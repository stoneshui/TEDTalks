When we think about prejudice and bias,,we tend to think about stupid and evil people,doing stupid and evil things.,And this idea is nicely summarized,by the British critic William Hazlitt,,who wrote, "Prejudice is the child of ignorance.",I want to try to convince you here,that this is mistaken.,I want to try to convince you,that prejudice and bias,are natural, they're often rational,,and they're often even moral,,and I think that once we understand this,,we're in a better position to make sense of them,when they go wrong,,when they have horrible consequences,,and we're in a better position to know what to do,when this happens. 
 So, start with stereotypes. You look at me,,you know my name, younknow certain facts about me,,and you could make certain judgments.,You could make guesses about my ethnicity,,my political affiliation, my religious beliefs.,And the thing is, thesenjudgments tend to be accurate.,We're very good at this sort of thing.,And we're very good at this sort of thing,because our ability to stereotype people,is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind,,but rather it's a specific instance,of a more general process,,which is that we have experience,with things and people in the world,that fall into categories,,and we can use our experiencento make generalizations,about novel instances of these categories.,So everybody here has a lot of experience,with chairs and apples and dogs,,and based on this, you could see,unfamiliar examples and you could guess,,you could sit on the chair,,you could eat the apple, the dog will bark.,Now we might be wrong.,The chair could collapse if you sit on it,,the apple might be poison, the dog might not bark,,and in fact, this is my dog Tessie, who doesn't bark.,But for the most part, we're good at this.,For the most part, we make good guesses,both in the social domain and the non-social domain,,and if we weren't able to do so,,if we weren't able to make guesses aboutnnew instances that we encounter,,we wouldn't survive.,And in fact, Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay,concedes this.,He writes, "Without the aid of prejudice and custom,,I should not be able to findnmy way my across the room;,nor know how to conductnmyself in any circumstances,,nor what to feel in any relation of life.",Or take bias.,Now sometimes, we break the world up into,us versus them, into in-group versus out-group,,and sometimes when we do this,,we know we're doing something wrong,,and we're kind of ashamed of it.,But other times we're proud of it.,We openly acknowledge it.,And my favorite example of this,is a question that came from the audience,in a Republican debate prior to the last election. 
 (Video) Anderson Cooper: Gets to your question,,the question in the hall, on foreign aid? Yes, ma'am. 
 Woman: The American people are suffering,in our country right now.,Why do we continue to send foreign aid,to other countries,when we need all the help we can get for ourselves? 
 AC: Governor Perry, what about that? 
 (Applause),Rick Perry: Absolutely, I think it's— 
 Paul Bloom: Each of the people onstage,agreed with the premise of her question,,which is as Americans, we should care more,about Americans than about other people.,And in fact, in general, people are often swayed,by feelings of solidarity, loyalty, pride, patriotism,,towards their country or towards their ethnic group.,Regardless of your politics, manynpeople feel proud to be American,,and they favor Americans over other countries.,Residents of other countriesnfeel the same about their nation,,and we feel the same about our ethnicities. 
 Now some of you may reject this.,Some of you may be so cosmopolitan,that you think that ethnicity and nationality,should hold no moral sway.,But even you sophisticates accept,that there should be some pull,towards the in-group in thendomain of friends and family,,of people you're close to,,and so even you make a distinction,between us versus them. 
 Now, this distinction is natural enough,and often moral enough, but it can go awry,,and this was part of the research,of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel.,Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919.,He left to go to university in France,,because as a Jew, he couldn'tngo to university in Poland,,and then he enlisted in the French military,in World War II.,He was captured and ended up,in a prisoner of war camp,,and it was a terrifying time for him,,because if it was discovered that he was a Jew,,he could have been moved to a concentration camp,,where he most likely would not have survived.,And in fact, when the warnended and he was released,,most of his friends and family were dead.,He got involved in different pursuits.,He helped out the war orphans.,But he had a long-lasting interest,in the science of prejudice,,and so when a prestigious British scholarship,on stereotypes opened up, he applied for it,,and he won it,,and then he began this amazing career.,And what started his career is an insight,that the way most people were thinking,about the Holocaust was wrong.,Many people, most people at the time,,viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing,some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans,,some genetic taint, some authoritarian personality.,And Tajfel rejected this.,Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust,is just an exaggeration,of normal psychological processes,that exist in every one of us.,And to explore this, he did a series of classic studies,with British adolescents.,And in one of his studies, what he did was he asked,the British adolescents all sorts of questions,,and then based on their answers, he said,,"I've looked at your answers,nand based on the answers,,I have determined that you are either" —,he told half of them —,"a Kandinsky lover, you love the work of Kandinsky,,or a Klee lover, you love the work of Klee.",It was entirely bogus.,Their answers had nothingnto do with Kandinsky or Klee.,They probably hadn't heard of the artists.,He just arbitrarily divided them up.,But what he found was, these categories mattered,,so when he later gave the subjects money,,they would prefer to give the money,to members of their own group,than members of the other group.,Worse, they were actually most interested,in establishing a difference,between their group and other groups,,so they would give up money for their own group,if by doing so they could giventhe other group even less. 
 This bias seems to show up very early.,So my colleague and wife, Karen Wynn, at Yale,has done a series of studies with babies,where she exposes babies to puppets,,and the puppets have certain food preferences.,So one of the puppets might like green beans.,The other puppet might like graham crackers.,They test the babies own food preferences,,and babies typically prefer the graham crackers.,But the question is, does this matter to babies,in how they treat the puppets? And it matters a lot.,They tend to prefer the puppet,who has the same food tastes that they have,,and worse, they actually prefer puppets,who punish the puppet with the different food taste.,(Laughter) 
 We see this sort of in-group,nout-group psychology all the time.,We see it in political clashes,within groups with different ideologies.,We see it in its extreme in cases of war,,where the out-group isn't merely given less,,but dehumanized,,as in the Nazi perspective of Jews,as vermin or lice,,or the American perspective of Japanese as rats. 
 Stereotypes can also go awry.,So often they're rational and useful,,but sometimes they're irrational,,they give the wrong answers,,and other times,they lead to plainly immoral consequences.,And the case that's been most studied,is the case of race.,There was a fascinating study,prior to the 2008 election,where social psychologists looked at the extent,to which the candidates werenassociated with America,,as in an unconscious associationnwith the American flag.,And in one of their studies they compared,Obama and McCain, and they found McCain,is thought of as more American than Obama,,and to some extent, people aren't nthat surprised by hearing that.,McCain is a celebrated war hero,,and many people would explicitly say,he has more of an American story than Obama.,But they also compared Obama,to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,,and they found that Blair was also thought of,as more American than Obama,,even though subjects explicitly understood,that he's not American at all.,But they were responding, of course,,to the color of his skin. 
 These stereotypes and biases,have real-world consequences,,both subtle and very important.,In one recent study, researchers,put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards.,Some of them were held by white hands,,others by black hands.,They were the same baseball cards.,The ones held by black hands,got substantially smaller bids,than the ones held by white hands.,In research done at Stanford,,psychologists explored the case of people,sentenced for the murder of a white person.,It turns out, holding everything else constant,,you are considerably more likely to be executed,if you look like the man on the right,than the man on the left,,and this is in large part because,the man on the right looks more prototypically black,,more prototypically African-American,,and this apparently influences people's decisions,over what to do about him. 
 So now that we know about this,,how do we combat it?,And there are different avenues.,One avenue is to appeal,to people's emotional responses,,to appeal to people's empathy,,and we often do that through stories.,So if you are a liberal parent,and you want to encourage your children,to believe in the merits of nontraditional families,,you might give them a book like this.n["Heather Has Two Mommies"],If you are conservative and have a different attitude,,you might give them a book like this.,(Laughter)n["Help! Mom! There Are Liberals under My Bed!"],But in general, stories can turn,anonymous strangers into people who matter,,and the idea that we care about people,when we focus on them as individuals,is an idea which has shown up across history.,So Stalin apocryphally said,,"A single death is a tragedy,,a million deaths is a statistic,",and Mother Teresa said,,"If I look at the mass, I will never act.,If I look at the one, I will.",Psychologists have explored this.,For instance, in one study,,people were given a list of facts about a crisis,,and it was seen how much they would donate,to solve this crisis,,and another group was given no facts at all,but they were told of an individual,and given a name and given a face,,and it turns out that they gave far more.,None of this I think is a secret,to the people who are engaged in charity work.,People don't tend to deluge people,with facts and statistics.,Rather, you show them faces,,you show them people.,It's possible that by extending our sympathies,to an individual, they can spread,to the group that the individual belongs to. 
 This is Harriet Beecher Stowe.,The story, perhaps apocryphal,,is that President Lincoln invited her,to the White House in the middle of the Civil War,and said to her,,"So you're the little lady who started this great war.",And he was talking about "Uncle Tom's Cabin.","Uncle Tom's Cabin" is notna great book of philosophy,or of theology or perhaps not even literature,,but it does a great job,of getting people to put themselves in the shoes,of people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of,,put themselves in the shoes of slaves.,And that could well have been a catalyst,for great social change. 
 More recently, looking at America,in the last several decades,,there's some reason to believenthat shows like "The Cosby Show",radically changed American attitudesntowards African-Americans,,while shows like "Will and Grace" and "Modern Family",changed American attitudes,towards gay men and women.,I don't think it's an exaggeration to say,that the major catalyst in America for moral change,has been a situation comedy. 
 But it's not all emotions,,and I want to end by appealing,to the power of reason.,At some point in his wonderful book,"The Better Angels of Our Nature,",Steven Pinker says,,the Old Testament says love thy neighbor,,and the New Testament says love thy enemy,,but I don't love either one of them, not really,,but I don't want to kill them.,I know I have obligations to them,,but my moral feelings to them, my moral beliefs,about how I should behave towards them,,aren't grounded in love.,What they're grounded in is thenunderstanding of human rights,,a belief that their life is as valuable to them,as my life is to me,,and to support this, he tells a story,by the great philosopher Adam Smith,,and I want to tell this story too,,though I'm going to modify it a little bit,for modern times. 
 So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine,the death of thousands of people,,and imagine that the thousands of people,are in a country you are not familiar with.,It could be China or India or a country in Africa.,And Smith says, how would you respond?,And you would say, well that's too bad,,and you'd go on to the rest of your life.,If you were to open up The NewnYork Times online or something,,and discover this, and in factnthis happens to us all the time,,we go about our lives.,But imagine instead, Smith says,,you were to learn that tomorrow,you were to have your little finger chopped off.,Smith says, that would matter a lot.,You would not sleep that night,wondering about that.,So this raises the question:,Would you sacrifice thousands of lives,to save your little finger?,Now answer this in the privacy of your own head,,but Smith says, absolutely not,,what a horrid thought.,And so this raises the question,,and so, as Smith puts it,,"When our passive feelings are almost always,so sordid and so selfish,,how comes it that our active principles,should often be so generous and so noble?",And Smith's answer is, "It is reason,,principle, conscience.,[This] calls to us,,with a voice capable of astonishingnthe most presumptuous of our passions,,that we are but one of the multitude,,in no respect better than any other in it." 
 And this last part is what is often described,as the principle of impartiality.,And this principle of impartiality manifests itself,in all of the world's religions,,in all of the different versions of the golden rule,,and in all of the world's moral philosophies,,which differ in many ways,but share the presuppositionnthat we should judge morality,from sort of an impartial point of view. 
 The best articulation of this view,is actually, for me, it's not fromna theologian or from a philosopher,,but from Humphrey Bogart,at the end of "Casablanca.",So, spoiler alert, he's telling his lover,that they have to separate,for the more general good,,and he says to her, and I won't do the accent,,but he says to her, "It doesn't take much to see,that the problems of three little people,don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world." 
 Our reason could cause us to override our passions.,Our reason could motivate us,to extend our empathy,,could motivate us to write anbook like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,",or read a book like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,",and our reason can motivate us to create,customs and taboos and laws,that will constrain us,from acting upon our impulses,when, as rational beings, we feel,we should be constrained.,This is what a constitution is.,A constitution is somethingnwhich was set up in the past,that applies now in the present,,and what it says is,,no matter how much we might to reelect,a popular president for a third term,,no matter how much white Americans might choose,to feel that they want to reinstatenthe institution of slavery, we can't.,We have bound ourselves. 
 And we bind ourselves in other ways as well.,We know that when it comes to choosing somebody,for a job, for an award,,we are strongly biased by their race,,we are biased by their gender,,we are biased by how attractive they are,,and sometimes we might say,n"Well fine, that's the way it should be.",But other times we say, "This is wrong.",And so to combat this,,we don't just try harder,,but rather what we do is we set up situations,where these other sourcesnof information can't bias us,,which is why many orchestras,audition musicians behind screens,,so the only information they have,is the information they believe should matter.,I think prejudice and bias,illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature.,We have gut feelings, instincts, emotions,,and they affect our judgments and our actions,for good and for evil,,but we are also capable of rational deliberation,and intelligent planning,,and we can use these to, in some cases,,accelerate and nourish our emotions,,and in other cases staunch them.,And it's in this way,that reason helps us create a better world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to ask and try to answer,,in some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.,Both civilians, obviously, and soldiers,suffer in war;,I don't think any civilian has ever missed,the war that they were subjected to.,I've been covering wars for almost 20 years,,and one of the remarkable things for me,is how many soldiers find themselves missing it.,How is it someone can go through,the worst experience imaginable,,and come home, back to their home,,and their family, their country, and miss the war?,How does that work? What does it mean?,We have to answer that question,,because if we don't, it'll be impossible,to bring soldiers back,to a place in society where they belong,,and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,,if we don't understand how that mechanism works. 
 The problem is that war,does not have a simple, neat truth,,one simple, neat truth. 
 Any sane person hates war,,hates the idea of war,,wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,,doesn't want to be near it,ndoesn't want to know about it.,That's a sane response to war.,But if I asked all of you in this room,,who here has paid money,to go to a cinema,and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,,most of you would probably raise your hands.,That's what's so complicated about war.,And trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people,finds something compelling about war,,so do 20-year-old soldiers,who have been trained in it, I promise you.,That's the thing that has to be understood. 
 I've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,,but my most intense experiences in combat,were with American soldiers in Afghanistan.,I've been in Africa, the Middle East,,Afghanistan in the '90s,,but it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,,that I was confronted with,very intense combat.,I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley,in eastern Afghanistan.,It was six miles long.,There were 150 men ofnBattle Company in that valley,,and for a while, while I was there,,almost 20 percent of all the combat,in all of Afghanistan was happening,in those six miles.,A hundred and fifty men were absorbing,almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces,in the country, for a couple months.,It was very intense.,I spent most of my time at a small outpost,called Restrepo.,It was named after the platoon medic,that had been killed about twonmonths into the deployment.,It was a few plywood B-huts,clinging to a side of a ridge,,and sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,,and there were 20 men up there,of Second Platoon, Battle Company.,I spent most of my time up there.,There was no running water.,There was no way to bathe.,The guys were up there for a month at a time.,They never even got out of their clothes.,They fought. The worked.,They slept in the same clothes.,They never took them off,nand at the end of the month,,they went back down to the company headquarters,,and by then, their clothes were unwearable.,They burned them and got a new set.,There was no Internet. There was no phone.,There was no communicationnwith the outside world up there.,There was no cooked food.,There was nothing up there,that young men typically like:,no cars, no girls, no television, nothing,except combat.,Combat they did learn to like. 
 I remember one day, it was a very hot day,in the spring,,and we hadn't been in a fight,in a couple of weeks, maybe.,Usually, the outpost was attacked,,and we hadn't seen anyncombat in a couple of weeks,,and everyone was just stunned,with boredom and heat.,And I remember the lieutenant walking past me,sort of stripped to the waist.,It was incredibly hot.,Stripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,,"Oh God, please someone attack us today.",That's how bored they were.,That's war too, is a lieutenant saying,,"Please make something happen,because we're going crazy." 
 To understand that,,you have to, for a moment,,think about combat not morally --,that's an important job to do —,but for a moment, don't think about it morally,,think about it neurologically.,Let's think about what happens in your brain,when you're in combat.,First of all, the experience,is very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.,It's not what I had expected.,Usually, you're not scared.,I've been very scared in combat,,but most of the time when I was out there,,I wasn't scared.,I was very scared beforehand,and incredibly scared afterwards,,and that fear that comes afterwards can last years.,I haven't been shot at in six years,,and I was woken up very abruptly this morning,by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,,six years later.,I've never even been strafed by aircraft,,and I was having nightmares about it.,Time slows down.,You get this weird tunnel vision.,You notice some details very, very, very accurately,and other things drop out.,It's almost a slightly altered state of mind.,What's happening in your brain,is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline,pumped through your system.,Young men will go to great lengths,to have that experience.,It's wired into us.,It's hormonally supported.,The mortality rate for young men in society,is six times what it is for young women,from violence and from accidents,,just the stupid stuff that young men do:,jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,,lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,,I mean, you know what I'm talking about.,They die at six times the rate,that young women do.,Statistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,,you would be safer in the fire department,or the police department in most American cities,than just walking around thenstreets of your hometown,looking for something to do,,statistically. 
 You can imagine how that plays out in combat.,At Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,,including me,,including my good friend Tim Hetherington,,who was later killed in Libya.,There were guys walking around,with bullet holes in their uniforms,,rounds that had cut through the fabric,and didn't touch their bodies. 
 I was leaning against some sandbags one morning,,not much going on, sort of spacing out,,and some sand was kicked into the side of,,sort of hit the side of my face.,Something hit the side of my face,nand I didn't know what it was.,You have to understand about bullets,that they go a lot faster than sound,,so if someone shoots at you,from a few hundred meters,,the bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,,half a second or so beforenthe sound catches up to it.,So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.,Half a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.,It was machine gun fire.,It was the first round, the first burst,of an hour-long firefight.,What had happened was the bullet hit,,a bullet hit three or four inchesnfrom the side of my head.,Imagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,,think about the angle of deviation that saved my life.,At 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.,Just think about the math on that.,Every guy up there,had some experience like that,,at least once, if not many times. 
 The boys are up there for a year.,They got back.,Some of them got out of the Army,and had tremendous psychologicalnproblems when they got home.,Some of them stayed in the Army,and were more or less okay, psychologically.,I was particularly close to anguy named Brendan O'Byrne.,I'm still very good friends with him.,He came back to the States. He got out of the Army.,I had a dinner party one night.,I invited him,,and he started talking with a woman,,one of my friends,,and she knew how bad it had been out there,,and she said, "Brendan,,is there anything at all that you miss about,being out in Afghanistan, about the war?",And he thought about it quite a long time,,and finally he said, "Ma'am, I miss almost all of it.",And he's one of the most traumatized people,I've seen from that war.,"Ma'am, I miss almost all of it." 
 What is he talking about?,He's not a psychopath.,He doesn't miss killing people.,He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at,and seeing his friends get killed.,What is it that he misses? We have to answer that.,If we're going to stop war, wenhave to answer that question. 
 I think what he missed is brotherhood.,He missed, in some ways,,the opposite of killing.,What he missed was connection,to the other men he was with.,Now, brotherhood is different from friendship.,Friendship happens in society, obviously.,The more you like someone,,the more you'd be willing to do for them.,Brotherhood has nothing to do,with how you feel about the other person.,It's a mutual agreement in a group,that you will put the welfare of the group,,you will put the safety of everyone in the group,above your own.,In effect, you're saying,,"I love these other people more than I love myself." 
 Brendan was a team leader,in command of three men,,and the worst day in Afghanistan —,He was almost killed so many times.,It didn't bother him.,The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan,was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet,in the helmet, knocked him over.,They thought he was dead.,It was in the middle of a huge firefight.,No one could deal with it, and a minute later,,Kyle Steiner sat back up,from the dead, as it were,,because he'd come back to consciousness.,The bullet had just knocked him out.,It glanced off the helmet.,He remembers people saying,,as he was sort of half-conscious,,he remembers people saying,,"Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead.",And he was thinking, "I'm not dead.",And he sat up.,And Brendan realized after that,that he could not protect his men,,and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,,was realizing that.,That's brotherhood. 
 This wasn't invented recently.,Many of you have probably read "The Iliad.",Achilles surely would have risked his life,or given his life to save his friend Patroclus.,In World War II, there were many stories,of soldiers who were wounded,,were brought to a rear base hospital,,who went AWOL,,crawled out of windows, slipped out doors,,went AWOL, wounded,,to make their way back to the front lines,to rejoin their brothers out there.,So you think about Brendan,,you think about all these soldiers,having an experience like that, a bond like that,,in a small group,,where they loved 20 other people,in some ways more than they loved themselves,,you think about how good that would feel, imagine it,,and they are blessed with that experience for a year,,and then they come home,,and they are just back in society,like the rest of us are,,not knowing who they can count on,,not knowing who loves them, who they can love,,not knowing exactly what anyone they know,would do for them if it came down to it.,That is terrifying.,Compared to that,,war, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,,compared to that kind of alienation.,That's why they miss it,,and that's what we have to understand,and in some ways fix in our society. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm excited to be here to speak about vets,,because I didn't join the Army,because I wanted to go to war.,I didn't join the Army because I had a lust,or a need to go overseas and fight.,Frankly, I joined the Army because,college is really damn expensive,,and they were going to help with that,,and I joined the Army because,it was what I knew,,and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well. 
 I didn't come from a military family.,I'm not a military brat.,No one in my family evernhad joined the military at all,,and how I first got introduced to the military,was when I was 13 years old,and I got sent away to military school,,because my mother had been threatening me,with this idea of military schoolnever since I was eight years old. 
 I had some issues when I was coming up,,and my mother would always tell me, she's like,,"You know, if you don't get this together,,I'm going to send you to military school.",And I'd look at her, and I'd say, "Mommy,,I'll work harder.",And then when I was nine years old,,she started giving me brochuresnto show me she wasn't playing around,,so I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,,"Okay, Mommy, I can see you'renserious, and I'll work harder.",And then when I was 10 and 11,,my behavior just kept on getting worse.,I was on academic and disciplinary probation,before I hit double digits,,and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists,when I was 11 years old.,And so when I was 13 years old,,my mother came up to me, and she was like,,"I'm not going to do this anymore.,I'm going to send you to military school.",And I looked at her, and I said, "Mommy,,I can see you're upset, andnI'm going to work harder.",And she was like, "No, you're going next week.",And that was how I first got introduced,to this whole idea of the military,,because she thought this was a good idea. 
 I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly,when I first showed up there,,because literally in the first four days,,I had already run away five times from this school.,They had these big black gatesnthat surrounded the school,,and every time they would turn their backs,,I would just simply run out of the black gates,and take them up on their offernthat if we don't want to be there,,we can leave at any time.,So I just said, "Well, if that's the case,,then I'd like to leave." (Laughter),And it never worked.,And I kept on getting lost. 
 But then eventually,,after staying there for a little while,,and after the end of that first year,at this military school,,I realized that I actually was growing up.,I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school,and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure,was something that I'd never found before:,the fact that I finally felt like Inwas part of something bigger,,part of a team, and it actually mattered to people,that I was there,,the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there,,but that it was a real, actually core part,of the entire experience.,And so when it was time for me to actually,finish up high school,,I started thinking about what I wanted to do,,and just like probably most students,,had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do.,And I thought about the people who I,respected and admired.,I thought about a lot of the people,,in particular a lot of the men, in my life,who I looked up to.,They all happened to wear the uniform,of the United States of America,,so for me, the question and the answer,really became pretty easy.,The question of what I wanted to do,was filled in very quickly with saying,,I guess I'll be an Army officer. 
 So the Army then went through this process,and they trained me up,,and when I say I didn't join the Army,because I wanted to go to war,,the truth is, I joined in 1996.,There really wasn't a whole lot going on.,I didn't ever feel like I was in danger.,When I went to my mom,,I first joined the Army when I was 17 years old,,so I literally needed parental permission,to join the Army,,so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom,,and she just assumed it wasnkind of like military school.,She was like, "Well, it was good for him before,,so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it,",having no idea that thenpaperwork that she was signing,was actually signing her son up,to become an Army officer.,And I went through the process,,and again the whole time still just thinking,,this is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend,,or two weeks during the year, do drill,,and then a couple years after I signed up,,a couple years after my mother signed those papers,,the whole world changed.,And after 9/11, there was an entirely new context,about the occupation that I chose.,When I first joined, I never joined to fight,,but now that I was in,,this is exactly what was now going to happen. 
 And I thought about so much about the soldiers,who I eventually had to end up leading.,I remember when we first, right after 9/11,,three weeks after 9/11, I wasnon a plane heading overseas,,but I wasn't heading overseas with the military,,I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship,to go overseas.,I received the scholarship to go overseas,and to go study and live overseas,,and I was living in England and that was interesting,,but at the same time, the same people who,I was training with,,the same soldiers that I wentnthrough all my training with,,and we prepared for war,,they were now actually heading over to it.,They were now about to find themselves,in the middle of places the fact is,the vast majority of people,,the vast majority of us as we were training,,couldn't even point out on a map.,I spent a couple years finishing graduate school,,and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there,in buildings at Oxford,that were literally built hundreds of years,before the United States was even founded,,and I'm sitting there talking to dons,about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,,and how that influenced the start of World War I,,where the entire time my heart and my head,were on my soldiers,who were now throwing on Kevlars,and grabbing their flak vests,and figuring out how exactly do I change around,or how exactly do I clean a machine gun,in the darkness.,That was the new reality. 
 By the time I finished that up and I rejoined,my military unit and we were gettingnready to deploy to Afghanistan,,there were soldiers in my unit who were now,on their second and third deployments,before I even had my first.,I remember walking out withnmy unit for the first time,,and when you join the Army,and you go through a combat tour,,everyone looks at your shoulder,,because on your shoulder is your combat patch.,And so immediately as you meet people,,you shake their hand,,and then your eyes go to their shoulder,,because you want to see where did they serve,,or what unit did they serve with?,And I was the only person walking around,with a bare shoulder,,and it burned every time someone stared at it. 
 But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,,and you ask them why did they sign up.,I signed up because college was expensive.,A lot of my soldiers signed upnfor completely different reasons.,They signed up because of a sense of obligation.,They signed up because they were angry,and they wanted to do something about it.,They signed up because,their family said this was important.,They signed up because theynwanted some form of revenge.,They signed for a wholencollection of different reasons.,And now we all found ourselves overseas,fighting in these conflicts. 
 And what was amazing to me was that I,very naively started hearing this statement,that I never fully understood,,because right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea,where people come up to you and they say,,"Well, thank you for your service.",And I just kind of followed in and started saying,the same things to all my soldiers.,This is even before I deployed.,But I really had no idea what that even meant.,I just said it because it sounded right.,I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say,to people who had served overseas.,"Thank you for your service.",But I had no idea what the context was,or what that even,,what it even meant to the people who heard it. 
 When I first came back from Afghanistan,,I thought that if you make it back from conflict,,then the dangers were all over.,I thought that if you made itnback from a conflict zone,that somehow you could kind of,wipe the sweat off your brow and say,,"Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,",without understanding that for so many people,,as they come back home,,the war keeps going.,It keeps playing out in all of our minds.,It plays out in all of our memories.,It plays out in all of our emotions.,Please forgive us,if we don't like being in big crowds.,Please forgive us,when we spend one week in a place,that has 100 percent light discipline,,because you're not allowed tonwalk around with white lights,,because if anything has a white light,,it can be seen from miles away,,versus if you use little green,or little blue lights,,they cannot be seen from far away.,So please forgive us if out of nowhere,,we go from having 100 percent light discipline,to then a week later being backnin the middle of Times Square,,and we have a difficult time adjusting to that.,Please forgive us,when you transition back to a family,who has completely been maneuvering without you,,and now when you come back, it's not that easy,to fall back into a sense of normality,,because the whole normal has changed. 
 I remember when I came back,nI wanted to talk to people.,I wanted people to ask me about my experiences.,I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,,"What did you do?",I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,,"What was it like? What was the food like?,What was the experience like? How are you doing?",And the only questions I got from people was,,"Did you shoot anybody?",And those were the ones who were even curious,enough to say anything.,Because sometimes there's this fear,and there's this apprehension that if I say anything,,I'm afraid I'll offend,,or I'm afraid I'll trigger something,,so the common default is just saying nothing.,The problem with that,is then it feels like your service,was not even acknowledged,,like no one even cared.,"Thank you for your service,",and we move on.,What I wanted to better understand,was what's behind that,,and why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.,The fact is, we have literally,2.6 million men and women,who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan,who are all amongst us.,Sometimes we know who they are,,sometimes we don't,,but there is that feeling, the shared experience,,the shared bond,where we know that that experience,and that chapter of our life,,while it might be closed,,it's still not over. 
 We think about "thank you for your service,",and people say, "So what does 'thanknyou for your service' mean to you?",Well, "Thank you for your service" means to me,,it means acknowledging our stories,,asking us who we are,,understanding the strength,that so many people, so manynpeople who we serve with, have,,and why that service means so much.,"Thank you for your service"nmeans acknowledging the fact,that just because we've now come home,and we've taken off the uniform,does not mean our larger service to this country,is somehow over.,The fact is, there's still a tremendous amount,that can be offered and can be given.,When I look at people,like our friend Taylor Urruela,,who in Iraq loses his leg,,had two big dreams in his life.,One was to be a soldier. The othernwas to be a baseball player.,He loses his leg in Iraq.,He comes back,and instead of deciding that,,well, now since I've lost mynleg, that second dream is over,,he decides that he still has thatndream of playing baseball,,and he starts this group called VETSports,,which now works with veterans all over the country,and uses sports as a way of healing.,People like Tammy Duckworth,,who was a helicopter pilot,and with the helicopter that she was flying,,you need to use both your hands,and also your legs to steer,,and her helicopter gets hit,,and she's trying to steer the chopper,,but the chopper's not reacting,to her instructions and to her commands.,She's trying to land the chopper safely,,but the chopper doesn't land safely,,and the reason it's not landing safely,is because it's not responding to thencommands that her legs are giving,because her legs were blown off.,She barely survives.,Medics come and they save her life,,but then as she's doing hernrecuperation back at home,,she realizes that, "My job's still not done.",And now she uses her voice,as a Congresswoman from Illinois,to fight and advocate for a collection of issues,to include veterans issues. 
 We signed up because,we love this country we represent.,We signed up because,we believe in the idea and we believe in the people,to our left and to our right.,And the only thing we then ask is that,"thank you for your service",needs to be more than just a quote break,,that "thank you for your service" means,honestly digging in,to the people who have stepped up,simply because they were asked to,,and what that means for us not just now,,not just during combat operations,,but long after the last vehicle has left,and after the last shot has been taken. 
 These are the people who I served with,,and these are the people who I honor.,So thank you for your service. 
 (Applause)My name is Harry Baker.nHarry Baker is my name.,If your name was Harry Baker,nthen our names would be the same.,(Laughter) 
 It's a short introductory part. 
 Yeah, I'm Harry.,I study maths. I write poetry.,So I thought I'd startnwith a love poem about prime numbers.,(Laughter) 
 This is called "59.",I was going to call itn"Prime Time Loving.",That reaction is why I didn't.,(Laughter) 
 So, "59." 
 59 wakes up on the wrong nside of the bed. 
 Realizes all his hair is non one side of his head. 
 Takes just under a minute to work out thatnit’s because of the way that he slept. 
 He finds some clothes and gets dressed. 
 He can’t help but look in the mirrornand be subtly impressed 
 How he looks rough around the edgesnand yet casually messed. 
 And as he glances out the window, hensees the sight that he gets blessed with,of 60 from across the street. 
 Now 60 was beautiful. 
 With perfectly trimmed cuticles,ndressed in something suitable. 
 Never rude or crude at all. 
 Unimprovable, right on time as usual,nmore on cue than a snooker ball,but liked to play it super cool. 
 59 wanted to tell hernthat he knew her favorite flower. 
 He thought of her every second,nevery minute, every hour. 
 But he knew it wouldn’t work,nhe’d never get the girl. 
 Because although she lived nacross the street,they came from different worlds. 
 While 59 admired 60’snperfectly round figure,,60 thought 59 was odd.n(Laughter) 
 One of his favorite filmsnwas "101 Dalmatians." 
 She preferred the sequel. 
 He romanticized the ideanthey were star-crossed lovers. 
 They could overcome the oddsnand evens because they had each other. 
 While she maintained the strict viewsnimposed on her by her mother 
 That separate could not be equal. 
 And though at the time he feltnstupid and dumb 
 For trying to love a girl controllednby her stupid mum, 
 He should have been comfortednby the simple sum. 
 Take 59 away from 60,nand you’re left with the one. 
 Sure enough after two monthsnof moping around, 
 61 days later, 61 was who he found, 
 He had lost his keys nand his parents were out. 
 So one day after school nhe went into a house 
 As he noticed the slightly wonkynnumbers on the door, 
 He wondered why he’d nevernintroduced himself before, 
 As she let him in, his jaw ndropped in awe. 
 61 was like 60, but a little bit more.n(Laughter) 
 She had prettier eyes,nand an approachable smile, 
 And like him, rough aroundnthe edges, casual style, 
 And like him, everythingnwas in disorganized piles, 
 And like him, her mum didn’t mindnif friends stayed a while. 
 Because she was like him, nand he liked her. 
 He reckoned she would like himnif she knew he was like her, 
 And it was different this time.nI mean, this girl was wicked, 
 So he plucked up the couragenand asked for her digits. 
 She said, "I'm 61."nHe grinned, said, "I'm 59." 
 Today I’ve had a really nice time, 
 So tomorrow if you wantednyou could come over to mine? 
 She said, "Sure." 
 She loved talking to someone njust as quirky, 
 She agreed to this unofficial first date. 
 In the end he was onlynready one minute early, 
 But it didn’t matter becausenshe arrived one minute late. 
 And from that moment onnthere was nonstop chatter, 
 How they loved "X Factor,"nhow they had two factors, 
 How that did not matter,ndistinctiveness made them better, 
 By the end of the night they knewnthey were meant together. 
 And one day she was talkingnabout stuck-up 60, 
 She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty. 
 He blushed, told her of his crush: 
 “The best thing that never happenednbecause it led to us.” 
 61 was clever, see,nnot prone to jealousy, 
 She looked him in the eyesnand told him quite tenderly, 
 "You’re 59, I’m 61, together we combinento become twice what 60 could ever be.",(Laughter) 
 At this point 59 had tears in his eyes, 
 Was so glad to haventhis one-of-a-kind girl in his life. 
 He told her the veryndefinition of being prime 
 Was that with only onenand himself could his heart divide, 
 And she was the one he wantednto give his heart to, 
 She said she felt the samenand now she knew the films were half true. 
 Because that wasn't real love,nthat love was just a sample, 
 When it came to real love,nthey were a prime example. 
 Cheers. 
 (Applause) 
 That was the first poem that I wrote,and it was for a prime number-themed npoetry night -- (Laughter) --,which turned out to bena prime number-themed poetry competition.,And I became a prime number-themednpoetry competition winner,,or as I like to call it,na prime minister. (Laughter),And this is how I discoverednthese things called poetry slams,,and if you don't know what na poetry slam is,,it was a format come up withnin America 30 years ago,as a way of tricking peopleninto going to poetry events,by putting an exciting wordnlike "slam" on the end.,(Laughter) 
 And each performer gotnthree minutes to perform,and then random audience membersnwould hold up scorecards,,and they would end upnwith a numerical score,,and what this meant is,,it kind of broke down the barriernbetween performer and audience,and encouraged the kindnof connection with the listener.,And what it also means is you can win.,And if you win a poetry slam,nyou can call yourself a slam champion,and pretend you're a wrestler,,and if you lose a poetry slam you can say,n"Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,,you can't put numbers on such things.",(Laughter) 
 But I loved it, and Ingot involved in these slams,,and I became the U.K. slam champion,and got invited tonthe Poetry World Cup in Paris,,which was unbelievable.,It was people from all around the worldnspeaking in their native languages,to be judged by five French strangers.,(Laughter),And somehow, I won, which was great,,and I've been ablento travel the world since doing it,,but it also means that this next piece,is technically the best poem in the world.,(Laughter),So...,(Applause),According to five French strangers. 
 So this is "Paper People." 
 I like people. 
 I'd like some paper people. 
 They’d be purple paper people.nMaybe pop-up purple paper people. 
 Proper pop-up purple paper people. 
 "How do you prop upnpop-up purple paper people?" 
 I hear you cry. Well I ... 
 I’d probably prop up propernpop-up purple paper people 
 with a proper pop-upnpurple people paperclip, 
 but I’d pre-prepare appropriatenadhesives as alternatives, 
 a cheeky pack of Blu Tacknjust in case the paper slipped. 
 Because I could build a pop-up metropolis. 
 but I wouldn’t wanna deal with all thenpaper people politics. 
 paper politicians with theirnpaper-thin policies, 
 broken promisesnwithout appropriate apologies. 
 There’d be a little paper me.nAnd a little paper you. 
 And we could watch paper TVnand it would all be pay-per-view.,(Laughter) 
 We’d see the poppy paper rappersnrap about their paper package 
 or watch paper people carriersnget stuck in paper traffic on the A4.,(Laughter) Paper. 
 There’d be a paper princess Katenbut we’d all stare at paper Pippa, 
 and then we’d all live in fear ofnkiller Jack the Paper-Ripper, 
 because the paper propagandanpropagates the people's prejudices, 
 papers printing pictures of thenphotogenic terrorists. 
 A little paper me.nAnd a little paper you. 
 And in a pop-up populationnpeople’s problems pop up too. 
 There’d be a pompous paper parliamentnwho remained out of touch, 
 and who ignored the people's protestsnabout all the paper cuts, 
 then the peaceful paper protestsnwould get blown to paper pieces, 
 by the confetti cannonsnmanned by pre-emptive police. 
 And yes there’d still be paper money,nso there’d still be paper greed, 
 and the paper piggy bankersnpocketing more than they need, 
 purchasing the potpourrinto pepper their paper properties, 
 others live in povertynand ain’t acknowledged properly. 
 A proper poor economynwhere so many are proper poor, 
 but while their needs are ignorednthe money goes to big wars. 
 Origami armiesnunfold plans for paper planes 
 and we remain imprisonednin our own paper chains, 
 but the greater shamenis that it always seems to stay the same, 
 what changes is who’s in powernchoosing how to lay the blame, 
 they’re naming names,nforgetting these are names of people, 
 because in the endnit all comes down to people. 
 I like people. 
 'Cause even when the situation’s dire, 
 it is only ever peoplenwho are able to inspire, 
 and on paper,nit’s hard to see how we all cope. 
 But in the bottom of Pandora’s boxnthere’s still hope, 
 and I still hopen'cause I believe in people. 
 People like my grandparents. 
 Who every single day since I was born,,have taken time out of their morningnto pray for me. 
 That’s 7892 days straightnof someone checking I’m okay,,and that’s amazing. 
 People like my aunt who puts onnplays with prisoners. 
 People who are capablenof genuine forgiveness. 
 People like the persecuted Palestinians. 
 People who go out of their waynto make your life better,,and expect nothing in return. 
 You see, people have potentialnto be powerful. 
 Just because the people in powerntend to pretend to be victims 
 we don’t need to succumb to that system. 
 And a paper population is no different. 
 There’s a little paper me.nAnd a little paper you. 
 And in a pop-up populationnpeople's problems pop up too, 
 but even if the whole world fell apartnthen we’d still make it through. 
 Because we’re people. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much.nI've just got time for one more. 
 For me, poetry has been the ultimate waynof ideas without frontiers.,When I first started,,the people who inspired menwere the ones with the amazing stories,,and I thought, as an 18-year-oldnwith a happy life, it was too normal,,but I could create these worldsnwhere I could talk about my experiences,and dreams and beliefs.,So it's amazing to be herenin front of you today.,Thank you for being here.,If you weren't here,,it would be pretty muchnlike the sound check yesterday.,(Laughter),And this is more fun. 
 So this last one is calledn"The Sunshine Kid." 
 Thank you very much for listening. 
 Old man sunshine was proud of his sun, 
 And it brightened his daynto see his little boy run, 
 Not because of what he’d done,nnor the problems overcome, 
 But that despite that his dispositionnremained a sunny one. 
 It hadn’t always been like this. 
 There’d been times when he’d triednto hide his brightness, 
 You see, every starnhits periods of hardship, 
 It takes a brighter lightnto inspire them through the darkness. 
 If we go back to whennhe was born in a nebula, 
 We know that he nevernwas thought of as regular, 
 Because he had a flair about him, 
 To say the Midas touch is wrong 
 But all he went nearnseemed to turn a little bronze, 
 Yes this sun was lovednby some more than others, 
 It was a case of Josephnand his dreamcoat and his brothers 
 Because standing out from the crowdnhad its pros and its cons, 
 And jealousy created enemiesnin those he outshone 
 Such as the Shadow People. 
 Now the Shadow Peoplendidn’t like the Sunshine Kid, 
 Because he showed up the dark thingsnthe Shadow People did, 
 And when he shone he showednthe places where the Shadow People hid, 
 So the Shadow People hadnan evil plan to get rid of him, 
 First up -- they made fun of his sunspots, 
 Shooting his dreams from the sky,ntheir words were gunshots, 
 Designed to remind himnhe wasn’t very cool 
 And he didn’t fit in with anynpopular kids at school. 
 They said his head was up in spacenand they would bring him down to Earth, 
 Essentially he came from nothingnand that is what he was worth, 
 He’d never get to gonto university to learn, 
 Only degrees he’d ever shownwould be the first degree burns 
 From those that came too close,,they told him he was too bright, 
 That’s why no one evernlooked him in the eyes, 
 His judgment became clouded 
 So did the sky,nWith evaporated tears 
 as the sun started to cry. 
 Because the sunshine kid was bright,nwith a warm personality, 
 And inside he burned savagely 
 Hurt by the words and cursesnof the shadowy folk 
 who spoke holes in his soulnand left cavities, 
 And as his heart hardened,nhis spark darkened, 
 Every time they called him namesnit cooled his flames, 
 He thought they might like himnif he kept his light dim 
 But they were busy telling lightningnshe had terrible aim, 
 He couldn’t quite get to gripsnwith what they said, 
 So he let his light be eclipsednby what they said, 
 He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas, 
 And felt like he’d been punchednin his solar plexus. 
 But that’s whennLittle Miss Sunshine came along 
 Singing her favorite songnabout how we’re made to be strong, 
 And you don’t have to be wrong to belong,nJust be true to who you are, 
 because we are all stars at heart. 
 Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff, 
 The kind of girl when you looked at her 
 you forgot stuff, 
 But for him, there was no forgetting her, 
 The minute he saw hernher image burned in his retina, 
 She was out of this world,nand she accepted him, 
 Something about this girl meant he knewnwhenever she was next to him, 
 Things weren’t as dark as they seemed,nand he dared to dream, 
 Shadows were nowhere to be seen;nwhen she was there he beamed, 
 His eyes would light upnin ways that can’t be faked, 
 When she grinned her rays erasednthe razor-tipped words of hate, 
 They gave each other nicknames,nthey were "cool star" and "fun sun," 
 And gradually the shadowyndamage became undone, 
 She was one in a septillion,nand she was brilliant, 
 Could turn the coldest bloodednreptilians vermillion, 
 Loved by billions,nfrom Chileans to Brazilians, 
 And taught the Sunshine Kidnthe meaning of resilience. 
 She said: “All the darkness in the world 
 cannot put out the lightnfrom a single candle 
 So how the hell can theynhandle your light? 
 Only you can choose to dim it,nand the sky is the limit,,so silence the critics by burning.” 
 And if eyes are windows to the soulnthen she drew back the curtains 
 And let the sun shinenthrough the hurting. 
 In a universe of adversitynthese stars stuck together, 
 And though days became nightsnthe memories would last forever, 
 Whether the weathermannsaid it or not, it would be fine, 
 'Cause even behind the cloudsnthe kid could still shine. 
 Yes, the Sunshine Kid was bright,nwith a warm personality, 
 And inside he burned savagely, 
 Fueled by the fireninspired across galaxies 
 By the girl who showed him belief. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Today,,a baffled lady observed,the shell where my soul dwells 
 And announced that I'm,"articulate" 
 Which means that when it comes,to enunciation and diction 
 I don't even think of it 
 ‘Cause I’m "articulate" 
 So when my professor asks a question 
 And my answer is tainted with a connotation,of urbanized suggestion 
 There’s no misdirected intention 
 Pay attention 
 ‘Cause I’m “articulate” 
 So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?” 
 My “articulate” answer never goes amiss 
 I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand” 
 And when I’m on the block,I switch it up just because I can 
 So when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?” 
 I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!” 
 And sometimes in class 
 I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask 
 “Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples” 
 Yes, I have decided to treat,all three of my languages as equals 
 Because I’m “articulate” 
 But who controls articulation? 
 Because the English languagenis a multifaceted oration 
 Subject to indefinite transformation 
 Now you may think that it isnignorant to speak broken English 
 But I’m here to tell you thatneven “articulate” Americans,sound foolish to the British 
 So when my Professor comes onnthe block and says, “Hello” 
 I stop him and say “Noooo … 
 You’re being inarticulate …,the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’” 
 Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not cool 
 But I’m here to tell you thatneven our language has rules 
 So when Mommy mocks me and says,“ya’ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store” 
 I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law 
 Never does the word "madd" go nbefore a present participle 
 That’s simply the principle of this English” 
 If I had the vocal capacity I would,sing this from every mountaintop, 
 From every suburbia, and every hood 
 ‘Cause the only God of language isnthe one recorded in the Genesis 
 Of this world saying “it is good" 
 So I may not always come before you,with excellency of speech 
 But do not judge me by my language and assume 
 That I’m too ignorant to teach 
 ‘Cause I speak three tongues 
 One for each: 
 Home, school and friends 
 I’m a tri-lingual orator 
 Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now 
 Then switch it up so I don’t bore later 
 Sometimes I fight back two tongues 
 While I use the other one in the classroom 
 And when I mistakenly mix them up 
 I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom 
 I know that I had to borrow your language,because mines was stolen 
 But you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly,while mines is broken 
 These words are spoken 
 By someone who is simply fed up with,the Eurocentric ideals of this season 
 And the reason I speak a compositenversion of your language 
 Is because mines was rapednaway along with my history 
 I speak broken English so thenprofusing gashes can remind us 
 That our current state is not a mystery 
 I’m so tired of the negative imagesnthat are driving my people mad 
 So unless you’ve seen it robna bank stop calling my hair bad 
 I’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity 
 So don’t call it good unless your hair is known,for donating to charity 
 As much as has been raped away from our people 
 How can you expect me to treatntheir imprint on your language 
 As anything less than equal 
 Let there be no confusion 
 Let there be no hesitation 
 This is not a promotion of ignorance 
 This is a linguistic celebration 
 That’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application 
 I can help to diversify your consumer market,is all I wanted them to know 
 And when they call me for the interview,I’ll be more than happy to show that 
 I can say: 
 “What’s good” 
 “Whatagwan” 
 And of course …“Hello” 
 Because I’m “articulate” 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As a kid I always loved information,that I could get from data,and the stories that could be told with numbers.,I remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at,how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.,"Talithia, if I've told you once nI've told you a thousand times.",No dad, you've only told me 17 times,and twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter) 
 I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.,I always wanted to know,,what are people trying to hide with numbers?,As a statistician,,I want people to show me the data,so I can decide for myself.,Donald and I were pregnant with our third child,and we were at about 41 and a half weeks,,what some of you may refer to as being overdue.,Statisticians, we call that,being within the 95 percent confidence interval.,(Laughter),And at this point in the process,we had to come in every couple of days,to do a stress test on the baby,,and this is just routine,,it tests whether or not the baby nis feeling any type of undue stress.,And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,,just whoever happens to be nworking at the hospital that day.,So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes,the doctor comes out and he says,,"Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you.",Now, as a statistician, what's my response?,Show me the data!,So then he proceeds to tell us,the baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,,the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone,and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be,my heart rate zone and I said,,"Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?,I was moving around a little bit,,it's hard to lay still on your back,,41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.,Maybe it was shifting around.",He said, "Well, we don't want to take any chances.",I said okay.,I said, "What if I was at 36 weeks,with this same data?,Would your decision be to induce?","Well, no, I would wait until you were at least,38 weeks, but you are almost 42,,there is no reason to leave that baby inside,,let's get you a room.",I said, "Well, why don't we just do it again?,We can collect more data.,I can try to be really still for 20 minutes.,We can average the two and see,what that means. (Laughter),And he goes,,"Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage.",That makes three of us.,And then he says,,"Your chances of having a miscarriage double,when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room.",Wow. So now as a statistician, what's my response?,Show me the data!,Dude, you're talking chances,,I do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.,Let's talk chances. (Laughter),Let's talk chances. 
 So I say, "Okay, great.,Do I go from a 30-percent nchance to a 60-percent chance?,Where are we here with this miscarriage thing?,And he goes, "Not quite, but it doubles,,and we really just want what's best for the baby.",Undaunted, I try a different angle.,I said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,,how many of them are going to miscarry,just before their due date?,And then he looks at me and looks at Donald,,and he goes, about one in 1,000.,I said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many,are going to miscarry just after their due date?" 
 "About two." (Laughter),I said, "Okay, so you are telling me that my chances,go from a 0.1-percent chance,to a 0.2-percent chance." 
 Okay, so at this point the data is not convincing us,that we need to be induced,,and so then we proceed to have a conversation,about how inductions lead to a higher rate,of Cesarean sections, and if at all npossible we'd like to avoid that.,And then I said,,"And I really don't think my due date is accurate.",(Laughter),And so this really stunned him,and he looked sort of puzzled,and I said, "You may not know this,,but pregnancy due dates are calculated,assuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,,and my cycle ranges —,sometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 —,and I have been collecting the data to prove it.,(Laughter),And so we ended up leaving the hospital nthat day without being induced.,We actually had to sign a waiver nto walk out of the hospital.,And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,,because even with our first child,,we were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.,I'm not anti-medical intervention.,But why were confident to leave that day?,Well, we had data that told a different story.,We had been collecting data for six years.,I had this temperature data,,and it told a different story.,In fact, we could probably pretty naccurately estimate conception.,Yeah, that's a story you want to tell,at your kid's wedding reception. (Laughter),I remember like it was yesterday.,My temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degrees,as I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter),Oh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.,But we were confident to leave nbecause we had been collecting data.,Now, what does that data look like?,Here's a standard chart,of a woman's waking body temperature,during the course of a cycle.,So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle,till the beginning of the next.,You'll see that the temperature is not random.,Clearly there is a low pattern,at the beginning of her cycle,and then you see this jump and then a higher,set of temperatures at the end of her cycle.,So what's happening here?,What is that data telling you?,Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,,the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen,causes a suppression of your body temperature.,And at ovulation, your body releases an egg,and progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.,And so your body heats up in anticipation,of housing this new little fertilized egg.,So why this temperature jump?,Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.,Why is she sitting on them?,She wants to keep them warm,,protect them and keep them warm.,Ladies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,,they heat up in anticipation,of keeping a new little life warm.,And if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,,then estrogen takes back over and nthat cycle starts all over again.,But if you do get pregnant, sometimes you,actually see another shift in your temperatures,and it stays elevated for those whole nine months.,That's why you see those pregnant nwomen just sweating and hot,,because their temperatures are high.,Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.,We were really very excited about this chart.,You'll see the low temperature level,and then a shift and for about five days,,that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel,down the fallopian tube and implant,,and then you see those temperatures nstart to go up a little bit.,And in fact, we had a second temperature shift,,confirmed with a pregnancy test nthat were indeed pregnant,with our first child, very exciting.,Until a couple of days later,I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,,and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.,Had I not been taking my temperature,I really would have just thought nmy period was late that month,,but we actually had data to show,that we had miscarried this baby,,and even though this data revealed a really,unfortunate event in our lives,,it was information that we could then take to our doctor.,So if there was a fertility issue or some problem,,I had data to show:,Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,,we somehow lost this baby.,What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?,And it's not just about temperatures,and it's not just about fertility;,we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things. 
 For instance, did you know that taking nyour temperature can tell you a lot,about the condition of your thyroid?,So, your thyroid works a lot like nthe thermostat in your house.,There is an optimal temperature nthat you want in your house;,you set your thermostat.,When it gets too cold in the house,nyour thermostat kicks in,and says, "Hey, we need to blow some heat around.",Or if it gets too hot, your thermostat,registers, "Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off.",That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.,Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature,for your body.,If it gets too cold, your thyroid nsays, "Hey, we need to heat up.",If it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.,But what happens when your nthyroid is not functioning well?,When it doesn't function, then it shows up,in your body temperatures,,they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.,And so by collecting this data,you can find out information about your thyroid. 
 Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid nproblem and you went to the doctor,,your doctor would actually test the amount of,thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.,Fine. But the problem with that test is,it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.,So you might have a lot of hormone present,,but it might not be actively working to regulate,your body temperature.,So just by collecting your temperature every day,,you get information about the condition of your thyroid.,So, what if you don't want to take nyour temperature every day?,I advocate that you do,,but there are tons of other things you could take.,You could take your blood pressure, nyou could take your weight —,yeah, who's excited about,taking their weight every day? (Laughter) 
 Early on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy nose,and he had been taking a slew of medications,to try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.,And so, that night he comes and nhe wakes me up and he says,,"Honey, I can't breath out of my nose.",And I roll over and I look, and I said, n"Well, can you breath out of your mouth?",(Laughter),And he goes, "Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!",And so like any good wife, I rush him,to the emergency room,at 2 o'clock in the morning.,And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,,you can't die on me now.,We just got married,,people will think I killed you! (Laughter),And so, we get to the emergency nroom, and the nurse sees us,,and he can't breath out of his nose, and so,she brings us to the back and the doctor says,,"What seems to be the problem?" and nhe goes, "I can't breath out of my nose.",And he said, "You can't breath out of your nose?,No, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter),He takes a step back and he looks at both of us,and he says "Sir, I think I know the problem.,You're having a heart attack.,I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan,for you immediately.",And we are thinking,,no, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe,,just out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.,And so we go back and forth with this doctor,because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,,and he's like, "No really, it'll be fine, just calm down.",And I'm thinking, how do you calm down? nBut I don't think he's having a heart attack.,And so fortunately for us, this ndoctor was at the end of the shift.,So this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearly,distraught, with a husband who can't breath,out of his nose. (Laughter),And he starts asking us questions.,He says, "Well, do you two exercise?",We ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.,(Laughter),We move around.,And he says, "What were you doing njust before you came here?",I'm thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.,But okay, what was Donald doing just before?,So Donald goes into this slew nof medications he was taking.,He lists, "I took this decongestant nand then I took this nasal spray,",and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,,"Oh! You should never mix this ndecongestant with this nasal spray.,Clogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead.",He gives us a prescription.,We're looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,,and I said, "Why is it that it seems like you,were able to accurately diagnose his condition,,but this previous doctor wanted to order,an EKG and a CAT scan?",And he looks at us and says,,"Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the nemergency room and says he can't breath,,you assume he's having a heart attack,and you ask questions later.",Now, emergency room doctors are ntrained to make decisions quickly,,but not always accurately.,And so had we had some information,about our heart health to share with him,,maybe we would have gotten a nbetter diagnosis the first time. 
 I want you to consider the following chart,,of systolic blood pressure measurements,from October 2010 to July 2012.,You'll see that these measurements start,in the prehypertension/hypertension zone,,but over about the course of a year and a half,they move into the normal zone.,This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.,What story is this data telling you?,Obviously it's the data from someone,who's made a drastic transformation,,and fortunately for us, that person nhappens to be here today.,So that 350-pound guy that walked ninto the emergency room with me,is now an even sexier and healthier,225-pound guy, and that's his blood pressure trace.,So over the course of that year and a half,Donald's eating changed,and our exercise regimen changed,,and his heart rate responded,,his blood pressure responded to that change,that he made in his body. 
 So what's the take-home message,that I want you to leave with today?,By taking ownership of your data just like we've done,,just by taking this daily measurements about yourself,,you become the expert on your body.,You become the authority.,It's not hard to do.,You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics,to be an expert in yourself.,You don't have to have a medical degree,to be your body's expert.,Medical doctors, they're experts on the population,,but you are the expert on yourself.,And so when two of you come together,,when two experts come together,,the two of you are able to make a better decision,than just your doctor alone.,Now that you understand the power of information,that you can get through personal data collection,,I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.,(Laughter),Yes, get it up.,I challenge you to take ownership of your data.,And today, I hereby confer upon you,a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics,with a concentration in time-dependent data analysis,with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.,And so the next time you are in your doctor's office,,as newly inducted statisticians,,what should always be your response?,Audience: Show me the data! nTalithia Williams: I can't hear you!,Audience: Show me the data!,TW: One more time!,Audience: Show me the data!,TW: Show me the data.,Thank you.,(Applause)We humans have always been very concernednabout the health of our bodies,,but we haven't always been that goodnat figuring out what's important.,Take the ancient Egyptians, for example:,very concerned about the body partsnthey thought they'd need in the afterlife,,but they left some parts out.,This part, for example.,Although they very carefully npreserved the stomach, the lungs,,the liver, and so forth,,they just mushed up the brain,ndrained it out through the nose,,and threw it away,,which makes sense, really,,because what does a brainndo for us anyway?,But imagine if there were a kindnof neglected organ in our bodies,that weighed just as much as the brain,and in some ways was justnas important to who we are,,but we knew so little aboutnand treated with such disregard.,And imagine if,nthrough new scientific advances,,we were just beginning to understand,its importance to hownwe think of ourselves.,Wouldn't you want to know more about it? 
 Well, it turns out that we donhave something just like that:,our gut,,or rather, its microbes.,But it's not just the microbesnin our gut that are important.,Microbes all over our body,turn out to be really criticalnto a whole range of differences,that make different people who we are.,So for example, have you ever noticed,how some people get bitten by mosquitosnway more often than others? 
 It turns out that everyone's anecdotalnexperience out camping is actually true.,For example, I seldomnget bitten by mosquitos,,but my partner Amandanattracts them in droves,,and the reason why is that we havendifferent microbes on our skin,that produce different chemicalsnthat the mosquitos detect. 
 Now, microbes are also really importantnin the field of medicine.,So, for example, what microbesnyou have in your gut,determine whether particular painkillersnare toxic to your liver.,They also determine whether or not otherndrugs will work for your heart condition.,And, if you're a fruit fly, at least,,your microbes determinenwho you want to have sex with.,We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet,but maybe it's just a matter of timenbefore we find out. (Laughter) 
 So microbes are performingna huge range of functions.,They help us digest our food.,They help educate our immune system.,They help us resist disease,,and they may evennbe affecting our behavior.,So what would a map of all thesenmicrobial communities look like?,Well, it wouldn't look exactly like this,,but it's a helpful guidenfor understanding biodiversity.,Different parts of the worldnhave different landscapes of organisms,that are immediately characteristicnof one place or another,or another.,With microbiology, it's kind of the same,nalthough I've got to be honest with you:,All the microbes essentiallynlook the same under a microscope.,So instead of tryingnto identify them visually,,what we do is we looknat their DNA sequences,,and in a project callednthe Human Microbiome Project,,NIH funded this $173 million project,where hundreds nof researchers came together,to map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's,,and all of these microbesnin the human body.,So when we take them together,nthey look like this.,It's a bit more difficultnto tell who lives where now, isn't it? 
 What my lab does is developncomputational techniques that allow us,to take all these terabytesnof sequence data,and turn them into somethingnthat's a bit more useful as a map,,and so when we do thatnwith the human microbiome data,from 250 healthy volunteers,,it looks like this.,Each point here representsnall the complex microbes,in an entire microbial community.,See, I told you they basicallynall look the same.,So what we're looking at is each pointnrepresents one microbial community,from one body sitenof one healthy volunteer.,And so you can see that there's differentnparts of the map in different colors,,almost like separate continents.,And what it turns out to be,is that those, as the differentnregions of the body,,have very different microbes in them.,So what we have is we haventhe oral community up there in green.,Over on the other side,nwe have the skin community in blue,,the vaginal community in purple,,and then right down at the bottom,nwe have the fecal community in brown.,And we've just over the last few years,found out that the microbesnin different parts of the body,are amazingly different from one another.,So if I look at just one person's microbes,in the mouth and in the gut,,it turns out that the difference betweennthose two microbial communities,is enormous.,It's bigger than the differencenbetween the microbes in this reef,and the microbes in this prairie.,So this is incrediblenwhen you think about it.,What it means is that a few feetnof difference in the human body,makes more of a differencento your microbial ecology,than hundreds of miles on Earth. 
 And this is not to say that two people nlook basically the same,in the same body habitat, either.,So you probably heard,that we're pretty much all the samenin terms of our human DNA.,You're 99.99 percent identicalnin terms of your human DNA,to the person sitting next to you.,But that's not true of your gut microbes:,you might only share 10 percent similarity,with the person sitting next to younin terms of your gut microbes.,So that's as differentnas the bacteria on this prairie,and the bacteria in this forest. 
 So these different microbes,have all these different kinds nof functions that I told you about,,everything from digesting food,to involvementnin different kinds of diseases,,metabolizing drugs, and so forth.,So how do they do all this stuff?,Well, in part it's because,although there's just three poundsnof those microbes in our gut,,they really outnumber us.,And so how much do they outnumber us?,Well, it depends on whatnyou think of as our bodies.,Is it our cells?,Well, each of us consistsnof about 10 trillion human cells,,but we harbor as manynas 100 trillion microbial cells.,So they outnumber us 10 to one.,Now, you might think, well,nwe're human because of our DNA,,but it turns out that each of us hasnabout 20,000 human genes,,depending on what you count exactly,,but as many as two millionnto 20 million microbial genes.,So whichever way we look at it,nwe're vastly outnumbered,by our microbial symbionts.,And it turns out that in addition nto traces of our human DNA,,we also leave tracesnof our microbial DNA,on everything we touch.,We showed in a study a few years ago,that you can actually matchnthe palm of someone's hand up,to the computer mousenthat they use routinely,with up to 95 percent accuracy.,So this came out in a scientific journalna few years ago,,but more importantly,nit was featured on "CSI: Miami,",so you really know it's true.,(Laughter) 
 So where do our microbesncome from in the first place?,Well if, as I do, you have dogs or kids,,you probably havensome dark suspicions about that,,all of which are true, by the way.,So just like we can matchnyou to your computer equipment,by the microbes you share,,we can also match you up to your dog.,But it turns out that in adults,,microbial communitiesnare relatively stable,,so even if you live together with someone,,you'll maintain your separatenmicrobial identity,over a period of weeks,nmonths, even years. 
 It turns out that ournfirst microbial communities,depend a lot on how we're born.,So babies that come outnthe regular way,,all of their microbes are basicallynlike the vaginal community,,whereas babies that arendelivered by C-section,,all of their microbes insteadnlook like skin.,And this might be associatednwith some of the differences,in health associated with Cesarean birth,,such as more asthma, more allergies,neven more obesity,,all of which have been linkednto microbes now,,and when you think about it,nuntil recently, every surviving mammal,had been delivered by the birth canal,,and so the lacknof those protective microbes,that we've co-evolved withnmight be really important,for a lot of these different conditionsnthat we now know involve the microbiome. 
 When my own daughter was bornna couple of years ago,by emergency C-section,,we took matters into our own hands,and made sure she was coatednwith those vaginal microbes,that she would have gotten naturally.,Now, it's really difficult to tellnwhether this has had an effect,on her health specifically, right?,With a sample size of just one child,nno matter how much we love her,,you don't really havenenough of a sample size,to figure out what happens on average,,but at two years old,nshe hasn't had an ear infection yet,,so we're keeping our fingersncrossed on that one.,And what's more, we're startingnto do clinical trials with more children,to figure out whethernthis has a protective effect generally. 
 So how we're born has a tremendous effectnon what microbes we have initially,,but where do we go after that?,What I'm showing younagain here is this map,of the Human Microbiome Project Data,,so each point representsna sample from one body site,from one of 250 healthy adults.,And you've seen childrenndevelop physically.,You've seen them develop mentally.,Now, for the first time,nyou're going to see,one of my colleague's childrenndevelop microbially.,So what we are going to look at,is we're going to look nat this one baby's stool,,the fecal community,nwhich represents the gut,,sampled every weeknfor almost two and a half years.,And so we're starting on day one.,What's going to happen is that the infantnis going to start off as this yellow dot,,and you can see that he's starting offnbasically in the vaginal community,,as we would expect from his delivery mode.,And what's going to happennover these two and a half years,is that he's going to travel nall the way down,to resemble the adult fecal community fromnhealthy volunteers down at the bottom.,So I'm just going to start this goingnand we'll see how that happens. 
 What you can see, and rememberneach step in this is just one week,,what you can see is that week to week,,the change in the microbial communitynof the feces of this one child,,the differences week to weeknare much greater,than the differences betweennindividual healthy adults,in the Human Microbiome Project cohort,,which are those brown dotsndown at the bottom.,And you can see he's startingnto approach the adult fecal community.,This is up to about two years.,But something amazingnis about to happen here.,So he's getting antibioticsnfor an ear infection.,What you can see isnthis huge change in the community,,followed by a relatively rapid recovery.,I'll just rewind that for you.,And what we can see is thatnjust over these few weeks,,we have a much more radical change,,a setback of many months nof normal development,,followed by a relatively rapid recovery,,and by the time he reaches day 838,,which is the end of this video,,you can see that he has essentiallynreached the healthy adult stool community,,despite that antibiotic intervention. 
 So this is really interestingnbecause it raises fundamental questions,about what happens when we intervenenat different ages in a child's life.,So does what we do early on, wherenthe microbiome is changing so rapidly,,actually matter,,or is it like throwing a stoneninto a stormy sea,,where the ripples will just be lost?,Well, fascinatingly, it turns outnthat if you give children antibiotics,in the first six months of life,,they're more likelynto become obese later on,than if they don't get antibiotics thennor only get them later,,and so what we do early onnmay have profound impacts,on the gut microbial communitynand on later health,that we're only beginning to understand.,So this is fascinating, because one day,nin addition to the effects,that antibiotics havenon antibiotic-resistant bacteria,,which are very important,,they may also be degradingnour gut microbial ecosystems,,and so one day we may comento regard antibiotics with the same horror,that we currently reservenfor those metal tools,that the Egyptians used to usento mush up the brains,before they drained them outnfor embalming. 
 So I mentioned that microbesnhave all these important functions,,and they've also now,njust over the past few years,,been connected to a whole rangenof different diseases,,including inflammatory bowel disease,,heart disease, colon cancer,,and even obesity.,Obesity has a really nlarge effect, as it turns out,,and today, we can tellnwhether you're lean or obese,with 90 percent accuracy,by looking at the microbes in your gut.,Now, although that might sound impressive,,in some ways it's a little bit problematicnas a medical test,,because you can probably tellnwhich of these people is obese,without knowing anythingnabout their gut microbes,,but it turns out that evennif we sequence their complete genomes,and had all their human DNA,,we could only predict which onenwas obese with about 60 percent accuracy.,So that's amazing, right?,What it means that the three poundsnof microbes that you carry around with you,may be more importantnfor some health conditions,than every single gene in your genome. 
 And then in mice, we can do a lot more.,So in mice, microbes have been linkednto all kinds of additional conditions,,including things like multiple sclerosis,,depression, autism, and again, obesity.,But how can we tell whethernthese microbial differences,that correlate with diseasenare cause or effect?,Well, one thing we can donis we can raise some mice,without any microbes of their ownnin a germ-free bubble.,Then we can add in some microbesnthat we think are important,,and see what happens.,When we take the microbesnfrom an obese mouse,and transplant themninto a genetically normal mouse,that's been raised in a bubblenwith no microbes of its own,,it becomes fatter than if it got them nfrom a regular mouse.,Why this happensnis absolutely amazing, though.,Sometimes what's going onnis that the microbes,are helping them digest foodnmore efficiently from the same diet,,so they're taking more energynfrom their food,,but other times, the microbesnare actually affecting their behavior.,What they're doing is they're eatingnmore than the normal mouse,,so they only get fat if we let them neat as much as they want. 
 So this is really remarkable, right?,The implication is that microbesncan affect mammalian behavior.,So you might be wondering whether we can nalso do this sort of thing across species,,and it turns out that if you take microbesnfrom an obese person,and transplant them into micenyou've raised germ-free,,those mice will also become fatter,than if they received the microbesnfrom a lean person,,but we can design a microbial communitynthat we inoculate them with,that prevents themnfrom gaining this weight. 
 We can also do this for malnutrition.,So in a project fundednby the Gates Foundation,,what we're looking atnis children in Malawi,who have kwashiorkor,na profound form of malnutrition,,and mice that get the kwashiorkorncommunity transplanted into them,lose 30 percent of their body mass,in just three weeks,,but we can restore their health by using nthe same peanut butter-based supplement,that is used for nthe children in the clinic,,and the mice that receive the community,from the healthy identical twinsnof the kwashiorkor children do fine.,This is truly amazing because it suggestsnthat we can pilot therapies,by trying them outnin a whole bunch of different mice,with individual people's gut communities,and perhaps tailor those therapiesnall the way down to the individual level. 
 So I think it's really importantnthat everyone has a chance,to participate in this discovery.,So, a couple of years ago,,we started this projectncalled American Gut,,which allows you to claim a place nfor yourself on this microbial map.,This is now the largest crowd-fundednscience project that we know of --,over 8,000 peoplenhave signed up at this point.,What happens is,nthey send in their samples,,we sequence the DNA of their microbesnand then release the results back to them.,We also release them, de-identified,nto scientists, to educators,,to interested membersnof the general public, and so forth,,so anyone can have access to the data.,On the other hand,,when we do tours of our labnat the BioFrontiers Institute,,and we explain that we use robotsnand lasers to look at poop,,it turns out that notneveryone wants to know.,(Laughter),But I'm guessing that many of you do,,and so I brought some kits herenif you're interested,in trying this out for yourself. 
 So why might we want to do this?,Well, it turns out that microbesnare not just important,for finding out where we arenin terms of our health,,but they can actually cure disease.,This is one of the newest thingsnwe've been able to visualize,with colleagues nat the University of Minnesota.,So here's that mapnof the human microbiome again.,What we're looking at now --,I'm going to add in the communitynof some people with C. diff.,So, this is a terrible form of diarrhea,where you have to gonup to 20 times a day,,and these people have failednantibiotic therapy for two years,before they're eligible for this trial.,So what would happen if we transplantednsome of the stool from a healthy donor,,that star down at the bottom,,into these patients.,Would the good microbesndo battle with the bad microbes,and help to restore their health?,So let's watch exactly what happens there.,Four of those patientsnare about to get a transplant,from that healthy donor at the bottom,,and what you can see is that immediately,,you have this radical changenin the gut community.,So one day after you do that transplant,,all those symptoms clear up,,the diarrhea vanishes,,and they're essentially healthy again,ncoming to resemble the donor's community,,and they stay there.,(Applause) 
 So we're just at the beginningnof this discovery.,We're just finding out that microbesnhave implications,for all these different kinds of diseases,,ranging from inflammatory nbowel disease to obesity,,and perhaps even autism and depression.,What we need to do, though,,is we need to developna kind of microbial GPS,,where we don't just knownwhere we are currently,but also where we want to gonand what we need to do,in order to get there,,and we need to be ablento make this simple enough,that even a child can use it.n(Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)All right, let's get upnour picture of the earth.,The earth is pretty awesome.,I'm a geologist, so I getnpretty psyched about this,,but the earth is great.,It's powerful, it's dynamic,nit's constantly changing.,It's a pretty exciting place to live.,But I want to share with you guys todaynmy perspective as a geologist,in how understanding earth's past,can help inform and guidendecisions that we make today,about how to sustainably livenon earth's surface. 
 So there's a lot of exciting thingsnthat go on on the surface of the earth.,If we zoom in here a little bit,,I want to talk to you guys a little bitnabout one of the things that happens.,Material get shuffled aroundnearth's surface all the time,,and one of the big thing that happensnis material from high mountains,gets eroded and transportednand deposited in the sea.,And this process is ongoing all the time,,and it has huge effectsnon how the landscape works.,So this example here in south India --,we have some of the biggestnmountains in the world,,and you can see in this satellite photo,rivers transporting materialnfrom those mountains out to the sea.,You can think of these riversnlike bulldozers.,They're basically taking these mountainsnand pushing them down towards the sea. 
 We'll give you guys an example here.,So we zoom in a little bit.,I want to talk to you guysnspecifically about a river.,We can see these beautiful patternsnthat the rivers make,as they're pushing materialndown to the sea,,but these patterns aren't static.,These rivers are wigglingnand jumping around quite a bit,,and it can have big impacts on our lives. 
 So an example of thisnis this is the Kosi River.,So the Kosi Rivernhas this nice c-shaped pathway,,and it exits the big mountains of Nepal,carrying with it a ton of material,,a lot of sediments that's beingneroded from the high mountains,,and it spreads out across India,and moves this material.,So we're going to zoom in to this area,and I'm going to tell you a little bitnabout what happened with the Kosi.,It's an example of how dynamicnthese systems can be.,So this is a satellite imagenfrom August of 2008,,and this satellite image is colored,so that vegetations or plantsnshow up as green,and water shows up as blue.,So here again you can seenthat c-shaped pathway,that this river takes as it exits Nepal.,And now this is monsoon season.,August is monsoon seasonnin this region of the world,,and anyone that lives near a rivernis no stranger to flooding,and the hazards and inconveniencesnat minimum that are associated with that.,But something interestingnhappened in 2008,,and this river moved in a waynthat's very different.,It flooded in a way that's veryndifferent than it normally does.,So the Kosi River is flowing down here,,but sometimes as these riversnare bulldozing sediment,,they kind of get clogged,,and these clogs cannactually cause the rivers,to shift their course dramatically.,So this satellite imagenis from just two weeks later.,Here's the previous pathway,,that c-shaped pathway,,and you notice it's not blue anymore.,But now what we have is this blue pathway,that cuts down the middlenof the field of view here.,What happened isnthe Kosi River jumped its banks,,and for reference,nthe scale bar here is 40 miles.,This river movednover 30 miles very abruptly.,So this river got cloggednand it jumped its banks.,Here's an image from about a week later,,and you can seenthese are the previous pathways,,and you can see this processnof river-jumping continues,as this river moves farther awaynfrom its major course. 
 So you can imaginenin landscapes like this,,where rivers move around frequently,,it's really important to understand when,nwhere and how they're going to jump.,But these kinds of processesnalso happen a lot closer to home as well.,So in the United States,,we have the Mississippi Rivernthat drains most of the continental US.,It pushes materialnfrom the Rocky Mountains,and from the Great Plains.,It drains it and moves itnall the way across America,and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.,So this is the course of the Mississippinthat we're familiar with today,,but it didn't always flownin this direction.,If we use the geologic record,,we can reconstructnwhere it went in the past.,So for example, this red area here,is where we know the Mississippi Rivernflowed and deposited material,about 4,600 years ago.,Then about 3,500 years ago it moved,to follow the coursenoutlined here in orange.,And it kept moving and it keeps moving.,So here's about 2,000 years ago,,a thousand years ago,,700 years ago.,And it was onlynas recently as 500 years ago,that it occupied the pathwaynthat we're familiar with today.,So these processes are really important,,and especially here, this delta area,,where these river-jumping eventsnin the Mississippi,are building land at the interfacenof the land and the sea.,This is really valuable real estate,,and deltas like this are some of the mostndensely populated areas on our planet.,So understanding the dynamicsnof these landscapes,,how they formed and how they willncontinue to change in the future,is really importantnfor the people that live there. 
 So rivers also wiggle.,These are sort of bigger jumpsnthat we've been talking about.,I want to show you guysnsome river wiggles here.,So we're going to fly downnto the Amazon River basin,,and here again we have a big river system,that is draining and moving and plowingnmaterial from the Andean Mountains,,transporting it across South America,and dumping it outninto the Atlantic Ocean.,So if we zoom in here, you guysncan see these nice, curvy river pathways.,Again, they're really beautiful,nbut again, they're not static.,These rivers wiggle around.,We can use satellite imagerynover the last 30 or so years,to actually monitor how these change.,So take a minute and just watchnany bend or curve in this river,,and you'll see it doesn't staynin the same place for very long.,It changes and evolvesnand warps its pattern.,If you look in this area in particular,,I want you guys to noticenthere's a sort of a loop in the river,that gets completely cut off.,It's almost like a whip cracking,and snaps off the pathwaynof the river at a certain spot.,So just for reference, again,,in this location, that rivernchanged its course over four miles,over the course of a season or two. 
 So the landscapesnthat we live in on earth,,as this materialnis being eroded from the mountains,and transported to the sea,,are wiggling around all the time.,They're changing all the time,,and we need to be ablento understand these processes,so we can manage and livensustainably on these landscapes.,But it's hard to donif the only information we have,is what's going on todaynat earth's surface.,Right? We don't havena lot of observations.,We only have 30 years' worthnof satellite photos, for example.,We need more observationsnto understand these processes more.,And additionally, we need to know,how these landscapes are goingnto respond to changing climate,and to changing land use,as we continue to occupynand modify earth's surface. 
 So this is where the rocks come in.,So as rivers flow,,as they're bulldozing materialnfrom the mountains to the sea,,sometimes bits of sand and claynand rock get stuck in the ground.,And that stuff that gets stucknin the ground gets buried,,and through time, we getnbig, thick accumulations of sediments,that eventually turn into rocks.,What this means is that we canngo to places like this,,where we see big, thick stacksnof sedimentary rocks,,and go back in time,and see what the landscapesnlooked like in the past.,We can do this to help reconstruct,and understandnhow earth landscapes evolve.,This is pretty convenient, too,,because the earth has hadnsort of an epic history. Right?,So this video herenis a reconstruction of paleogeography,for just the firstn600 million years of earth's history.,So just a little bit of time here.,So as the plates move around,,we know climate has changed,nsea level has changed,,we have a lot of differentntypes of landscapes,and different types of environmentsnthat we can go back --,if we have a time machine --,we can go back and look at,,and we do indeed have a time machine,because we can look at the rocksnthat were deposited at these times. 
 So I'm going to give younan example of this,and take you to a specialntime in earth's past.,About 55 million years ago,nthere was a really abrupt warming event,,and what happened wasna whole bunch of carbon dioxide,was released into earth's atmosphere,,and it caused a rapidnand pretty extreme global warming event.,And when I say warm, I mean pretty warm,,that there were thingsnlike crocodiles and palm trees,as far north as Canadanand as far south as Patagonia.,So this was a pretty warm timenand it happened really abruptly.,So what we can do,is we can go back and find rocksnthat were deposited at this time,and reconstruct how the landscape changednin response to this warming event. 
 So here, yay, rocks. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's a pile of rocks.,This yellow blob here,,this is actually a fossil river,,so just like this cartoon I showed,,these are deposits that werenlaid down 55 million years ago.,As geologists, we can gonand look at these up close,and reconstruct the landscape.,So here's another example.,The yellow blob here is a fossil river.,Here's another one above it.,We can go and look in detailnand make measurements and observations,,and we can measure features.,For example, the featuresnI just highlighted there,tell us that this particular rivernwas probably about three feet deep.,You could wadenacross this cute little stream,if you were walking aroundn55 million years ago.,The reddish stuff that's abovenand below those channels,,those are ancient soil deposits.,So we can look at those to tell usnwhat lived and grew on the landscape,and to understand how these riversnwere interacting with their floodplains.,So we can look in detailnand reconstruct with some specificity,how these rivers flowednand what the landscapes looked like.,So when we do thisnfor this particular place,at this time,,if we look what happenednbefore this abrupt warming event,,the rivers kind of carved their wayndown from the mountains to the sea,,and they looked maybe similar to whatnI showed you in the Amazon River basin.,But right at the onsetnof this climate change event,,the rivers change dramatically.,All of a sudden they got much broader,,and they started to slide back and forthnacross the landscape more readily.,Eventually, the rivers revertednback to a state that was more similar,to what they would have looked likenbefore this climate event,,but it took a long, long time. 
 So we can go back in earth's timenand do these kinds of reconstructions,and understand hownearth's landscape has changed,in response to a climate event like thisnor a land use event.,So some of the ways that rivers change,or the reasons that rivers changentheir pattern and their movements,is because of things like with extra waternfalling on the land's surface,when climate is hotter,,we can move more sedimentnand erode more sediment,,and that changes how rivers behave. 
 So ultimately,,as long as earth's surface is our home,,we need to carefully managenthe resources and risks,associated with livingnin dynamic environments.,And I think the only waynwe can really do that sustainably,is if we include information,about how landscapes evolvednand behaved in earth's past. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I'm going to speak to you,about the last 30 yearsnof architectural history.,That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes. 
 It's a complex topic,,so we're just going to dive right innat a complex place:,New Jersey.,Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,,and I was six, and I lived therenin my parents' house,in a town called Livingston,,and this was my childhood bedroom.,Around the corner from my bedroom,was the bathroomnthat I used to share with my sister.,And in between my bedroom and the bathroom,was a balcony that overlookednthe family room.,And that's where everyonenwould hang out and watch TV,,so that every time that I walkednfrom my bedroom to the bathroom,,everyone would see me,,and every time I took a showernand would come back in a towel,,everyone would see me.,And I looked like this.,I was awkward,,insecure, and I hated it.,I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,,I hated that room, and I hated that house. 
 And that's architecture.,(Laughter),Done.,That feeling, those emotions that I felt,,that's the power of architecture,,because architecture is not about mathnand it's not about zoning,,it's about those visceral,nemotional connections,that we feel to the places that we occupy.,And it's no surprisenthat we feel that way,,because according to the EPA,,Americans spend 90 percentnof their time indoors.,That's 90 percent of our timensurrounded by architecture.,That's huge.,That means that architecture is shaping usnin ways that we didn't even realize. 
 That makes us a little bit gulliblenand very, very predictable.,It means that when I show youna building like this,,I know what you think:,You think "power"nand "stability" and "democracy.",And I know you think thatnbecause it's based on a building,that was build 2,500 years agonby the Greeks.,This is a trick.,This is a trigger that architects use,to get you to createnan emotional connection,to the forms that we buildnour buildings out of.,It's a predictable emotional connection,,and we've been using this tricknfor a long, long time.,We used it [200] years ago to build banks.,We used it in the 19th centurynto build art museums.,And in the 20th century in America,,we used it to build houses.,And look at these solid,nstable little soldiers,facing the oceannand keeping away the elements. 
 This is really, really useful,,because building things is terrifying.,It's expensive, it takes a long time,nand it's very complicated.,And the people that build things --,developers and governments --,they're naturally afraid of innovation,,and they'd rather just use those formsnthat they know you'll respond to. 
 That's how we end upnwith buildings like this.,This is a nice building.,This is the Livingston Public Library,that was completed in 2004 in my hometown,,and, you know, it's got a dome,and it's got this round thing nand columns, red brick,,and you can kind of guess what Livingstonnis trying to say with this building:,children, property values and history.,But it doesn't have much to donwith what a library actually does today.,That same year, in 2004,non the other side of the country,,another library was completed,,and it looks like this.,It's in Seattle.,This library is about hownwe consume media in a digital age.,It's about a new kindnof public amenity for the city,,a place to gather and read and share. 
 So how is it possible,that in the same year,nin the same country,,two buildings, both called libraries,,look so completely different?,And the answer is that architecture worksnon the principle of a pendulum.,On the one side is innovation,,and architects are constantly pushing,npushing for new technologies,,new typologies, new solutionsnfor the way that we live today.,And we push and we push and we push,until we completely alienate all of you.,We wear all black, we get very depressed,,you think we're adorable,,we're dead inside becausenwe've got no choice.,We have to go to the other side,and reengage those symbolsnthat we know you love.,So we do that, and you're happy,,we feel like sellouts,,so we start experimenting again,and we push the pendulum backnand back and forth and back and forth,we've gone for the last 300 years,,and certainly for the last 30 years. 
 Okay, 30 years agonwe were coming out of the '70s.,Architects had been busy experimentingnwith something called brutalism.,It's about concrete.,(Laughter),You can guess this.,Small windows, dehumanizing scale.,This is really tough stuff.,So as we get closer to the '80s,,we start to reengage those symbols.,We push the pendulumnback into the other direction.,We take these forms that we know you love,and we update them.,We add neon,and we add pastels,and we use new materials.,And you love it.,And we can't give you enough of it.,We take Chippendale armoires,and we turned those into skyscrapers,,and skyscrapers can benmedieval castles made out of glass.,Forms got big,,forms got bold and colorful.,Dwarves became columns.,(Laughter),Swans grew to the size of buildings.,It was crazy.,But it's the '80s, it's cool.,(Laughter),We're all hanging out in malls,and we're all moving to the suburbs,,and out there, out in the suburbs,,we can create our ownnarchitectural fantasies.,And those fantasies,,they can be Mediterranean,or French,or Italian.,(Laughter),Possibly with endless breadsticks. 
 This is the thing about postmodernism.,This is the thing about symbols.,They're easy, they're cheap,,because instead of making places,,we're making memories of places.,Because I know, nand I know all of you know,,this isn't Tuscany.,This is Ohio.,(Laughter) 
 So architects get frustrated,,and we start pushing the pendulumnback into the other direction.,In the late '80s and early '90s,,we start experimenting with somethingncalled deconstructivism.,We throw out historical symbols,,we rely on new, computer-aidedndesign techniques,,and we come up with new compositions,,forms crashing into forms.,This is academic and heady stuff,,it's super unpopular,,we totally alienate you.,Ordinarily, the pendulum would justnswing back into the other direction.,And then, something amazing happened. 
 In 1997, this building opened.,This is the Guggenheim Bilbao,nby Frank Gehry.,And this building,fundamentally changesnthe world's relationship to architecture.,Paul Goldberger said that Bilbaonwas one of those rare moments,when critics, academics,nand the general public,were completely united around a building.,The New York Timesncalled this building a miracle.,Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent,after this building was completed.,So all of a sudden, everybodynwants one of these buildings:,L.A.,,Seattle,,Chicago,,New York,,Cleveland,,Springfield.,(Laughter),Everybody wants one,nand Gehry is everywhere.,He is our very first starchitect. 
 Now, how is it possiblenthat these forms --,they're wild and radical --,how is it possible that they becomenso ubiquitous throughout the world?,And it happened because medianso successfully galvanized around them,that they quickly taught usnthat these forms mean culture and tourism.,We created an emotionalnreaction to these forms.,So did every mayor in the world.,So every mayor knewnthat if they had these forms,,they had culture and tourism. 
 This phenomenonnat the turn of the new millennium,happened to a few other starchitects.,It happened to Zaha,and it happened to Libeskind,,and what happenednto these elite few architects,at the turn of the new millennium,could actually start to happennto the entire field of architecture,,as digital media startsnto increase the speed,with which we consume information.,Because think aboutnhow you consume architecture.,A thousand years ago,,you would have had to have walked tonthe village next door to see a building.,Transportation speeds up:,You can take a boat, you can take a plane,nyou can be a tourist.,Technology speeds up:nYou can see it in a newspaper, on TV,,until finally, we are allnarchitectural photographers,,and the building has becomendisembodied from the site.,Architecture is everywhere now,,and that means thatnthe speed of communication,has finally caught upnto the speed of architecture. 
 Because architecturenactually moves quite quickly.,It doesn't take longnto think about a building.,It takes a long time to build a building,,three or four years,,and in the interim, an architectnwill design two or eight,or a hundred other buildings,before they know if that buildingnthat they designed four years ago,was a success or not.,That's because there's never beenna good feedback loop in architecture.,That's how we end upnwith buildings like this.,Brutalism wasn't a two-year movement,,it was a 20-year movement.,For 20 years, we were producingnbuildings like this,because we had no ideanhow much you hated it.,It's never going to happen again,,I think,,because we are living on the vergenof the greatest revolution in architecture,since the invention of concrete,,of steel, or of the elevator,,and it's a media revolution. 
 So my theory is that whennyou apply media to this pendulum,,it starts swinging faster and faster,,until it's at both extremesnnearly simultaneously,,and that effectively blurs the differencenbetween innovation and symbol,,between us, the architects,nand you, the public.,Now we can make nearly instantaneous,nemotionally charged symbols,out of something that's brand new. 
 Let me show you how this plays out,in a project that my firmnrecently completed.,We were hired to replace this building,nwhich burned down.,This is the center of a townncalled the Pines,in Fire Island in New York State.,It's a vacation community.,We proposed a building that was audacious,,that was different than any of the formsnthat the community was used to,,and we were scarednand our client was scared,and the community was scared,,so we created a seriesnof photorealistic renderings,that we put onto Facebook,and we put onto Instagram,,and we let people startnto do what they do:,share it, comment, like it, hate it.,But that meant that two yearsnbefore the building was complete,,it was already a part of the community,,so that when the renderingsnlooked exactly like the finished product,,there were no surprises.,This building was already a partnof this community,,and then that first summer,,when people started arrivingnand sharing the building on social media,,the building ceased to be just an edificenand it became media,,because these, these are notnjust pictures of a building,,they're your pictures of a building.,And as you use them to tell your story,,they become partnof your personal narrative,,and what you're doingnis you're short-circuiting,all of our collective memory,,and you're making these charged symbolsnfor us to understand.,That means we don't neednthe Greeks anymore,to tell us what to thinknabout architecture.,We can tell each othernwhat we think about architecture,,because digital media hasn't just changednthe relationship between all of us,,it's changed the relationshipnbetween us and buildings.,Think for a second aboutnthose librarians back in Livingston.,If that building was goingnto be built today,,the first thing they would do is go onlinenand search "new libraries.",They would be bombarded by examplesnof experimentation, of innovation,,of pushing at the envelopenof what a library can be.,That's ammunition.,That's ammunitionnthat they can take with them,to the mayor of Livingston,nto the people of Livingston,,and say, there's no one answernto what a library is today.,Let's be a part of this.,This abundance of experimentation,gives them the freedomnto run their own experiment. 
 Everything is different now.,Architects are no longernthese mysterious creatures,that use big wordsnand complicated drawings,,and you aren't the hapless public,,the consumer that won't acceptnanything that they haven't seen anymore.,Architects can hear you,,and you're not intimidatednby architecture.,That means that that pendulumnswinging back and forth,from style to style,nfrom movement to movement,,is irrelevant.,We can actually move forward,and find relevant solutionsnto the problems that our society faces.,This is the end of architectural history,,and it means thatnthe buildings of tomorrow,are going to look a lot differentnthan the buildings of today.,It means that a public spacenin the ancient city of Seville,can be unique and tailorednto the way that a modern city works.,It means that a stadium in Brooklynncan be a stadium in Brooklyn,,not some red-brick historical pastiche,of what we think a stadium ought to be.,It means that robots are goingnto build our buildings,,because we're finally ready for the formsnthat they're going to produce.,And it means that buildingsnwill twist to the whims of nature,instead of the other way around.,It means that a parking garagenin Miami Beach, Florida,,can also be a place for sports,and for yoga,and you can evennget married there late at night.,(Laughter),It means that three architectsncan dream about swimming,in the East River of New York,,and then raise nearlynhalf a million dollars,from a communitynthat gathered around their cause,,no one client anymore.,It means that no buildingnis too small for innovation,,like this little reindeer pavilion,that's as muscly and sinewynas the animals it's designed to observe.,And it means that a buildingndoesn't have to be beautiful,to be lovable,,like this ugly little building in Spain,,where the architects dug a hole,,packed it with hay,,and then poured concrete around it,,and when the concrete dried,,they invited someone to comenand clean that hay out,so that all that's left when it's done,is this hideous little room,that's filled with the imprintsnand scratches of how that place was made,,and that becomes the most sublime placento watch a Spanish sunset. 
 Because it doesn't matternif a cow builds our buildings,or a robot builds our buildings.,It doesn't matter how we build,nit matters what we build.,Architects already know hownto make buildings that are greener,and smarter and friendlier.,We've just been waitingnfor all of you to want them.,And finally, we're notnon opposite sides anymore.,Find an architect, hire an architect,,work with us to design better buildings,nbetter cities, and a better world,,because the stakes are high.,Buildings don't just reflect our society,nthey shape our society,down to the smallest spaces:,the local libraries,,the homes where we raise our children,,and the walk that they takenfrom the bedroom to the bathroom. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What do augmented reality,and professional football,have to do with empathy?,And what is the air speed velocity,of an unladen swallow?,Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer,one of those questions today,,so please, try and contain your disappointment. 
 When most people think about augmented reality,,they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise,waving his hands in the air,,but augmented reality is not science fiction.,Augmented reality is something that will happen,in our lifetime, and it will happen,because we have the tools to make it happen,,and people need to be aware of that,,because augmented reality will change our lives,just as much as the Internet and the cell phone. 
 Now how do we get to augmented reality?,Step one is the step I'm wearing right now,,Google Glass.,I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.,What you may not be familiar with,is that Google Glass is a device,that will allow you to see what I see.,It will allow you to experience what it is like,to be a professional athlete on the field.,Right now, the only way you can be on the field,is for me to try and describe it to you.,I have to use words.,I have to create a framework that you then fill in,with your imagination.,With Google Glass, we can put that,underneath a helmet,,and we can get a sense of what it's like,to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,,your blood pounding in your ears.,You can get a sense of what it's like,to have a 250-pound man,sprinting at you,trying to decapitate you,with every ounce of his being.,And I've been on the receiving end of that,,and it doesn't feel very good. 
 Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like,to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet,to give you a taste of that.,Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage,because the NFL thinks emergent technology,is what happens when a submarine surfaces,,but — (Laughter) — we do what we can. 
 So let's pull up some video. 
 (Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.,Ugh, getting tackled sucks.,Hold on, let's get a little closer.,All right, ready?,Go! 
 Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,,small taste of what it's like to get tackled,on the football field,from the perspective of the tacklee.,Now, you may have noticed there are,some people missing there:,the rest of the team.,We have some video of that,courtesy of the University of Washington. 
 (Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!,Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!,Oh! 
 CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer,to what it's like to be on that field,,but this is nowhere what it's like,to be on the NFL. 
 Fans want that experience.,Fans want to be on that field.,They want to be their favorite players,,and they've already talked to me on YouTube,,they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,,"Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?,Can you get this on a running back?,We want that experience." 
 Well, once we have that experience with GoPro,and Google Glass,,how do we make it more immersive?,How do we take that next step?,Well, we take that step,by going to something called the Oculus Rift,,which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.,The Oculus Rift has been described as one of,the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,,and that is not empty hype.,I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype,with this video.,(Video) Man: Oh! Oh!,No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!,Oh my God! Aaaah! 
 CK: So that is the experience of a man,on a roller coaster,in fear of his life.,What do you think that fan's experience,is going to be when we take the video footage,of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,,shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm,before sprinting in for a touchdown?,What do you think that fan's experience,is going to be when he's Messi,sprinting down the pitch,putting the ball in the back of the net,,or Federer serving in Wimbledon?,What do you think his experience is going to be,when he is going down the side of a mountain,at over 70 miles an hour,as an Olympic downhill skier?,I think adult diaper sales may surge.,(Laughter) 
 But this is not yet augmented reality.,This is only virtual reality, V.R.,How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?,We get to augmented reality,when coaches and managers and owners,look at this information streaming in,that people want to see, and they say,,"How do we use this to make our teams better?,How do we use this to win games?",Because teams always use technology to win games.,They like winning. It makes them money. 
 So a brief history of technology in the NFL.,In 1965, the Baltimore Colts,put a wristband on their quarterback,to allow him to call plays quicker.,They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.,Other teams followed suit.,More people watched the gamenbecause it was more exciting.,It was faster. 
 In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios,into the helmets of the quarterbacks,,and later the defense.,More people watched games because it was faster.,It was more entertaining. 
 In 2023, imagine you're a player,walking back to the huddle,,and you have your next play displayed,right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor,that you already wear right now.,No more having to worry about forgetting plays.,No more worrying about havingnto memorize your playbook.,You just go out and react.,And coaches really want this,,because missed assignments lose you games,,and coaches hate losing games.,Losing games gets you fired as a coach.,They don't want that. 
 But augmented reality is not just,an enhanced playbook.,Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data,and use it in real time,to enhance how you play the game.,What would that be like?,Well, a very simple setup would be a camera,on each corner of the stadium looking down,,giving you a bird's-eye view,of all the people down there.,You also have information from helmet sensors,and accelerometers,,technology that's being worked on right now.,You take all that information,nand you stream it to your players.,The good teams stream it in anway that the players can use.,The bad ones have information overload.,That determines good teams from bad.,And now, your I.T. department,is just as important as your scouting department,,and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.,It's also for jocks. Who knew? 
 What would that look like on the field?,Well, imagine you're the quarterback.,You take the snap and you drop back.,You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.,All of a sudden, a bright flash,on the left side of your visor lets you know,,blind side linebacker is blitzing in.,Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him,,but the augmented reality system lets you know.,You step up into the pocket.,Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.,You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.,The ball comes off track.,You don't know where it's going to land.,However, on the receiver's visor,,he sees a patch of grass light up,,and he knows to readjust.,He goes, catches the ball,,sprints in, touchdown.,Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him,every step of the way,,watching from every perspective. 
 Now this is something that will create,massive excitement in the game.,It will make tons of people watch,,because people want this experience.,Fans want to be on the field.,They want to be their favorite player.,Augmented reality will be a part of sports,,because it's too profitable not to. 
 But the question I ask you is,,is that's all that we're contentnto use augmented reality for?,Are we going to use it solely for our panem,,our circenses, our entertainment as normal?,Because I believe that we can use augmented reality,for something more.,I believe we can use augmented reality,as a way to foster more empathy,within the human species itself,,by literally showing someone,what it looks like,to walk a mile in another person's shoes.,We know what this technology is worth,to sports leagues.,It's worth revenue, to the tunenof billions of dollars a year.,But what is this technology worth,to a teacher in a classroom,trying to show a bully,just how harmful his actions are,from the perspective of the victim?,What is this technology worth,to a gay Ugandan or Russian,trying to show the world what it's like,living under persecution?,What is this technology worth,to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson,trying to inspire a generation of children,to think more about space and science,instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians? 
 Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality,is coming.,The questions we ask, the choices we make,,and the challenges we face,are, as always, up to us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Humanity takes center stage at TED,,but I would like to add na voice for the animals,,whose bodies and minds nand spirits shaped us. 
 Some years ago, it was my good fortune,to meet a tribal elder on an island,not far from Vancouver.,His name is Jimmy Smith,,and he shared a story with me,that is told among his people,,who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw. 
 Once upon a time, he told me,,all animals on Earth were one.,Even though they look different on the outside,,inside, they're all the same,,and from time to time they would gather,at a sacred cave deep inside the forest,to celebrate their unity.,When they arrived,,they would all take off their skins.,Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur,,and salmon her scales,,and then, they would dance.,But one day, a human made it to the cave,and laughed at what he saw,because he did not understand.,Embarrassed, the animals fled,,and that was the last time,they revealed themselves this way. 
 The ancient understanding that underneath,their separate identities, all animals are one,,has been a powerful inspiration to me.,I like to get past the fur, the feathers,and the scales.,I want to get under the skin.,No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant,or a tiny tree frog,,my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye. 
 You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?,Sure. People are always present in my photos,,no matter whether they appear,to portray tortoises,or cougars,or lions.,You just have to learn how nto look past their disguise. 
 As a photographer,,I try to reach beyond the differences,in our genetic makeup,to appreciate all we have in common,with every other living thing.,When I use my camera,,I drop my skin,like the animals at that cave,so I can show who they really are. 
 As animals blessed,with the power of rational thought,,we can marvel at the intricacies of life.,As citizens of a planet in trouble,,it is our moral responsibility,to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.,But as humans with hearts,,we can all rejoice in the unity of life,,and perhaps we can change,what once happened in that sacred cave. 
 Let's find a way to join the dance. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As a student of adversity,,I've been struck over the yearsnby how some people with major challenges,seem to draw strength from them.,And I've heard the popular wisdomnthat that has to do with finding meaning.,And for a long time,,I thought the meaning was out there,,some great truth waiting to be found. 
 But over time,,I've come to feelnthat the truth is irrelevant.,We call it "finding meaning,",but we might better callnit "forging meaning." 
 My last book was aboutnhow families manage to deal,with various kinds of challengingnor unusual offspring.,And one of the mothers I interviewed,,who had two childrennwith multiple severe disabilities,,said to me, "People always give usnthese little sayings like,,'God doesn't give younany more than you can handle.',But children like oursnare not preordained as a gift.,They're a gift,because that's what we have chosen." 
 We make those choices all our lives.,When I was in second grade,,Bobby Finkel had a birthday party,and invited everyone in our class but me.,My mother assumednthere had been some sort of error,,and she called Mrs. Finkel,,who said that Bobby didn't like menand didn't want me at his party.,And that day, my mom took me to the zoo,and out for a hot fudge sundae.,When I was in seventh grade,,one of the kids on my school busnnicknamed me "Percy,",as a shorthand for my demeanor.,And sometimes, he and his cohortnwould chant that provocation,the entire school bus ride,,45 minutes up, 45 minutes back:,"Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!",When I was in eighth grade,nour science teacher told us,that all male homosexualsndevelop fecal incontinence,because of the traumanto their anal sphincter.,And I graduated high schoolnwithout ever going to the cafeteria,,where I would have sat with the girlsnand been laughed at for doing so,,or sat with the boys,,and been laughed at for being a boynwho should be sitting with the girls. 
 I survived that childhoodnthrough a mix of avoidance and endurance.,What I didn't know then,and do know now,,is that avoidance and endurancencan be the entryway to forging meaning.,After you've forged meaning,,you need to incorporate that meaningninto a new identity.,You need to take the traumas,and make them partnof who you've come to be,,and you need to foldnthe worst events of your life,into a narrative of triumph,,evincing a better selfnin response to things that hurt. 
 One of the other mothers I interviewednwhen I was working on my book,had been raped as an adolescent,,and had a child following that rape,,which had thrown away her career plans,and damaged allnof her emotional relationships.,But when I met her, she was 50,,and I said to her,,"Do you often thinknabout the man who raped you?",And she said, "I used to thinknabout him with anger,,but now only with pity.",And I thought she meant pitynbecause he was so unevolved,as to have done this terrible thing.,And I said, "Pity?",And she said, "Yes,,because he has a beautiful daughternand two beautiful grandchildren,,and he doesn't know that,,and I do.,So as it turns out,,I'm the lucky one." 
 Some of our strugglesnare things we're born to:,our gender, our sexuality,nour race, our disability.,And some are things that happen to us:,being a political prisoner,nbeing a rape victim,,being a Katrina survivor.,Identity involves entering a community,to draw strength from that community,,and to give strength there, too.,It involves substitutingn"and" for "but" --,not "I am here but I have cancer,",but rather, "I have cancer and I am here." 
 When we're ashamed,nwe can't tell our stories,,and stories are the foundation,of identity.,Forge meaning,,build identity.,Forge meaning and build identity.,That became my mantra.,Forging meaningnis about changing yourself.,Building identitynis about changing the world.,All of us with stigmatized identitiesnface this question daily:,How much to accommodate societynby constraining ourselves,,and how much to break the limits,of what constitutes a valid life?,Forging meaning and building identity,does not make what was wrong right.,It only makes what was wrong precious. 
 In January of this year,,I went to Myanmarnto interview political prisoners,,and I was surprised to find themnless bitter than I'd anticipated.,Most of them had knowinglyncommitted the offenses,that landed them in prison,,and they had walked innwith their heads held high,,and they walked outnwith their heads still held high,,many years later.,Dr. Ma Thida, a leadingnhuman rights activist,who had nearly died in prison,and had spent many yearsnin solitary confinement,,told me she was grateful to her jailersnfor the time she had had to think,,for the wisdom she had gained,,for the chance to honenher meditation skills.,She had sought meaning,and made her travailninto a crucial identity.,But if the people I metnwere less bitter than I'd anticipated,about being in prison,,they were also less thrillednthan I'd expected,about the reform processngoing on in their country.,Ma Thida said,,"We Burmese are notednfor our tremendous grace under pressure,,but we also have grievance under glamour.",She said, "And the fact that therenhave been these shifts and changes,doesn't erase the continuingnproblems in our society,that we learned to see so wellnwhile we were in prison." 
 I understood her to be saying,that concessions confernonly a little humanity,where full humanity is due;,that crumbs are not the samenas a place at the table.,Which is to say,,you can forge meaning and build identity,and still be mad as hell. 
 I've never been raped,,and I've never been in anythingnremotely approaching a Burmese prison.,But as a gay American,,I've experienced prejudicenand even hatred,,and I've forged meaning,and I've built identity,,which is a move I learned from people,who had experienced far worse privationnthan I've ever known.,In my own adolescence,,I went to extreme lengthsnto try to be straight.,I enrolled myself in something calledn"sexual surrogacy therapy,",in which peoplenI was encouraged to call doctors,prescribed what I was encouragednto call exercises,with women I was encouragednto call surrogates,,who were not exactly prostitutes,but who were alsonnot exactly anything else. 
 (Laughter) 
 My particular favoritenwas a blonde woman from the Deep South,who eventually admitted to menthat she was really a necrophiliac,,and had taken this jobnafter she got in trouble,down at the morgue. 
 (Laughter) 
 These experiences eventuallynallowed me to have,some happy physicalnrelationships with women,,for which I'm grateful.,But I was at war with myself,,and I dug terrible woundsninto my own psyche. 
 We don't seek the painful experiences,that hew our identities,,but we seek our identities,in the wake of painful experiences.,We cannot bear a pointless torment,,but we can endure great pain,if we believe that it's purposeful.,Ease makes less of an impression on us,than struggle.,We could have been ourselvesnwithout our delights,,but not without the misfortunesnthat drive our search for meaning.,"Therefore, I takenpleasure in infirmities,",St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,,"for when I am weak, then I am strong." 
 In 1988, I went to Moscownto interview artists,of the Soviet underground.,I expected their worknto be dissident and political.,But the radicalism in their work,actually lay in reinsertingnhumanity into a society,that was annihilating humanity itself,,as, in some senses,nRussian society is now doing again.,One of the artists I met said to me,,"We were in training to bennot artists but angels." 
 In 1991, I went back to seenthe artists I'd been writing about,,and I was with them during the putschnthat ended the Soviet Union.,And they were among the chief organizersnof the resistance to that putsch.,And on the third day of the putsch,,one of them suggestednwe walk up to Smolenskaya.,And we went there,,and we arranged ourselvesnin front of one of the barricades,,and a little while later,,a column of tanks rolled up.,And the soldier on the front tank said,,"We have unconditional ordersnto destroy this barricade.,If you get out of the way,nwe don't need to hurt you.,But if you won't move, we'll havenno choice but to run you down.",The artist I was with said,n"Give us just a minute.,Give us just a minutento tell you why we're here.",And the soldier folded his arms,,and the artist launched intona Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy,such as those of us who livenin a Jeffersonian democracy,would be hard-pressed to present.,And they went on and on,,and the soldier watched.,And then he sat there for a full minutenafter they were finished,and looked at us,nso bedraggled in the rain,,and said, "What you have said is true,,and we must bow to the will of the people.,If you'll clear enough spacenfor us to turn around,,we'll go back the way we came.",And that's what they did.,Sometimes, forging meaningncan give you the vocabulary you need,to fight for your ultimate freedom. 
 Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion,that oppression breedsnthe power to oppose it.,And I gradually understood thatnas the cornerstone of identity.,It took identitynto rescue me from sadness.,The gay rights movement posits a world,in which my aberrances are a victory.,Identity politicsnalways works on two fronts:,to give pride to people who havena given condition or characteristic,,and to cause the outside worldnto treat such people,more gently and more kindly.,Those are two totallynseparate enterprises,,but progress in each spherenreverberates in the other.,Identity politics can be narcissistic.,People extol a differencenonly because it's theirs.,People narrow the worldnand function in discrete groups,without empathy for one another.,But properly understoodnand wisely practiced,,identity politics should expandnour idea of what it is to be human.,Identity itself should bennot a smug label or a gold medal,,but a revolution. 
 I would have had an easier lifenif I were straight,,but I would not be me.,And I now like being myself better,than the idea of being someone else,,someone who, to be honest,,I have neither the option of beingnnor the ability fully to imagine.,But if you banish the dragons,nyou banish the heroes,,and we become attachednto the heroic strain in our own lives.,I've sometimes wondered,whether I could have ceasednto hate that part of myself,without gay pride's technicolor fiesta,,of which this speech is one manifestation. 
 (Laughter) 
 I used to think I would knownmyself to be mature,when I could simply be gaynwithout emphasis.,But the self-loathingnof that period left a void,,and celebration needsnto fill and overflow it,,and even if I repaynmy private debt of melancholy,,there's still an outer world of homophobia,that it will take decades to address.,Someday, being gay will be a simple fact,,free of party hats and blame.,But not yet.,A friend of mine who thought gay pridenwas getting very carried away with itself,,once suggested that we organizenGay Humility Week. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 It's a great idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 But its time has not yet come. 
 (Laughter) 
 And neutrality, which seems to lienhalfway between despair and celebration,,is actually the endgame. 
 In 29 states in the US,,I could legally be fired or denied housing,for being gay.,In Russia, the anti-propaganda law,has led to people being beatennin the streets.,Twenty-seven African countriesnhave passed laws against sodomy.,And in Nigeria, gay peoplencan legally be stoned to death,,and lynchings have become common.,In Saudi Arabia recently,,two men who had been caught in carnal acts,were sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,,and are now permanentlyndisabled as a result.,So who can forge meaning,and build identity?,Gay rights are not primarilynmarriage rights,,and for the millions who livenin unaccepting places,with no resources,,dignity remains elusive.,I am lucky to have forged meaning,and built identity,,but that's still a rare privilege.,And gay people deserve more, collectively,,than the crumbs of justice. 
 And yet,,every step forward is so sweet.,In 2007, six years after we met,,my partner and I decided to get married.,Meeting John had been the discoverynof great happiness,and also the eliminationnof great unhappiness.,And sometimes, I was so occupiednwith the disappearance of all that pain,,that I forgot about the joy,,which was at firstnthe less remarkable part of it to me.,Marrying was a way to declare our love,as more a presence than an absence. 
 Marriage soon led us to children,,and that meant new meanings,and new identities -- ours and theirs.,I want my children to be happy,,and I love them most achinglynwhen they are sad.,As a gay father, I can teach themnto own what is wrong in their lives,,but I believe that if I succeednin sheltering them from adversity,,I will have failed as a parent.,A Buddhist scholar I knownonce explained to me,that Westerners mistakenly think,that nirvana is what arrivesnwhen all your woe is behind you,,and you have only blissnto look forward to.,But he said that would not be nirvana,,because your bliss in the present,would always be shadowednby the joy from the past.,Nirvana, he said, is what you arrive at,when you have only blissnto look forward to,and find in what looked like sorrowsnthe seedlings of your joy.,And I sometimes wonder,whether I could have foundnsuch fulfillment in marriage and children,if they'd come more readily,,if I'd been straight in my youthnor were young now,,in either of which casesnthis might be easier.,Perhaps I could.,Perhaps all the complexnimagining I've done,could have been applied to other topics.,But if seeking meaningnmatters more than finding meaning,,the question is not whethernI'd be happier for having been bullied,,but whether assigning meaningnto those experiences,has made me a better father.,I tend to find the ecstasynhidden in ordinary joys,,because I did not expect those joysnto be ordinary to me. 
 I know many heterosexuals who havenequally happy marriages and families,,but gay marriagenis so breathtakingly fresh,,and gay families so exhilaratingly new,,and I found meaning in that surprise. 
 In October, it was my 50th birthday,,and my family organized a party for me.,And in the middle of it,nmy son said to my husband,that he wanted to make a speech.,And John said,,"George, you can't makena speech. You're four." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Only Grandpa and Uncle David and Inare going to make speeches tonight.",But George insisted and insisted,,and finally, John took himnup to the microphone,,and George said very loudly,,"Ladies and gentlemen!,May I have your attention, please?",And everyone turned around, startled.,And George said,,"I'm glad it's daddy's birthday.,I'm glad we all get cake.,And Daddy, if you were little,,I'd be your friend." 
 (Gasp) 
 And I thought -- (Applause),Thank you.,I thought that I was indebtedneven to Bobby Finkel,,because all those earlier experiences,were what had propelled me to this moment,,and I was finally unconditionally grateful,for a life I'd once have donenanything to change. 
 The gay activist Harvey Milknwas once asked by a younger gay man,what he could do to help the movement,,and Harvey Milk said,,"Go out and tell someone.",There's always somebodynwho wants to confiscate our humanity.,And there are alwaysnstories that restore it.,If we live out loud,,we can trounce the hatred,,and expand everyone's lives. 
 Forge meaning.,Build identity.,Forge meaning.,Build identity.,And then invite the worldnto share your joy. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My job at Twitter,is to ensure user trust,,protect user rights and keep users safe,,both from each other,and, at times, from themselves.,Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.,Back in January 2009,,we saw more than two million new tweets each day,on the platform.,January 2014, more than 500 million.,We were seeing two million tweets,in less than six minutes.,That's a 24,900-percent increase. 
 Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter,puts no one in harm's way.,There's no risk involved.,My job is to root out and prevent activity that might.,Sounds straightforward, right?,You might even think it'd be easy,,given that I just said the vast majority,of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.,Why spend so much time,searching for potential calamities,in innocuous activities?,Given the scale that Twitter is at,,a one-in-a-million chance happens,500 times a day.,It's the same for other companies,dealing at this sort of scale.,For us, edge cases,,those rare situations that are unlikely to occur,,are more like norms.,Say 99.999 percent of tweets,pose no risk to anyone.,There's no threat involved.,Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks,like Australia's Heart Reef,,or tweeting about a concert they're attending,,or sharing pictures of cute baby animals.,After you take out that 99.999 percent,,that tiny percentage of tweets remaining,works out to roughly,150,000 per month.,The sheer scale of what we're dealing with,makes for a challenge. 
 You know what else makes my role,particularly challenging?,People do weird things.,(Laughter),And I have to figure out what they're doing,,why, and whether or not there's risk involved,,often without much in terms of context,or background.,I'm going to show you some examples,that I've run into during my time at Twitter --,these are all real examples —,of situations that at first seemed cut and dried,,but the truth of the matter was something,altogether different.,The details have been changed,to protect the innocent,and sometimes the guilty.,We'll start off easy. 
 ["Yo bitch"] 
 If you saw a Tweet that only said this,,you might think to yourself,,"That looks like abuse.",After all, why would younwant to receive the message,,"Yo, bitch.",Now, I try to stay relatively hip,to the latest trends and memes,,so I knew that "yo, bitch",was also often a common greeting between friends,,as well as being a popular "Breaking Bad" reference.,I will admit that I did not expect,to encounter a fourth use case.,It turns out it is also used on Twitter,when people are role-playing as dogs.,(Laughter),And in fact, in that case,,it's not only not abusive,,it's technically just an accurate greeting.,(Laughter) 
 So okay, determining whether or not,something is abusive without context,,definitely hard. 
 Let's look at spam.,Here's an example of an account engaged,in classic spammer behavior,,sending the exact same message,to thousands of people.,While this is a mockup I putntogether using my account,,we see accounts doing this all the time.,Seems pretty straightforward.,We should just automatically suspend accounts,engaging in this kind of behavior.,Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule.,Turns out that that messagencould also be a notification,you signed up for that the InternationalnSpace Station is passing overhead,because you wanted to go outside,and see if you could see it.,You're not going to get that chance,if we mistakenly suspend the account,thinking it's spam. 
 Okay. Let's make the stakes higher.,Back to my account,,again exhibiting classic behavior.,This time it's sending the same message and link.,This is often indicative of nsomething called phishing,,somebody trying to steal anothernperson's account information,by directing them to another website.,That's pretty clearly not a good thing.,We want to, and do, suspend accounts,engaging in that kind of behavior.,So why are the stakes higher for this?,Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally,who managed to record a video,of a police officer beating a non-violent protester,who's trying to let the world know what's happening.,We don't want to gamble,on potentially silencing that crucial speech,by classifying it as spam and suspending it.,That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters,when looking at account behaviors,,and even then, we can still get it wrong,and have to reevaluate. 
 Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against,,it's crucial that I not only predict,but also design protections for the unexpected.,And that's not just an issue for me,,or for Twitter, it's an issue for you.,It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating,something that you think is going to be amazing,and will let people do awesome things.,So what do I do?,I pause and I think,,how could all of this,go horribly wrong?,I visualize catastrophe.,And that's hard. There's a sort of,inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that,,like when you're writing your wedding vows,at the same time as your prenuptial agreement.,(Laughter),But you still have to do it,,particularly if you're marrying n500 million tweets per day.,What do I mean by "visualize catastrophe?",I try to think of how something as,benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat,could lead to death,,and what to do to prevent that.,Which happens to be my next example.,This is my cat, Eli.,We wanted to give users the ability,to add photos to their tweets.,A picture is worth a thousand words.,You only get 140 characters.,You add a photo to your tweet,,look at how much more content you've got now.,There's all sorts of great things you can do,by adding a photo to a tweet.,My job isn't to think of those.,It's to think of what could go wrong. 
 How could this picture,lead to my death?,Well, here's one possibility.,There's more in that picture than just a cat.,There's geodata.,When you take a picture with your smartphone,or digital camera,,there's a lot of additional information,saved along in that image.,In fact, this image also contains,the equivalent of this,,more specifically, this.,Sure, it's not likely that someone's going to try,to track me down and do me harm,based upon image data associated,with a picture I took of my cat,,but I start by assuming the worst will happen.,That's why, when we launched photos on Twitter,,we made the decision to strip that geodata out.,(Applause),If I start by assuming the worst,and work backwards,,I can make sure that the protections we build,work for both expected,and unexpected use cases. 
 Given that I spend my days and nights,imagining the worst that could happen,,it wouldn't be surprising if nmy worldview was gloomy.,(Laughter),It's not.,The vast majority of interactions I see --,and I see a lot, believe me -- are positive,,people reaching out to help,or to connect or share information with each other.,It's just that for those of us dealing with scale,,for those of us tasked with keeping people safe,,we have to assume the worst will happen,,because for us, a one-in-a-million chance,is pretty good odds. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We live in a very complex environment:,complexity and dynamism,and patterns of evidence,from satellite photographs, from videos.,You can even see it outside your window.,It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,,but the patterns kind of repeat,,but they never repeat exactly.,It's a huge challenge to understand.,The patterns that you see,are there at all of the different scales,,but you can't chop it into one little bit and say,,"Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate.",I can't use the normal products of reductionism,to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study,in a laboratory and say, "Oh,,now that's something I now understand.",It's the whole or it's nothing. 
 The different scales that give you,these kinds of patterns,range over an enormous range of magnitude,,roughly 14 orders of magnitude,,from the small microscopic particles,that seed clouds,to the size of the planet itself,,from 10 to the minus six,to 10 to the eight,,14 orders of spatial magnitude.,In time, from milliseconds to millennia,,again around 14 orders of magnitude. 
 What does that mean?,Okay, well if you think about how,you can calculate these things,,you can take what you can see,,okay, I'm going to chop it up,into lots of little boxes,,and that's the result of physics, right?,And if I think about a weather model,,that spans about five orders of magnitude,,from the planet to a few kilometers,,and the time scale,from a few minutes to 10 days, maybe a month.,We're interested in more than that.,We're interested in the climate.,That's years, that's millennia,,and we need to go to even smaller scales.,The stuff that we can't resolve,,the sub-scale processes,,we need to approximate in some way.,That is a huge challenge.,Climate models in the 1990s,took an even smaller chunk of that,,only about three orders of magnitude.,Climate models in the 2010s,,kind of what we're working with now,,four orders of magnitude.,We have 14 to go,,and we're increasing our capability,of simulating those at about,one extra order of magnitude every decade.,One extra order of magnitude in space,is 10,000 times more calculations.,And we keep adding more things,,more questions to these different models. 
 So what does a climate model look like?,This is an old climate model, admittedly,,a punch card, a single line of Fortran code.,We no longer use punch cards.,We do still use Fortran.,New-fangled ideas like C,really haven't had a big impact,on the climate modeling community. 
 But how do we go about doing it?,How do we go from that complexity that you saw,to a line of code?,We do it one piece at a time.,This is a picture of sea ice,taken flying over the Arctic.,We can look at all of the different equations,that go into making the ice grow,or melt or change shape.,We can look at the fluxes.,We can look at the rate at which,snow turns to ice, and we can code that.,We can encapsulate that in code.,These models are around,a million lines of code at this point,,and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code,every year. 
 So you can look at that piece,,but you can look at the other pieces too.,What happens when you have clouds?,What happens when clouds form,,when they dissipate, when they rain out?,That's another piece.,What happens when we have radiation,coming from the sun, going through the atmosphere,,being absorbed and reflected?,We can code each of thosenvery small pieces as well.,There are other pieces:,the winds changing the ocean currents.,We can talk about the role of vegetation,in transporting water from the soils,back into the atmosphere.,And each of these different elements,we can encapsulate and put into a system.,Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole. 
 And you get something like this.,You get a beautiful representation,of what's going on in the climate system,,where each and every one of those,emergent patterns that you can see,,the swirls in the Southern Ocean,,the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico,,and there's two more that are going to pop up,in the Pacific at any point now,,those rivers of atmospheric water,,all of those are emergent properties,that come from the interactions,of all of those small-scale processes I mentioned.,There's no code that says,,"Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean.",There's no code that says, "Have two,tropical cyclones that spin around each other.",All of those things are emergent properties. 
 This is all very good. This is all great.,But what we really want to know,is what happens to these emergent properties,when we kick the system?,When something changes, whatnhappens to those properties?,And there's lots of different ways to kick the system.,There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit,over hundreds of thousands of years,that change the climate.,There are changes in the solar cycles,,every 11 years and longer, that change the climate.,Big volcanoes go off and change the climate.,Changes in biomass burning, in smoke,,in aerosol particles, all of those things,change the climate.,The ozone hole changed the climate.,Deforestation changes the climate,by changing the surface properties,and how water is evaporated,and moved around in the system.,Contrails change the climate,by creating clouds where there were none before,,and of course greenhouse gases change the system. 
 Each of these different kicks,provides us with a target,to evaluate whether we understand,something about this system.,So we can go to look at,what model skill is.,Now I use the word "skill" advisedly:,Models are not right or wrong; they're always wrong.,They're always approximations.,The question you have to ask,is whether a model tells you more information,than you would have had otherwise.,If it does, it's skillful.,This is the impact of the ozone hole,on sea level pressure, sonlow pressure, high pressures,,around the southern oceans, around Antarctica.,This is observed data.,This is modeled data.,There's a good match,because we understand the physics,that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere,and what that does to the winds,around the southern oceans. 
 We can look at other examples.,The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991,put an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles,,into the stratosphere.,That changed the radiationnbalance of the whole planet.,There was less energy comingnin than there was before,,so that cooled the planet,,and those red lines and those green lines,,those are the differences between what we expected,and what actually happened.,The models are skillful,,not just in the global mean,,but also in the regional patterns. 
 I could go through a dozen more examples:,the skill associated with solar cycles,,changing the ozone in the stratosphere;,the skill associated with orbital changes,over 6,000 years.,We can look at that too, and the models are skillful.,The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets,20,000 years ago.,The models are skillful,when it comes to the 20th-century trends,over the decades.,Models are successful at modeling,lake outbursts into the North Atlantic,8,000 years ago.,And we can get a good match to the data. 
 Each of these different targets,,each of these different evaluations,,leads us to add more scope,to these models,,and leads us to more and more,complex situations that we can ask,more and more interesting questions,,like, how does dust from the Sahara,,that you can see in the orange,,interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic?,How do organic aerosols from biomass burning,,which you can see in the red dots,,intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns?,How does pollution, which you can see,in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe,,how does that affect thentemperatures at the surface,and the sunlight that you get at the surface? 
 We can look at this across the world.,We can look at the pollution from China.,We can look at the impacts of storms,on sea salt particles in the atmosphere.,We can see the combination,of all of these different things,happening all at once,,and we can ask much more interesting questions.,How do air pollution and climate coexist?,Can we change things,that affect air pollution andnclimate at the same time?,The answer is yes. 
 So this is a history of the 20th century.,The first one is the model.,The weather is a little bit different,to what actually happened.,The second one are the observations.,And we're going through the 1930s.,There's variability, there are things going on,,but it's all kind of in the noise.,As you get towards the 1970s,,things are going to start to change.,They're going to start to look more similar,,and by the time you get to the 2000s,,you're already seeing thenpatterns of global warming,,both in the observations and in the model. 
 We know what happened over the 20th century.,Right? We know that it's gotten warmer.,We know where it's gotten warmer.,And if you ask the models why did that happen,,and you say, okay, well, yes,,basically it's because of the carbon dioxide,we put into the atmosphere.,We have a very good match,up until the present day. 
 But there's one key reason why we look at models,,and that's because of this phrase here.,Because if we had observations of the future,,we obviously would trust them more than models,,But unfortunately,,observations of the futurenare not available at this time. 
 So when we go out into thenfuture, there's a difference.,The future is unknown, the future is uncertain,,and there are choices.,Here are the choices that we have.,We can do some work to mitigate,the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.,That's the top one.,We can do more work,to really bring it down,so that by the end of the century,,it's not much more than there is now.,Or we can just leave it to fate,and continue on,with a business-as-usual type of attitude.,The differences between these choices,can't be answered by looking at models. 
 There's a great phrase,that Sherwood Rowland,,who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry,that led to ozone depletion,,when he was accepting his Nobel Prize,,he asked this question:,"What is the use of having developed a science,well enough to make predictions if, in the end,,all we're willing to do is stand around,and wait for them to come true?",The models are skillful,,but what we do with theninformation from those models,is totally up to you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Looking deeply inside nature,,through the magnifying glass of science,,designers extract principles,nprocesses and materials,that are forming the very basisnof design methodology.,From synthetic constructsnthat resemble biological materials,,to computational methodsnthat emulate neural processes,,nature is driving design.,Design is also driving nature.,In realms of genetics, regenerativenmedicine and synthetic biology,,designers are growing novel technologies,,not foreseen or anticipated by nature. 
 Bionics explores the interplaynbetween biology and design.,As you can see, my legs are bionic.,Today, I will tell human storiesnof bionic integration;,how electromechanics attachednto the body, and implanted inside the body,are beginning to bridge the gapnbetween disability and ability,,between human limitationnand human potential. 
 Bionics has defined my physicality.,In 1982, both of my legs were amputated,due to tissue damage from frostbite,,incurred duringna mountain-climbing accident.,At that time, I didn'tnview my body as broken.,I reasoned that a human beingncan never be "broken.",Technology is broken.,Technology is inadequate.,This simple but powerful ideanwas a call to arms,,to advance technologynfor the elimination of my own disability,,and ultimately, the disability of others.,I began by developing specialized limbs,that allowed me to returnnto the vertical world,of rock and ice climbing.,I quickly realized that the artificialnpart of my body is malleable;,able to take on any form, any function --,a blank slate for which to create,,perhaps, structures that could extendnbeyond biological capability.,I made my height adjustable.,I could be as short as five feetnor as tall as I'd like. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when I was feeling bad about myself,,insecure, I would jack my height up. 
 (Laughter) 
 But when I was feelingnconfident and suave,,I would knock my height down a notch,njust to give the competition a chance. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Narrow-edged feet allowed mento climb steep rock fissures,,where the human foot cannot penetrate,,and spiked feet enabled mento climb vertical ice walls,,without ever experiencingnmuscle leg fatigue.,Through technological innovation,,I returned to my sport,nstronger and better.,Technology had eliminated my disability,,and allowed me a new climbing prowess.,As a young man, I imagined a future worldnwhere technology so advanced,could rid the world of disability,,a world in which neuralnimplants would allow,the visually impaired to see.,A world in which the paralyzedncould walk, via body exoskeletons. 
 Sadly, because ofndeficiencies in technology,,disability is rampant in the world.,This gentleman is missing three limbs.,As a testimony to current technology,nhe is out of the wheelchair,,but we need to do a better job in bionics,nto allow, one day, full rehabilitation,for a person with this level of injury.,At the MIT Media Lab, we've establishednthe Center for Extreme Bionics.,The mission of the centernis to put forth fundamental science,and technological capability,that will allow the biomechatronicnand regenerative repair of humans,,across a broad rangenof brain and body disabilities. 
 Today, I'm going to tell younhow my legs function, how they work,,as a case in point for this center.,Now, I made sure to shavenmy legs last night,,because I knew I'd be showing them off. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bionics entails the engineeringnof extreme interfaces.,There's three extremeninterfaces in my bionic limbs:,mechanical, how my limbsnare attached to my biological body;,dynamic, how they movenlike flesh and bone;,and electrical, how they communicatenwith my nervous system. 
 I'll begin with mechanical interface.,In the area of design,nwe still do not understand,how to attach devicesnto the body mechanically.,It's extraordinary to menthat in this day and age,,one of the most mature,noldest technologies,in the human timeline, the shoe,nstill gives us blisters.,How can this be?,We have no idea how to attachnthings to our bodies.,This is the beautifullynlyrical design work,of Professor Neri Oxmannat the MIT Media Lab,,showing spatially varyingnexoskeletal impedances,,shown here by color variationnin this 3D-printed model.,Imagine a future where clothingnis stiff and soft where you need it,,when you need it, for optimalnsupport and flexibility,,without ever causing discomfort. 
 My bionic limbs are attachednto my biological body,via synthetic skinsnwith stiffness variations,,that mirror my underlyingntissue biomechanics.,To achieve that mirroring, we firstndeveloped a mathematical model,of my biological limb.,To that end, we usednimaging tools such as MRI,,to look inside my body,,to figure out the geometriesnand locations of various tissues.,We also took robotic tools --,here's a 14-actuator circlenthat goes around the biological limb.,The actuators come in,nfind the surface of the limb,,measure its unloaded shape,,and then they push on the tissues,to measure tissue compliancesnat each anatomical point. 
 We combine these imaging and robotic data,to build a mathematical descriptionnof my biological limb, shown on the left.,You see a bunch of points, or nodes?,At each node, there's a colornthat represents tissue compliance.,We then do a mathematical transformationnto the design of the synthetic skin,,shown on the right.,And we've discovered optimality is:,where the body is stiff,nthe synthetic skin should be soft,,where the body is soft,nthe synthetic skin is stiff,,and this mirroring occursnacross all tissue compliances.,With this framework,nwe've produced bionic limbs,that are the most comfortablenlimbs I've ever worn.,Clearly, in the future, our clothing,nour shoes, our braces, our prostheses,,will no longer be designednand manufactured using artisan strategies,,but rather, data-drivennquantitative frameworks.,In that future, our shoesnwill no longer give us blisters. 
 We're also embeddingnsensing and smart materials,into the synthetic skins.,This is a material developednby SRI International, California.,Under electrostatic effect,nit changes stiffness.,So under zero voltage,nthe material is compliant,,it's floppy like paper.,Then the button's pushed,na voltage is applied,,and it becomes stiff as a board. 
 (Tapping sounds) 
 We embed this materialninto the synthetic skin,that attaches my bionic limbnto my biological body.,When I walk here, it's no voltage.,My interface is soft and compliant.,The button's pushed,nvoltage is applied, and it stiffens,,offering me a greater maneuverabilitynover the bionic limb. 
 We're also building exoskeletons.,This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft,in just the right areasnof the running cycle,,to protect the biological jointsnfrom high impacts and degradation.,In the future, we'll allnbe wearing exoskeletons,in common activities, such as running. 
 Next, dynamic interface.,How do my bionic limbsnmove like flesh and bone?,At my MIT lab, we study how humansnwith normal physiologies,stand, walk and run.,What are the muscles doing,,and how are they controllednby the spinal cord?,This basic sciencenmotivates what we build.,We're building bionic ankles,nknees and hips.,We're building body partsnfrom the ground up.,The bionic limbs that I'm wearingnare called BiOMs.,They've been fittednto nearly 1,000 patients,,400 of which have beennwounded U.S. soldiers. 
 How does it work? 
 At heel strike, under computer control,,the system controls stiffness,,to attenuate the shocknof the limb hitting the ground.,Then at mid-stance, the bionic limbnoutputs high torques and powers,to lift the personninto the walking stride,,comparable to how musclesnwork in the calf region.,This bionic propulsion is very importantnclinically to patients.,So on the left, you seenthe bionic device worn by a lady,,on the right, a passive devicenworn by the same lady,,that fails to emulatennormal muscle function,,enabling her to do somethingneveryone should be able to do:,go up and down their steps at home.,Bionics also allowsnfor extraordinary athletic feats.,Here's a gentleman runningnup a rocky pathway.,This is Steve Martin --nnot the comedian --,who lost his legs in a bomb blastnin Afghanistan. 
 We're also building exoskeletalnstructures using these same principles,,that wrap around the biological limb.,This gentleman does not havenany leg condition, any disability.,He has a normal physiology,,so these exoskeletons are applyingnmuscle-like torques and powers,,so that his own muscles need notnapply those torques and powers.,This is the first exoskeleton in historynthat actually augments human walking.,It significantly reduces metabolic cost.,It's so profound in its augmentation,,that when a normal, healthy personnwears the device for 40 minutes,and then takes it off,,their own biological legs feelnridiculously heavy and awkward.,We're beginning the age in whichnmachines attached to our bodies,will make us strongernand faster and more efficient. 
 Moving on to electrical interface:,How do my bionic limbs communicatenwith my nervous system?,Across my residual limb are electrodes,that measure the electricalnpulse of my muscles.,That's communicated to the bionic limb,,so when I think about movingnmy phantom limb,,the robot tracks those movement desires.,This diagram shows fundamentallynhow the bionic limb is controlled.,So we model the missing biological limb,,and we've discoverednwhat reflexes occurred,,how the reflexes of the spinal cordnare controlling the muscles.,And that capability is embeddednin the chips of the bionic limb.,What we've done, then, is we modulatenthe sensitivity of the reflex,,the modeled spinal reflex,nwith the neural signal,,so when I relax my musclesnin my residual limb,,I get very little torque and power,,but the more I fire my muscles,nthe more torque I get,,and I can even run.,And that was the first demonstrationnof a running gait under neural command.,Feels great. 
 (Applause) 
 We want to go a step further.,We want to actually close the loop,between the humannand the bionic external limb.,We're doing experiments,where we're growing nerves,ntransected nerves,,through channels, or micro-channel arrays.,On the other side of the channel,,the nerve then attaches to cells,,skin cells and muscle cells.,In the motor channels, we can sensenhow the person wishes to move.,That can be sent out wirelesslynto the bionic limb,,then [sensory information]non the bionic limb,can be converted to stimulationsnin adjacent channels,,sensory channels.,So when this is fully developednand for human use,,persons like myself will not only have,synthetic limbs that movenlike flesh and bone,,but actually feel like flesh and bone. 
 This video shows Lisa Mallette,,shortly after being fittednwith two bionic limbs.,Indeed, bionics is makingna profound difference in people's lives. 
 (Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.,LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it! 
 (Video) (Laughter) 
 LM: It's just like I've got a real leg! 
 Woman: Now, don't start running. 
 Man: Now turn around,nand do the same thing walking up,,but get on your heel to toe, like younwould normally just walk on level ground.,Try to walk right up the hill. 
 LM: Oh my God. 
 Man: Is it pushing you up? 
 LM: Yes! I'm not even --nI can't even describe it. 
 Man: It's pushing you right up. 
 Hugh Herr: Next week,nI'm visiting the Center -- 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Next week I'm visiting the Centernfor Medicare and Medicaid Services,,and I'm going to try to convince CMS,to grant appropriatencode language and pricing,,so this technology can be made availablento the patients that need it. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 It's not well appreciated,nbut over half of the world's population,suffers from some form of cognitive,nemotional, sensory or motor condition,,and because of poor technology,ntoo often, conditions result in disability,and a poorer quality of life.,Basic levels of physiological functionnshould be a part of our human rights.,Every person should have the rightnto live life without disability,if they so choose --,the right to live lifenwithout severe depression;,the right to see a loved one,nin the case of seeing-impaired;,or the right to walk or to dance,,in the case of limb paralysisnor limb amputation.,As a society, we cannachieve these human rights,,if we accept the propositionnthat humans are not disabled.,A person can never be broken.,Our built environment, our technologies,,are broken and disabled.,We the people need notnaccept our limitations,,but can transcend disabilitynthrough technological innovation.,Indeed, through fundamental advancesnin bionics in this century,,we will set the technological foundationnfor an enhanced human experience,,and we will end disability. 
 I'd like to finish upnwith one more story, a beautiful story.,The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.,Adrianne lost her left legnin the Boston terrorist attack.,I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,nat Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.,Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer. 
 Adrianne breathes and lives dance.,It is her expression. It is her art form.,Naturally, when she lost her limbnin the Boston terrorist attack,,she wanted to return to the dance floor. 
 After meeting hernand driving home in my car,,I thought, I'm an MIT professor.nI have resources.,Let's build her a bionic limb,,to enable her to go backnto her life of dance.,I brought in MIT scientistsnwith expertise in prosthetics,,robotics, machine learningnand biomechanics,,and over a 200-day research period,nwe studied dance.,We brought in dancersnwith biological limbs,,and we studied how they move,,what forces they apply on the dance floor,,and we took those data,,and we put forthnfundamental principles of dance,,reflexive dance capability,,and we embedded that intelligenceninto the bionic limb.,Bionics is not only about makingnpeople stronger and faster.,Our expression, our humanityncan be embedded into electromechanics. 
 It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blastsnin the Boston terrorist attack.,In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowardsntook Adrianne off the dance floor.,In 200 days, we put her back.,We will not be intimidated, brought down,ndiminished, conquered or stopped,by acts of violence. 
 (Applause) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, please allow mento introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,,her first performance since the attack.,She's dancing with Christian Lightner.

 (Applause)TED is 30.,The world wide web is celebrating this month,its 25th anniversary.,So I've got a question for you.,Let's talk about the journey, mainly about the future.,Let's talk about the state.,Let's talk about what sort of a web we want. 
 So 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.,I got permission in the end after about a year,to basically do it as a side project.,I wrote the code.,I was I suppose the first user.,There was a lot of concern,that people didn't want to pick it up,because it would be too complicated.,A lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful,collaboration with other people,,and bit by bit, it worked.,It took off. It was pretty cool.,And in fact, a few years later in 2000,,five percent of the world population,were using the world wide web.,In 2007, seven years later, 17 percent.,In 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation,partly to look at that,and worry about that figure.,And now here we are in 2014,,and 40 percent of the world,are using the world wide web, and counting.,Obviously it's increasing. 
 I want you to think about both sides of that.,Okay, obviously to anybody here at TED,,the first question you ask is, what can we do,to get the other 60 percent on board,as quickly as possible?,Lots of important things. Obviouslynit's going to be around mobile.,But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent,,because if you're sitting there yourself,sort of with a web-enabled life,,you don't remember things anymore,,you just look them up,,then you may feel that it's been a success,and we can all sit back.,But in fact, yeah, it's been a success,,there's lots of things, Khan Academy,for crying out loud, there's Wikipedia,,there's a huge number of free e-books,that you can read online,,lots of wonderful things for education,,things in many areas.,Online commerce has in some cases,completely turned upside down thenway commerce works altogether,,made types of commerce available,which weren't available at all before.,Commerce has been almost universally affected.,Government, not universally affected,,but very affected, and on a good day,,lots of open data, lots of e-government,,so lots of things which are visible,happening on the web. 
 Also, lots of things which are less visible.,The healthcare, late at night when they're worried,about what sort of cancer,somebody they care about might have,,when they just talk across the Internet to somebody,who they care about very much in another country.,Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there,,and in fact they've acquiredna certain amount of privacy.,So we cannot assume that part of the web,,part of the deal with the web,,is when I use the web,,it's just a transparent, neutral medium.,I can talk to you over it without worrying,about what we in fact now know is happening,,without worrying about the fact,that not only will surveillance be happening,but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data.,So in fact, something we realized,,we can't just use the web,,we have to worry about,what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing,,is it in fact of a quality that we need?,We revel in the fact that wenhave this wonderful free speech.,We can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people,can see our tweets, except when they can't,,except when actually Twitternis blocked from their country,,or in some way the way we try to express ourselves,has put some informationnabout the state of ourselves,,the state of the country we live in,,which isn't available to anybody else.,So we must protest and make sure,that censorship is cut down,,that the web is opened up,where there is censorship. 
 We love the fact that the web is open.,It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody.,It doesn't matter who we are.,And then we join these big,social networking companies,which are in fact effectively built as silos,,so that it's much easier to talk to somebody,in the same social network,than it is to talk to somebody in a different one,,so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves.,And we also have, if you've readnthe book about the filter bubble,,the filter bubble phenomenon is that,we love to use machines,which help us find stuff we like.,So we love it when we're bathed in,what things we like to click on,,and so the machine automatically feeds us,the stuff that we like and we end up,with this rose-colored spectacles view of the world,called a filter bubble.,So here are some of the things which maybe,threaten the social web we have. 
 What sort of web do you want?,I want one which is notnfragmented into lots of pieces,,as some countries have been suggesting,they should do in reaction to recent surveillance.,I want a web which has got, for example,,is a really good basis for democracy.,I want a web where I can use healthcare,with privacy and where there's a lot,of health data, clinical data is available,to scientists to do research.,I want a web where the other 60 percent,get on board as fast as possible.,I want a web which is suchna powerful basis for innovation,that when something nasty happens,,some disaster strikes, that we can respond,by building stuff to respond to it very quickly. 
 So this is just some of the things that I want,,from a big list, obviously it's longer.,You have your list.,I want us to use this 25th anniversary,to think about what sort of a web we want.,You can go to webat25.org,and find some links.,There are lots of sites where people,have started to put together a Magna Carta,,a bill of rights for the web.,How about we do that?,How about we decide, these are, in a way,,becoming fundamental rights, the rightnto communicate with whom I want.,What would be on your list for that Magna Carta?,Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta,for the web.,Let's do that this year.,Let's use the energy from the 25th anniversary,to crowdsource a Magna Carta,to the web. (Applause) 
 Thank you. And do me a favor, will you?,Fight for it for me. Okay? Thanks. 
 (Applause)On November 5th, 1990,,a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked,into a hotel in Manhattan,and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,,the leader of the Jewish Defense League.,Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,,but while serving time on lesser charges,,he and other men began planning attacks,on a dozen New York City landmarks,,including tunnels, synagogues,and the United Nations headquarters.,Thankfully, those plans were foiled,by an FBI informant.,Sadly, the 1993 bombing,of the World Trade Center was not.,Nosair would eventually be convicted,for his involvement in the plot.,El-Sayyid Nosair is my father. 
 I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,,and a loving American mothernand grade school teacher,,who together tried their best,to create a happy childhood for me.,It wasn't until I was seven years old,that our family dynamic started to change.,My father exposed me to a side of Islam,that few people, including the majority of Muslims,,get to see.,It's been my experience that when people,take the time to interact with one another,,it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,,we all want the same things out of life.,However, in every religion, in every population,,you'll find a small percentage of people,who hold so fervently to their beliefs,that they feel they must use any means necessary,to make others live as they do. 
 A few months prior to his arrest,,he sat me down and explained that,for the past few weekends, he and some friends,had been going to a shooting range on Long Island,for target practice.,He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.,We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,,which unbeknownst to our group was being watched,by the FBI.,When it was my turn to shoot,,my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder,and explained how to aim at the target,about 30 yards off.,That day, the last bullet I shot,hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target,and to everyone's surprise, especially mine,,the entire target burst into flames.,My uncle turned to the other men,,and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh.",Like father, like son.,They all seemed to get a reallynbig laugh out of that comment,,but it wasn't until a few years later,that I fully understood whatnthey thought was so funny.,They thought they saw in me the same destruction,my father was capable of.,Those men would eventually be convicted,of placing a van filled withn1,500 pounds of explosives,into the sub-level parking lot of thenWorld Trade Center's North Tower,,causing an explosion that killed six people,and injured over 1,000 others.,These were the men I looked up to.,These were the men I callednammu, which means uncle. 
 By the time I turned 19,,I had already moved 20 times in my life,,and that instability during my childhood,didn't really provide an opportunity,to make many friends.,Each time I would begin to feelncomfortable around someone,,it was time to pack up and move to the next town.,Being the perpetual new face in class,,I was frequently the target of bullies.,I kept my identity a secret from my classmates,to avoid being targeted,,but as it turns out, being thenquiet, chubby new kid in class,was more than enough ammunition.,So for the most part, I spent my time at home,reading books and watching TV,or playing video games.,For those reasons, my social skills were lacking,,to say the least,,and growing up in a bigoted household,,I wasn't prepared for the real world.,I'd been raised to judge people,based on arbitrary measurements,,like a person's race or religion. 
 So what opened my eyes?,One of my first experiences,that challenged this way of thinking,was during the 2000 presidential elections.,Through a college prep program,,I was able to take part,in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.,My particular group's focus was on youth violence,,and having been the victimnof bullying for most of my life,,this was a subject in whichnI felt particularly passionate.,The members of our group camenfrom many different walks of life.,One day toward the end of the convention,,I found out that one of the kids I had befriended,was Jewish.,Now, it had taken several days,for this detail to come to light,,and I realized that there was no natural animosity,between the two of us.,I had never had a Jewish friend before,,and frankly I felt a sense of pride,in having been able to overcome a barrier,that for most of my life I had been led to believe,was insurmountable.,Another major turning point came when,I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,,an amusement park.,There, I was exposed to peoplenfrom all sorts of faiths and cultures,,and that experience proved to be fundamental,to the development of my character.,Most of my life, I'd been taught,that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,,that all gay people were a negative influence.,As chance would have it, I had the opportunity,to work with some of the gay performers,at a show there,,and soon found that many were the kindest,,least judgmental people I had ever met.,Being bullied as a kid,created a sense of empathy in me,toward the suffering of others,,and it comes very unnaturally to me,to treat people who are kind,in any other way than hownI would want to be treated.,Because of that feeling, I was able,to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child,with real life experience and interaction.,I don't know what it's like to be gay,,but I'm well acquainted with being judged,for something that's beyond my control. 
 Then there was "The Daily Show.",On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me,to be intellectually honest withnmyself about my own bigotry,and helped me to realize that a person's race,,religion or sexual orientation,had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.,He was in many ways a father figure to me,when I was in desperate need of one.,Inspiration can often comenfrom an unexpected place,,and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more,to positively influence my worldview,than my own extremist father,is not lost on me. 
 One day, I had a conversation with my mother,about how my worldview was starting to change,,and she said something to me,that I will hold dear to my heart,for as long as I live.,She looked at me with the weary eyes,of someone who had experienced,enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,,"I'm tired of hating people.",In that instant, I realized how much negative energy,it takes to hold that hatred inside of you. 
 Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.,I changed it when my family decided,to end our connection with my father,and start a new life.,So why would I out myself,and potentially put myself in danger?,Well, that's simple.,I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday,who is compelled to use violence,may hear my story and realize,that there is a better way,,that although I had been subjected,to this violent, intolerant ideology,,that I did not become fanaticized.,Instead, I choose to use my experience,to fight back against terrorism,,against the bigotry.,I do it for the victims of terrorism,and their loved ones,,for the terrible pain and loss,that terrorism has forced upon their lives.,For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out,against these senseless acts,and condemn my father's actions.,And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof,that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,,and the son does not have to follow,the ways of his father.,I am not my father. 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 Thank you, everybody. (Applause) 
 Thank you all. (Applause) 
 Thanks a lot. (Applause)My grandfather was a cobbler.,Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes.,I never got to meet him.,He perished in the Holocaust.,But I did inherit his love for making,,except that it doesn't exist that much anymore.,You see, while the Industrial Revolution,did a great deal to improve humanity,,it eradicated the very skill,that my grandfather loved,,and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. 
 But all of that is about to change with 3D printing,,and it all started with this,,the very first part,that was ever printed.,It's a little older than TED.,It was printed in 1983,by Chuck Hull,,who invented 3D printing.,But the thing that I want to talk to you about today,,the big idea that I want to discuss with you,,is not that 3D printing,is going to catapult us into the future,,but rather that it's actually going,to connect us with our heritage,,and it's going to usher in a new era,of localized, distributed manufacturing,that is actually based,on digital fabrication. 
 So think about useful things.,You all know your shoe size.,How many of you know the size,of the bridge of your nose,or the distance between your temples?,Anybody?,Wouldn't it be awesome if you could,,for the first time, get eyewear,that actually fits you perfectly,and doesn't require any hinge assembly,,so chances are, the hinges are not going to break?,But the implications of 3D printing,go well beyond the tips of our noses. 
 When I met Amanda for the first time,,she could already stand up and walk a little bit,even though she was paralyzed from the waist down,,but she complained to me that her suit,was uncomfortable.,It was a beautiful robotic suit,made by Ekso Bionics,,but it wasn't inspired by her body.,It wasn't made to measure.,So she challenged me to make her something,that was a little bit more feminine,,a little bit more elegant,,and lightweight,,and like good tailors,,we thought that we would measure her digitally.,And we did. We built her an amazing suit. 
 The incredible part about what I learned,from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing,and we say to ourselves,,it's going to replace traditional methods.,Amanda looked at it and she said,,it's an opportunity for me,to reclaim my symmetry,and to embrace my authenticity.,And you know what? She's not standing still.,She now wants to walk in high heels. 
 It doesn't stop there.,3D printing is changing,personalized medical devices as we know them,,from new, beautiful, conformal,,ventilated scoliosis braces,to millions of dental restorations,and to beautiful bracings,for amputees,,another opportunity to emotionally reconnect,with your symmetry.,And as we sit here today,,you can go wireless on your braces,with clear aligners,,or your dental restorations.,Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids,are already 3D printed today.,Millions of people are served today,from these devices.,What about full knee replacements,,from your data, made to measure,,where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed?,G.E. is using 3D printing,to make the next generation LEAP engine,that will save fuel to the tune,of about 15 percent,and cost for an airline,of about 14 million dollars.,Good for G.E., right?,And their customers and the environment.,But, you know, the even better news,is that this technology is no longer reserved,for deep-pocketed corporations.,Planetary Resources, a startup,for space explorations,is going to put out its first nspace probe later this year.,It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,,it costs a fraction of its cost,,and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,,and it's going to be out in space later this year.,Google is taking on this very audacious project,of making the block phone, the Ara.,It's only possible because of the development,of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time,will make functional, usable modules,that will go into it.,A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. 
 How about food?,What if we could, for the first time,,make incredible delectables,like this beautiful TED Teddy here,,that are edible?,What if we could completelynchange the experience,,like you see with that absinthe serving,that is completely 3D printed?,And what if we could begin to put ingredients,and colors and flavors in every taste,,which means not only delicious foods,but the promise of personalized nutrition,around the corner? 
 And that gets me to one of thenbiggest deals about 3D printing.,With 3D printing, complexity is free.,The printer doesn't care,if it makes the most rudimentary shape,or the most complex shape,,and that is completely turning design,and manufacturing on its head as we know it.,Many people think that 3D printing will be,the end of manufacturing as we know it.,I think that it's the opportunity to put,tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters,that will create endless abundance,of job opportunities,,and with that,,everybody can become an expert maker,and an expert manufacturer.,That will take new tools.,Not everybody knows how to use CAD,,so we're developing haptics,,perceptual devices,that will allow you to touch,and feel your designs,as if you play with digital clay.,When you do things like that,,and we also developed things that take,physical photographs that are instantly printable,,it will make it easier to create content,,but with all of the unimagined,,we will also have the unintended,,like democratized counterfeiting,and ubiquitous illegal possession. 
 So many people ask me,,will we have a 3D printer in every home?,I think it's the wrong question to ask.,The right question to ask is,,how will 3D printing change my life?,Or, in other words, what room in my house,will 3D printing fit in? 
 So everything that you see here,has been 3D printed,,including these shoes,at the Amsterdam fashion show.,Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes.,These are shoes that represent,the continuation of his passion,for hyper-local manufacturing.,My grandfather didn't get to see Nike,printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl,,and my father didn't get to see me standing,in my hybridized 3D printed shoes.,He passed away three years ago.,But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all,,is right here in the house today,,and thanks to him,,I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say,that I am a cobbler too,,and by standing in these shoes,I am honoring my past,while manufacturing the future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Why does the universe exist?,Why is there — Okay. Okay. (Laughter),This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.,Why is there a world, why are we in it,,and why is there something rather than nothing at all?,I mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question? 
 So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,,the puzzle of existence,,where we are now in addressing it,,and why you should care,,and I hope you do care.,The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that,those who don't wonder aboutnthe contingency of their existence,,of the contingency of the world's existence,,are mentally deficient.,That's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter),So this has been called the most sublime,and awesome mystery,,the deepest and most far-reaching question,man can pose.,It's obsessed great thinkers.,Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest,philosopher of the 20th century,,was astonished that there should be a world at all.,He wrote in his "Tractatus," Proposition 4.66,,"It is not how things are in the world,that is the mystical,,it's that the world exists.",And if you don't like taking your epigrams,from a philosopher, try a scientist.,John Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists,of the 20th century,,the teacher of Richard Feynman,,the coiner of the term "black hole,",he said, "I want to know,how come the quantum,,how come the universe, how come existence?",And my friend Martin Amis —,sorry that I'll be doing a lot ofnname-dropping in this talk,,so get used to it —,my dear friend Martin Amis once said,that we're about five Einsteins away from answering,the mystery of where the universe came from.,And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins,in the audience tonight.,Any Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?,No Einsteins? Okay. 
 So this question, why is therensomething rather than nothing,,this sublime question, was posed rather late,in intellectual history.,It was towards the end of the 17th century,,the philosopher Leibniz who asked it,,a very smart guy, Leibniz,,who invented the calculus,independently of Isaac Newton,nat about the same time,,but for Leibniz, who asked why isnthere something rather than nothing,,this was not a great mystery.,He either was or pretended to be,an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,,and he said it's obvious why the world exists:,because God created it.,And God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.,That's how powerful God is.,He doesn't need any preexistingnmaterials to fashion a world out of.,He can make it out of sheer nothingness,,creation ex nihilo.,And by the way, this is what,most Americans today believe.,There is no mystery of existence for them.,God made it. 
 So let's put this in an equation.,I don't have any slides sonI'm going to mime my visuals,,so use your imaginations.,So it's God + nothing = the world.,Okay? Now that's the equation.,And so maybe you don't believe in God.,Maybe you're a scientific atheist,or an unscientific atheist,nand you don't believe in God,,and you're not happy with it.,By the way, even if we have this equation,,God + nothing = the world,,there's already a problem:,Why does God exist?,God doesn't exist by logic alone,unless you believe the ontological argument,,and I hope you don't, becausenit's not a good argument.,So it's conceivable, if God were to exist,,he might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,,but where did I come from?,(Laughter),Whence then am I?,God speaks in a more formal English.,(Laughter),And so one theory is that God was so bored with,pondering the puzzle of His own existence,that He created the world just to distract himself.,But anyway, let's forget about God.,Take God out of the equation: We have,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ + nothing = the world.,Now, if you're a Buddhist,,you might want to stop right there,,because essentially what you've got is,nothing = the world,,and by symmetry of identity, that means,the world = nothing. Okay?,And to a Buddhist, the worldnis just a whole lot of nothing.,It's just a big cosmic vacuity.,And we think there's a lot of something out there,but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.,If we let our desires melt away,,we'll see the world for what it truly is,,a vacuity, nothingness,,and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana,which has been defined as having,just enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter) 
 So that's the Buddhist thinking.,But I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned,with the puzzle of existence, so I've got,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ + —,this is going to get serious in a minute, so —,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ + nothing = the world.,What are we going to put in that blank?,Well, how about science?,Science is our best guide to the nature of reality,,and the most fundamental science is physics.,That tells us what naked reality really is,,that reveals what I call TAUFOTU,,the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.,So maybe physics can fill this blank,,and indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,,physicists have purported to give,a purely scientific explanation of how,a universe like ours could have popped into existence,out of sheer nothingness,,a quantum fluctuation out of the void.,Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists,,more recently Alex Vilenkin,,and the whole thing has been popularized,by another very fine physicist and friend of mine,,Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called,"A Universe from Nothing,",and Lawrence thinks that he's given —,he's a militant atheist, by the way,,so he's gotten God out of the picture.,The laws of quantum field theory,,the state-of-the-art physics, can show how,out of sheer nothingness,,no space, no time, no matter, nothing,,a little nugget of false vacuum,can fluctuate into existence,,and then, by the miracle of inflation,,blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos,we see around us. 
 Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario.,It's very speculative. It's fascinating.,But I've got a big problem with it,,and the problem is this:,It's a pseudo-religious point of view.,Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,,but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.,He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.,The laws of quantum field theory for him,are like fiat lux, "Let there be light.",The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout,that they can form the abyss,,that it's pregnant with being.,They can call a world into existence out of nothing.,But that's a very primitive view of what,a physical law is, right?,We know that physical laws are actually,generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities,in the world.,They don't exist outside the world.,They don't have any ontic cloud of their own.,They can't call a world into existence,out of nothingness.,That's a very primitive view,of what a scientific law is.,And if you don't believe me on this,,listen to Stephen Hawking,,who himself put forward a model of the cosmos,that was self-contained,,didn't require any outside cause, any creator,,and after proposing this,,Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled.,He said, this model is just equations.,What breathes fire into the equations,and creates a world for them to describe?,He was puzzled by this,,so equations themselves can't do the magic,,can't resolve the puzzle of existence.,And besides, even if the laws could do that,,why this set of laws?,Why quantum field theory that describes,a universe with a certain number of forces,and particles and so forth?,Why not a completely different set of laws?,There are many, many mathematicallynconsistent sets of laws.,Why not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness? 
 So this is a problem, believe it or not,,that reflective physicists really think a lot about,,and at this point they tend to go metaphysical,,say, well, maybe the set of laws,that describes our universe,,it's just one set of laws,and it describes one part of reality,,but maybe every consistent set of laws,describes another part of reality,,and in fact all possible physical worlds,really exist, they're all out there.,We just see a little tiny part of reality,that's described by the laws of quantum field theory,,but there are many, many other worlds,,parts of reality that are described,by vastly different theories,that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,,that are inconceivably exotic.,Steven Weinberg, the father,of the standard model of particle physics,,has actually flirted with this idea himself,,that all possible realities actually exist.,Also, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,,who believes that all mathematical structures exist,,and mathematical existence is the same thing,as physical existence,,so we have this vastly rich multiverse,that encompasses every logical possibility. 
 Now, in taking this metaphysical way out,,these physicists and also philosophers are actually,reaching back to a very old idea,that goes back to Plato.,It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,,or the great chain of being,,that reality is actually as full as possible.,It's as far removed from nothingness,as it could possibly be. 
 So we have these two extremes now.,We have sheer nothingness on one side,,and we have this vision of a reality,that encompasses every conceivable world,at the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,,nothingness, the simplest possible reality.,Now what's in between these two extremes?,There are all kinds of intermediate realities,that include some things and leave out others.,So one of these intermediate realities,is, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,,that leaves out the inelegant bits,,the ugly asymmetries and so forth.,Now, there are some physicists who will tell you,that we're actually living in the most elegant reality.,I think that Brian Greene is in the audience,,and he has written a bookncalled "The Elegant Universe.",He claims that the universe we live in mathematically,is very elegant.,Don't believe him. (Laughter),It's a pious hope, I wish it were true,,but I think the other day he admitted to me,it's really an ugly universe.,It's stupidly constructed,,it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants,and mass ratios,and superfluous families of elementary particles,,and what the hell is dark energy?,It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.,It's not an elegant universe. (Laughter),And then there's the best of all possible worlds,in an ethical sense.,You should get solemn now,,because a world in which sentient beings,don't suffer needlessly,,in which there aren't things like,childhood cancer or the Holocaust.,This is an ethical conception.,Anyway, so between nothingness,and the fullest possible reality,,various special realities.,Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.,Then there's the most elegant possible reality.,That's special.,The fullest possible reality, that's special. 
 But what are we leaving out here?,There's also just the crummy,,generic realities,that aren't special in any way,,that are sort of random.,They're infinitely removed from nothingness,,but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.,They're a mixture of chaos and order,,of mathematical elegance and ugliness.,So I would describe these realities,as an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,,a generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.,And these realities,,is there a deity in any of these realities?,Maybe, but the deity isn't perfect,like the Judeo-Christian deity.,The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.,It might be instead 100 percent malevolent,but only 80 percent effective,,which pretty much describes the worldnwe see around us, I think. (Laughter),So I would like to propose that the resolution,to the mystery of existence,is that the reality we exist in,is one of these generic realities.,Reality has to turn out some way.,It can either turn out to be nothing,or everything or something in between.,So if it has some special feature,,like being really elegant or really full,or really simple, like nothingness,,that would require an explanation.,But if it's just one of these random, generic realities,,there's no further explanation for it.,And indeed, I would say,that's the reality we live in.,That's what science is telling us.,At the beginning of the week,,we got the exciting information that,the theory of inflation, which predicts a big,,infinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,,it's like a big frothing champagne,coming out of a bottle endlessly,,a vast universe, mostly a wasteland,with little pockets of charm and order and peace,,this has been confirmed,,this inflationary scenario, by the observations,made by radio telescopes in Antarctica,that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves,from just before the Big Bang.,I'm sure you all know about this.,So anyway, I think there's some evidence,that this really is the reality that we're stuck with. 
 Now, why should you care?,Well — (Laughter) —,the question, "Why does the world exist?",that's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes,with a more intimate question:,Why do I exist? Why do you exist?,you know, our existence wouldnseem to be amazingly improbable,,because there's an enormous numbernof genetically possible humans,,if you can compute it by looking at,the number of the genes and thennumber of alleles and so forth,,and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you,there are about 10 to the 10,000th,possible humans, genetically.,That's between a googol and a googolplex.,And the number of the actualnhumans that have existed,is 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,,an infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,,we've won this amazing cosmic lottery.,We're here. Okay. 
 So what kind of reality do we want to live in?,Do we want to live in a special reality?,What if we were living in thenmost elegant possible reality?,Imagine the existential pressure on us,to live up to that, to be elegant,,not to pull down the tone of it.,Or, what if we were livingnin the fullest possible reality?,Well then our existence would be guaranteed,,because every possible thing,exists in that reality,,but our choices would be meaningless.,If I really struggle morally and agonize,and I decide to do the right thing,,what difference does it make,,because there are an infinite number,of versions of me,also doing the right thing,and an infinite number doing the wrong thing.,So my choices are meaningless.,So we don't want to live in that special reality.,And as for the special reality of nothingness,,we wouldn't be having this conversation.,So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,,there are nasty bits and nice bits,and we could make the nice bits bigger,and the nasty bits smaller,and that gives us a kind of purpose in life.,The universe is absurd,,but we can still construct a purpose,,and that's a pretty good one,,and the overall mediocrity of reality,kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity,we all feel in the core of our being.,And I know you feel it.,I know you're all special,,but you're still kind of secretly mediocre,,don't you think?,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 So anyway, you may say, this npuzzle, the mystery of existence,,it's just silly mystery-mongering.,You're not astonished at the existence of the universe,and you're in good company.,Bertrand Russell said,,"I should say the universe is just there, and that's all.",Just a brute fact.,And my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,,a great philosophical wag,,when I said to him, "Professor Morgenbesser,,why is there something rather than nothing?",And he said, "Oh, even if there was nothing,,you still wouldn't be satisfied." 
 So — (Laughter) — okay.,So you're not astonished. I don't care.,But I will tell you something to conclude,that I guarantee you will astonish you,,because it's astonished all of the brilliant,,wonderful people I've met at this TED conference,,when I've told them, and it's this:,Never in my life have I had a cell phone.,Thank you.,(Laughter) (Applause)Ten years ago, I wrote a book which I entitled,"Our Final Century?" Question mark.,My publishers cut out the question mark. (Laughter),The American publishers changed our title,to "Our Final Hour.",Americans like instant gratification and the reverse.,(Laughter) 
 And my theme was this:,Our Earth has existed for 45 million centuries,,but this one is special —,it's the first where one species, ours,,has the planet's future in its hands.,Over nearly all of Earth's history,,threats have come from nature —,disease, earthquakes, asteroids and so forth —,but from now on, the worst dangers come from us.,And it's now not just the nuclear threat;,in our interconnected world,,network breakdowns can cascade globally;,air travel can spread pandemicsnworldwide within days;,and social media can spread panic and rumor,literally at the speed of light.,We fret too much about minor hazards —,improbable air crashes, carcinogens in food,,low radiation doses, and so forth —,but we and our political masters,are in denial about catastrophic scenarios.,The worst have thankfully not yet happened.,Indeed, they probably won't.,But if an event is potentially devastating,,it's worth paying a substantial premium,to safeguard against it, even if it's unlikely,,just as we take out fire insurance on our house. 
 And as science offers greater power and promise,,the downside gets scarier too.,We get ever more vulnerable.,Within a few decades,,millions will have the capability,to misuse rapidly advancing biotech,,just as they misuse cybertech today.,Freeman Dyson, in a TED Talk,,foresaw that children will designnand create new organisms,just as routinely as his generationnplayed with chemistry sets.,Well, this may be on the science fiction fringe,,but were even part of his scenario to come about,,our ecology and even our species,would surely not survive long unscathed.,For instance, there are some eco-extremists,who think that it would be better for the planet,,for Gaia, if there were far fewer humans.,What happens when such people have mastered,synthetic biology techniques,that will be widespread by 2050?,And by then, other science fiction nightmares,may transition to reality:,dumb robots going rogue,,or a network that develops a mind of its own,threatens us all. 
 Well, can we guard against such risks by regulation?,We must surely try, but these enterprises,are so competitive, so globalized,,and so driven by commercial pressure,,that anything that can be donenwill be done somewhere,,whatever the regulations say.,It's like the drug laws — we try to regulate, but can't.,And the global village will have its village idiots,,and they'll have a global range. 
 So as I said in my book,,we'll have a bumpy ride through this century.,There may be setbacks to our society —,indeed, a 50 percent chance of a severe setback.,But are there conceivable events,that could be even worse,,events that could snuff out all life?,When a new particle accelerator came online,,some people anxiously asked,,could it destroy the Earth or, even worse,,rip apart the fabric of space?,Well luckily, reassurance could be offered.,I and others pointed out that nature,has done the same experiments,zillions of times already,,via cosmic ray collisions.,But scientists should surely be precautionary,about experiments that generate conditions,without precedent in the natural world.,Biologists should avoid releasenof potentially devastating,genetically modified pathogens. 
 And by the way, our special aversion,to the risk of truly existential disasters,depends on a philosophical and ethical question,,and it's this:,Consider two scenarios.,Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity.,Scenario B wipes out 100 percent.,How much worse is B than A?,Some would say 10 percent worse.,The body count is 10 percent higher.,But I claim that B is incomparably worse.,As an astronomer, I can't believe,that humans are the end of the story.,It is five billion years before the sun flares up,,and the universe may go on forever,,so post-human evolution,,here on Earth and far beyond,,could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process,that's led to us, and even more wonderful.,And indeed, future evolutionnwill happen much faster,,on a technological timescale,,not a natural selection timescale. 
 So we surely, in view of those immense stakes,,shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk,that human extinction would foreclose,this immense potential.,Some scenarios that have been envisaged,may indeed be science fiction,,but others may be disquietingly real.,It's an important maxim that the unfamiliar,is not the same as the improbable,,and in fact, that's why we at Cambridge University,are setting up a center to study how to mitigate,these existential risks.,It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people,to think about these potential disasters.,And we need all the help we can get from others,,because we are stewards of a precious,pale blue dot in a vast cosmos,,a planet with 50 million centuries ahead of it.,And so let's not jeopardize that future. 
 And I'd like to finish with a quote,from a great scientist called Peter Medawar.,I quote, "The bells that toll for mankind,are like the bells of Alpine cattle.,They are attached to our own necks,,and it must be our fault if they do not make,a tuneful and melodious sound." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Election night 2008,was a night that tore me in half.,It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.,[One hundred and forty-three] nyears after the end of slavery,,and [43] years after the passage,of the Voting Rights Act,,an African-American was elected president.,Many of us never thought that this was possible,until the moment that it happened.,And in many ways, it was the climax,of the black civil rights movement,in the United States. 
 I was in California that night,,which was ground zero at the time,for another movement:,the marriage equality movement.,Gay marriage was on the ballot,in the form of Proposition 8,,and as the election returns started to come in,,it became clear that the right,for same sex couples to marry,,which had recently been grantednby the California courts,,was going to be taken away.,So on the same night,that Barack Obama won his historic presidency,,the lesbian and gay community suffered,one of our most painful defeats. 
 And then it got even worse.,Pretty much immediately,,African-Americans started to be blamed,for the passage of Proposition 8.,This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said,that blacks had voted for the measure,by something like 70 percent.,This turned out not to be true,,but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,,and was grabbed on by the media.,I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.,I listened to some gay commentator say,that the African-American community,was notoriously homophobic,,and now that civil rights had been achieved for us,,we wanted to take away other people's rights.,There were even reports of racist epithets,being thrown at some of the participants,of the gay rights rallies,that took place after the election.,And on the other side,,some African-Americans dismissed or ignored,homophobia that was indeed real in our community.,And others resented this comparison,between gay rights and civil rights,,and once again, the sinking feeling,that two minority groups,of which I'm both a part of,were competing with each other,instead of supporting each other,overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off. 
 Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker,,so after going through my pissed off stage,and yelling at the television and radio,,my next instinct was,to make a movie.,And what guided me in making this film was,,how was this happening?,How was it that the gay rights movement,was being pitted against the civil rights movement?,And this wasn't just an abstract question.,I'm a beneficiary of both movements,,so this was actually personal.,But then something else happened,after that election in 2008.,The march towards gay equality,accelerated at a pace,that surprised and shocked everyone,,and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,,our institutions and our entire country.,And so it started to become increasingly clear to me,that this pitting of the two movements,against each other actually didn't make sense,,and that they were in fact,much, much more interconnected,,and that, in fact, some of the way,that the gay rights movement has been able,to make such incredible gains so quickly,is that it's used some of the same tactics,and strategies that were first laid down,by the civil rights movement.,Let's just look at a few of these strategies. 
 First off, it's really interesting to see,,to actually visually see, how quick,the gay rights movement has made its gains,,if you look at a few of the major events,on a timeline of both freedom movements.,Now, there are tons of milestones,in the civil rights movement,,but the first one we're going to start with,is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.,This was a protest campaign,against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation,on their public transit system,,and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks,refused to give up her seat to a white person.,The campaign lasted a year,,and it galvanized the civil rights movement,like nothing had before it.,And I call this strategy the,"I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy. 
 So gays and lesbians have been in society,since societies began,,but up until the mid-20th century,,homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.,So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,,a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.,It's known as Stonewall, in 1969,,and it's where a group of LGBT patrons,fought back against police beatings,at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked,three days of rioting.,Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks,were at the forefront of this rebellion,,and it's a really interesting example,of the intersection of our struggles against racism,,homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.,After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups,sprang up all over the country,,and the modern gay rights nmovement as we know it took off. 
 So the next moment to look at on the timeline,is the 1963 March on Washington.,This was a seminal eventnin the civil rights movement,and it's where African-Americans called for both,civil and economic justice.,And it's of course where Martin Luther King,delivered his famous "I have a dream" speech,,but what's actually less known,is that this march was organized,by a man named Bayard Rustin.,Bayard was an out gay man,,and he's considered one of the most brilliant,strategists of the civil rights movement.,He later in his life became a fierce advocate,of LGBT rights as well, and his life,is testament to the intersection of the struggles.,The March on Washington,is one of the high points of the movement,,and it's where there was a fervent belief,that African-Americans too,could be a part of American democracy.,I call this strategy the,"We are visible and many in numbers" strategy. 
 Some early gay activists were actually,directly inspired by the march,,and some had taken part.,Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said,,"We marched with Martin Luther King,,seven of us from the Mattachine Society" --,which was an early gay rights organization —,"and from that moment on, we had our own dream,about a gay rights march of similar proportions.",Several years later, a series of marches took place,,each one gaining the momentum,of the gay freedom struggle.,The first one was in 1979,,and the second one took place in 1987.,The third one was held in 1993.,Almost a million people showed up,,and people were so energized and excited,by what had taken place,,they went back to their own communities,and started their own political,and social organizations,,further increasing the visibility of the movement.,The day of that march, October 11,,was then declared National Coming Out Day,,and is still celebrated all over the world.,These marches set the groundwork,for the historic changes that we see happening,today in the United States. 
 And lastly, the "Loving" strategy.,The name speaks for itself.,In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled,in Loving v. Virginia,,and invalidated all laws,that prohibited interracial marriage.,This is considered one of the Supreme Court's,landmark civil rights cases.,In 1996, President Clinton signed,the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,,and that made the federal government,only have to recognize marriages,between a man and a woman.,In United States v. Windsor,,a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor,sued the federal government,when she was forced to pay estate taxes,on her deceased wife's property,,something that heterosexual ncouples don't have to do.,And as the case wound its way,through the lower courts,,the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.,When it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,,the Supreme Court agreed,,and DOMA was thrown out.,It was incredible.,But the gay marriage movement,has been making gains for years now.,To date, 17 states,have passed laws allowing marriage equality.,It's become the de facto battle,for gay equality,,and it seems like daily,,laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,,even in places like Texas and Utah,,which no one saw coming. 
 So a lot has changed,since that night in 2008,when I felt torn in half.,I did go on to make that film.,It's a documentary film,,and it's called "The New Black,",and it looks at how the African-American community,is grappling with the gay rights issue,in light of the gay marriage movement,and this fight over the meaning of civil rights.,And I wanted to capture,some of this incredible change that was happening,,and as luck or politics would have it,,another marriage battle started gearing up,,this time in Maryland,,where African-Americans make up 30 percent,of the electorate.,So this tension between gay rights,and civil rights started to bubble up once again,,and I was lucky enough to capture,how some people were making the connection,between the movements this time.,This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes,and Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,,as they hit the streets of Baltimore,and try to convince potential voters. 
 (Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up,nman, this is a righteous man over here.,Okay, are you registered to vote? 
 Man: No.nKaress Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you? 
 Man: 21.nKTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote. 
 We got to get you registered to vote. 
 Man: I ain't voting on no gay shit. 
 SM: Okay, why? What's up?nMan: I ain't with that. 
 SM: That's not cool. 
 Man: What made you be gay?nSM: So what made you be straight? 
 So what made you be straight?,Man 2: You can't answer that question. (Laughter) 
 KSM: I used to not have the same rights as you,,but I know that because a black man like yourself,stood up for a woman like me,,I know that I've got the same opportunities.,So you, as a black man, have the opportunity,to stand up for somebody else.,Whether you're gay or not,,these are your brothers and sisters out here,,and they need you to represent. 
 Man 2: Who is you to tell somebody,who they can't have sex with,,who they can't be with?,They ain't got that power.,Nobody has that power to say,nyou can't marry that young lady.,Who has that power? Nobody. 
 SM: But you know what?,Our state has put the power in your hands,,and so what we need you to do,is vote for, you gonna vote for 6. 
 Man 2: I got you. 
 SM: Vote for 6, okay?nMan 2: I got you. 
 KSM: All right, do y'all needncommunity service hours?,You do? All right, you can always volunteer with us,to get community service hours.,Y'all want to do that?,We feed you. We bring you pizza. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Yoruba Richen: Thank you.,What's amazing to me about that clip,that we just captured as we were filming,is, it really shows how Karess,understands the historynof the civil rights movement,,but she's not restricted by it.,She doesn't just limit it to black people.,She sees it as a blueprint,for expanding rights to gays and lesbians.,Maybe because she's younger, she's like 25,,she's able to do this a little bit more easily,,but the fact is that Maryland voters,did pass that marriage equality amendment,,and in fact it was the first time,that marriage equality was directly voted on,and passed by the voters.,African-Americans supported it at a higher level,than had ever been recorded.,It was a complete turnaround from that night,in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.,It was, and feels, monumental.,We in the LGBT community have gone,from being a pathologized and reviled,and criminalized group,to being seen as part of the great human quest,for dignity and equality.,We've gone from having to hide our sexuality,in order to maintain our jobs and our families,to literally getting a place at the table,with the president,and a shout out at his second inauguration.,I just want to read what he said,at that inauguration:,"We the people declare today,that the most evident of truths,,that all of us are created equal.,It is the star that guides us still,,just as it guided our forebears,through Seneca Falls,and Selma and Stonewall." 
 Now we know that everything is not perfect,,especially when you look at what's happening,with the LGBT rights issue internationally,,but it says something about how far we've come,when our president puts the gay freedom struggle,in the context of the other great freedom struggles,of our time: the women's rights movement,and the civil rights movement.,His statement demonstrates not only,the interconnectedness of those movements,,but how each one borrowed,and was inspired by the other.,So just as Martin Luther King,learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics,of civil disobedience and nonviolence,,which became a bedrock ofnthe civil rights movement,,the gay rights movement saw what worked,in the civil rights movement,,and they used some of those same strategies,and tactics to make gains,at an even quicker pace. 
 Maybe one more other reason,for the relative quick progress,of the gay rights movement.,Whereas a lot of us continue to still live,in racially segregated spaces,,LGBT folks, we are everywhere.,We are in urban communities,and rural communities,,communities of color, immigrant communities,,churches and mosques and synagogues.,We are your mothers and brothers,and sisters and sons.,And when someone that you love,or a family member comes out,,it may be easier to support their quest for equality.,And in fact, the gay rights movement,asks us to support justice and equality,from a space of love.,That may be the biggest, greatest gift,that the movement has given us.,It calls on us to access that which is most universal,and most intimate:,a love of our brother and our sister,and our neighbor.,I just want to end with a quote,by one of our greatest freedom fighters,who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela,of South Africa.,Nelson Mandela led South Africa,after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,,and out of the ashes of that nlegalized racial discrimination,,he led South Africa to become the first country,in the world to ban discrimination,based on sexual orientation within its constitution.,Mandela said,,"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains,,but to live in a way that respects,and enhances the freedom of others." 
 So as these movements continue on,,and as freedom strugglesnaround the world continue on,,let's remember that not only are they interconnected,,but they must support and enhance each other,for us to be truly victorious. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I turned 19, I started my career,as the first female photojournalist,in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.,My work as a woman photographer,was considered a serious insult,to local traditions,,and created a lasting stigma,for me and my family.,The male-dominated field made my presence,unwelcome by all possible means.,They made clear that a woman,must not do a man's job.,Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me,because of my gender.,The "No" sign was pretty clear. 
 Three of my colleagues,went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area,where the explosion sounds,were the only thing I could hear.,Dust was flying in the air,,and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me.,I only realized we weren'tnthere to document the event,when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep,and drove away, waving and laughing,,leaving me behind in the open air strike zone. 
 For a moment, I felt terrified,,humiliated, and sorry for myself.,My colleagues' action was not,the only death threat I have received,,but it was the most dangerous one. 
 The perception of women's life in Gaza,is passive.,Until a recent time, a lot of nwomen were not allowed,to work or pursue education.,At times of such doubled war including,both social restrictions on women,and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,,women's dark and bright stories were fading away.,To men, women's stories were seen,as inconsequential. 
 I started paying closer attention,to women's lives in Gaza.,Because of my gender, I had access,to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.,Beyond the obvious pain and struggle,,there was a healthy dose,of laughter and accomplishments.,In front of a police compound in Gaza City,during the first war in Gaza,,an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound,and break my nose.,For a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,,like these lights.,I thought to myself I either got blind,or I was in heaven.,By the time I managed to open my eyes,,I had documented this moment. 
 Mohammed Khader, a Palestinian worker,who spent two decades in Israel,,as his retirement plan,,he decided to build a four-floor house,,only by the first field operation at his neighborhood,,the house was flattened to the ground.,Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised,and a jacuzzi, a bathtub,that he got from Tel Aviv.,Mohammed got the bathtub,on the top of the rubble,and started giving his kids,an every morning bubble bath. 
 My work is not meant to hide the scars of war,,but to show the full frame,of unseen stories of Gazans.,As a Palestinian female photographer,,the journey of struggle, survival and everyday life,has inspired me to overcome the community taboo,and see a different side of war and its aftermath.,I became a witness with a choice:,to run away or stand still. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)On March 10, 2011,,I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab,meeting with faculty, students and staff,,and we were trying to figure out whether,I should be the next director. 
 That night, at midnight,,a magnitude 9 earthquake,hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.,My wife and family were in Japan,,and as the news started to come in,,I was panicking.,I was looking at the news streams,and listening to the press conferences,of the government officials,and the Tokyo Power Company,,and hearing about this explosion,at the nuclear reactors,and this cloud of fallout,that was headed towards our house,which was only about 200 kilometers away.,And the people on TV weren't telling us,anything that we wanted to hear.,I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,,what was going on with the radiation,,whether my family was in danger. 
 So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,,which was to go onto the Internet,and try to figure out,if I could take matters into my own hands.,On the Net, I found there were a lot of other people,like me trying to figure out what was going on,,and together we sort of loosely formed a group,and we called it Safecast,,and we decided we were going to try,to measure the radiation,and get the data out to everybody else,,because it was clear that the government,wasn't going to be doing this for us. 
 Three years later,,we have 16 million data points,,we have designed our own Geiger counters,that you can download the designs,and plug it into the network.,We have an app that shows you,most of the radiation in Japannand other parts of the world.,We are arguably one of the most successful,citizen science projects in the world,,and we have created,the largest open dataset of radiation measurements. 
 And the interesting thing here,is how did — (Applause) — Thank you.,How did a bunch of amateurs,who really didn't know what we were doing,somehow come together,and do what NGOs and the government,were completely incapable of doing?,And I would suggest that this has something to do,with the Internet. It's not a fluke.,It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.,It helped that it was an event,that pulled everybody together,,but it was a new way of doing things,that was enabled by the Internet,and a lot of the other things that were going on,,and I want to talk a little bit about,what those new principles are. 
 So remember before the Internet? (Laughter),I call this B.I. Okay?,So, in B.I., life was simple.,Things were Euclidian, Newtonian,,somewhat predictable.,People actually tried to predict the future,,even the economists.,And then the Internet happened,,and the world became extremely complex,,extremely low-cost, extremely fast,,and those Newtonian laws,that we so dearly cherished,turned out to be just local ordinances,,and what we found was that in this,completely unpredictable world,that most of the people who were surviving,were working with sort of a different set of principles,,and I want to talk a little bit about that. 
 Before the Internet, if you remember,,when we tried to create services,,what you would do is you'd create,the hardware layer and thennetwork layer and the software,and it would cost millions of dollars,to do anything that was substantial.,So when it costs millions of dollarsnto do something substantial,,what you would do is you'd get an MBA,who would write a plan,and get the money,from V.C.s or big companies,,and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,,and they'd build the thing.,This is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.,What happened after the Internet was,the cost of innovation went down so much,because the cost of collaboration,nthe cost of distribution,,the cost of communication, and Moore's Law,made it so that the cost of trying a new thing,became nearly zero,,and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,,students that didn't have permission —,permissionless innovation —,didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,,they just built the thing,,then they raised the money,,and then they sort of figured out a business plan,and maybe later on they hired some MBAs.,So the Internet caused innovation,,at least in software and services,,to go from an MBA-driven innovation model,to a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,,and it pushed innovation to the edges,,to the dorm rooms, to the startups,,away from the large institutions,,the stodgy old institutions that had the power,and the money and the authority.,And we all know this. We all knownthis happened on the Internet.,It turns out it's happening in other things, too.,Let me give you some examples. 
 So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.,We do all kinds of things.,We do biology, we do hardware,,and Nicholas Negropontenfamously said, "Demo or die,",as opposed to "Publish or perish,",which was the traditional academic way of thinking.,And he often said, the demo only has to work once,,because the primary mode of us impacting the world,was through large companies,being inspired by us,and creating products likenthe Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.,But today, with the ability,to deploy things into the real world at such low cost,,I'm changing the motto now,,and this is the official public statement.,I'm officially saying, "Deploy or die.",You have to get the stuff into the real world,for it to really count,,and sometimes it will be large companies,,and Nicholas can talk about satellites.,(Applause),Thank you.,But we should be getting out there ourselves,and not depending on largeninstitutions to do it for us. 
 So last year, we sent a bunchnof students to Shenzhen,,and they sat on the factory floors,with the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.,What was happening there,was you would have these manufacturing devices,,and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.,They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment,and innovating right on thenmanufacturing equipment.,The factory was in the designer,,and the designer was literally in the factory.,And so what you would do is,,you'd go down to the stalls,and you would see these cell phones.,So instead of starting little websites,like the kids in Palo Alto do,,the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.,They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto,make websites,,and so there's a rainforest,of innovation going on in the cell phone.,What they do is, they make a cell phone,,go down to the stall, they sell some,,they look at the other kids' stuff, go up,,make a couple thousand more, go down.,Doesn't this sound like a software thing?,It sounds like agile software development,,A/B testing and iteration,,and what we thought you could only do with software,kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.,My next fellow, I hope, is going to be,one of these innovators from Shenzhen. 
 And so what you see is,that is pushing innovation to the edges.,We talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,,and that's great, but this is Limor.,She is one of our favorite graduates,,and she is standing in front of a Samsung,Techwin Pick and Place Machine.,This thing can put 23,000 components per hour,onto an electronics board.,This is a factory in a box.,So what used to take a factory full of workers,working by hand,in this little box in New York,,she's able to have effectively —,She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen,to do this manufacturing.,She can buy this box and she can manufacture it.,So manufacturing, the cost of innovation,,the cost of prototyping, distribution,nmanufacturing, hardware,,is getting so low,that innovation is being pushed to the edges,and students and startups are being able to build it.,This is a recent thing, but this will happen,and this will change,just like it did with software. 
 Sorona is a DuPont process,that uses a genetically engineered microbe,to turn corn sugar into polyester.,It's 30 percent more efficientnthan the fossil fuel method,,and it's much better for the environment.,Genetic engineering and bioengineering,are creating a whole bunch,of great new opportunities,for chemistry, for computation, for memory.,We will probably be doing a lot,nobviously doing health things,,but we will probably be growing chairs,and buildings soon.,The problem is, Sorona costsnabout 400 million dollars,and took seven years to build.,It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.,The thing is, the cost of innovation,in bioengineering is also going down.,This is desktop gene sequencer.,It used to cost millions and millionsnof dollars to sequence genes.,Now you can do it on a desktop like this,,and kids can do this in dorm rooms.,This is Gen9 gene assembler,,and so right now when you try to print a gene,,what you do is somebody in a factory,with pipettes puts the thing together by hand,,you have one error per 100 base pairs,,and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.,This new device,assembles genes on a chip,,and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,,it's one error per 10,000 base pairs.,In this lab, we will have the world's capacity,of gene printing within a year,,200 million base pairs a year.,This is kind of like when we went,from transistor radios wrapped by hand,to the Pentium.,This is going to become thenPentium of bioengineering,,pushing bioengineering into the hands,of dorm rooms and startup companies. 
 So it's happening in software and in hardware,and bioengineering,,and so this is a fundamental newnway of thinking about innovation.,It's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,,it's chaotic, it's hard to control.,It's not bad, but it's very different,,and I think that the traditional rules that we have,for institutions don't work anymore,,and most of us here,operate with a different set of principles.,One of my favorite principles is the power of pull,,which is the idea of pulling resources,from the network as you need them,rather than stocking them in the center,and controlling everything. 
 So in the case of the Safecast story,,I didn't know anything whennthe earthquake happened,,but I was able to find Sean,who was the hackerspace community organizer,,and Peter, the analog hardware hacker,who made our first Geiger counter,,and Dan, who built the Three Mile Island,monitoring system after thenThree Mile Island meltdown.,And these people I wouldn't have been able to find,beforehand and probably were better,that I found them just in time from the network. 
 I'm a three-time college dropout,,so learning over education,is very near and dear to my heart,,but to me, education is what people do to you,and learning is what you do to yourself. 
 (Applause) 
 And it feels like, and I'm biased,,it feels like they're trying to make you memorize,the whole encyclopedia beforenthey let you go out and play,,and to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,,and it feels like they assume,you're going to be on top of some mountain,all by yourself with a number 2 pencil,trying to figure out what to do,when in fact you're always going to be connected,,you're always going to have friends,,and you can pull Wikipedianup whenever you need it,,and what you need to learn is how to learn.,In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs,when we started three years ago,,I would argue that we probably as a group,know more than any other organization,about how to collect data and publish data,and do citizen science. 
 Compass over maps.,So this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan,or mapping something is getting so expensive,and it's not very accurate or useful.,So in the Safecast story, wenknew we needed to collect data,,we knew we wanted to publish the data,,and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,,we first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.,Oh, they've run out.,Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors.,Okay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.,We can drive around. We can get volunteers.,We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.,We could not have planned this whole thing,,but by having a very strong compass,,we eventually got to where we were going,,and to me it's very similar tonagile software development,,but this idea of compasses is very important. 
 So I think the good news is,that even though the world is extremely complex,,what you need to do is very simple.,I think it's about stopping this notion,that you need to plan everything,,you need to stock everything,,and you need to be so prepared,,and focus on being connected,,always learning,,fully aware,,and super present. 
 So I don't like the word "futurist.",I think we should be now-ists,,like we are right now. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I want to tell you,about a project being carried out,by scientists all over the world,to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.,And the central idea of this work,is that the human mind and brain,is not a single, general-purpose processor,,but a collection of highly specialized components,,each solving a different specific problem,,and yet collectively making up,who we are as human beings and thinkers.,To give you a feel for this idea, 
 imagine the following scenario:,You walk into your child's day care center.,As usual, there's a dozen kids there,waiting to get picked up,,but this time,,the children's faces look weirdly similar,,and you can't figure out which child is yours.,Do you need new glasses?,Are you losing your mind?,You run through a quick mental checklist.,No, you seem to be thinking clearly,,and your vision is perfectly sharp.,And everything looks normal,except the children's faces.,You can see the faces,,but they don't look distinctive,,and none of them looks familiar,,and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon,that you find your daughter. 
 This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces,actually happens to people.,It's called prosopagnosia,,and it results from damage,to a particular part of the brain.,The striking thing about it,is that only face recognition is impaired;,everything else is just fine. 
 Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific,mental deficits that can happen after brain damage.,These syndromes collectively,have suggested for a long time,that the mind is divvied up into distinct components,,but the effort to discover those components,has jumped to warp speed,with the invention of brain imaging technology,,especially MRI.,So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy,at high resolution,,so I'm going to show you in a second,a set of MRI cross-sectional images,through a familiar object,,and we're going to fly through them,and you're going to try to figure out what the object is.,Here we go. 
 It's not that easy. It's an artichoke. 
 Okay, let's try another one,,starting from the bottom and going through the top.,Broccoli! It's a head of broccoli.,Isn't it beautiful? I love that. 
 Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.,In fact, it's my brain.,We're going through slices through my head like that.,That's my nose over on the right, and now,we're going over here, right there. 
 So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,,but it shows only anatomy.,The really cool advance with functional imaging,happened when scientists figured out how to make,pictures that show not just anatomy but activity,,that is, where neurons are firing.,So here's how this works.,Brains are like muscles.,When they get active,,they need increased blood flow to supply that activity,,and lucky for us, blood flowncontrol to the brain is local,,so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there,get active and start firing,,then blood flow increases just right there.,So functional MRI picks upnon that blood flow increase,,producing a higher MRI response,where neural activity goes up. 
 So to give you a concrete feel,for how a functional MRI experiment goes,and what you can learn from it,and what you can't,,let me describe one of the first studies I ever did.,We wanted to know if there was a specialnpart of the brain for recognizing faces,,and there was already reason tonthink there might be such a thing,based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia,that I described a moment ago,,but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain,in a normal person,,so we set out to look for it.,So I was the first subject.,I went into the scanner, I lay on my back,,I held my head as still as I could,while staring at pictures of faces like these,and objects like these,and faces and objects for hours.,So as somebody who hasnpretty close to the world record,of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,,I can tell you that one of the skills,that's really important for MRI research,is bladder control.,(Laughter) 
 When I got out of the scanner,,I did a quick analysis of the data,,looking for any parts of my brain,that produced a higher responsenwhen I was looking at faces,than when I was looking at objects,,and here's what I saw.,Now this image looks just awful by today's standards,,but at the time I thought it was beautiful.,What it shows is that region right there,,that little blob,,it's about the size of an olive,and it's on the bottom surface of my brain,about an inch straight in from right there.,And what that part of my brain is doing,is producing a higher MRI response,,that is, higher neural activity,,when I was looking at faces,than when I was looking at objects.,So that's pretty cool,,but how do we know this isn't a fluke?,Well, the easiest way,is to just do the experiment again.,So I got back in the scanner,,I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects,and I got a similar blob,,and then I did it again,and I did it again,and again and again,,and around about then,I decided to believe it was for real.,But still, maybe this isnsomething weird about my brain,and no one else has one of these things in there,,so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people,and found that pretty much everyone,has that little face-processing region,in a similar neighborhood of the brain. 
 So the next question was,,what does this thing really do?,Is it really specialized just for face recognition?,Well, maybe not, right?,Maybe it responds not only to faces,but to any body part.,Maybe it responds to anything human,or anything alive,or anything round.,The only way to be really sure that that region,is specialized for face recognition,is to rule out all of those hypotheses.,So we spent much of the next couple of years,scanning subjects while they looked at lots,of different kinds of images,,and we showed that that part of the brain,responds strongly when you look at,any images that are faces of any kind,,and it responds much less strongly,to any image you show that isn't a face,,like some of these. 
 So have we finally nailed the case,that this region is necessary for face recognition?,No, we haven't.,Brain imaging can never tell you,if a region is necessary for anything.,All you can do with brain imaging,is watch regions turn on and off,as people think different thoughts.,To tell if a part of the brain isnnecessary for a mental function,,you need to mess with it and see what happens,,and normally we don't get to do that.,But an amazing opportunity came about,very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine,tested this man who has epilepsy,and who is shown here in his hospital bed,where he's just had electrodes placed,on the surface of his brain,to identify the source of his seizures.,So it turned out by total chance,that two of the electrodes,happened to be right on top of his face area.,So with the patient's consent,,the doctors asked him what happened,when they electrically stimulatednthat part of his brain.,Now, the patient doesn't know,where those electrodes are,,and he's never heard of the face area.,So let's watch what happens.,It's going to start with a control condition,that will say "Sham" nearly invisibly,in red in the lower left,,when no current is delivered,,and you'll hear the neurologist speakingnto the patient first. So let's watch. 
 (Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face,and tell me what happens when I do this.,All right? 
 Patient: Okay. 
 Neurologist: One, two, three. 
 Patient: Nothing.nNeurologist: Nothing? Okay.,I'm going to do it one more time.,Look at my face.,One, two, three. 
 Patient: You just turned into somebody else.,Your face metamorphosed.,Your nose got saggy, it went to the left.,You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before,,but somebody different.,That was a trip.,(Laughter) 
 Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment —,(Applause) —,this experiment finally nails the case,that this region of the brain is not only,selectively responsive to faces,but causally involved in face perception.,So I went through all of these details,about the face region to show you what it takes,to really establish that a part of the brain,is selectively involved in a specific mental process.,Next, I'll go through much more quickly,some of the other specialized regions of the brain,that we and others have found.,So to do this, I've spent a lot of time,in the scanner over the last month,so I can show you these things in my brain. 
 So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.,So we're oriented like that.nYou're looking at my head this way.,Imagine taking the skull off,and looking at the surface of the brain like that.,Okay, now as you can see,,the surface of the brain is all folded up.,So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.,We want to see the whole thing,,so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.,Next, let's find that face area I've been talking about,that responds to images like these.,To see that, let's turn the brain around,and look on the inside surface on the bottom,,and there it is, that's my face area.,Just to the right of that is another region,that is shown in purple,that responds when you process color information,,and near those regions are other regions,that are involved in perceiving places,,like right now, I'm seeingnthis layout of space around me,and these regions in green right there,are really active.,There's another one out on the outside surface again,where there's a couple more face regions as well.,Also in this vicinity,is a region that's selectively involved,in processing visual motion,,like these moving dots here,,and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,,and near that is a region that responds,when you look at images of bodies and body parts,like these, and that region is shown in lime green,at the bottom of the brain. 
 Now all these regions I've shown you so far,are involved in specific aspects of visual perception.,Do we also have specialized brain regions,for other senses, like hearing?,Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,,here's a region in dark blue,that we reported just a couple of months ago,,and this region responds strongly,when you hear sounds with pitch, like these.,(Sirens),(Cello music),(Doorbell),In contrast, that same regionndoes not respond strongly,when you hear perfectly familiar sounds,that don't have a clear pitch, like these.,(Chomping),(Drum roll),(Toilet flushing) 
 Okay. Next to the pitch region,is another set of regions thatnare selectively responsive,when you hear the sounds of speech. 
 Okay, now let's look at these same regions.,In my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement —,not identical, but similar —,and most of the same regions are in here,,albeit sometimes different in size. 
 Now, everything I've shown you so far,are regions that are involved inndifferent aspects of perception,,vision and hearing.,Do we also have specialized brain regions,for really fancy, complicated mental processes?,Yes, we do.,So here in pink are my language regions.,So it's been known for a very long time,that that general vicinity of the brain,is involved in processing language,,but we showed very recently,that these pink regions,respond extremely selectively.,They respond when you understandnthe meaning of a sentence,,but not when you do other complex mental things,,like mental arithmetic,or holding information in memory,or appreciating the complex structure,in a piece of music. 
 The most amazing region that's been found yet,is this one right here in turquoise.,This region responds,when you think about what another person is thinking.,So that may seem crazy,,but actually, we humans do this all the time.,You're doing this when you realize,that your partner is going to be worried,if you don't call home to say you're running late.,I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now,when I realize that you guys,are probably now wondering about,all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,,and what's up with that? 
 Well, I'm wondering about that too,,and we're running a bunch ofnexperiments in my lab right now,to try to find a number of other,possible specializations in the brain,for other very specific mental functions.,But importantly, I don't think we have,specializations in the brain,for every important mental function,,even mental functions that may be critical for survival.,In fact, a few years ago,,there was a scientist in my lab,who became quite convinced,that he'd found a brain region,for detecting food,,and it responded really strongly in the scanner,when people looked at images like this.,And further, he found a similar response,in more or less the same location,in 10 out of 12 subjects.,So he was pretty stoked,,and he was running around the lab,telling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah",with his big discovery.,But then he devised the critical test:,He showed subjects images of food like this,and compared them to images with very similar,color and shape, but that weren't food, like these.,And his region responded the same,to both sets of images.,So it wasn't a food area,,it was just a region that liked colors and shapes.,So much for "Oprah." 
 But then the question, of course, is,,how do we process all this other stuff,that we don't have specialized brain regions for?,Well, I think the answer is that in addition,to these highly specialized componentsnthat I've been describing,,we also have a lot of very general-npurpose machinery in our heads,that enables us to tackle,whatever problem comes along.,In fact, we've shown recently that,these regions here in white,respond whenever you do any difficult mental task,at all —,well, of the seven that we've tested.,So each of the brain regions that I've described,to you today,is present in approximately the same location,in every normal subject.,I could take any of you,,pop you in the scanner,,and find each of those regions in your brain,,and it would look a lot like my brain,,although the regions would be slightly different,in their exact location and in their size. 
 What's important to me about this work,is not the particular locations of these brain regions,,but the simple fact that we have,selective, specific components of mind and brain,in the first place.,I mean, it could have been otherwise.,The brain could have been a single,,general-purpose processor,,more like a kitchen knife,than a Swiss Army knife.,Instead, what brain imaging has delivered,is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.,So we have this picture of very general-purpose,machinery in our heads,in addition to this surprising array,of very specialized components. 
 It's early days in this enterprise.,We've painted only the first brushstrokes,in our neural portrait of the human mind.,The most fundamental questions remain unanswered.,So for example, what does eachnof these regions do exactly?,Why do we need three face areas,and three place areas,,and what's the division of labor between them?,Second, how are all these things,connected in the brain?,With diffusion imaging,,you can trace bundles of neurons,that connect to different parts of the brain,,and with this method shown here,,you can trace the connections ofnindividual neurons in the brain,,potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram,of the entire human brain.,Third, how does all of this,very systematic structure get built,,both over development in childhood,and over the evolution of our species?,To address questions like that,,scientists are now scanning,other species of animals,,and they're also scanning human infants. 
 Many people justify the highncost of neuroscience research,by pointing out that it may help us someday,to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.,That's a hugely important goal,,and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,,but fixing things that are broken in the world,is not the only thing that's worth doing.,The effort to understand the human mind and brain,is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment,of a single disease.,What could be more thrilling,than to understand the fundamental mechanisms,that underlie human experience,,to understand, in essence, who we are?,This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest,of all time. 
 (Applause)I would like to share with youna new model of higher education,,a model that, once expanded,,can enhance the collective intelligence,of millions of creativenand motivated individuals,that otherwise would be left behind.,Look at the world.,Pick a place and focus on it.,You will find humansnchasing higher education.,Let's meet some of them. 
 Patrick.,Patrick was born in Liberianto a family of 20 children.,During the civil war,,he and his family were forcednto flee to Nigeria.,There, in spite of his situation,,he graduated high schoolnwith nearly perfect grades.,He wanted to continue to higher education,,but due to his familynliving on the poverty line,,he was soon sent to South Africa,to work and send back moneynto feed his family.,Patrick never gave up his dreamnof higher education.,Late at night, after work,,he surfed the net,nlooking for ways to study. 
 Meet Debbie.,Debbie is from Florida.,Her parents didn't go to college,nand neither did any of her siblings.,Debbie has worked all her life,,pays taxes, supports herselfnmonth to month,,proud of the American dream,,a dream that just won't be completenwithout higher education.,But Debbie doesn't have the savingsnfor higher education.,She can't pay the tuition.,Neither could she leave work. 
 Meet Wael.,Wael is from Syria.,He's experiencing firsthand,the misery, fear and failurenimposed on his country.,He's a big believer in education.,He knew that if he could findnan opportunity for higher education,,an opportunity to get ahead of the rest,,he has a better chance to survivenin a world turned upside down. 
 The higher education system,failed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,,exactly as it is failingnmillions of potential students --,millions that graduate high school,,millions that are qualifiednfor higher education,,millions that want to studynyet cannot access it for various reasons.,First: financial.,Universities are expensive;nwe all know it.,In large parts of the world,,higher education is unattainablenfor an average citizen.,This is probably the biggest problemnfacing our society.,Higher education stoppednbeing a right for all,and became a privilege for the few. 
 Second: cultural.,Students who are qualifiednfor higher education,can afford -- want to study -- cannot,,because it is not decent,nit is not a place for a woman.,This is the story of countless womennin Africa, for example,,prevented from higher educationnbecause of cultural barriers.,And here comes the third reason:,UNESCO stated that in 2025,,100 million students will be deprivednof higher education,,simply because there will not be enoughnseats to accommodate them,,to meet the demand.,They will take a placement test,nthey will pass it,,but they still won't have access,nbecause there are no places available. 
 These are the reasonsnI founded University of the People,,a nonprofit, tuition-free,ndegree-granting university,to give an alternative,,to create an alternative,nto those who have no other;,an alternative that will benaffordable and scalable,,an alternative that will disruptnthe current education system,,and open the gates to higher educationnfor every qualified student,regardless of what they earn,nwhere they live,,or what society says about them.,Patrick, Debbie and Wael,are only three examplesnout of the 1,700 accepted students,from 143 countries. 
 (Applause),Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.,We just looked at what wasn't working,and used the amazing power of the Internet,to get around it.,We set out to build a model,that will cut down almost entirelynthe cost of higher education.,And that's how we did it.,First, bricks and mortar cost money.,Universities have expensesnthat virtual universities don't.,We don't need to pass these expensesnon to our students.,They don't exist.,We also don't neednto worry about capacity.,There are no limits of seatsnin virtual university.,Actually, nobody needs to standnat the back of the lecture hall.,Textbooks are also somethingnour students don't need to buy.,By using open educational resources,and the generosity of professors,who are putting their material upnfree and accessible,,we don't need to sendnour students to buy textbooks.,All of our materials come free. 
 Even professors,,the most expensive linenin any university balance sheet,,come free to our students.,Over 3,000 of them,,including presidents, vice chancellors,nprofessors and academic advisers,from top universities such as NYU,nYale, Berkeley and Oxford,,came on board to help our students. 
 Finally, is our beliefnin peer-to-peer learning.,We use this sound pedagogical model,to encourage our studentsnfrom all over the world,to interact and study together,,and also to reduce the timenour professors need,to labor over class assignments. 
 If the Internet has made usna global village,,this model can developnits future leadership.,Look how we do it.,We only offer two programs:,business administrationnand computer science,,the two programs most in demand worldwide,,the two programs that are likeliestnto help our students find a job.,When our students are accepted,,they are placed in a small classroomnof 20 to 30 students,,to ensure that those who neednpersonalized attention get it.,Moreover, for every nine-week course,nthey meet a new peer,,a whole new set of studentsnfrom all over the world.,Every week, when they goninto the classroom,,they find the lecture notes of the week,,the reading assignment,nthe homework assignment,,and the discussion question,nwhich is the core of our studies.,Every week, every student must contributento the class discussion,,and also must commentnon the contribution of others.,This way, we open our students' minds,,we develop a positive shift in attitudentoward different cultures.,By the end of each week,nthe students take a quiz,,hand in their homework,,which are assessed by their peersnunder the supervision of the instructors,,get a grade, move to the next week.,By the end of the course,nthey take the final exam,,get a grade, and follownto the next course. 
 We open the gates for higher educationnfor every qualified student.,Every student with a high school diploma,,sufficient English and Internet connection,can study with us.,We don't use audio, we don't use video.,Broadband is not necessary.,Any student from any part of the worldnwith any Internet connection,can study with us.,We are tuition free.,All we ask our students to covernis the cost of their exams,,100 dollars per exam.,A full-time bachelor's degreenstudent taking 40 courses,will pay 1,000 dollars a year,,4,000 dollars for the entire degree.,And for those who cannot afford even this,,we offer them a variety of scholarships.,It is our mission that nobodynwill be left behind,for financial reasons.,With 5,000 students in 2016,nthis model is financially sustainable. 
 Five years ago, it was a vision.,Today, it is a reality.,Last month, we got the ultimatenacademic endorsement to our model.,University of the Peoplenis now fully accredited. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 With this accreditation,nit's our time now to scale up.,We have demonstrated that our model works.,I invite universitiesnand, even more important,,developing countries' governments,,to replicate this model,to ensure that the gates of higherneducation will open widely.,A new era is coming --,an era that will witness the disruptionnof the higher education model,as we know it today,,from being a privilege for the few,to becoming a basic right,naffordable and accessible for all. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There's a man by the name of Captain,William Swenson,who recently was awarded thencongressional Medal of Honor,for his actions on September 8, 2009. 
 On that day, a column of American,and Afghan troops,were making their way,through a part of Afghanistan,to help protect,a group of government officials,,a group of Afghan government officials,,who would be meeting with some local,village elders.,The column came under ambush,,and was surrounded on three sides,,and amongst many other things,,Captain Swenson was recognized,for running into live fire,to rescue the wounded,and pull out the dead.,One of the people he rescued was a sergeant,,and he and a comrade were making their way,to a medevac helicopter. 
 And what was remarkable about this day,is, by sheer coincidence,,one of the medevac medics,happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet,and captured the whole scene on camera.,It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade,bringing this wounded soldier,who had received a gunshot to the neck.,They put him in the helicopter,,and then you see Captain Swenson bend over,and give him a kiss,before he turns around to rescue more. 
 I saw this, and I thought to myself,,where do people like that come from?,What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,,when you would want to do that.,There's a love there,,and I wanted to know why is it that,I don't have people that I work with like that?,You know, in the military, they give medals,to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves,so that others may gain.,In business, we give bonuses to people,who are willing to sacrifice others,so that we may gain.,We have it backwards. Right?,So I asked myself, where donpeople like this come from?,And my initial conclusion wasnthat they're just better people.,That's why they're attracted to the military.,These better people are attracted,to this concept of service.,But that's completely wrong.,What I learned was that it's the environment,,and if you get the environment right,,every single one of us has the capacity,to do these remarkable things,,and more importantly, others have that capacity too.,I've had the great honor of getting to meet,some of these, who we would call heroes,,who have put themselves and put their lives,at risk to save others,,and I asked them, "Why would you do it?,Why did you do it?",And they all say the same thing:,"Because they would have done it for me.",It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.,So trust and cooperation are really important here.,The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation,is that they are feelings, they are not instructions.,I can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.,I can't simply instruct two people nto cooperate, and they will.,It's not how it works. It's a feeling. 
 So where does that feeling come from?,If you go back 50,000 years,to the Paleolithic era,,to the early days of Homo sapiens,,what we find is that the world,was filled with danger,,all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.,Nothing personal.,Whether it was the weather,,lack of resources,,maybe a saber-toothed tiger,,all of these things working,to reduce our lifespan.,And so we evolved into social animals,,where we lived together and worked together,in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,,where we felt like we belonged.,And when we felt safe amongst our own,,the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.,There are inherent benefits to this.,It means I can fall asleep at night,and trust that someone from withinnmy tribe will watch for danger.,If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,,that means you won't watch for danger.,Bad system of survival. 
 The modern day is exactly the same thing.,The world is filled with danger,,things that are trying to frustrate our lives,or reduce our success,,reduce our opportunity for success.,It could be the ups and downs in the economy,,the uncertainty of the stock market.,It could be a new technology that renders,your business model obsolete overnight.,Or it could be your competition,that is sometimes trying to kill you.,It's sometimes trying to put you out of business,,but at the very minimum,is working hard to frustrate your growth,and steal your business from you.,We have no control over these forces.,These are a constant,,and they're not going away. 
 The only variable are the conditions,inside the organization,,and that's where leadership matters,,because it's the leader that sets the tone.,When a leader makes the choice,to put the safety and lives,of the people inside the organization first,,to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice,the tangible results, so that the people remain,and feel safe and feel like they belong,,remarkable things happen. 
 I was flying on a trip,,and I was witness to an incident,where a passenger attempted to board,before their number was called,,and I watched the gate agent,treat this man like he had broken the law,,like a criminal.,He was yelled at for attempting to board,one group too soon.,So I said something.,I said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?,Why can't you treat us like human beings?",And this is exactly what she said to me.,She said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules,,I could get in trouble or lose my job.",All she was telling me,is that she doesn't feel safe.,All she was telling me is that,she doesn't trust her leaders.,The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines,is not because they necessarily hire better people.,It's because they don't fear their leaders. 
 You see, if the conditions are wrong,,we are forced to expend our own time and energy,to protect ourselves from each other,,and that inherently weakens the organization.,When we feel safe inside the organization,,we will naturally combine our talents,and our strengths and work tirelessly,to face the dangers outside,and seize the opportunities. 
 The closest analogy I can give,to what a great leader is, is like being a parent.,If you think about what being a great parent is,,what do you want? What makes a great parent?,We want to give our child opportunities,,education, discipline them when necessary,,all so that they can grow up and achieve more,than we could for ourselves.,Great leaders want exactly the same thing.,They want to provide their people opportunity,,education, discipline when necessary,,build their self-confidence, giventhem the opportunity to try and fail,,all so that they could achieve more,than we could ever imagine for ourselves. 
 Charlie Kim, who's the CEO ofna company called Next Jump,in New York City, a tech company,,he makes the point that,if you had hard times in your family,,would you ever consider layingnoff one of your children?,We would never do it.,Then why do we consider laying off people,inside our organization?,Charlie implemented a policy,of lifetime employment.,If you get a job at Next Jump,,you cannot get fired for performance issues.,In fact, if you have issues,,they will coach you and they will give you support,,just like we would with one of our children,who happens to come home with a C from school.,It's the complete opposite. 
 This is the reason so many people,have such a visceral hatred, anger,,at some of these banking CEOs,with their disproportionatensalaries and bonus structures.,It's not the numbers.,It's that they have violated thenvery definition of leadership.,They have violated this deep-seated social contract.,We know that they allowed their people,to be sacrificed so they couldnprotect their own interests,,or worse, they sacrificed their people,to protect their own interests.,This is what so offends us, not the numbers.,Would anybody be offended if we gave,a $150 million bonus to Gandhi?,How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?,Do we have an issue with that? None at all.,None at all.,Great leaders would never sacrifice,the people to save the numbers.,They would sooner sacrifice the numbers,to save the people. 
 Bob Chapman, who runs,a large manufacturing company in the Midwest,called Barry-Wehmiller,,in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,,and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.,Now in a large manufacturing company,,this is a big deal,,and they could no longer afford their labor pool.,They needed to save 10 million dollars,,so, like so many companies today,,the board got together and discussed layoffs.,And Bob refused.,You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.,Bob believes in heart counts,,and it's much more difficult to simply reduce,the heart count.,And so they came up with a furlough program.,Every employee, from secretary to CEO,,was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.,They could take it any time they wanted,,and they did not have to take it consecutively.,But it was how Bob announced the program,that mattered so much.,He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little,than any of us should have to suffer a lot,,and morale went up.,They saved 20 million dollars,,and most importantly, as would be expected,,when the people feel safe and protectednby the leadership in the organization,,the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.,And quite spontaneously, nobody expected,,people started trading with each other.,Those who could afford it more,would trade with those who could afford it less.,People would take five weeks,so that somebody else only had to take three. 
 Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank.,I know many people at the seniormost,levels of organizations,who are absolutely not leaders.,They are authorities, and we do what they say,because they have authority over us,,but we would not follow them.,And I know many people,who are at the bottoms of organizations,who have no authority,and they are absolutely leaders,,and this is because they have chosen to look after,the person to the left of them,,and they have chosen to look after,the person to the right of them.,This is what a leader is. 
 I heard a story,of some Marines,who were out in theater,,and as is the Marine custom,,the officer ate last,,and he let his men eat first,,and when they were done,,there was no food left for him.,And when they went back out in the field,,his men brought him some of their food,so that he may eat,,because that's what happens.,We call them leaders because they go first.,We call them leaders because they take the risk,before anybody else does.,We call them leaders because they will choose,to sacrifice so that their people,may be safe and protected,and so their people may gain,,and when we do, the natural response,is that our people will sacrifice for us.,They will give us their blood and sweat and tears,to see that their leader's vision comes to life,,and when we ask them, "Why would you do that?,Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears,for that person?" they all say the same thing:,"Because they would have done it for me.",And isn't that the organization,we would all like to work in? 
 Thank you very much. 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)I need to start by telling you a little bit,about my social life,,which I know may not seem relevant,,but it is. 
 When people meet me at parties,and they find out that I'm an English professor,who specializes in language,,they generally have one of two reactions.,One set of people look frightened. (Laughter),They often say something like,,"Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.,I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make.",And then they stop talking. (Laughter),And they wait for me to go away,and talk to someone else.,The other set of people,,their eyes light up,,and they say,,"You are just the person I want to talk to.",And then they tell me about whatever it is,they think is going wrong with the English language.,(Laughter) 
 A couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party,and the man to my right,started telling me about all the ways,that the Internet is degrading the English language.,He brought up Facebook, and he said,,"To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?" 
 I want to pause on that question:,What makes a word real?,My dinner companion and I both know,what the verb "defriend" means,,so when does a new word like "defriend",become real?,Who has the authority to make those kinds,of official decisions about words, anyway?,Those are the questions I want to talk about today. 
 I think most people, when they say a word isn't real,,what they mean is, it doesn't appear,in a standard dictionary.,That, of course, raises a host of other questions,,including, who writes dictionaries? 
 Before I go any further,,let me clarify my role in all of this.,I do not write dictionaries.,I do, however, collect new words,much the way dictionary editors do,,and the great thing about being a historian,of the English language,is that I get to call this "research.",When I teach the history of the English language,,I require that students teach me,two new slang words before I will begin class.,Over the years, I have learned,some great new slang this way,,including "hangry," which --,(Applause) —,which is when you are cranky or angry,because you are hungry,,and "adorkable,",which is when you are adorable,in kind of a dorky way,,clearly, terrific words that fill,important gaps in the English language.,(Laughter),But how real are they,if we use them primarily as slang,and they don't yet appear in a dictionary? 
 With that, let's turn to dictionaries.,I'm going to do this as a show of hands:,How many of you still regularly,refer to a dictionary, either print or online?,Okay, so that looks like most of you.,Now, a second question. Again, a show of hands:,How many of you have ever looked to see,who edited the dictionary you are using?,Okay, many fewer.,At some level, we know that there are human hands,behind dictionaries,,but we're really not sure who those hands belong to.,I'm actually fascinated by this.,Even the most critical people out there,tend not to be very critical about dictionaries,,not distinguishing among them,and not asking a whole lot of questions,about who edited them.,Just think about the phrase,"Look it up in the dictionary,",which suggests that all dictionaries,are exactly the same.,Consider the library here on campus,,where you go into the reading room,,and there is a large, unabridged dictionary,up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect,lying open so we can go stand before it,to get answers. 
 Now, don't get me wrong,,dictionaries are fantastic resources,,but they are human,and they are not timeless.,I'm struck as a teacher,that we tell students to critically question,every text they read, every website they visit,,except dictionaries,,which we tend to treat as un-authored,,as if they came from nowhere to give us answers,about what words really mean.,Here's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,,what they'll tell you,is they're just trying to keep up with us,as we change the language.,They're watching what we say and what we write,and trying to figure out what's going to stick,and what's not going to stick.,They have to gamble,,because they want to appear cutting edge,and catch the words that are going to make it,,such as LOL,,but they don't want to appear faddish,and include the words that aren't going to make it,,and I think a word that they're watching right now,is YOLO, you only live once. 
 Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors,,and you might be surprised,by one of the places where we hang out.,Every January, we go,to the American Dialect Society annual meeting,,where among other things,,we vote on the word of the year.,There are about 200 or 300 people who come,,some of the best knownnlinguists in the United States.,To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,,it occurs right before happy hour.,Anyone who comes can vote.,The most important rule is,that you can vote with only one hand.,In the past, some of the winners have been,"tweet" in 2009,and "hashtag" in 2012.,"Chad" was the word of the year in the year 2000,,because who knew what a chad was before 2000,,and "WMD" in 2002. 
 Now, we have other categories in which we vote too,,and my favorite category,is most creative word of the year.,Past winners in this category have included,"recombobulation area,",which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,,where you can recombobulate.,(Laughter),You can put your belt back on,,put your computer back in your bag.,And then my all-time favorite word at this vote,,which is "multi-slacking.",(Laughter),And multi-slacking is the act,of having multiple windows up on your screen,so it looks like you're working,when you're actually goofing around on the web.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 Will all of these words stick? Absolutely not.,And we have made some questionable choices,,for example in 2006,when the word of the year was "Plutoed,",to mean demoted.,(Laughter),But some of the past winners,now seem completely unremarkable,,such as "app",and "e" as a prefix,,and "google" as a verb. 
 Now, a few weeks before our vote,,Lake Superior State University,issues its list of banished words for the year.,What is striking about this,is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap,between their list and the list that we are considering,for words of the year,,and this is because we're noticing the same thing.,We're noticing words that are coming into prominence.,It's really a question of attitude.,Are you bothered by languagenfads and language change,,or do you find it fun, interesting,,something worthy of study,as part of a living language? 
 The list by Lake Superior State University,continues a fairly long tradition in English,of complaints about new words.,So here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,,who was very concerned that "desirability",is really a terrible word.,In 1760, Benjamin Franklin,wrote a letter to David Hume,giving up the word "colonize" as bad. 
 Over the years, we've also seen worries,about new pronunciations.,Here is Samuel Rogers in 1855,who is concerned about somenfashionable pronunciations,that he finds offensive,,and he says "as if contemplate were not bad enough,,balcony makes me sick.",(Laughter),The word is borrowed in from Italian,and it was pronounced bal-COE-nee. 
 These complaints now strike us as quaint,,if not downright adorkable -- (Laughter) --,but here's the thing:,we still get quite worked up about language change.,I have an entire file in my office,of newspaper articles,which express concern about illegitimate words,that should not have been included in the dictionary,,including "LOL",when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary,and "defriend",when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.,I also have articles expressing concern,about "invite" as a noun,,"impact" as a verb,,because only teeth can be impacted,,and "incentivize" is described,as "boorish, bureaucratic misspeak." 
 Now, it's not that dictionary editors,ignore these kinds of attitudes about language.,They try to provide us some guidance about words,that are considered slang or informal,or offensive, often through usage labels,,but they're in something of a bind,,because they're trying to describe what we do,,and they know that we often go to dictionaries,to get information about how we should use a word,well or appropriately.,In response, the American Heritage Dictionaries,include usage notes.,Usage notes tend to occur with words,that are troublesome in one way,,and one of the ways that they can be troublesome,is that they're changing meaning.,Now usage notes involve very human decisions,,and I think, as dictionary users,,we're often not as aware of those human decisions,as we should be.,To show you what I mean,,we'll look at an example, but before we do,,I want to explain what the dictionary editors,are trying to deal with in this usage note. 
 Think about the word "peruse",and how you use that word.,I would guess many of you are thinking,of skim, scan, reading quickly.,Some of you may even have some walking involved,,because you're perusing grocery store shelves,,or something like that.,You might be surprised to learn,that if you look in most standard dictionaries,,the first definition will be to read carefully,,or pore over.,American Heritage has that as the first definition.,They then have, as the second definition, skim,,and next to that, they say "usage problem.",(Laughter),And then they include a usage note,,which is worth looking at. 
 So here's the usage note:,"Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'...,But the word is often used more loosely,,to mean simply 'to read.'...,Further extension of the wordnto mean 'to glance over, skim,',has traditionally been considered an error,,but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming,somewhat more acceptable.,When asked about the sentence,,'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,',66 percent of the [Usage] Panel,found it unacceptable in 1988,,58 percent in 1999,,and 48 percent in 2011." 
 Ah, the Usage Panel,,that trusted body of language authorities,who is getting more lenient about this.,Now, what I hope you're thinking right now is,,"Wait, who's on the Usage Panel?,And what should I do with their pronouncements?",If you look in the front matter,of American Heritage Dictionaries,,you can actually find the names,of the people on the Usage Panel.,But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?,There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.,They include academicians,,journalists, creative writers.,There's a Supreme Court justice on it,and a few linguists.,As of 2005, the list includes me.,(Applause) 
 Here's what we can do for you.,We can give you a sense,of the range of opinions about contested usage.,That is and should be the extent of our authority.,We are not a language academy.,About once a year, I get a ballot,that asks me about whether new uses,,new pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable. 
 Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot.,I listen to what other people are saying and writing.,I do not listen to my own likes,and dislikes about the English language.,I will be honest with you:,I do not like the word "impactful,",but that is neither here nor there,in terms of whether "impactful"nis becoming common usage,and becoming more acceptable in written prose.,So to be responsible,,what I do is go look at usage,,which often involves going to look,at online databases such as Google Books.,Well, if you look for "impactful" in Google Books,,here is what you find.,Well, it sure looks like "impactful",is proving useful,for a certain number of writers,,and has become more and more useful,over the last 20 years. 
 Now, there are going to be changes,that all of us don't like in the language.,There are going to be changes where you think,,"Really?,Does the language have to change that way?",What I'm saying is,,we should be less quick,to decide that that change is terrible,,we should be less quick to impose,our likes and dislikes about words on other people,,and we should be entirely reluctant,to think that the English language is in trouble.,It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled,with the creativity of the speakers who speak it.,In retrospect, we think it's fascinating,that the word "nice" used to mean silly,,and that the word "decimate",used to mean to kill one in every 10.,(Laughter),We think that Ben Franklin was being silly,to worry about "notice" as a verb.,Well, you know what?,We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years,for worrying about "impact" as a verb,and "invite" as a noun.,The language is not going to change so fast,that we can't keep up.,Language just doesn't work that way.,I hope that what you can do,is find language change not worrisome,but fun and fascinating,,just the way dictionary editors do.,I hope you can enjoy being part,of the creativity that is continually remaking,our language and keeping it robust. 
 So how does a word get into a dictionary?,It gets in because we use it,and we keep using it,,and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.,If you're thinking, "But that lets all of us decide,what words mean,",I would say, "Yes it does,,and it always has.",Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,,but there is no objectivendictionary authority out there,that is the final arbiter about what words mean.,If a community of speakers is using a word,and knows what it means, it's real.,That word might be slangy,,that word might be informal,,that word might be a word that you think,is illogical or unnecessary,,but that word that we're using,,that word is real. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We're seen as the organization that isnthe bucket for failed social policy.,I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.,We get the people for whomnnothing else has worked,,people who have fallen through all,of the other social safety nets.,They can't contain them, so we must.,That's our job:,contain them, control them. 
 Over the years, as a prison system,,as a nation, and as a society,,we've become very good at that,,but that shouldn't make you happy.,Today we incarcerate more people per capita,than any other country in the world.,We have more black men in prison today,than were under slavery in 1850.,We house the parents of almost three million,of our community's children,,and we've become the new asylum,,the largest mental health provider in this nation.,When we lock someone up,,that is no small thing.,And yet, we are called thenDepartment of Corrections.,Today I want to talk about,changing the way we think about corrections.,I believe, and my experience tells me,,that when we change the way we think,,we create new possibilities, or futures,,and prisons need a different future. 
 I've spent my entire careernin corrections, over 30 years.,I followed my dad into this field.,He was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him.,He was strong, steady, disciplined.,I was not so much any of those things,,and I'm sure that worried him about me.,Eventually I decided, if I wasngoing to end up in prison,,I'd better end up on the right side of the bars,,so I thought I'd check it out,,take a tour of the place my dad worked,,the McNeil Island Penitentiary. 
 Now this was the early '80s,,and prisons weren't quite what you see,on TV or in the movies.,In many ways, it was worse.,I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high.,There were eight men to a cell.,there were 550 men in that living unit.,And just in case you wondered,,they shared one toilet in those small confines.,An officer put a key in a lockbox,,and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.,Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.,I walked away as fast as I could. 
 Eventually I went back andnI started as an officer there.,My job was to run one of those cell blocks,and to control those hundreds of men.,When I went to work at our receptions center,,I could actually hear the inmates nroiling from the parking lot,,shaking cell doors, yelling,,tearing up their cells.,Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up,,and what you get is chaos.,Contain and control — that was our job. 
 One way we learned to do this more effectively,was a new type of housing unit,called the Intensive Management Unit, IMU,,a modern version of a "hole.",We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors,with cuff ports so we could restrain them,and feed them.,Guess what?,It got quieter.,Disturbances died down in the general population.,Places became safer,because those inmates whonwere most violent or disruptive,could now be isolated.,But isolation isn't good.,Deprive people of socialncontact and they deteriorate.,It was hard getting them out of IMU,,for them and for us.,Even in prison, it's no small thing,to lock someone up. 
 My next assignment was to onenof the state's deep-end prisons,where some of our more violentnor disruptive inmates are housed.,By then, the industry had advanced a lot,,and we had different tools and techniques,to manage disruptive behavior.,We had beanbag guns and pepper spray,and plexiglass shields,,flash bangs, emergency response teams.,We met violence with force,and chaos with chaos.,We were pretty good at putting out fires. 
 While I was there, I met twonexperienced correctional workers,who were also researchers,,an anthropologist and a sociologist.,One day, one of them commented to me and said,,"You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires.,Have you ever thought about how to prevent them?",I was patient with them,,explaining our brute force approach,to making prisons safer.,They were patient with me.,Out of those conversations grew some new ideas,and we started some small experiments.,First, we started training our officers in teams,rather than sending them one or twonat a time to the state training academy.,Instead of four weeks of training, we gave them 10.,Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model,where we paired new staff with veteran staff.,They both got better at the work.,Second, we added verbal de-escalation skills,into the training continuum,and made it part of the use of force continuum.,It was the non-force use of force.,And then we did something even more radical.,We trained the inmates on those same skills.,We changed the skill set,,reducing violence, not just responding to it. 
 Third, when we expanded our facility, nwe tried a new type of design.,Now the biggest and most controversial component,of this design, of course, was the toilet.,There were no toilets.,Now that might not soundnsignificant to you here today,,but at the time, it was huge.,No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet.,We all thought it was dangerous and crazy.,Even eight men to a cell had a toilet.,That small detail changed the way we worked.,Inmates and staff started interacting,more often and openly and developing a rapport.,It was easier to detect conflict and intervene,before it escalated.,The unit was cleaner, quieter,nsafer and more humane.,This was more effective at keeping the peace,than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point.,Interacting changes the way you behave,,both for the officer and the inmate.,We changed the environmentnand we changed the behavior. 
 Now, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson,,they assigned me to headquarters next,,and that's where I ran straightnup against system change.,Now, many things work against system change:,politics and politicians, bills and laws,,courts and lawsuits, internal politics.,System change is difficult and slow,,and oftentimes it doesn't take you,where you want to go.,It's no small thing to change a prison system.,So what I did do is I reflectednon my earlier experiences,and I remembered that when we interactednwith offenders, the heat went down.,When we changed the environment,nthe behavior changed.,And these were not huge system changes.,These were small changes, and these changes,created new possibilities. 
 So next, I got reassigned asnsuperintendent of a small prison.,And at the same time, I was working on my degree,at the Evergreen State College.,I interacted with a lot ofnpeople who were not like me,,people who had different ideas,and came from different backgrounds.,One of them was a rainforest ecologist.,She looked at my small prison and what she saw,was a laboratory.,We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates,could actually help advance science,by helping them complete projects,they couldn't complete on their own,,like repopulating endangered species:,frogs, butterflies, endangered prairie plants.,At the same time, we found ways to make,our operation more efficient,through the addition of solar power,,rainwater catchment, organic gardening, recycling.,This initiative has led to many projects,that have had huge system-wide impact,,not just in our system, but in nother state systems as well,,small experiments making a big difference,to science, to the community.,The way we think about our work changes our work.,The project just made my jobnmore interesting and exciting.,I was excited. Staff were excited.,Officers were excited. Inmates were excited.,They were inspired.,Everybody wanted to be part of this.,They were making a contribution, a difference,,one they thought was meaningful and important. 
 Let me be clear on what's going on here, though.,Inmates are highly adaptive.,They have to be.,Oftentimes, they know more about our own systems,than the people who run them.,And they're here for a reason.,I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them,,but I do think they can have,decent and meaningful lives even in prison.,So that was the question:,Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives,,and if so, what difference would that make?,So I took that question back to the deep end,,where some of our mostnviolent offenders are housed.,Remember, IMUs are for punishment.,You don't get perks there, like programming.,That was how we thought.,But then we started to realize that if any inmates,needed programming, itnwas these particular inmates.,In fact, they needed intensive programming.,So we changed our thinking 180 degrees,,and we started looking for new possibilities.,What we found was a new kind of chair.,Instead of using the chair for punishment,,we put it in classrooms.,Okay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control,,but now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face,with other inmates and staff,,and because control was no longer an issue,,everybody could focus on other things,,like learning. Behavior changed.,We changed our thinking, and we changed nwhat was possible, and this gives me hope. 
 Now, I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work.,What I can tell you, though, it is working.,Our prisons are getting safernfor both staff and inmates,,and when our prisons are safe,,we can put our energies intona lot more than just controlling.,Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal,,but it's not our only goal.,To be honest with you, preventing crime,takes so much more from so many more people,and institutions.,If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime,,I'm afraid we'll never get there.,But prisons can do some things,we never thought they could do.,Prisons can be the source of innovation,and sustainability,,repopulating endangered speciesnand environmental restoration.,Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers,,dog rescuers.,Prisons can be the source of meaningful work,and opportunity for staff,and the inmates who live there.,We can contain and control,and provide humane environments.,These are not opposing qualities. 
 We can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out,if this is worth doing.,Our strategy is not massive system change.,Our strategy is hundreds of small changes,that take place in days or months, not years.,We need more small pilots where we learn as we go,,pilots that change the range of possibility.,We need new and better ways to measure impacts,on engagement, on interaction,,on safe environments.,We need more opportunities to participate in,and contribute to our communities,,your communities.,Prisons need to be secure, yes, safe, yes.,We can do that.,Prisons need to provide humane environments,where people can participate, contribute,,and learn meaningful lives.,We're learning how to do that. 
 That's why I'm hopeful.,We don't have to stay stucknin old ideas about prison.,We can define that. We can create that.,And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity,,prisons can be more than the bucket,for failed social policy.,Maybe finally, we will earn our title:,a department of corrections. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm an industrial engineer.,The goal in my life has always been to make,more and more products,in the least amount of time and resources.,While working at Toyota,,all I knew was how to make cars,until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki,,who came to our factory to make a forest in it,in order to make it carbon-neutral.,I was so fascinated,that I decided to learn this methodology,by joining his team as a volunteer.,Soon, I started making a forest,in the backyard of my own house,,and this is how it looks after three years. 
 These forests,,compared to a conventional plantation,,grow 10 times faster,,they're 30 times more dense,,and 100 times more biodiverse.,Within two years of having this forest in our backyard,,I could observe that the groundwater,didn't dry during summers,,the number of bird species I spotted in this area,doubled.,Quality of air became better,,and we started harvesting seasonal fruits,growing effortlessly,right in the backyard of our house. 
 I wanted to make more of these forests.,I was so moved by these results,that I wanted to make these forests,with the same acumen with which we make cars,or write software or do any mainstream business,,so I founded a company,which is an end-to-end service provider,to create these native natural forests.,But to make afforestation as a mainstream business,or an industry, we had to standardize,the process of forest-making.,So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System,known for its quality and efficiency,for the process of forest-making. 
 For an example, the core of TPS,,Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka,,which is making manufacturing,of different models of cars,on a single assembly line.,We replaced these cars with trees,,using which now we can make multi-layered forests.,These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.,They are so dense,that one can't even walk into them.,For an example, we can make a 300-tree forest,in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.,In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint,,we started utilizing local biomass,as soil amender and fertilizers.,For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine,mixed with rice straw,,powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure,is finally dumped in soil on which,our forest is planted.,Once planted, we use grass or rice straw,to cover the soil,so that all the water which goes into irrigation,doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere.,And using these simple improvisations,,today we can make a forest,for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone. 
 Today, we are making forests in houses,,in schools, even in factories with the corporates.,But that's not enough.,There is a huge number of people,who want to take matters into their own hands.,So we let it happen.,Today, we are working on an Internet-based platform,where we are going to share our methodology,on an open source,using which anyone and everyone,can make their own forest,without our physical presence being there,,using our methodology.,At the click of a button,,they can get to know all the native species,of their place.,By installing a small hardware probe on site,,we can do remote soil testing,,using which we can give step-by-step instructions,on forest-making remotely.,Also we can monitor the growth of this forest,without being on site. 
 This methodology, I believe,,has a potential.,By sharing, we can actuallynbring back our native forests.,Now, when you go back home,,if you see a barren piece of land,,do remember that it can be a potential forest. 
 Thank you very much. Thanks. 
 (Applause)There are 39 million people in the world,who are blind.,Eighty percent of them,are living in low-income countries such as Kenya,,and the absolute majority,do not need to be blind.,They are blind from diseases,that are either completely curable or preventable. 
 Knowing this, with my young family,,we moved to Kenya.,We secured equipment,,funds, vehicles, we trained a team,,we set up a hundred clinics throughout,the Great Rift Valley,to try and understand a single question:,why are people going blind,,and what can we do? 
 The challenges were great.,When we got to where we were going,,we set up our high-tech equipment.,Power was rarely available.,We'd have to run our equipment,from petrol power generators.,And then something occurred to me:,There has to be an easier way,,because it's the patients who are the most in need,of access to eye care,who are the least likely to get it. 
 More people in Kenya,,and in sub-Saharan Africa,,have access to a mobile phone,than they do clean running water.,So we said, could we harness,the power of mobile technology,to deliver eye care in a new way?,And so we developed Peek,,a smartphone [system] that enables,community healthcare workers,and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.,We set about replacingntraditional hospital equipment,,which is bulky, expensive and fragile,,with smartphone apps and hardware,that make it possible to test anyone,in any language and of any age.,Here we have a demonstration,of a three-month-old having their vision,accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker. 
 We've got many trials going on,in the community and in schools,,and through the lessons thatnwe've learned in the field,,we've realized it's extremely important,to share the data in non-medical jargon,so that people understand,what we're examining and what that means to them.,So here, for example,,we use our sight sim application,,once your vision has been measured,,to show carers and teachers,what the visual world is like for that person,,so they can empathize with them and help them. 
 Once we've discovered somebody has low vision,,the next big challenge is to work out why,,and to be able to do that,,we need to have access to the inside of the eye.,Traditionally, this requires expensive equipment,to examine an area called the retina.,The retina is the single part of the eye that has,huge amounts of information about the body,and its health.,We've developed 3D-printed,,low-cost hardware,that comes in at less than five dollars to produce,,which can then be clipped onto a smartphone,and makes it possible to get views,of the back of the eye,of a very high quality.,And the beauty is, anybody can do it.,In our trials on over two and half thousand people,,the smartphone with the add-on clip,is comparable to a camera,that is hugely more expensive,and hugely more difficult to transport. 
 When we first moved to Kenya,,we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,,a team of 15 people,,and that was what wasnneeded to deliver health care.,Now, all that's needed,is a single person,on a bike with a smartphone.,And it costs just 500 dollars.,The issue of power supply,is overcome by harnessing the power of solar.,Our healthcare workers travel,with a solar-powered rucksack,which keeps the phone charged and backed up.,Now we go to the patient,rather than waiting for the patient never to come.,We go to them in their homes,and we give them the most comprehensive,,high-tech, accurate examination,,which can be delivered bynanyone with minimal training.,We can link global experts,with people in the most rural,,difficult-to-reach places,that are beyond the end of the road,,effectively putting those experts in their homes,,allowing us to make diagnoses,and make plans for treatment. 
 Project managers, hospital directors,,are able to search on our interface,by any parameter they may be interested in.,Here in Nakuru, where I've been living,,we can search for people,by whatever condition.,Here are people who are blind,from a curable condition cataract.,Each red pin depicts somebody,who is blind from a disease that is curable,and treatable, and they're locatable.,We can use bulk text messaging services,to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment. 
 What's more, we've learned that this is something,that we haven't built just for the community,but with the community.,Those blue pins that drop represent,elders, or local leaders,,that are connected to those people,who can ensure that we can find them,and arrange treatment. 
 So for patients like Mama Wangari,,who have been blind for over 10 years,and never seen her grandchildren,,for less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.,This is something that has to happen.,It's only in statistics,that people go blind by the millions.,The reality is everyone goes blind on their own.,But now, they might just be,a text message away from help. 
 (Applause) 
 And now because live demos are always a bad idea,,we're going to try a live demo. 
 (Laughter) 
 So here we have the Peek Vision app.,Okay, and what we're looking at here,,this is Sam's optic nerve,,which is a direct extension of her brain,,so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.,We can see all parts of the retina.,It makes it possible to pick up diseases,of the eye and of the body,that would not be possible without access to the eye,,and that clip-on device can be manufactured,for just a few dollars,,and people can be cured of blindness,,and I think it says a lot about us as a human race,if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.,But now we can. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I would like to share with you today,a project that has changed how I approach,and practice architecture:,the Fez River Rehabilitation Project. 
 My hometown of Fez, Morocco,,boasts one of the largest wallednmedieval cities in the world,,called the medina, nestled in a river valley.,The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.,Since the 1950s, as thenpopulation of the medina grew,,basic urban infrastructure,such as green open spaces and sewage,quickly changed and got highly stressed.,One of the biggest casualties of the situation,was the Fez River, which bisectsnthe medina in its middle,and has been considered for many centuries,as the city's very soul.,In fact, one can witness the presence,of the river's extensive water network,all throughout the city,,in places such as private and public fountains. 
 Unfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,,it has been covered little by little,by concrete slabs since 1952.,This process of erasure was coupled,with the destruction of many houses,along the river banks,to be able to make machineries,enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.,Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking,or trash yards.,Actually, the state of the river,before entering the medina is pretty healthy.,Then pollution takes its toll,,mainly due to untreated sewage,and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.,At some point, I couldn't bear,the desecration of the river,,such an important part of my city,,and I decided to take action,,especially after I heard that the city,received a grant to divert sewage water,and to treat it. 
 With clean water, suddenly,the uncovering of the river became possible,,and with luck and actually a lot of pushing,,my partner Takako Tajima and I,were commissioned by the city tonwork with a team of engineers,to uncover the river.,However, we were sneaky,,and we proposed more:,to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,,and then to connect these pathways,back to the city fabric,,and finally to convert the urban voids,along the riverbanks into public spaces,that are lacking in the Medina of Fez.,I will show you briefly now,two of these public spaces. 
 The first one is the Rcif Plaza,,which sits actually right on top of the river,,which you can see here in dotted lines.,This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub,that actually compromised the urban integrity,of the medina, that has the largest,pedestrian network in the world.,And right beyond the historicnbridge that you can see here,,right next to the plaza,,you can see that the river looked like,a river of trash.,Instead, what we proposed is to make,the plaza entirely pedestrian,,to cover it with recycled leather canopies,,and to connect it to the banks of the river. 
 The second site of intervention,is also an urban void along the river banks,,and it used to be an illegal parking,,and we proposed to transform it,into the first playground in the medina.,The playground is constructed using recycled tires,and also is coupled with a constructed wetland,that not only cleans the water of the river,but also retains it when floods occur. 
 As the project progressed andnreceived several design awards,,new stakeholders intervened,and changed the project goals and design.,The only way for us to be able to bring,the main goals of the project ahead,was for us to do something very unusual,that usually architects don't do.,It was for us to take our design ego,and our sense of authorship,and put it in the backseat,and to focus mainly on being activists,and on trying to coalesce,all of the agendas of stakeholders,and focus on the main goals of the project:,that is, to uncover the river, treat its water,,and provide public spaces for all.,We were actually very lucky,,and many of those goals happened,or are in the process of happening.,Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.,This is how it looked like about six years ago.,This is how it looks like today.,It's still under construction,,but actually it is heavily used,by the local population.,And finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like,when the project is completed.,This is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.,Then after many years of work,,the river with clean water, uncovered.,And finally, you can see here the river,when the project will be completed. 
 So for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation,will keep on changing and adapting,to the sociopolitical landscape of the city,,but we strongly believe that by reimagining,the role and the agency of the architect,,we have set up the core ideanof the project into motion;,that is, to transform the river from sewage,to public space for all,,thereby making sure that the city of Fez,will remain a living city for its inhabitants,rather than a mummified heritage. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I was born and raised in Sierra Leone,,a small and very beautiful country,in West Africa,,a country rich both in physical resources,and creative talent. 
 However, Sierra Leone is infamous,for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s,when entire villages were burnt down.,An estimated 8,000 men, women and children,had their arms and legs amputated during this time.,As my family and I ran for safety,when I was about 12 from one of those attacks,,I resolved that I would do everything I could,to ensure that my own children,would not go through the nsame experiences we had.,They would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone,where war and amputation,were no longer a strategy for gaining power. 
 As I watched people who I knew, loved ones,,recover from this devastation,,one thing that deeply troubled me,was that many of the amputees in the country,would not use their prostheses.,The reason, I would come to find out,,was that their prosthetic sockets,were painful because they did not fit well.,The prosthetic socket is the part,in which the amputee inserts their residual limb,,and which connects to the prosthetic ankle.,Even in the developed world,,it takes a period of three weeks to often years,for a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever.,Prosthetists still use conventional processes,like molding and casting,to create single-material prosthetic sockets.,Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts,of pressure on the limbs of the patient,,leaving them with pressure sores and blisters.,It does not matter,how powerful your prosthetic ankle is.,If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,,you will not use your leg,,and that is just simply unacceptable in our age. 
 So one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr,about two and a half years ago,,and he asked me if I knew nhow to solve this problem,,I said, "No, not yet,,but I would love to figure it out.",And so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,,I designed custom prosthetic sockets,quickly and cheaply,that are more comfortable,than conventional prostheses.,I used magnetic resonance imaging,to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,,then use finite element modeling to better predict,the internal stresses and strains,on the normal forces,,and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.,We use a 3D printer to create,a multi-material prosthetic socket,which relieves pressure where needed,on the anatomy of the patient.,In short, we're using data,to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.,In a recent trial we just wrapped up,at the Media Lab,,one of our patients, a U.S. veteran,who has been an amputee for about 20 years,and worn dozens of legs,,said of one of our printed parts,,"It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,,and it's effing sexy.",(Laughter) 
 Disability in our age,should not prevent anyone,from living meaningful lives.,My hope and desire is that the tools and processes,we develop in our research group,can be used to bring highly functional prostheses,to those who need them.,For me, a place to begin healing the souls,of those affected by war and disease,is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces,for their bodies.,Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston,,I hope this not only restores,but indeed transforms theirnsense of human potential. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)As a little girl, I always imagined,I would one day run away.,From the age of six on,,I kept a packed bag with some clothes,and cans of food tucked away,in the back of a closet.,There was a deep restlessness in me,,a primal fear that I would fall prey,to a life of routine and boredom.,And so, many of my early memories involved,intricate daydreams wherenI would walk across borders,,forage for berries,,and meet all kinds of strange people,living unconventional lives on the road. 
 Years have passed, but many of the adventures,I fantasized about as a child --,traveling and weaving my way,between worlds other than my own —,have become realities through my work,as a documentary photographer.,But no other experience has felt as true,to my childhood dreams,as living amongst and documenting the lives,of fellow wanderers across the United States.,This is the nomadic dream,,a different kind of American dream,lived by young hobos, travelers,,hitchhikers, vagrants and tramps. 
 In most of our minds,,the vagabond is a creature from the past.,The word "hobo" conjures up an old,black and white image,of a weathered old man covered in coal,,legs dangling out of a boxcar,,but these photographs are in color,,and they portray a community,swirling across the country,,fiercely alive and creatively free,,seeing sides of America that no one else,gets to see. 
 Like their predecessors, today's nomads,travel the steel and asphalt arteries,of the United States.,By day, they hop freight trains,nstick out their thumbs,,and ride the highways with anyone,from truckers to soccer moms.,By night, they sleep beneath the stars,,huddled together with their packs of dogs,,cats and pet rats between their bodies. 
 Some travelers take to the road by choice,,renouncing materialism, traditional jobs,and university degrees in exchange nfor a glimmer of adventure.,Others come from the underbelly of society,,never given a chance to mobilize upwards:,foster care dropouts, teenage runaways escaping,abuse and unforgiving homes. 
 Where others see stories of privation,and economic failure,,travelers view their own existence,through the prism of liberation and freedom.,They'd rather live off of the excess,of what they view as a wasteful consumer society,than slave away at an unrealistic chance,at the traditional American dream.,They take advantage of the fact,that in the United States,,up to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage,by scavenging for perfectly good produce,in dumpsters and trash cans.,They sacrifice material comforts in exchange,for the space and the time to explore,a creative interior,,to dream, to read, to work on music, art and writing. 
 But there are many aspects to this life,that are far from idyllic.,No one loses their inner demons,by taking to the road.,Addiction is real, the elements are real,,freight trains maim and kill,,and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest,to the exhaustive list of laws,that criminalize homeless existence.,Who here knows that in many cities,across the United States it is now illegal,to sit on the sidewalk,,to wrap oneself in a blanket,,to sleep in your own car,,to offer food to a stranger?,I know about these laws because I've watched,as friends and other travelers,were hauled off to jail or received citations,for committing these so-called crimes. 
 Many of you might be wondering why anyone,would choose a life like this,,under the thumb of discriminatory laws,,eating out of trash cans,,sleeping under bridges,,picking up seasonal jobs here and there.,The answer to such a question is as varied,as the people that take to the road,,but travelers often respond with a single word:,freedom.,Until we live in a society where every human,is assured dignity in their labor,so that they can work to live well,,not only work to survive,,there will always be an element of those,who seek the open road as a means of escape,,of liberation and, of course, of rebellion. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm assuming everyone here has watched,a TED Talk online at one time or another, right?,So what I'm going to do is play this.,This is the song from the TED Talks online.,(Music),And I'm going to slow it down,because things sound cooler when they're slower.,(Music),Ken Robinson: Good morning. How are you?,Mark Applebaum: I'm going to --nKate Stone: -- mix some music.,MA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story.,Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before.,KS: I have a crossfader.,Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer.,KS: Two D.J. decks.,Chris Anderson: You turn up the ndials, the wheel starts to turn.,Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music.,Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody nor a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?,Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything nthat's going on inside my body.,Adam Ockelford: In your brain is nthis amazing musical computer.,MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create nworks. It's a language that's still evolving.,And the 21st century.,KR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque.,You will know what this person nis doing: moving to the music.,Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part.,MA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important.,TM: We all love music a great deal.,MTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches.,Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It nis new music created from old music.,Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly.,Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes.,MTT: What happens when the music stops?,KS: Yay!,(Applause),MR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks.,When I was first asked to speak at TED,,I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,,so yeah, I immediately startednwatching tons of TED Talks,,which is pretty much absolutely,the worst thing that you can do,because you start to go into panic mode, thinking,,I haven't mounted a successfulnexpedition to the North Pole yet.,Neither have I provided electricity,to my village through sheer ingenuity.,In fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my life,DJing in night clubs,and producing pop records. 
 But I still kept watching the videos,,because I'm a masochist,,and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas,and Tod Machover, and seeing,their visceral passion talking about music,,it definitely stirred something in me,,and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly,about the power of music.,And I started to write down on these little note cards,every time I heard something,that struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,,or something that I thought I could use,,and pretty soon, my studio looked like this,,kind of like a John Nash, "Beautiful Mind" vibe. 
 The other good thing about watching TED Talks,,when you see a really good one,,you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker,was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.,They seem like a nice person.,You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.,You'd certainly learn a lot.,And every now and then they'd chide you,,when they got frustrated that you couldn't really,keep up with half of the technical thingsnthey're banging on about all the time.,But then they'd remember thatnyou're but a mere human,of ordinary, mortal intelligence,that didn't finish university,,and they'd kind of forgive you,,and pet you like the dog.,(Laughter) 
 Man, yeah, back to the real world,,probably Sir Ken Robinson and I,are not going to end up being best of friends.,He lives all the way in L.A.nand I imagine is quite busy,,but through the tools available to me -- technology,and the innate way that I approach making music --,I can sort of bully our existences,into a shared event,,which is sort of what you saw.,I can hear something that I love in a piece of media,and I can co-opt it,and insert myself in that narrative,,or alter it, even. 
 In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do,with these things, but more importantly,,that's what the past 30 years of music has been.,That's the major thread.,See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,,and they changed everything overnight.,All of a sudden, artists could sample,from anything and everything that came before them,,from a snare drum from the Funky Meters,,to a Ron Carter bassline,,the theme to "The Price Is Right.",Albums like De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising",and the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique",looted from decades of recorded music,to create these sonic, layered masterpieces,that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.,And they weren't sampling these records,because they were too lazy to write their own music.,They weren't sampling these records to cash in on,the familiarity of the original stuff.,To be honest, it was all about sampling,really obscure things,,except for a few obvious exceptions,like Vanilla Ice and "doo doo doo da da doo doo",that we know about.,But the thing is,,they were sampling those records,because they heard something in that music,that spoke to them,that they instantly wanted to inject themselves,into the narrative of that music.,They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it,,and all of a sudden they found themselves,in possession of the technology to do so,,not much unlike the way the Delta blues,struck a chord with the Stonesnand the Beatles and Clapton,,and they felt the need to co-opt that music,for the tools of their day.,You know, in music we take something that we love,and we build on it. 
 I'd like to play a song for you. 
 (Music: "La Di Da Di" by Doug E. Fresh & Slick Rick) 
 That's "La Di Da Di" and it's the fifth-most sampled,song of all time.,It's been sampled 547 times.,It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop,,Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh,,and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.,I do hope that comes back soon. 
 Anyway, this predated the sampling era.,There were no samples in this record,,although I did look up on the Internet last night,,I mean several months ago,,that "La Di Da Di" means, it's an old,Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England,,so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore,from "Downton Abbey" coming soon,,or that's for another day. 
 Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box.,Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,,and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,,super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites,and samples for future pop records. 
 That was 1984.,This is me in 1984, in case you were wondering,how I was doing, thank you for asking.,It's Throwback Thursday already.,I was involved in a heavy love affair,with the music of Duran Duran,,as you can probably tell from my outfit.,I was in the middle.,And the simplest way that I knew,how to co-opt myself into that experience,of wanting to be in that song somehow,was to just get a band togethernof fellow nine-year-olds,and play "Wild Boys" at the school talent show.,So that's what we did, and long story short,,we were booed off the stage,,and if you ever have a chance to live your life,escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium,full of second- and third-graders booing,,I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.,But it didn't really matter,,because what I wanted somehow,was to just be in the historynof that song for a minute.,I didn't care who liked it.,I just loved it, and I thoughtnI could put myself in there. 
 Over the next 10 years, "La Di Da Di",continues to be sampled by countless records,,ending up on massive hits liken"Here Comes the Hotstepper",and "I Wanna Sex You Up.",Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song,on his debut album "Doggystyle"nand calls it "Lodi Dodi.",Copyright lawyers are havingna field day at this point.,And then you fast forward to 1997,,and the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie,,reinterprets "La Di Da Di",on his number one hit called "Hypnotize,",which I will play a little bit of,and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick,to show you where they got it from. 
 (Music: "Hypnotize" by The Notorious B.I.G.) 
 So Biggie was killed,weeks before that song made it to number one,,in one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era,,but he would have been 13 years old,and very much alive whenn"La Di Da Di" first came out,,and as a young boy,growing up in Brooklyn,,it's hard not to think that that song probably held,some fond memories for him.,But the way he interpreted it, as you hear,,is completely his own.,He flips it, makes it,,there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.,It's thoroughly modern Biggie.,I had to make that joke in this room,,because you would be the only peoplenthat I'd ever have a chance of getting it.,And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter) 
 Elsewhere in the pop and rap world,,we're going a little bit sample-crazy.,We're getting away from the obscurensamples that we were doing,,and all of a sudden everyone's taking,these massive '80s tunes like Bowie, "Let's Dance,",and all these disco records,nand just rapping on them.,These records don't really age that well.,You don't hear them now, because they borrowed,from an era that was too steeped,in its own connotation.,You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale.,It leaves the listener feeling sickly. 
 You have to take an element of those things,and then bring something fresh and new to it,,which was something that I learned,when I was working with the late,,amazing Amy Winehouse,on her album "Back to Black.",A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album,that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,,achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,,but without the very, very 21st-century personality,and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse,and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore,and even a mention of Slick Rick,,the whole thing would have run the risk,of being very pastiche, to be honest.,Imagine any other singer from that era over it,singing the same old lyrics.,It runs a risk of being completely bland.,I mean, there was no doubt that Amy,and I and Salaam all had this love,for this gospel, soul and blues and jazz,that was evident listening tonthe musical arrangements.,She brought the ingredients that made it urgent,and of the time. 
 So if we come all the way up to the present day now,,the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus,,she reinterprets "La Di Da Di",completely for her generation,,and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part,and then see how she sort of flipped it.,(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Slick Rick & Doug E. Fresh),(Music: "We Can't Stop" by Miley Cyrus),So Miley Cyrus,,who wasn't even born yetnwhen "La Di Da Di" was made,,and neither were any of the co-writers on the song,,has found this song that somehow,etched its way into the collectivenconsciousness of pop music,,and now, with its timeless playfulness of the original,,has kind of translated to a whole new generation,who will probably co-opt it as their own. 
 Since the dawn of the sampling era,,there's been endless debate,about the validity of music that contains samples.,You know, the Grammy committee says that,if your song contains some kind of pre-written,or pre-existing music,,you're ineligible for song of the year.,Rockists, who are racist,but only about rock music,,constantly use the argument to —,That's a real word. That is a real word.,They constantly use the argument to devalue rap,and modern pop,,and these arguments completely miss the point,,because the dam has burst.,We live in the post-sampling era.,We take the things that we love,and we build on them.,That's just how it goes.,And when we really addnsomething significant and original,and we merge our musical journey with this,,then we have a chance to be,a part of the evolution of that music that we love,and be linked with it once itnbecomes something new again. 
 So I would like to do one more piece,that I put together for you tonight,,and it takes place with two,pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.,One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,,who happens to be a blind,,autistic genius at the piano,,and Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldier,from the South Sudan,,who is a spoken word poet and rapper.,And once again I found a way to annoyingly,me-me-me myself into the musical history,of these songs,,but I can't help it,,because they're these things that I love,,and I want to mess around with them.,So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go. 
 Let's hear that TED sound again, right? 
 (Music) 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was born in Taiwan.,I grew up surrounded by,different types of hardware stores,,and I like going to night markets.,I love the energy of the night markets,,the colors, the lights, the toys,,and all the unexpected things I find every time I go,,things like watermelon with straw antennas,or puppies with mohawks.,When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart,,any kind of toys I'd find around the house,,like my brother's BB gun when he's not home. 
 I also liked to make environments,for people to explore and play.,In these early installations,,I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags,,and things I would find in the hardware store,or around the house.,I would take things like highlighter pen,,mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing,,creating these glowing circulatory systems,for people to walk through and enjoy.,I like these materials because of the way they look,,the way they feel, and they're very affordable. 
 I also liked to make devicesnthat work with body parts.,I would take camera LED lights,and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist,and I would videotape my belly button,,get a different perspective,,and see what it does.,(Laughter) 
 I also like to modify household appliances.,This is an automatic night light.,Some of you might have them at home.,I would cut out the light sensor,,add an extension line,,and use modeling clay,,stick it onto the television,,and then I would videotape my eye,,and using the dark part of my eye,tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time,,so you turn on the lightbulb.,The white of the eye and the eyelid,will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime,,and it will shut off the light. 
 I wanted to collect more different types of eyes,,so I built this device using bicycle helmets,,some lightbulbs and television sets.,It would be easier for othernpeople to wear the helmet,and record their eyes.,This device allows me to symbolically,extract other people's eyes,,so I have a diversity of eyes to use,for my other sculptures.,This sculpture has four eyes.,Each eye is controlling a different device.,This eye is turning itself around in a television.,This eye is inflating a plastic tube.,This eye is watching a videonof another piece being made.,And these two eyes are activating glowing water.,Many of these pieces are later on shown,in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions,around the world. 
 I love science and biology.,In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship,at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum,looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.,I love these creatures. I love thenway they look, the way they feel.,They're soft, they're slimy,,and I was fascinated by the way they use light,in their environment,,either to attract mates, for self-defense,,or to attract food.,This research inspired mynwork in many different ways,,things like movement or different light patterns.,So I started gathering a lot of,different types of material in my studio,and just experimenting,and trying this out, trying that out,,and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.,I used a lot of computer cooling fans,and just kind of put themntogether and see what happens.,This is an 8,000-square-foot installation,composed of many different creatures,,some hanging from the ceilingnand some resting on the floor.,From afar, they look alien-like,,but when you look closer,,they're all made out of black garbage bags,or Tupperware containers. 
 I'd like to share with you how ordinary things,can become something magical and wondrous.,(Applause),Thank you.,(Applause)It was less than a year after September 11,,and I was at the Chicago Tribune,writing about shootings and murders,,and it was leaving me feeling,pretty dark and depressed.,I had done some activism in college,,so I decided to help a local group,hang door knockers against animal testing.,I thought it would be a safe way,to do something positive,,but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,,and we were all arrested.,Police took this blurry photo of me,holding leaflets as evidence. 
 My charges were dismissed,,but a few weeks later,,two FBI agents knocked on my door,,and they told me that unless I helped them,by spying on protest groups,,they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.,I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,,but I was terrified,,and when my fear subsided,,I became obsessed with finding out,how this happened,,how animal rights and environmental activists,who have never injured anyone,could become the FBI's number one,domestic terrorism threat. 
 A few years later, I was invited to testify,before Congress about my reporting,,and I told lawmakers that, while everybody,is talking about going green,,some people are risking their lives,to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.,They're physically putting their bodies on the line,between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.,These are everyday people,,like these protesters in Italy,who spontaneously climbed over,barbed wire fences to rescue beagles,from animal testing.,And these movements have been incredibly effective,and popular,,so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,,eco-terrorist,,to shift how we view them.,They just made it up. 
 Now these companies have backed new laws,like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,,which turns activism into terrorism,if it causes a loss of profits.,Now most people never even heard about this law,,including members of Congress.,Less than one percent were in the room,when it passed the House.,The rest were outside at a new memorial.,They were praising Dr. King,as his style of activism was branded as terrorism,if done in the name of animals or the environment. 
 Supporters say laws like this are needed,for the extremists:,the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.,But right now, companies like TransCanada,are briefing police in presentations like this one,about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters,as terrorists.,The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism,are not about violence,,they're about public relations.,Today, in multiple countries,,corporations are pushing new laws,that make it illegal to photograph,animal cruelty on their farms.,The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,,and today we released a lawsuit,challenging it as unconstitutional,as a threat to journalism. 
 The first of these ag-gag prosecutions,,as they're called,,was a young woman named Amy Meyer,,and Amy saw a sick cow being moved,by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse,as she was on the public street.,And Amy did what any of us would:,She filmed it.,When I found out about her story, I wrote about it,,and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar,that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges. 
 But apparently, even exposing stuff like that,is a threat.,Through the Freedom of Information Act,,I learned that the counter-terrorism unit,has been monitoring my articles,and speeches like this one.,They even included this nicenlittle write-up of my book.,They described it as "compelling and well-written.",(Applause),Blurb on the next book, right? 
 The point of all of this is to make us afraid,,but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith,in the power of education.,Our best weapon is sunlight. 
 Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man,is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.,Over and over throughout history,,people in power have used fear,to silence the truth and to silence dissent.,It's time we strike a new note. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,,fathers are usually known by their sons,,but I'm one of the few fathers,who is known by his daughter,,and I am proud of it. 
 (Applause) 
 Malala started her campaign for education,and stood for her rights in 2007,,and when her efforts were honored in 2011,,and she was given the national youth peace prize,,and she became a very famous,,very popular young girl of her country.,Before that, she was my daughter,,but now I am her father.,Ladies and gentlemen,,if we glance to human history,,the story of women,is the story of injustice,,inequality,,violence and exploitation.,You see,,in patriarchal societies,,right from the very beginning,,when a girl is born,,her birth is not celebrated.,She is not welcomed,,neither by father nor by mother.,The neighborhood comes,and commiserates with the mother,,and nobody congratulates the father.,And a mother is very uncomfortable,for having a girl child.,When she gives birth to the first girl child,,first daughter, she is sad.,When she gives birth to the second daughter,,she is shocked,,and in the expectation of a son,,when she gives birth to a third daughter,,she feels guilty like a criminal. 
 Not only the mother suffers,,but the daughter, the newly born daughter,,when she grows old,,she suffers too.,At the age of five,,while she should be going to school,,she stays at home,and her brothers are admitted in a school.,Until the age of 12, somehow,,she has a good life.,She can have fun.,She can play with her friends in the streets,,and she can move around in the streets,like a butterfly.,But when she enters her teens,,when she becomes 13 years old,,she is forbidden to go out of her home,without a male escort.,She is confined under the four walls of her home.,She is no more a free individual.,She becomes the so-called honor,of her father and of her brothers,and of her family,,and if she transgresses,the code of that so-called honor,,she could even be killed. 
 And it is also interesting that this so-called,code of honor,,it does not only affect the life of a girl,,it also affects the life,of the male members of the family.,I know a family of seven sisters and one brother,,and that one brother,,he has migrated to the Gulf countries,,to earn a living for his seven sisters,and parents,,because he thinks that it will be humiliating,if his seven sisters learn a skill,and they go out of the home,and earn some livelihood.,So this brother,,he sacrifices the joys of his life,and the happiness of his sisters,at the altar of so-called honor. 
 And there is one more norm,of the patriarchal societies,that is called obedience.,A good girl is supposed to be,very quiet, very humble,and very submissive.,It is the criteria.,The role model good girl should be very quiet.,She is supposed to be silent,and she is supposed to accept the decisions,of her father and mother,and the decisions of elders,,even if she does not like them.,If she is married to a man she doesn't like,or if she is married to an old man,,she has to accept,,because she does not want to be dubbed,as disobedient.,If she is married very early,,she has to accept.,Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.,And what happens at the end?,In the words of a poetess,,she is wedded, bedded,,and then she gives birthnto more sons and daughters.,And it is the irony of the situation,that this mother,,she teaches the same lesson of obedience,to her daughter,and the same lesson of honor to her sons.,And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,this plight of millions of women,could be changed,if we think differently,,if women and men think differently,,if men and women in thentribal and patriarchal societies,in the developing countries,,if they can break a few norms,of family and society,,if they can abolish the discriminatory laws,of the systems in their states,,which go against the basic human rights,of the women. 
 Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,,and for the first time,,believe me,,I don't like newborn children, to be honest,,but when I went and I looked into her eyes,,believe me,,I got extremely honored.,And long before she was born,,I thought about her name,,and I was fascinated with a heroic,legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.,Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,,and I named my daughter after her.,A few days after Malala was born,,my daughter was born,,my cousin came --,and it was a coincidence --,he came to my home,and he brought a family tree,,a family tree of the Yousafzai family,,and when I looked at the family tree,,it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.,But when I looked, all were men,,and I picked my pen,,drew a line from my name,,and wrote, "Malala." 
 And when she grow old,,when she was four and a half years old,,I admitted her in my school.,You will be asking, then, why should I mention about,the admission of a girl in a school?,Yes, I must mention it.,It may be taken for granted in Canada,,in America, in many developed countries,,but in poor countries,,in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,,it's a big event for the life of girl.,Enrollment in a school means,recognition of her identity and her name.,Admission in a school means,that she has entered the world of dreams,and aspirations,where she can explore her potentials,for her future life.,I have five sisters,,and none of them could go to school,,and you will be astonished,,two weeks before,,when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,,and I was filling out the family part of the form,,I could not recall,the surnames of some of my sisters.,And the reason was,that I have never, never seen the names,of my sisters written on any document.,That was the reason that,I valued my daughter.,What my father could not give to my sisters,and to his daughters,,I thought I must change it. 
 I used to appreciate the intelligence,and the brilliance of my daughter.,I encouraged her to sit with me,when my friends used to come.,I encouraged her to go withnme to different meetings.,And all these good values,,I tried to inculcate in her personality.,And this was not only she, only Malala.,I imparted all these good values,to my school, girl students nand boy students as well.,I used education for emancipation.,I taught my girls,,I taught my girl students,,to unlearn the lesson of obedience.,I taught my boy students,to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor. 
 Dear brothers and sisters,,we were striving for more rights for women,,and we were struggling to have more,,more and more space for the women in society.,But we came across a new phenomenon.,It was lethal to human rights,and particularly to women's rights.,It was called Talibanization.,It means a complete negation,of women's participation,in all political, economical and social activities.,Hundreds of schools were lost.,Girls were prohibited from going to school.,Women were forced to wear veils,and they were stopped from going to the markets.,Musicians were silenced,,girls were flogged,and singers were killed.,Millions were suffering,,but few spoke,,and it was the most scary thing,when you have all around such people,who kill and who flog,,and you speak for your rights.,It's really the most scary thing. 
 At the age of 10,,Malala stood, and she stood for the right,of education.,She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,,she volunteered herself,for the New York Times documentaries,,and she spoke from every platform she could.,And her voice was the most powerful voice.,It spread like a crescendo all around the world.,And that was the reason the Taliban,could not tolerate her campaign,,and on October 9 2012,,she was shot in the head at point blank range. 
 It was a doomsday for my family and for me.,The world turned into a big black hole.,While my daughter was,on the verge of life and death,,I whispered into the ears of my wife,,"Should I be blamed for what happened,to my daughter and your daughter?" 
 And she abruptly told me,,"Please don't blame yourself.,You stood for the right cause.,You put your life at stake,for the cause of truth,,for the cause of peace,,and for the cause of education,,and your daughter in inspired from you,and she joined you.,You both were on the right path,and God will protect her." 
 These few words meant a lot to me,,and I didn't ask this question again. 
 When Malala was in the hospital,,and she was going through the severe pains,and she had had severe headaches,because her facial nerve was cut down,,I used to see a dark shadow,spreading on the face of my wife.,But my daughter never complained.,She used to tell us,,"I'm fine with my crooked smile,and with my numbness in my face.,I'll be okay. Please don't worry.",She was a solace for us,,and she consoled us. 
 Dear brothers and sisters,,we learned from her how to be resilient,in the most difficult times,,and I'm glad to share with you,that despite being an icon,for the rights of children and women,,she is like any 16-year old girl.,She cries when her homework is incomplete.,She quarrels with her brothers,,and I am very happy for that. 
 People ask me,,what special is in my mentorship,which has made Malala so bold,and so courageous and so vocal and poised?,I tell them, don't ask me what I did.,Ask me what I did not do.,I did not clip her wings, and that's all. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)These are simple objects:,clocks, keys, combs, glasses.,They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia,carried with them on their final journey.,We are all familiar with these mundane,,everyday objects.,The fact that some of the victims carried,personal items such asntoothpaste and a toothbrush,is a clear sign they had no idea,what was about to happen to them.,Usually, they were told that they were going to be,exchanged for prisoners of war. 
 These items have been recovered,from numerous mass graves across my homeland,,and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies,from newly discovered mass graves,,20 years after the war.,And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.,During the four years of conflict,that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,,approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,,went missing, presumed killed,,and another 100,000 were killed,during combat operations.,Most of them were killed,either in the early days of the war,or towards the end of the hostilities,,when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica,fell into the hands of the Serb army. 
 The international criminal tribunal,delivered a number of sentences,for crimes against humanity and genocide.,Genocide is a systematic and deliberate,destruction of a racial, political, religious,or ethnic group.,As much as genocide is about killing.,It is also about destroying their property,,their cultural heritage,,and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.,Genocide is not only about the killing;,it is about the denied identity.,There are always traces —,no such thing as a perfect crime.,There are always remnants of the perished ones,that are more durable than their fragile bodies,and our selective and fading memory of them. 
 These items are recovered,from numerous mass graves,,and the main goal of this collection of the items,is a unique process,of identifying those who disappeared in the killings,,the first act of genocide on European soil,since the Holocaust.,Not a single body should remain undiscovered,or unidentified.,Once recovered,,these items that the victims carried with them,on their way to execution,are carefully cleaned, analyzed,,catalogued and stored.,Thousands of artifacts arenpacked in white plastic bags,just like the ones you see on CSI.,These objects are used as a forensic tool,in visual identification of the victims,,but they are also used asnvery valuable forensic evidence,in the ongoing war crimes trials.,Survivors are occasionally called,to try to identify these items physically,,but physical browsing is extremely difficult,,an ineffective and painful process.,Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers,are done with these objects,,they become orphans of the narrative.,Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not,,or they get simply shelved,,out of sight and out of mind. 
 I decided a few years ago,to photograph every single exhumed item,in order to create a visual archive,that survivors could easily browse.,As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.,I like to move beyond raising awareness.,And in this case, someone may,recognize these items,or at least their photographs will remain,as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder,of what happened.,Photography is about empathy,,and the familiarity of thesenitems guarantee empathy.,In this case, I am merely a tool,,a forensic, if you like,,and the result is a photography that is as close,as possible of being a document. 
 Once all the missing persons are identified,,only decaying bodies in their graves,and these everyday items will remain.,In all their simplicity,,these items are the last testament,to the identity of the victims,,the last permanent reminder,that these people ever existed. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)If you look deep into the night sky,,you see stars,,and if you look further, you see more stars,,and further, galaxies, and nfurther, more galaxies.,But if you keep looking further and further,,eventually you see nothing for a long while,,and then finally you see anfaint, fading afterglow,,and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang. 
 Now, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe,when everything we see in the night sky,was condensed into an incredibly small,,incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,,and from it sprung everything we see. 
 Now, we've mapped that afterglow,with great precision,,and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.,We've mapped the afterglow,with spectacular precision,,and one of the shocks about it,is that it's almost completely uniform.,Fourteen billion light years that way,and 14 billion light years that way,,it's the same temperature.,Now it's been 14 billion years,since that Big Bang,,and so it's got faint and cold.,It's now 2.7 degrees.,But it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.,It's only 2.7 degrees to about,10 parts in a million.,Over here, it's a little hotter,,and over there, it's a little cooler,,and that's incredibly importantnto everyone in this room,,because where it was a little hotter,,there was a little more stuff,,and where there was a little more stuff,,we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies,and superclusters,and all the structure you see in the cosmos.,And those small, little, inhomogeneities,,20 parts in a million,,those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles,in that early universe that were stretched,across the size of the entire cosmos. 
 That is spectacular,,and that's not what they found on Monday;,what they found on Monday is cooler.,So here's what they found on Monday:,Imagine you take a bell,,and you whack the bell with a hammer.,What happens? It rings.,But if you wait, that ringing fades,and fades and fades,until you don't notice it anymore.,Now, that early universe was incredibly dense,,like a metal, way denser,,and if you hit it, it would ring,,but the thing ringing would be,the structure of space-time itself,,and the hammer would be quantum mechanics.,What they found on Monday,was evidence of the ringing,of the space-time of the early universe,,what we call gravitational waves,from the fundamental era,,and here's how they found it.,Those waves have long since faded.,If you go for a walk,,you don't wiggle.,Those gravitational waves in the structure of space,are totally invisible for all practical purposes.,But early on, when the universe was making,that last afterglow,,the gravitational waves,put little twists in the structure,of the light that we see.,So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper --,in fact, these guys spentnthree years on the South Pole,looking straight up through the coldest, clearest,,cleanest air they possibly could find,looking deep into the night sky and studying,that glow and looking for the faint twists,which are the symbol, the signal,,of gravitational waves,,the ringing of the early universe.,And on Monday, they announced,that they had found it. 
 And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me,is not just the ringing, though that is awesome.,The thing that's totally amazing,,the reason I'm on this stage, is because,what that tells us is somethingndeep about the early universe.,It tells us that we,and everything we see around us,are basically one large bubble --,and this is the idea of inflation—,one large bubble surrounded by something else.,This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,,but anything that isn't inflation that explains this,will look the same.,This is a theory, an idea,,that has been around for a while,,and we never thought we we'd really see it.,For good reasons, we thought we'd never see,killer evidence, and this is killer evidence. 
 But the really crazy idea,is that our bubble is just one bubble,in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.,We're never going to see the stuff outside,,but by going to the South Polenand spending three years,looking at the detailed structure of the night sky,,we can figure out,that we're probably in a universenthat looks kind of like that.,And that amazes me. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: So, this is anninterview with a difference.,On the basis that a picturenis worth a thousand words,,what I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda,to dig out from their archive,some images that would help explain,some of what they've done,,and do a few things that way. 
 So, we're going to start here.,Melinda, when and where was this,,and who is that handsome man next to you? 
 Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?,This is in Africa, our very first trip,,the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,,in the fall of 1993.,We were already engaged to be married.,We married a few months later,,and this was the trip where we really went to see,the animals and to see the savanna.,It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time,off from work.,But what really touched us, actually, were the people,,and the extreme poverty.,We started asking ourselves questions.,Does it have to be like this?,And at the end of the trip,,we went out to Zanzibar,,and took some time to walk on the beach,,which is something we had done a lot,while we were dating.,And we'd already been talking about during that time,that the wealth that had come from Microsoft,would be given back to society,,but it was really on that beach walk,that we started to talk about, well,,what might we do and how might we go about it? 
 CA: So, given that this vacation,led to the creation of,the world's biggest private foundation,,it's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter) 
 MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it. 
 CA: Which of you was the key instigator here,,or was it symmetrical?,Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited,that there'd be a phase of our life,where we'd get to work together,and figure out how to give this money back.,At this stage, we were talking about the poorest,,and could you have a big impact on them?,Were there things that weren't being done?,There was a lot we didn't know.,Our naïveté is pretty incredible,,when we look back on it.,But we had a certain enthusiasm,that that would be the phase,,the post-Microsoft phase,would be our philanthropy. 
 MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come,after he was 60,,so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,,so some things change along the way. 
 CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.,So that was '93, and it was '97, really,,before the foundation itself started. 
 MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article,about diarrheal diseases killingnso many kids around the world,,and we kept saying to ourselves,,"Well that can't be.,In the U.S., you just go down to the drug store.",And so we started gathering scientists,and started learning about population,,learning about vaccines,,learning about what had worked and what had failed,,and that's really when we got going,,was in late 1998, 1999. 
 CA: So, you've got a big pot of money,and a world full of so many different issues.,How on Earth do you decide what to focus on? 
 BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,,whatever the biggest inequity was globally,,and there we looked at children dying,,children not having enough nutrition to ever develop,,and countries that were really stuck,,because with that level of death,,and parents would have so many kids,that they'd get huge population growth,,and that the kids were so sick,that they really couldn't be educated,and lift themselves up.,So that was our global thing,,and then in the U.S.,,both of us have had amazing educations,,and we saw that as the way that the U.S.,could live up to its promise of equal opportunity,is by having a phenomenal education system,,and the more we learned, the more we realized,we're not really fulfilling that promise.,And so we picked those two things,,and everything the foundation does,is focused there. 
 CA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image,that you like that illustrates your work,,and Melinda, this is what you picked.,What's this about? 
 MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel,is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,,whether it's Bangladesh, India,nlots of countries in Africa,,and I go in as a Western woman without a name.,I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.,And I kept hearing from women,,over and over and over, the more I traveled,,"I want to be able to use this shot.",I would be there to talk to themnabout childhood vaccines,,and they would bring the conversation around to,"But what about the shot I get?",which is an injection they werengetting called Depo-Provera,,which is a contraceptive.,And I would come back andntalk to global health experts,,and they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptives,are stocked in in the developing world.",Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,,and this is what the team came to me with,,which is, to have the number one thing,that women tell you in Africa they want to use,stocked out more than 200 days a year,explains why women were saying to me,,"I walked 10 kilometers withoutnmy husband knowing it,,and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there.",And so condoms were stocked in in Africa,because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.,and others supported.,But women will tell you over and over again,,"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.,I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,,and I need that tool because then I can space,the births of my children, and I can feed them,and have a chance of educating them." 
 CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,,and you've often been embroiled,in controversy over this issue,,and on the abortion question,,on both sides, really.,How do you navigate that? 
 MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,,which is, we had backed away from contraceptives,as a global community.,We knew that 210 million women,were saying they wanted access to contraceptives,,even the contraceptives we havenhere in the United States,,and we weren't providing them,because of the political controversy in our country,,and to me that was just a crime,,and I kept looking around trying to find the person,that would get this back on the global stage,,and I finally realized I just had to do it.,And even though I'm Catholic,,I believe in contraceptives,just like most of the Catholicnwomen in the United States,who report using contraceptives,,and I shouldn't let that controversy,be the thing that holds us back.,We used to have consensus in the United States,around contraceptives,,and so we got back to that global consensus,,and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars,around exactly this issue for women.,(Applause) 
 CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about? 
 BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.,(Laughter),I really like this graph.,This is the number of children,who die before the age of five every year.,And what you find is really,a phenomenal success story,which is not widely known,,that we are making incredible progress.,We go from 20 million,not long after I was born,to now we're down to about six million.,So this is a story,largely of vaccines.,Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.,That was eradicated, so that got down to zero.,Measles was killing a couple million a year.,That's down to a few hundred thousand.,Anyway, this is a chart,where you want to get that number to continue,,and it's going to be possible,,using the science of new vaccines,,getting the vaccines out to kids.,We can actually accelerate the progress.,The last decade,,that number has dropped faster,than ever in history,,and so I just love the fact that,you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,,we can get them out there,,use the very latest understanding of these things,,and get the delivery right, thatnwe can perform a miracle. 
 CA: I mean, you do the math on this,,and it works out, I think, literally,to thousands of kids' lives saved every day,compared to the prior year.,It's not reported.,An airliner with 200-plus deaths,is a far, far bigger story than that.,Does that drive you crazy? 
 BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.,It's a kid, one kid at a time.,Ninety-eight percent of this,has nothing to do with natural disasters,,and yet, people's charity,,when they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.,It's incredible how people think, okay,,that could be me, and the money flows.,These causes have been a bit invisible.,Now that the Millennium Development Goals,and various things are getting out there,,we are seeing some increased generosity,,so the goal is to get this well below a million,,which should be possible in our lifetime. 
 CA: Maybe it needed someone,who is turned on by numbers and graphs,rather than just the big, sad face,to get engaged.,I mean, you've used it in your letter this year,,you used basically this argument to say that aid,,contrary to the current meme,that aid is kind of worthless and broken,,that actually it has been effective. 
 BG: Yeah, well people can take,,there is some aid that was well-meaning,and didn't go well.,There's some venture capital investments,that were well-meaning and didn't go well.,You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,,because we don't have a perfect record,,this is a bad endeavor.,You should look at, what was your goal?,How are you trying to uplift nutrition,and survival and literacy,so these countries can take care of themselves,,and say wow, this is going well,,and be smarter.,We can spend aid smarter.,It is not all a panacea.,We can do better than venture capital, I think,,including big hits like this. 
 CA: Traditional wisdom is that,it's pretty hard for married couples to work together.,How have you guys managed it?,MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,,"I really don't think I could work with my husband.,That just wouldn't work out.",You know, we enjoy it, and we don't --,this foundation has been a coming to for both of us,in its continuous learning journey,,and we don't travel together as much,for the foundation, actually, as we used to,when Bill was working at Microsoft.,We have more trips wherenwe're traveling separately,,but I always know when I come home,,Bill's going to be interested in what I learned,,whether it's about women or girls,or something new about the vaccine delivery chain,,or this person that is a great leader.,He's going to listen and be really interested.,And he knows when he comes home,,even if it's to talk about the speech he did,or the data or what he's learned,,I'm really interested,,and I think we have a reallyncollaborative relationship.,But we don't every minute together, that's for sure.,(Laughter) 
 CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.,Melinda, early on, you were basically,largely running the show.,Six years ago, I guess,,Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft,and became full time.,That must have been hard,,adjusting to that. No? 
 MG: Yeah. I think actually,,for the foundation employees,,there was way more angst for them,than there was for me about Bill coming.,I was actually really excited.,I mean, Bill made this decision,even obviously before it got announced in 2006,,and it was really his decision,,but again, it was a beach vacation,where we were walking on the beach,and he was starting to think of this idea.,And for me, the excitement of Bill,putting his brain and his heart,against these huge global problems,,these inequities, to me that was exciting.,Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that.,(Applause) 
 CA: That's cool. 
 MG: But that went away within three months,,once he was there. 
 BG: Including some of the employees. 
 MG: That's what I said, the employees,,it went away for them threenmonths after you were there. 
 BG: No, I'm kidding.nMG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away. 
 BG: A few of them did, but —,(Laughter) 
 CA: So what do you guys argue about?,Sunday, 11 o'clock,,you're away from work,,what comes up? What's the argument? 
 BG: Because we built this thing,together from the beginning,,it's this great partnership.,I had that with Paul Allen,in the early days of Microsoft.,I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,,and now Melinda, and in even stronger,,equal ways, is the partner,,so we talk a lot about,which things should we give more to,,which groups are working well?,She's got a lot of insight.,She'll sit down with the employees a lot.,We'll take the different trips she described.,So there's a lot of collaboration.,I can't think of anything where one of us,had a super strong opinion,about one thing or another? 
 CA: How about you, Melinda, nthough? Can you? (Laughter),You never know. 
 MG: Well, here's the thing.,We come at things from different angles,,and I actually think that's really good.,So Bill can look at the big data,and say, "I want to act basednon these global statistics.",For me, I come at it from intuition.,I meet with lots of people on the ground,and Bill's taught me to take that,and read up to the global data and see if they match,,and I think what I've taught him,is to take that data,and meet with people on the ground to understand,,can you actually deliver that vaccine?,Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops,in her child's mouth?,Because the delivery piece,is every bit as important as the science.,So I think it's been more a coming to over time,towards each other's point of view,,and quite frankly, the work is better because of it. 
 CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,,you've had some amazing successes.,What about failure, though?,Can you talk about a failure,and maybe what you've learned from it? 
 BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,,because we've certainly had them.,We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work,that you know you're going to have different failures.,Like, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity,was asking for a better condom.,Well, we got hundreds of ideas.,Maybe a few of those will work out.,We were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug,for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,,that I thought, once I got this drug,,we can just go wipe out the disease.,Well, turns out it took an injection,every day for 10 days.,It took three more years to get it than we expected,,and then there was no way,it was going to get out there.,Fortunately, we found out,that if you go kill the sand flies,,you probably can have success there,,but we spent five years,,you could say wasted five years,,and about 60 million,,on a path that turned out to have,very modest benefit when we got there. 
 CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year,in education, I think, something like that.,Is anything, the story of what's gone right there,is quite a long and complex one.,Are there any failures that you can talk about? 
 MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us,out of the early work is we thought,that these small schools were the answer,,and small schools definitely help.,They bring down the dropout rate.,They have less violence and crime in those schools.,But the thing that we learned from that work,,and what turned out to be the fundamental key,,is a great teacher in front of the classroom.,If you don't have an effective teacher,in the front of the classroom,,I don't care how big or small the building is,,you're not going to change the trajectory,of whether that student will be ready for college.,(Applause) 
 CA: So Melinda, this is you and,your eldest daughter, Jenn.,And just taken about three weeks ago, I think,,three or four weeks ago. Where was this? 
 MG: So we went to Tanzania.,Jenn's been to Tanzania.,All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.,And we did something very different,,which is, we decided to go spend,two nights and three days with a family.,Anna and Sanare are the parents.,They invited us to come and stay in their boma.,Actually, the goats had been there, I think,,living in that particular little hut,on their little compound before we got there.,And we stayed with their family,,and we really, really learned,what life is like in rural Tanzania.,And the difference between just going,and visiting for half a day,or three quarters of a day,versus staying overnight was profound,,and so let me just give you one explanation of that.,They had six children, and as I talked to Anna,in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours,in the cooking hut that day,,and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned,and spaced with her husband,the births of their children.,It was a very loving relationship.,This was a Maasai warrior and his wife,,but they had decided to get married,,they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.,Their children, their six children,,the two in the middle were twins, 13,,a boy, and a girl named Grace.,And when we'd go out to chop wood,and do all the things that Gracenand her mother would do,,Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent,,but she wasn't an adult.,She was very, very shy.,So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.,We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.,And at night, though,,when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,,and there was no moon that night,,the first night, and no stars,,and Jenn came out of our hut,with her REI little headlamp on,,Grace went immediately,,and got the translator,,came straight up to my Jenn and said,,"When you go home,,can I have your headlamp,so I can study at night?" 
 CA: Oh, wow. 
 MG: And her dad had told me,how afraid he was that unlike the son,,who had passed his secondary exams,,because of her chores,,she'd not done so well,and wasn't in the government school yet.,He said, "I don't know how I'mngoing to pay for her education.,I can't pay for private school,,and she may end up on this farm like my wife.",So they know the difference,that an education can make,in a huge, profound way. 
 CA: I mean, this is another pic,of your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,,along with Paul Farmer.,Bringing up three children,when you're the world's richest family,seems like a social experiment,without much prior art.,How have you managed it?,What's been your approach? 
 BG: Well, I'd say overall,the kids get a great education,,but you've got to make sure,they have a sense of their own ability,and what they're going to go and do,,and our philosophy has been,to be very clear with them --,most of the money's going to the foundation --,and help them find something they're excited about.,We want to strike a balance where they have,the freedom to do anything,but not a lot of money showered on them,so they could go out and do nothing.,And so far, they're fairly diligent,,excited to pick their own direction. 
 CA: You've obviously guarded their nprivacy carefully for obvious reasons.,I'm curious why you've given me permission,to show this picture now here at TED.,MG: Well, it's interesting.,As they get older, they so know,that our family belief is about responsibility,,that we are in an unbelievable situation,just to live in the United States,and have a great education,,and we have a responsibilitynto give back to the world.,And so as they get older,and we are teaching them --,they have been to so manyncountries around the world —,they're saying,,we do want people to know that we believe,in what you're doing, Mom and Dad,,and it is okay to show us more.,So we have their permission to show this picture,,and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it,eventually in some of his work.,But they really care deeply,about the mission of the foundation, too. 
 CA: You've easily got enough money,despite your vast contributions to the foundation,to make them all billionaires.,Is that your plan for them? 
 BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.,They need to have a sense,that their own work is meaningful and important.,We read an article long, actually,nbefore we got married,,where Warren Buffett talked about that,,and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor,either to society or to the kids. 
 CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,,something really amazing happened in 2006,,when somehow your only real rival,for richest person in America,suddenly turned around and agreed to give,80 percent of his fortune,to your foundation.,How on Earth did that happen?,I guess there's a long versionnand a short version of that.,We've got time for the short version. 
 BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,,and he was going to have his wife Suzie,give it all away.,Tragically, she passed away before he did,,and he's big on delegation, and,— (Laughter) —,he said — 
 CA: Tweet that. 
 BG: If he's got somebodynwho is doing something well,,and is willing to do it at no charge,,maybe that's okay. But we were stunned.,MG: Totally stunned.nBG: We had never expected it,,and it has been unbelievable.,It's allowed us to increase our ambition,in what the foundation can do quite dramatically.,Half the resources we have,come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity. 
 CA: And I think you've pledged that,by the time you're done,,more than, or 95 percent of your wealth,,will be given to the foundation. 
 BG: Yes. 
 CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing—,(Applause),And recently, you and Warren,have been going around trying to persuade,other billionaires and successful people,to pledge to give, what,,more than half of their assets for philanthropy.,How is that going?,BG: Well, we've got about 120 people,who have now taken this giving pledge.,The thing that's great is that we get together,yearly and talk about, okay,,do you hire staff, what do you give to them?,We're not trying to homogenize it.,I mean, the beauty of philanthropy,is this mind-blowing diversity.,People give to some things.,We look and go, "Wow.",But that's great.,That's the role of philanthropy,is to pick different approaches,,including even in one space, like education.,We need more experimentation.,But it's been wonderful, meeting those people,,sharing their journey to philanthropy,,how they involve their kids,,where they're doing it differently,,and it's been way more successful than we expected.,Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size,in the years ahead. 
 MG: And having people see that other people,are making change with philanthropy,,I mean, these are people who have,created their own businesses,,put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.,If they put their ideas and their brain,behind philanthropy, they can change the world.,And they start to see others doing it, and saying,,"Wow, I want to do that with my own money.",To me, that's the piece that's incredible. 
 CA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard,for some people to figure out,even how to remotely spend that much money,on something else.,There are probably some billionaires in the room,and certainly some successful people.,I'm curious, can you make the pitch?,What's the pitch? 
 BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing,we've ever done,,and you can't take it with you,,and if it's not good for your kids,,let's get together and brainstorm,about what we can be done.,The world is a far better place,because of the philanthropists of the past,,and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,,is the envy of the world.,And part of the reason I'm so optimistic,is because I do think philanthropy,is going to grow,and take some of these things,government's not just good atnworking on and discovering,and shine some light in the right direction. 
 CA: The world's got this terrible inequality,,growing inequality problem,that seems structural.,It does seem to me that if more of your peers,took the approach that you two have made,,it would make a dent,both in that problem and certainly,in the perception of that problem.,Is that a fair comment? 
 BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy,and give to the least wealthy, it's good.,It tries to balance out, and that's just. 
 MG: But you change systems.,In the U.S., we're trying tonchange the education system,so it's just for everybody,and it works for all students.,That, to me, really changes,the inequality balance. 
 BG: That's the most important.,(Applause) 
 CA: Well, I really think that most people here,and many millions around the world,are just in awe of the trajectory,your lives have taken,and the spectacular degree to which,you have shaped the future.,Thank you so much for coming to TED,and for sharing with us and for all you do. 
 BG: Thank you.nMG: Thank you.,(Applause) 
 BG: Thank you.nMG: Thank you very much.,BG: All right, good job. (Applause)Good morning.,When I was a little boy,,I had an experience that changed my life,,and is in fact why I'm here today.,That one moment,profoundly affected how I think about,art, design and engineering. 
 As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up,in a family of loving and talented artists,in one of the world's great cities.,My dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,,was an artist by both passion and profession,,as is my mom, Rae.,He was one of the New York School,abstract expressionists who,,together with his contemporaries,,invented American modern art,,and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist,towards modernism in the 20th century.,Isn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years,of people doing mostly representational art,,that modern art, comparatively speaking,,is about 15 minutes old,,yet now pervasive.,As with many other important innovations,,those radical ideas required no new technology,,just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,,plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism,and rejection.,In our home, art was everywhere.,It was like oxygen,,around us and necessary for life.,As I watched him paint,,Dad taught me that art,was not about being decorative,,but was a different way of communicating ideas,,and in fact one that could bridge the worlds,of knowledge and insight. 
 Given this rich artistic environment,,you'd assume that I would have been compelled,to go into the family business,,but no.,I followed the path of most kids,who are genetically programmed,to make their parents crazy.,I had no interest in becoming an artist,,certainly not a painter.,What I did love was electronics and machines --,taking them apart, building new ones,,and making them work.,Fortunately, my family also had engineers in it,,and with my parents,,these were my first role models.,What they all had in common,was they worked very, very hard.,My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal,kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.,On weekends, we would gontogether to Cortlandt Street,,which was New York City's radio row.,There we would explore massive piles,of surplus electronics,,and for a few bucks bring home treasures,like Norden bombsights,and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.,I found these objects both useful and fascinating.,I learned about engineering and how things worked,,not at school,but by taking apart and studying,these fabulously complex devices.,I did this for hours every day,,apparently avoiding electrocution.,Life was good. 
 However, every summer, sadly,,the machines got left behind,while my parents and I traveled overseas,to experience history, art and design.,We visited the great museums and historic buildings,of both Europe and the Middle East,,but to encourage my growing interest,in science and technology,,they would simply drop me off in places,like the London Science Museum,,where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself,studying the history of science and technology. 
 Then, when I was about nine years old,,we went to Rome.,On one particularly hot summer day,,we visited a drum-shapednbuilding that from the outside,was not particularly interesting.,My dad said it was called the Pantheon,,a temple for all of the gods.,It didn't look all that special from the outside,,as I said, but when we walked inside,,I was immediately struck by three things:,First of all, it was pleasantly cool,despite the oppressive heat outside.,It was very dark, the only source of light,being an big open hole in the roof.,Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,,but it was called the oculus,,an eye to the heavens.,And there was something about this place,,I didn't know why, that just felt special.,As we walked to the center of the room,,I looked up at the heavens through the oculus.,This was the first church that I'd been to,that provided an unrestricted view,between God and man.,But I wondered, what about when it rained?,Dad may have called this an oculus,,but it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.,I looked down and saw floor drains,had been cut into the stone floor.,As I became more accustomed to the dark,,I was able to make out details of the floor,and the surrounding walls.,No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff,that we'd seen all over Rome.,In fact, it looked like the Appian Way,marble salesman showed up,with his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,,and Hadrian said, "We'll take all of it.",(Laughter) 
 But the ceiling was amazing.,It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.,I'd seen these before,,and Bucky was friends with my dad.,It was modern, high-tech, impressive,,a huge 142-foot clear span,which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.,I loved this place.,It was really beautiful and unlikenanything I'd ever seen before,,so I asked my dad, "When was this built?",He said, "About 2,000 years ago.",And I said, "No, I mean, the roof.",You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof,that had been put on because the original,was destroyed in some long-past war.,He said, "It's the original roof." 
 That moment changed my life,,and I can remember it as if it were yesterday.,For the first time, I realized people were smart,2,000 years ago. (Laughter),This had never crossed my mind.,I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,,we visited those the year before,,and sure they're impressive, nice enough design,,but look, give me an unlimited budget,,20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years,to cut and drag stone blocks nacross the countryside,,and I'll build you pyramids too.,But no amount of brute force,gets you the dome of the Pantheon,,not 2,000 years ago, nor today.,And incidentally, it is still the largest,unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.,To build the Pantheon took some miracles.,By miracles, I mean things that are,technically barely possible,,very high-risk, and might not be,actually accomplishable at this moment in time,,certainly not by you. 
 For example, here are somenof the Pantheon's miracles.,To make it even structurally possible,,they had to invent super-strong concrete,,and to control weight,,varied the density of the aggregate,as they worked their way up the dome.,For strength and lightness, the dome structure,used five rings of coffers,,each of diminishing size,,which imparts a dramatic forced perspective,to the design.,It was wonderfully cool inside,because of its huge thermal mass,,natural convection of air rising up,through the oculus,,and a Venturi effect when wind blows across,the top of the building.,I discovered for the first time that light itself,has substance.,The shaft of light beaming through the oculus,was both beautiful and palpable,,and I realized for the first time,that light could be designed.,Further, that of all of the forms of design,,visual design,,they were all kind of irrelevant without it,,because without light, you can't see any of them.,I also realized that I wasn't the first person,to think that this place was really special.,It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers,and the ravages of time to become,what I believe is the longest,continuously occupied building in history. 
 Largely because of that visit,,I came to understand that,,contrary to what I was being told in school,,the worlds of art and design,were not, in fact, incompatible,with science and engineering.,I realized, when combined,,you could create things that were amazing,that couldn't be done in either domain alone.,But in school, with few exceptions,,they were treated as separate worlds,,and they still are.,My teachers told me that I had to get serious,and focus on one or the other.,However, urging me to specialize,only caused me to really nappreciate those polymaths,like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,,Benjamin Franklin,,people who did exactly the opposite.,And this led me to embrace,and want to be in both worlds. 
 So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity,like the Pantheon actually happen?,Someone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,,needed a brilliant creative vision.,They also needed the storytellingnand leadership skills,necessary to fund and execute it,,and a mastery of science and technology,with the ability and knowhow,to push existing innovations even farther.,It is my belief that to createnthese rare game changers,requires you to pull off at least five miracles.,The problem is, no matter how talented,,rich or smart you are,,you only get one to one and a half miracles.,That's it. That's the quota.,Then you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,,whatever.,Remember, most people can't even imagine,one of these technical miracles,,and you need at least five to make a Pantheon.,In my experience, these rare visionaries,who can think across the worlds of art,,design and engineering,have the ability to notice,when others have provided enough of the miracles,to bring the goal within reach.,Driven by the clarity of their vision,,they summon the courage and determination,to deliver the remaining miracles,and they often take what other people think to be,insurmountable obstacles,and turn them into features.,Take the oculus of the Pantheon.,By insisting that it be in the design,,it meant you couldn't use muchnof the structural technology,that had been developed for Roman arches.,However, by instead embracing it,and rethinking weight and stress distribution,,they came up with a design that only works,if there's a big hole in the roof.,That done, you now get the aesthetic,and design benefits of light, cooling,and that critical direct connection with the heavens.,Not bad.,These people not only believed,that the impossible can be done,,but that it must be done. 
 Enough ancient history.,What are some recent examples of innovations,that combine creative design,and technological advances in a way so profound,that they will be remembered,a thousand years from now?,Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one,,and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.,Talk about one giant leap:,It's hard to imagine a more profound moment,in human history,than when we first left our world,to set foot on another. 
 So what came after the moon?,One is tempted to say that today's pantheon,is the Internet,,but I actually think that's quite wrong,,or at least it's only part of the story.,The Internet isn't a Pantheon.,It's more like the invention of concrete:,important, absolutely necessary,to build the Pantheon,,and enduring,,but entirely insufficient by itself.,However, just as the technology of concrete,was critical in realization of the Pantheon,,new designers will use thentechnologies of the Internet,to create novel concepts that will endure.,The smartphone is a perfect example.,Soon the majority of people on the planet,will have one,,and the idea of connecting everyone,to both knowledge and each other will endure. 
 So what's next?,What imminent advance will benthe equivalent of the Pantheon?,Thinking about this,,I rejected many very plausible,and dramatic breakthroughs to come,,such as curing cancer.,Why? Because Pantheons are anchored,in designed physical objects,,ones that inspire by simply seeing,and experiencing them,,and will continue to do so indefinitely.,It is a different kind of language, like art.,These other vital contributions that extend life,and relieve suffering are, of course, critical,,and fantastic,,but they're part of the continuum of,our overall knowledge and technology,,like the Internet. 
 So what is next?,Perhaps counterintuitively,,I'm guessing it's a visionary idea,from the late 1930s,that's been revived every decade since:,autonomous vehicles.,Now you're thinking, give me a break.,How can a fancy version of cruise control,be profound?,Look, much of our world,has been designed around nroads and transportation.,These were as essential to the success,of the Roman Empire,as the interstate highway system,to the prosperity and development,of the United States.,Today, these roads that interconnect our world,are dominated by cars and trucks,that have remained largely unchanged,for 100 years.,Although perhaps not obvious today,,autonomous vehicles will be the key technology,that enables us to redesign our cities,and, by extension, civilization.,Here's why:,Once they become ubiquitous,,each year, these vehicles will save,tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone,and a million globally.,Automotive energy consumption and air pollution,will be cut dramatically.,Much of the road congestion,in and out of our cities will disappear.,They will enable compelling new concepts,in how we design cities, work,,and the way we live.,We will get where we're going faster,and society will recapture vast amounts,of lost productivity,now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting. 
 But why now? Why do we think this is ready?,Because over the last 30 years,,people from outside the automotive industry,have spent countless billions,creating the needed miracles,,but for entirely different purposes.,It took folks like DARPA, universities,,and companies completelynoutside of the automotive industry,to notice that if you were clever about it,,autonomy could be done now.,So what are the five miraclesnneeded for autonomous vehicles?,One, you need to know,where you are and exactly what time it is.,This was solved neatly by the GPS system,,Global Positioning System,,that the U.S. Government put in place.,You need to know where all the roads are,,what the rules are, and where you're going.,The various needs of personal navigation systems,,in-car navigation systems,,and web-based maps address this.,You must have near-continuous communication,with high-performance computing networks,and with others nearby,to understand their intent.,The wireless technologiesndeveloped for mobile devices,,with some minor modifications,,are completely suitable to solve this.,You'll probably want some restricted roadways,to get started,that both society and its lawyers,agree are safe to use for this.,This will start with the HOV lanes,and move from there.,But finally, you need to recognize,people, signs and objects.,Machine vision, special sensors,nand high-performance computing,can do a lot of this,,but it turns out a lot is not good enough,when your family is on board.,Occasionally, humans will nneed to do sense-making.,For this, you might actually have to wake up,your passenger and ask them what the hell,that big lump is in the middle of the road.,Not so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose,in this new world.,Besides, once the first drivers explain,to their confused car,that the giant chicken at the fork in the road,is actually a restaurant,,and it's okay to keep driving,,every other car on the surface of the Earth,will know that from that point on. 
 Five miracles, mostly delivered,,and now you just need a clear vision,of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles,with seductively beautiful nand new functional designs,plus a lot of money and hard work,to bring it home.,The beginning is now only a handful of years away,,and I predict that autonomous vehicles,will permanently change our world,over the next several decades. 
 In conclusion, I've come to believe,that the ingredients for the next Pantheons,are all around us,,just waiting for visionary people,with the broad knowledge,,multidisciplinary skills,,and intense passion,to harness them to make their dreams a reality.,But these people don't spontaneously,pop into existence.,They need to be nurtured and encouraged,from when they're little kids.,We need to love them and help them,discover their passions.,We need to encourage them to work hard,and help them understand that failure,is a necessary ingredient for success,,as is perseverance.,We need to help them to find their own role models,,and give them the confidencento believe in themselves,and to believe that anything is possible,,and just as my grandpa did whennhe took me shopping for surplus,,and just as my parents did,when they took me to science museums,,we need to encourage them to find their own path,,even if it's very different from our own. 
 But a cautionary note:,We also need to periodically pry them away,from their modern miracles,,the computers, phones, tablets,,game machines and TVs,,take them out into the sunlight,so they can experience both the natural,and design wonders of our world,,our planet and our civilization.,If we don't, they won't understand,what these precious things are,that someday they will be resopnsible,for protecting and improving.,We also need them to understand,something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated,in our increasingly tech-dependent world,,that art and design,are not luxuries,,nor somehow incompatible,with science and engineering.,They are in fact essential to what makes us special. 
 Someday, if you get the chance,,perhaps you can take your kids,to the actual Pantheon,,as we will our daughter Kira,,to experience firsthand,the power of that astonishing design,,which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome,,reached 2,000 years into the future,to set the course for my life. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've come here today,to talk to you about a problem.,It's a very simple yet devastating problem,,one that spans the globe,and is affecting all of us.,The problem is,anonymous companies.,It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,,doesn't it?,But anonymous companies are making it difficult,and sometimes impossible,to find out,the actual human beings responsible,sometimes for really terrible crimes.,So, why am I here talking to all of you?,Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker,and when my parents taught my twin brother and I,to question authority,,I don't think they knew where it might lead.,(Laughter),And, they probably really regretted it,during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,,I questioned their authority a lot.,And a lot of my school teachers,didn't appreciate it much either.,You see, since the age of about five,I've always asked the question, but why?,But why does the Earth go around the sun?,But why is blood red?,But why do I have to go to school?,But why do I have to respect the teachers,and authority?,And little did I realize,that this question would become the basis,of everything I would do.,And so it was,in my twenties, a long time ago,,that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London,I was sitting with Simon Taylor,and Patrick Alley,and we were busy stuffing envelopes,for a mail out in the office of the campaign group,where we worked at the time.,And as usual, we were talking nabout the world's problems.,And in particular, we were talking about,the civil war in Cambodia.,And we had talked about that nmany, many times before.,But then suddenly we stopped,and looked at each other,and said, but why don't we try and change this?,And from that slightly crazy question,,over two decades,and many campaigns later,,including alerting the world,to the problem of blood diamonds funding war,,from that crazy question,,Global Witness is now an 80-strong team,of campaigners, investigators, njournalists and lawyers.,And we're all driven by the same belief,,that change really is possible. 
 So, what exactly does Global Witness do?,We investigate, we report,,to uncover the people really responsible,for funding conflict --,for stealing millions from citizens around the world,,also known as state looting,,and for destroying the environment.,And then we campaign hard to nchange the system itself.,And we're doing this because nso many of the countries,rich in natural resources,like oil or diamonds or timber,are home to some of the poorest,and most dispossessed people on the planet.,And much of this injustice,is made possible,by currently accepted business practices.,And one of these is anonymous companies.,Now we've come up against anonymous companies,in lots of our investigations,,like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,,where we exposed how secretive deals,involving anonymous companies,had deprived the citizens,of one of the poorest countries on the planet,of well over a billion dollars.,That's twice the country's health nand education budget combined.,Or in Liberia,,where an international predatory logging company,used front companies as it attempted to grab,a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.,Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,,which has led to the destruction nof much of its forests.,Well, that uses anonymous companies too.,We secretly filmed some of the family,of the former chief minister and a lawyer,as they told our undercover investigator,exactly how these dubious deals are done,using such companies.,And the awful thing is,,there are so many other examples out there,from all walks of life.,This truly is a scandal of epic proportions,hidden in plain sight.,Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,,the Zetas,,who use anonymous companies nto launder profits,while their drugs-related violence,is tearing communities apart across the Americas.,Or the anonymous company,,which bought up Americans' tax debts,,piled on the legal fees,and then gave homeowners a choice:,Pay up or lose your home.,Imagine being threatened with losing your home,sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,,and not being able to find out,who you were really up against. 
 Now anonymous companies,are great for sanctions busting too.,As the Iranian government found out,when, through a series of front companies,,it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,,on Fifth Avenue,,despite American sanctions.,And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,,and other companies were the unwitting,,unknowing tenants there.,There are just so many examples,,the horesemeat scandal in Europe,,the Italian mafia, they've used these companies,for decades.,The $100 million American Medicare fraud,,the supply of weapons to wars around the world,including those,in Eastern Europe in the early '90s.,Anonymous companies,have even come to light,in the recent revolution in the Ukraine. 
 But, for every case that we and others expose,there are so many more that will remain hidden away,because of the current system.,And it's just a simple truth,that some of the people responsible nfor outrageous crimes,,for stealing from you and me,and millions of others,,they are remaining faceless,and they are escaping accountability,and they're doing this with ease,,and they're doing it using legal structures.,And really, that is unfair.,Well, you might well ask,,what exactly is an anonymous company,,and can I really set one up, and use it,,without anyone knowing who I am?,Well, the answer is, yes you can.,But if you're anything like me,,you'll want to see some of that for yourself,,so let me show you.,Well first you need to work out,where you want to set it up.,Now, at this point you might be imagining,one of those lovely tropical island tax havens,but here's the thing,,shockingly,,my own hometown, London,,and indeed the U.K.,,is one of the best places in the world,to set up an anonymous company.,And the other, even better,,I'm afraid that's America.,Do you know, in some states across America,you need less identification,to open up a company,than you do to get a library card,,like Delaware,,which is one of the easiest places,in the world to set up an anonymous company. 
 Okay, so let's say it's America,,and let's say it's Delaware,,and now you can simply go online,and find yourself a company service provider.,These are the companies that ncan set your one up for you,,and remember, it's all legal,nroutine business practice.,So, here's one,,but there are plenty of others to choose from.,And having made your choice,,you then pick what type of company you want,and then fill in a contact, name and address.,But don't worry,,it doesn't have to be your name.,It can be your lawyer's,or your service provider's,,and it's not for the public record anyway.,And then you add the owner of the company.,Now this is the key part,,and again it doesn't have to be you,,because you can get creative,,because there is a whole universe nout there of nominees,to choose from.,And nominees are the people that you,can legally pay to be your company's owner.,And if you don't want to involve anyone else,,it doesn't even have to be an actual human being.,It could be another company.,And then finally,,give your company a name,add a few more details and make your payment.,And then the service provider,will take a few hours or more to process it.,But there you are,,in 10 minutes of online shopping,you can create yourself an anonymous company.,And not only is it easy,,really, really easy and cheap,,it's totally legal too.,But the fun doesn't have to end there,,maybe you want to be even more anonymous.,Well, that's no problem either.,You can simply keep adding layers,,companies owned by companies.,You can have hundreds of layers,with hundreds of companies spread across,lots of different countries,,like a giant web,,each layer adds anonymity.,Each layer makes it more difficult,for law enforcement and others,to find out who the real owner is.,But whose interests is this all serving?,It might be in the interests of the company,or a particular individual,,but what about all of us, the public?,There hasn't even been a global conversation yet,about whether it's okay,to misuse companies in this way.,And what does it all mean for us? 
 Well, an example that really haunts me,is one I came across recently.,And it's that of a horrific fire,in a nightclub in Buenos Aires,about a decade ago.,It was the night before New Year's Eve.,Three thousand very happy revelers,,many of them teenagers,,were crammed into a space meant for 1,000.,And then tragedy struck,,a fire broke out,plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling,and toxic smoke filled the club.,So people tried to escape,only to find that some of the fire doors,had been chained shut.,Over 200 people died.,Seven hundred were injured trying to get out.,And as the victims' families nand the city and the country,reeled in shock,,investigators tried to find out who was responsible.,And as they looked for the owners of the club,,they found instead anonymous companies,,and confusion surrounded the identities of those,involved with the companies.,Now ultimately, a range of people were charged,and some went to jail.,But this was an awful tragedy,,and it shouldn't have been so difficult,just to try and find out who was responsible,for those deaths.,Because in an age,when there is so much information,out there in the open,,why should this crucial information,about company ownership,stay hidden away?,Why should tax evaders, corrupt ngovernment officials,,arms traders and more,,be able to hide their identities from us, the public?,Why should this secrecy be such nan accepted business practice?,Anonymous companies,might be the norm right now,but it wasn't always this way.,Companies were created,to give people a chance to innovate,and not have to put everything on the line.,Companies were created to limit financial risk,,they were never intended to nbe used as a moral shield.,Companies were never intended to be anonymous,,and they don't have to be. 
 And so I come to my wish.,My wish is for us to know,who owns and controls companies,so that they can no longer be used anonymously,against the public good.,Together let's ignite world opinion,,change the law,,and launch a new era of openness in business.,So what might this look like?,Well, imagine if you could go online,and look up the real owner of a company.,Imagine if this data were open and free,,accessible across borders,for citizens and businesses,and law enforcement alike.,Imagine what a game changer that would be.,So how are we going to do this?,Well, there is only one way.,Together, we have to change the law globally,to create public registries,which list the true owners of companies,and can be accessed by all,with no loopholes.,And yes, this is ambitious,,but there is momentum on this issue,,and over the years I have seen,the sheer power of momentum,,and it's just starting on this issue.,There is such an opportunity right now.,And the TED community,of creative and innovative thinkers and doers,across all of society,could make the crucial difference.,You really can make this change happen.,Now, a simple starting point,is the address behind me,for a Facebook page that you can join now,to support the campaign and spread the word.,It's going to be a springboard,for our global campaigning.,And the techies among you,,you could really help us create a prototype,public registry,to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.,Campaign groups from around the world,have come together to work on this issue.,The U.K. government is already on board;,it supports these public registries.,And just last week,,the European Parliament came on board,with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.,That is momentum.,(Applause),But it's early days.,America still needs to come on board,,as do so many other countries.,And to succeed we will all together,need to help and push our politicians,,because without that,,real far-reaching, world-shifting change,just isn't going to happen.,Because this isn't just about changing the law,,this is about starting a conversation,about what it's okay for companies to do,,and in what ways is it acceptable nto use company structures.,This isn't just a dry policy issue.,This is a human issue,which affects us all.,This is about being on the right side of history.,Global citizens, innovators, nbusiness leaders, individuals,,we need you.,Together, let's kickstart this global movement.,Let's just do it,,let's end anonymous companies.,Thank you.,(Applause)What's the scariest thing you've ever done?,Or another way to say it is,,what's the most dangerous nthing that you've ever done?,And why did you do it?,I know what the most dangerous thing is,that I've ever done,because NASA does the math.,You look back to the first five shuttle launches,,the odds of a catastrophic event,during the first five shuttle launches,was one in nine.,And even when I first flew in the shuttle,back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight,,the odds were still now that we look back,about one in 38 or so -- one in 35, one in 40.,Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day,when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center,and you're going to go to space that day,because you realize by the end of the day,you're either going to be floating neffortlessly, gloriously in space,,or you'll be dead.,You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center,,the suit-up room,,the same room that our childhood heroes,got dressed in,,that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in,to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon.,And I got my pressure suit built around me,and rode down outside in the van,heading out to the launchpad --,in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad,,and as you come around the corner,at the Kennedy Space Center,,it's normally predawn, and in the distance,,lit up by the huge xenon lights,,is your spaceship --,the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet.,The crew is sitting in the Astro van,sort of hushed, almost holding hands,,looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger.,We ride the elevator up,and we crawl in, on your hands and knees,into the spaceship, one at a time,,and you worm your way up,into your chair and plunk yourself down,on your back.,And the hatch is closed,,and suddenly,,what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial,is becoming real,,something that I dreamed about,,in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old,,is now suddenly within not too many minutes,of actually happening.,In the astronaut business --,the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle;,it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.,And in the astronaut business, nwe have a saying, which is,,there is no problem so bad,that you can't make it worse.,(Laughter),And so you're very conscious in the cockpit;,you're thinking about all of the things,that you might have to do,,all the switches and all the nwickets you have to go through.,And as the time gets closer and closer,,this excitement is building.,And then about three and a nhalf minutes before launch,,the huge nozzles on the back,,like the size of big church bells,,swing back and forth,and the mass of them is such,that it sways the whole vehicle,,like the vehicle is alive underneath you,,like an elephant getting up noff its knees or something.,And then about 30 seconds before launch,,the vehicle is completely alive --,it is ready to go --,the APUs are running,,the computers are all self-contained,,it's ready to leave the planet.,And 15 seconds before launch, this happens:,(Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10,,nine, eight, seven, six --,(Space shuttle preparing for takeoff),-- start, two, one,,booster ignition, and liftoff of nthe space shuttle Discovery,,returning to the space station, paving the way ...,(Space shuttle taking off) 
 Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful,to be on board one of these things.,You are in the grip of something,that is vastly more powerful than yourself.,It's shaking you so hard you can't focus,on the instruments in front of you.,It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog,and there's a foot in the small of your back,pushing you into space,,accelerating wildly straight up,,shouldering your way through the air,,and you're in a very complex place --,paying attention, watching the vehicle,go through each one of its wickets,with a steadily increasing smile on your face.,After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off,and then you just have the liquid engines,,the hydrogen and oxygen,,and it's as if you're in a dragster,with your foot to the floor,and accelerating like you've never accelerated.,You get lighter and lighter,,the force gets on us heavier and heavier.,It feels like,someone's pouring cement on you or something.,Until finally,,after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so,,we are finally at exactly the right altitude,,exactly the right speed,,the right direction, the engine shut off,,and we're weightless.,And we're alive. 
 It's an amazing experience.,But why would we take that risk?,Why would you do something that dangerous? 
 In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.,I was inspired as a youngster,that this was what I wanted to do.,I watched the first people walk on the moon,and to me, it was just an obvious thing --,I want to somehow turn myself into that.,But the real question is,,how do you deal with the danger of it,and the fear that comes from it?,How do you deal with fear versus danger?,And having the goal in mind,nthinking about where it might lead,,directed me to a life of,looking at all of the small details to allow,this to become possible,,to be able to launch and go nhelp build a space station,where you are on board a million-pound creation,that's going around the world at five miles a second,,eight kilometers a second,,around the world 16 times a day,,with experiments on board that are teaching us,what the substance of the universe is made of,and running 200 experiments inside.,But maybe even more importantly,,allowing us to see the world in a way,that is impossible through any other means,,to be able to look down,and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would --,the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb,like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,,constantly changing beauty that is the world itself.,And you see, because of the speed,,a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes,for half a year.,And the most magnificent part of all that,is to go outside on a spacewalk.,You are in a one-person spaceship,that is your spacesuit,,and you're going through space with the world.,It's an entirely different perspective,,you're not looking up at the universe,,you and the Earth are going nthrough the universe together.,And you're holding on with one hand,,looking at the world turn beside you.,It's roaring silently,with color and texture as it pours by,mesmerizingly next to you.,And if you can tear your eyes away from that,and you look under your arm,down at the rest of everything,,it's unfathomable blackness,,with a texture you feel like you ncould stick your hand into.,and you are holding on with one hand,,one link to the other seven billion people.,And I was outside on my first spacewalk 
 when my left eye went blind,,and I didn't know why.,Suddenly my left eye slammed shut,in great pain,and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.,I was thinking, what do I do next?,I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,,so I kept working.,But unfortunately, without gravity,,tears don't fall.,So you just get a bigger and nbigger ball of whatever that is,mixed with your tears on your eye,until eventually, the ball becomes so big,that the surface tension takes it nacross the bridge of your nose,like a tiny little waterfall,and goes "goosh" into your other eye,,and now I was completely blind,outside the spaceship. 
 So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?,(Laughter),Maybe it's spiders.,A lot of people are afraid of spiders.,I think you should be afraid of spiders --,spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,,and spiders like this one, the brown recluse --,it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,,you end with one of these nhorrible, big necrotic things,on your leg,and there might be one right now,sitting on the chair behind you, in fact.,And how do you know?,And so a spider lands on you,,and you go through this great, spasmy attack,because spiders are scary.,But then you could say, well nis there a brown recluse,sitting on the chair beside me or not?,I don't know. Are there brown recluses here?,So if you actually do the research, you find out that,in the world there are about n50,000 different types of spiders,,and there are about two dozen that are venomous,out of 50,000.,And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters,here in B.C., there's about 720, n730 different types of spiders,and there's one -- one --,that is venomous,,and its venom isn't even fatal,,it's just kind of like a nasty sting.,And that spider -- not only that,,but that spider has beautiful markings on it,,it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation nsymbol on my back, it's the black widow.",So, if you're even slightly careful,you can avoid running into the one spider --,and it lives close the ground,,you're walking along, you are nnever going to go through,a spider web where a black widow bites you.,Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those,,it builds them down in the corners.,And its a black widow because,the female spider eats the male;,it doesn't care about you.,So in fact,,the next time you walk into a spiderweb,,you don't need to panic and go nwith your caveman reaction.,The danger is entirely different than the fear. 
 How do you get around it, though?,How do you change your behavior?,Well, next time you see a spiderweb,,have a good look, make sure nit's not a black widow spider,,and then walk into it.,And then you see another spiderweb,and walk into that one.,It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.,And the spider that may come out is nno more threat to you than a lady bug,or a butterfly.,And then I guarantee you if you nwalk through 100 spiderwebs,you will have changed,your fundamental human behavior,,your caveman reaction,,and you will now be able to walk nin the park in the morning,and not worry about that spiderweb --,or into your grandma's attic or whatever,,into your own basement.,And you can apply this to anything. 
 If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,,your natural reaction would be to panic, I think.,It would make you nervous and worried.,But we had considered all the venom,,and we had practiced with a whole nvariety of different spiderwebs.,We knew everything there is to know,about the spacesuit,and we trained underwater thousands of times.,And we don't just practice things going right,,we practice things going wrong all the time,,so that you are constantly walking nthrough those spiderwebs.,And not just underwater, but nalso in virtual reality labs,with the helmet and the gloves,so you feel like it's realistic.,So when you finally actually nget outside on a spacewalk,,it feels much different than it would,if you just went out first time.,And even if you're blinded,,your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.,Instead you kind of look around and go,,"Okay, I can't see,,but I can hear, I can talk,,Scott Parazynski is out here with me.,He could come over and help me.",We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,,so he could float me like a blimp,and stuff me into the airlock if he had to.,I could find my own way back.,It's not nearly as big a deal.,And actually, if you keep on crying for a while,,whatever that gunk was that's nin your eye starts to dilute,and you can start to see again,,and Houston, if you negotiate with them,,they will let you then keep working.,We finished everything on the spacewalk,and when we came back inside,,Jeff got some cotton batting and took nthe crusty stuff around my eyes,,and it turned out it was just the anti-fog,,sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.,And now we use Johnson's No More Tears,,which we probably should've been using,right from the very beginning. (Laughter) 
 But the key to that is,by looking at the difference,between perceived danger and actual danger,,where is the real risk?,What is the real thing that you should be afraid of?,Not just a generic fear of bad things happening.,You can fundamentally change nyour reaction to things,so that it allows you to go places,and see things and do things,that otherwise would be completely denied to you ... 
 where you could see the nhardpan south of the Sahara,,or you can see New York City,in a way that is almost dreamlike,,or the unconscious gingham nof Eastern Europe fields,or the Great Lakes,as a collection of small puddles.,You can see the fault lines of San Francisco,and the way the water pours out under the bridge,,just entirely different,than any other way that you could have,if you had not found a way to conquer your fear.,You see a beauty that otherwise,never would have happened. 
 It's time to come home at the end.,This is our spaceship,,the Soyuz, that little one.,Three of us climb in,,and then this spaceship detaches from the station,and falls into the atmosphere.,These two parts here,actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up,in the atmosphere.,The only part that survives is the little bullet,that we're riding in,,and it falls into the atmosphere,,and in essence,you are riding a meteorite home,,and riding meteorites is scary,,and it ought to be.,But instead of riding into the atmosphere,just screaming, like you would,if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite,back to Earth -- (Laughter) --,instead, 20 years previously,we had started studying Russian,,and then once you learn Russian, then we,learned orbital mechanics in Russian,,and then we learned vehicle control theory,,and then we got into the simulator,and practiced over and over and over again.,And in fact, you can fly this meteorite,and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle,anywhere on the Earth.,So in fact, when our crew was coming back,into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,,we weren't screaming, we were laughing;,it was fun.,And when the great big parachute opened,,we knew that if it didn't open,there's a second parachute,,and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.,So we came back, we came thundering back,to Earth and this is what it looked like,to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.,(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those,search and recovery helicopters, once again,that helicopter part of dozen such Russian,Mi-8 helicopters.,Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds,,a.m. Central Time.,CH: And you roll to a stop,as if someone threw your nspaceship at the ground,and it tumbles end over end,,but you're ready for it,you're in a custom-built seat,,you know how the shock absorber works.,And then eventually the Russians reach in,,drag you out,,plunk you into a chair,,and you can now look back at,what was an incredible experience.,You have taken the dreams of that,nine-year-old boy,,which were impossible,and dauntingly scary,,dauntingly terrifying,,and put them into practice,,and figured out a way to reprogram yourself,,to change your primal fear,so that it allowed you to come back,with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration,for other people,that never could have been possible otherwise.,Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.,I know this song,,and it's really a tribute to the genius,of David Bowie himself,,but it's also, I think,,a reflection of the fact that we are not machines,exploring the universe,,we are people,,and we're taking,that ability to adapt,and that ability to understand,and the ability to take,our own self-perception into a new place.,(Music),♫ This is Major Tom to ground control ♫,♫ I've left forevermore ♫,♫ And I'm floating in a most peculiar way ♫,♫ And the stars look very different today ♫,♫ For here am I floating in the tin can ♫,♫ A last glimpse of the world ♫,♫ Planet Earth is blue and nthere's so much left to do ♫,(Music),Fear not.,(Applause),That's very nice of you. Thank you very much.,Thank you.At every stage of our lives,we make decisions that will profoundly influence,the lives of the people we're going to become,,and then when we become those people,,we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.,So young people pay good money,to get tattoos removed that teenagers,paid good money to get.,Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people,who young adults rushed to marry.,Older adults work hard to lose,what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.,On and on and on.,The question is, as a psychologist,nthat fascinates me is,,why do we make decisions,that our future selves so often regret? 
 Now, I think one of the reasons --,I'll try to convince you today —,is that we have a fundamental misconception,about the power of time.,Every one of you knows that the rate of change,slows over the human lifespan,,that your children seem to change by the minute,but your parents seem to change by the year.,But what is the name of this magical point in life,where change suddenly goes,from a gallop to a crawl?,Is it teenage years? Is it middle age?,Is it old age? The answer, it turns out,,for most people, is now,,wherever now happens to be.,What I want to convince you today,is that all of us are walking around with an illusion,,an illusion that history, our personal history,,has just come to an end,,that we have just recently become,the people that we were always meant to be,and will be for the rest of our lives. 
 Let me give you some data to back up that claim.,So here's a study of change in people's,personal values over time.,Here's three values.,Everybody here holds all of them,,but you probably know that as you grow,,as you age, the balance of these values shifts.,So how does it do so?,Well, we asked thousands of people.,We asked half of them to predict for us,how much their values wouldnchange in the next 10 years,,and the others to tell us,how much their values hadnchanged in the last 10 years.,And this enabled us to do a reallyninteresting kind of analysis,,because it allowed us to compare the predictions,of people, say, 18 years old,,to the reports of people who were 28,,and to do that kind of analysisnthroughout the lifespan. 
 Here's what we found.,First of all, you are right,,change does slow down as we age,,but second, you're wrong,,because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.,At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,,people vastly underestimated how much change,they would experience over the next 10 years.,We call this the "end of history" illusion.,To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,,you can connect these two lines,,and what you see here is that 18-year-olds,anticipate changing only as much,as 50-year-olds actually do. 
 Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.,For example, personality.,Many of you know that psychologists now claim,that there are five fundamentalndimensions of personality:,neuroticism, openness to experience,,agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.,Again, we asked people how much they expected,to change over the next 10 years,,and also how much they hadnchanged over the last 10 years,,and what we found,,well, you're going to get used tonseeing this diagram over and over,,because once again the rate of change,does slow as we age,,but at every age, people underestimate,how much their personalities will change,in the next decade. 
 And it isn't just ephemeral things,like values and personality.,You can ask people about their likes and dislikes,,their basic preferences.,For example, name your best friend,,your favorite kind of vacation,,what's your favorite hobby,,what's your favorite kind of music.,People can name these things.,We ask half of them to tell us,,"Do you think that that willnchange over the next 10 years?",and half of them to tell us,,"Did that change over the last 10 years?",And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now,,and here it is again:,people predict that the friend they have now,is the friend they'll have in 10 years,,the vacation they most enjoy now is the one,they'll enjoy in 10 years,,and yet, people who are 10 years older all say,,"Eh, you know, that's really changed." 
 Does any of this matter?,Is this just a form of mis-predictionnthat doesn't have consequences?,No, it matters quite a bit, andnI'll give you an example of why.,It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.,Bring to mind right now for yourself,your favorite musician today,and your favorite musician 10 years ago.,I put mine up on the screen to help you along.,Now we asked people,to predict for us, to tell us,how much money they would pay right now,to see their current favorite musician,perform in concert 10 years from now,,and on average, people said they would pay,129 dollars for that ticket.,And yet, when we asked themnhow much they would pay,to see the person who was their favorite,10 years ago perform today,,they say only 80 dollars.,Now, in a perfectly rational world,,these should be the same number,,but we overpay for the opportunity,to indulge our current preferences,because we overestimate their stability. 
 Why does this happen? We're not entirely sure,,but it probably has to do,with the ease of remembering,versus the difficulty of imagining.,Most of us can remembernwho we were 10 years ago,,but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be,,and then we mistakenly thinknthat because it's hard to imagine,,it's not likely to happen.,Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that,",they're usually talking aboutntheir own lack of imagination,,and not about the unlikelihood,of the event that they're describing. 
 The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.,It transforms our preferences.,It reshapes our values.,It alters our personalities.,We seem to appreciate this fact,,but only in retrospect.,Only when we look backwards do we realize,how much change happens in a decade.,It's as if, for most of us,,the present is a magic time.,It's a watershed on the timeline.,It's the moment at which we finally,become ourselves.,Human beings are works in progress,that mistakenly think they're finished.,The person you are right now,is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary,as all the people you've ever been.,The one constant in our life is change. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Right now,you have a movie playing inside your head.,It's an amazing multi-track movie.,It has 3D vision and surround sound,for what you're seeing and hearing right now,,but that's just the start of it.,Your movie has smell and taste and touch.,It has a sense of your body,,pain, hunger, orgasms.,It has emotions,,anger and happiness.,It has memories, like scenes from your childhood,playing before you.,And it has this constant voiceover narrative,in your stream of conscious thinking.,At the heart of this movie is you,experiencing all this directly.,This movie is your stream of consciousness,,the subject of experience,of the mind and the world. 
 Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts,of human existence.,Each of us is conscious.,We all have our own inner movie,,you and you and you.,There's nothing we know about more directly.,At least, I know about my consciousness directly.,I can't be certain that you guys are conscious. 
 Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.,If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives,would have meaning or value.,But at the same time, it's the most,mysterious phenomenon in the universe.,Why are we conscious?,Why do we have these inner movies?,Why aren't we just robots,who process all this input,,produce all that output,,without experiencing the inner movie at all?,Right now, nobody knows the answers,to those questions.,I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness,into science, some radical ideas may be needed. 
 Some people say a science of consciousness,is impossible.,Science, by its nature, is objective.,Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.,So there can never be a science of consciousness.,For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.,Psychologists studied behavior objectively,,neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,,and nobody even mentioned consciousness.,Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,,there was very little scientific work,on consciousness. 
 Now, about 20 years ago,,all that began to change.,Neuroscientists like Francis Crick,and physicists like Roger Penrose,said now is the time for science,to attack consciousness.,And since then, there's been a real explosion,,a flowering of scientific work,on consciousness.,And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.,But it also has some fundamental,limitations so far.,The centerpiece,of the science of consciousness in recent years,has been the search for correlations,,correlations between certain areas of the brain,and certain states of consciousness.,We saw some of this kind of work,from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work,she presented just a few minutes ago.,Now we understand much better, for example,,the kinds of brain areas that go along with,the conscious experience of seeing faces,or of feeling pain,or of feeling happy.,But this is still a science of correlations.,It's not a science of explanations.,We know that these brain areas,go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,,but we don't know why they do.,I like to put this by saying,that this kind of work from neuroscience,is answering some of the questions,we want answered about consciousness,,the questions about what certain brain areas do,and what they correlate with.,But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.,No knock on the neuroscientists.,There are no truly easynproblems with consciousness.,But it doesn't address the real mystery,at the core of this subject:,why is it that all that physical processing in a brain,should be accompanied by consciousness at all?,Why is there this inner subjective movie?,Right now, we don't really have a bead on that. 
 And you might say,,let's just give neuroscience a few years.,It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon,like traffic jams, like hurricanes,,like life, and we'll figure it out.,The classical cases of emergence,are all cases of emergent behavior,,how a traffic jam behaves,,how a hurricane functions,,how a living organism reproduces,and adapts and metabolizes,,all questions about objective functioning.,You could apply that to the human brain,in explaining some of the behaviors,and the functions of the human brain,as emergent phenomena:,how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,,all these questions about behavior.,But when it comes to consciousness,,questions about behavior,are among the easy problems.,When it comes to the hard problem,,that's the question of why is it,that all this behavior,is accompanied by subjective experience?,And here, the standard paradigm,of emergence,,even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,,don't really, so far, have that much to say. 
 Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.,I want a scientific theory of consciousness,that works,,and for a long time, I banged my head,against the wall,looking for a theory of consciousness,in purely physical terms,that would work.,But I eventually came to the conclusion,that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.,It's a long story,,but the core idea is just that what you get,from purely reductionist explanations,in physical terms, in brain-based terms,,is stories about the functioning of a system,,its structure, its dynamics,,the behavior it produces,,great for solving the easy problems —,how we behave, how we function —,but when it comes to subjective experience —,why does all this feel likensomething from the inside? —,that's something fundamentally new,,and it's always a further question.,So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.,We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,,we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,,chemistry explains biology,,biology explains parts of psychology.,But consciousness,doesn't seem to fit into this picture.,On the one hand, it's a datum,that we're conscious.,On the other hand, we don't know how,to accommodate it into ournscientific view of the world.,So I think consciousness right now,is a kind of anomaly,,one that we need to integrate,into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.,Faced with an anomaly like this,,radical ideas may be needed,,and I think that we may need one or two ideas,that initially seem crazy,before we can come to grips with consciousness,scientifically. 
 Now, there are a few candidates,for what those crazy ideas might be.,My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.,His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem,of consciousness.,The whole idea of the inner subjective movie,involves a kind of illusion or confusion.,Actually, all we've got to do is explain,the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,,and then we've explained everything,that needs to be explained.,Well I say, more power to him.,That's the kind of radical idea,that we need to explore,if you want to have a purely reductionist,brain-based theory of consciousness.,At the same time, for me and for many other people,,that view is a bit too close to simply,denying the datum of consciousness,to be satisfactory.,So I go in a different direction.,In the time remaining,,I want to explore two crazy ideas,that I think may have some promise. 
 The first crazy idea,is that consciousness is fundamental.,Physicists sometimes takensome aspects of the universe,as fundamental building blocks:,space and time and mass.,They postulate fundamental laws governing them,,like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.,These fundamental properties and laws,aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.,Rather, they're taken as primitive,,and you build up the world from there.,Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.,In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out,that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena,in terms of the existing fundamentals —,space, time, mass, Newton's laws —,so he postulated fundamental laws,of electromagnetism,and postulated electric charge,as a fundamental element,that those laws govern.,I think that's the situation we're in,with consciousness.,If you can't explain consciousness,in terms of the existing fundamentals —,space, time, mass, charge —,then as a matter of logic,nyou need to expand the list.,The natural thing to do is to postulate,consciousness itself as something fundamental,,a fundamental building block of nature.,This doesn't mean you suddenlyncan't do science with it.,This opens up the way for you to do science with it.,What we then need is to study,the fundamental laws governing consciousness,,the laws that connect consciousness,to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,,physical processes.,Physicists sometimes say,that we want fundamental laws so simple,that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.,Well I think something like that is the situation,we're in with consciousness.,We want to find fundamental laws so simple,we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.,We don't know what those laws are yet,,but that's what we're after. 
 The second crazy idea,is that consciousness might be universal.,Every system might have some degree,of consciousness.,This view is sometimes called panpsychism:,pan for all, psych for mind,,every system is conscious,,not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,,but even Rob Knight's microbes,,elementary particles.,Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.,The idea is not that photons are intelligent,or thinking.,It's not that a photon,is wracked with angst,because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm alwaysnbuzzing around near the speed of light.,I never get to slow down and smell the roses.",No, not like that.,But the thought is maybe photons might have,some element of raw, subjective feeling,,some primitive precursor to consciousness. 
 This may sound a bit kooky to you.,I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?,Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,,that consciousness is fundamental.,If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,,it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,,the way they are.,It's also worth noting that although the idea,seems counterintuitive to us,,it's much less counterintuitive to people,from different cultures,,where the human mind is seen as much more,continuous with nature. 
 A deeper motivation comes from the idea that,perhaps the most simple and powerful way,to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness,to physical processing,is to link consciousness to information.,Wherever there's information processing,,there's consciousness.,Complex information processing, like in a human,,complex consciousness.,Simple information processing,,simple consciousness. 
 A really exciting thing is in recent years,a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,,has taken this kind of theory,and developed it rigorously,with a mathematical theory.,He has a mathematical measure,of information integration,which he calls phi,,measuring the amount of information,integrated in a system.,And he supposes that phi goes along,with consciousness.,So in a human brain,,incredibly large amount of information integration,,high degree of phi,,a whole lot of consciousness.,In a mouse, medium degreenof information integration,,still pretty significant,,pretty serious amount of consciousness.,But as you go down to worms,,microbes, particles,,the amount of phi falls off.,The amount of information integration falls off,,but it's still non-zero.,On Tononi's theory,,there's still going to be a non-zero degree,of consciousness.,In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law,of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.,Now, I don't know if this theory is right,,but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now,in the science of consciousness,,and it's been used to integrate a whole range,of scientific data,,and it does have a nice propertynthat it is in fact simple enough,you can write it on the front of a t-shirt. 
 Another final motivation is that,panpsychism might help us to integrate,consciousness into the physical world.,Physicists and philosophers have often observed,that physics is curiously abstract.,It describes the structure of reality,using a bunch of equations,,but it doesn't tell us about the reality,that underlies it.,As Stephen Hawking puts it,,what puts the fire into the equations?,Well, on the panpsychist view,,you can leave the equations of physics as they are,,but you can take them to be describing,the flux of consciousness.,That's what physics really is ultimately doing,,describing the flux of consciousness.,On this view, it's consciousness,that puts the fire into the equations.,On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle,outside the physical world,as some kind of extra.,It's there right at its heart. 
 This view, I think, the panpsychist view,,has the potential to transfigure our relationship,to nature,,and it may have some pretty serious social,and ethical consequences.,Some of these may be counterintuitive.,I used to think I shouldn't eat anything,which is conscious,,so therefore I should be vegetarian.,Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,,you're going to go very hungry.,So I think when you think about it,,this tends to transfigure your views,,whereas what matters for ethical purposes,and moral considerations,,not so much the fact of consciousness,,but the degree and the complexity of consciousness. 
 It's also natural to ask about consciousness,in other systems, like computers.,What about the artificially intelligent system,in the movie "Her," Samantha?,Is she conscious?,Well, if you take the informational,,panpsychist view,,she certainly has complicated information processing,and integration,,so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.,If that's right, it raises pretty serious,ethical issues about both the ethics,of developing intelligent computer systems,and the ethics of turning them off. 
 Finally, you might ask about the consciousness,of whole groups,,the planet.,Does Canada have its own consciousness?,Or at a more local level,,does an integrated group,like the audience at a TED conference,,are we right now having ancollective TED consciousness,,an inner movie,for this collective TED group,which is distinct from the inner movies,of each of our parts?,I don't know the answer to that question,,but I think it's at least one,worth taking seriously. 
 Okay, so this panpsychist vision,,it is a radical one,,and I don't know that it's correct.,I'm actually more confident about,the first crazy idea,,that consciousness is fundamental,,than about the second one,,that it's universal.,I mean, the view raises any number of questions,,has any number of challenges,,like how do those little bits,of consciousness add up,to the kind of complex consciousness,we know and love.,If we can answer those questions,,then I think we're going to be well on our way,to a serious theory of consciousness.,If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps,in science and philosophy.,We can't expect to solve it overnight.,But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.,Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,,both to understanding the universe,and to understanding ourselves.,It may just take the right crazy idea. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens,,the future of the Internet.,So I would like to welcome to the TED stage,the man behind those revelations,,Ed Snowden.,(Applause),Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia,controlling this bot from his laptop,,so he can see what the bot can see.,Ed, welcome to the TED stage.,What can you see, as a matter of fact? 
 Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.,This is amazing.,(Laughter) 
 CA: Ed, some questions for you.,You've been called many things,in the last few months.,You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,,a hero.,What words would you describe yourself with? 
 ES: You know, everybody who is involved,with this debate,has been struggling over me and my personality,and how to describe me.,But when I think about it,,this isn't the question thatnwe should be struggling with.,Who I am really doesn't matter at all.,If I'm the worst person in the world,,you can hate me and move on.,What really matters here are the issues.,What really matters here is thenkind of government we want,,the kind of Internet we want,,the kind of relationship between people,and societies.,And that's what I'm hopingnthe debate will move towards,,and we've seen that increasing over time.,If I had to describe myself,,I wouldn't use words like "hero.",I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor.",I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,,just like everyone else. 
 CA: So just to give some context,for those who don't know the whole story --,(Applause) —,this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii,working as a consultant to the NSA.,As a sysadmin, you had access,to their systems,,and you began revealingncertain classified documents,to some handpicked journalists,leading the way to June's revelations.,Now, what propelled you to do this?,ES: You know,,when I was sitting in Hawaii,,and the years before, when I wasnworking in the intelligence community,,I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.,We do a lot of good thingsnin the intelligence community,,things that need to be done,,and things that help everyone.,But there are also things that go too far.,There are things that shouldn't be done,,and decisions that were being made in secret,without the public's awareness,,without the public's consent,,and without even our representatives in government,having knowledge of these programs.,When I really came to struggle with these issues,,I thought to myself,,how can I do this in the most responsible way,,that maximizes the public benefit,while minimizing the risks?,And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,,out of going to Congress,,when there were no laws,,there were no legal protections,for a private employee,,a contractor in intelligence like myself,,there was a risk that I would benburied along with the information,and the public would never find out.,But the First Amendment ofnthe United States Constitution,guarantees us a free press for a reason,,and that's to enable an adversarial press,,to challenge the government,,but also to work together with the government,,to have a dialogue and debate about how we can,inform the public about matters of vital importance,without putting our national security at risk.,And by working with journalists,,by giving all of my information,back to the American people,,rather than trusting myself to make,the decisions about publication,,we've had a robust debate,with a deep investment by the government,that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.,And the risks that have been threatened,,the risks that have been played up,by the government,have never materialized.,We've never seen any evidence,of even a single instance of specific harm,,and because of that,,I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made. 
 CA: So let me show the audience,a couple of examples of what you revealed.,If we could have a slide up, and Ed,,I don't know whether you can see,,the slides are here.,This is a slide of the PRISM program,,and maybe you could tell the audience,what that was that was revealed. 
 ES: The best way to understand PRISM,,because there's been a little bit of controversy,,is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.,Much of the debate in the U.S.nhas been about metadata.,They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,,and they're talking about a specific legal authority,called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.,That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,,mass surveillance of the entire country's,phone records, things like that --,who you're talking to,,when you're talking to them,,where you traveled.,These are all metadata events.,PRISM is about content.,It's a program through which the government could,compel corporate America,,it could deputize corporate America,to do its dirty work for the NSA.,And even though some ofnthese companies did resist,,even though some of them --,I believe Yahoo was one of them —,challenged them in court, they all lost,,because it was never tried by an open court.,They were only tried by a secret court.,And something that we've seen,,something about the PRISM programnthat's very concerning to me is,,there's been a talking point in the U.S. government,where they've said 15 federal judges,have reviewed these programsnand found them to be lawful,,but what they don't tell you,is those are secret judges,in a secret court,based on secret interpretations of law,that's considered 34,000 warrant requests,over 33 years,,and in 33 years only rejected,11 government requests.,These aren't the people that we want deciding,what the role of corporate America,in a free and open Internet should be. 
 CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here,shows the dates in which,different technology companies, Internet companies,,are alleged to have joined the program,,and where data collection began from them.,Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.,How was that data collected by the NSA? 
 ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides,refer to it as direct access.,What that means to an actual NSA analyst,,someone like me who was workingnas an intelligence analyst,targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,,things like that, in Hawaii,,is the provenance of that data,is directly from their servers.,It doesn't mean,that there's a group of company representatives,sitting in a smoky room with the NSA,palling around and making back-room deals,about how they're going to give this stuff away.,Now each company handles it different ways.,Some are responsible.,Some are somewhat less responsible.,But the bottom line is, when we talk about,how this information is given,,it's coming from the companies themselves.,It's not stolen from the lines.,But there's an important thing to remember here:,even though companies pushed back,,even though companies demanded,,hey, let's do this through a warrant process,,let's do this,where we actually have some sort of legal review,,some sort of basis for handing over,these users' data,,we saw stories in the Washington Post last year,that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story,that said the NSA broke in,to the data center communications,between Google to itself,and Yahoo to itself.,So even these companies that are cooperating,in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner,with the NSA,,the NSA isn't satisfied with that,,and because of that, we need our companies,to work very hard,to guarantee that they're going to represent,the interests of the user, and also advocate,for the rights of the users.,And I think over the last year,,we've seen the companies that are named,on the PRISM slides,take great strides to do that,,and I encourage them to continue. 
 CA: What more should they do? 
 ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company,in America can do today, right now,,without consulting with lawyers,,to protect the rights of users worldwide,,is to enable SSL web encryption,on every page you visit.,The reason this matters is today,,if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,,the NSA can see a record of that,,the Russian intelligence servicencan see a record of that,,the Chinese service can see a record of that,,the French service, the German service,,the services of Andorra.,They can all see it because it's unencrypted.,The world's library is Amazon.com,,but not only do they notnsupport encryption by default,,you cannot choose to use encryption,when browsing through books.,This is something that we need to change,,not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,,but they're a great example.,All companies need to move,to an encrypted browsing habit by default,for all users who haven't taken any action,or picked any special methods on their own.,That'll increase the privacy and the rights,that people enjoy worldwide. 
 CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.,I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause),This is a program called Boundless Informant.,What is that? 
 ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA,for using appropriate names on this.,This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.,Boundless Informant,is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.,The NSA was previously asked by Congress,,was there any ability that they had,to even give a rough ballpark estimate,of the amount of American communications,that were being intercepted.,They said no. They said, we don't track those stats,,and we can't track those stats.,We can't tell you how many communications,we're intercepting around the world,,because to tell you that would be,to invade your privacy.,Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,,but the reality, when you look at this slide is,,not only do they have the capability,,the capability already exists.,It's already in place.,The NSA has its own internal data format,that tracks both ends of a communication,,and if it says,,this communication came from America,,they can tell Congress hownmany of those communications,they have today, right now.,And what Boundless Informant tells us,is more communications are being intercepted,in America about Americans,than there are in Russia about Russians.,I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency,should be aiming for. 
 CA: Ed, there was a story brokennin the Washington Post,,again from your data.,The headline says,,"NSA broke privacy rules,thousands of times per year.",Tell us about that. 
 ES: We also heard in Congressionalntestimony last year,,it was an amazing thing for someone like me,who came from the NSA,and who's seen the actual internal documents,,knows what's in them,,to see officials testifying under oath,that there had been no abuses,,that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,,when we knew this story was coming.,But what's especially interesting about this,,about the fact that the NSA has violated,their own rules, their own laws,thousands of times in a single year,,including one event by itself,,one event out of those 2,776,,that affected more than 3,000 people.,In another event, they intercepted,all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.,What's amazing about this,,this report, that didn't get that much attention,,is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,,the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,,Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report,until the Washington Post contacted her,asking for comment on the report.,And she then requested a copy from the NSA,and received it,,but had never seen this before that.,What does that say about the state of oversight,in American intelligence,when the chairman of thenSenate Intelligence Committee,has no idea that the rules are being broken,thousands of times every year? 
 CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:,Why should we care about,all this surveillance, honestly?,I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,,you've got nothing to worry about.,What's wrong with that point of view?,ES: Well, so the first thing is,,you're giving up your rights.,You're saying hey, you know,,I don't think I'm going to need them,,so I'm just going to trust that, you know,,let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,,these guys are going to do the right thing.,Your rights matter,because you never know whennyou're going to need them.,Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,,not just in America,,but in Western societies,and in democratic societies around the world.,People should be able to pick up the phone,and to call their family,,people should be able to send a text message,to their loved ones,,people should be able to buy a book online,,they should be able to travel by train,,they should be able to buy an airline ticket,without wondering about how these events,are going to look to an agent of the government,,possibly not even your government,years in the future,,how they're going to be misinterpreted,and what they're going to think your intentions were.,We have a right to privacy.,We require warrants to be based on probable cause,or some kind of individualized suspicion,because we recognize that trusting anybody,,any government authority,,with the entirety of human communications,in secret and without oversight,is simply too great a temptation to be ignored. 
 CA: Some people are furious at what you've done.,I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney,who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,,Edward Snowden is the lionnthat bit the head off the dog.,He thinks you've committed,one of the worst acts of betrayal,in American history.,What would you say to people who think that? 
 ES: Dick Cheney's really something else.,(Laughter) (Applause),Thank you. (Laughter),I think it's amazing, because at the time,Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,,Dick Cheney was saying,he was going to end governments worldwide,,the skies were going to ignite,and the seas were going to boil off,,and now he's saying it's a flea bite.,So we should be suspicious about the same sort of,overblown claims of damage to national security,from these kind of officials.,But let's assume that thesenpeople really believe this.,I would argue that they have kind of,a narrow conception of national security.,The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney,do not keep the nation safe.,The public interest is not always the same,as the national interest.,Going to war with people who are not our enemy,in places that are not a threat,doesn't make us safe,,and that applies whether it's in Iraq,or on the Internet.,The Internet is not the enemy.,Our economy is not the enemy.,American businesses, Chinese businesses,,and any other company out there,is a part of our society.,It's a part of our interconnected world.,There are ties of fraternity that bond us together,,and if we destroy these bonds,by undermining the standards, the security,,the manner of behavior,,that nations and citizens all around the world,expect us to abide by. 
 CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen,1.7 million documents.,It seems only a few hundred of them,have been shared with journalists so far.,Are there more revelations to come? 
 ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.,I don't think there's any question,that some of the most important reporting,to be done is yet to come. 
 CA: Come here, because I want to ask you,about this particular revelation.,Come and take a look at this.,I mean, this is a story which I thinknfor a lot of the techies in this room,is the single most shocking thing,that they have heard in the last few months.,It's about a program called "Bullrun.",Can you explain what that is? 
 ES: So Bullrun, and this is again,where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,,this is a program named after a Civil War battle.,The British counterpart is called Edgehill,,which is a U.K. civil war battle.,And the reason that I believe they're named this way,is because they target our own infrastructure.,They're programs through which the NSA,intentionally misleads corporate partners.,They tell corporate partners that these,are safe standards.,They say hey, we need to work with you,to secure your systems,,but in reality, they're giving bad advice,to these companies that makes them,degrade the security of their services.,They're building in backdoors that not only,the NSA can exploit,,but anyone else who has time and money,to research and find it,can then use to let themselves in,to the world's communications.,And this is really dangerous,,because if we lose a single standard,,if we lose the trust of something like SSL,,which was specifically targeted,by the Bullrun program,,we will live a less safe world overall.,We won't be able to access our banks,and we won't be able to access commerce,without worrying about peoplenmonitoring those communications,or subverting them for their own ends. 
 CA: And do those same decisions also potentially,open America up to cyberattacks,from other sources? 
 ES: Absolutely.,One of the problems,,one of the dangerous legacies,that we've seen in the post-9/11 era,,is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.,They've been in charge of offensive operations,,that is hacking,,but they've also been inncharge of defensive operations,,and traditionally they've always prioritized,defense over offense,based on the principle,that American secrets are simply worth more.,If we hack a Chinese business,and steal their secrets,,if we hack a government office in Berlin,and steal their secrets,,that has less value to the American people,than making sure that the Chinese,can't get access to our secrets.,So by reducing the security of our communications,,they're not only putting the world at risk,,they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,,because intellectual property is the basis,,the foundation of our economy,,and if we put that at risk through weak security,,we're going to be paying for it for years. 
 CA: But they've made a calculation,that it was worth doing this,as part of America's defense against terrorism.,Surely that makes it a price worth paying. 
 ES: Well, when you look at the results,of these programs in stopping terrorism,,you will see that that's unfounded,,and you don't have to take my word for it,,because we've had the first open court,,the first federal court that's reviewed this,,outside the secrecy arrangement,,called these programs Orwellian,and likely unconstitutional.,Congress, who has access,to be briefed on these things,,and now has the desire to be,,has produced bills to reform it,,and two independent White House panels,who reviewed all of the classified evidence,said these programs have never stopped,a single terrorist attack,that was imminent in the United States.,So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?,Do these programs have any value at all?,I say no, and all three branches,of the American government say no as well. 
 CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation,for them than the war against terrorism? 
 ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again? 
 CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation,for them other than the war against terrorism? 
 ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism,has always been what we in the intelligence world,would call a cover for action.,Terrorism is something that provokes,an emotional response that allows people,to rationalize authorizing powers and programs,that they wouldn't give otherwise.,The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,,the NSA asked for these authorities,back in the 1990s.,They asked the FBI to go tonCongress and make the case.,The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.,But Congress and the American people said no.,They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.,They said it's worth too much damage,to our society to justify the gains.,But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,,they used secrecy and theynused the justification of terrorism,to start these programs in secret,without asking Congress,,without asking the American people,,and it's that kind of government behind closed doors,that we need to guard ourselves against,,because it makes us less safe,,and it offers no value. 
 CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,,because I've got a more personal question for you.,Speaking of terror,,most people would find thensituation you're in right now,in Russia pretty terrifying.,You obviously heard what happened,,what the treatment that Bradley Manning got,,Chelsea Manning as now is,,and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that,there are people in the intelligence community,who want you dead.,How are you coping with this?,How are you coping with the fear? 
 ES: It's no mystery,that there are governments outnthere that want to see me dead.,I've made clear again and again and again,that I go to sleep every morning,thinking about what I canndo for the American people.,I don't want to harm my government.,I want to help my government,,but the fact that they are willing to,completely ignore due process,,they're willing to declare guilt,without ever seeing a trial,,these are things that we need to work against,as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.,We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.,We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.,And whatever part I can do to see that end,,I'm happy to do despite the risks. 
 CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback,from the audience here,,because I know there's widely differing reactions,to Edward Snowden.,Suppose you had the following two choices, right?,You could view what he did,as fundamentally a reckless act,that has endangered America,or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act,that will work towards America and the world's,long-term good?,Those are the two choices I'll give you.,I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with,the first of those,,that this was a reckless act?,There are some hands going up.,Some hands going up.,It's hard to put your hand up,when the man is standing right here,,but I see them. 
 ES: I can see you. (Laughter) 
 CA: And who goes with the second choice,,the fundamentally heroic act? 
 (Applause) (Cheers) 
 And I think it's true to say thatnthere are a lot of people,who didn't show a hand and I think,are still thinking this through,,because it seems to me that the debate around you,doesn't split along traditional political lines.,It's not left or right, it's not really about,pro-government, libertarian, or not just that.,Part of it is almost a generational issue.,You're part of a generation that grew up,with the Internet, and it seems as if,you become offended at almost a visceral level,when you see something done,that you think will harm the Internet.,Is there some truth to that? 
 ES: It is. I think it's very true.,This is not a left or right issue.,Our basic freedoms, and when I say our,,I don't just mean Americans,,I mean people around the world,,it's not a partisan issue.,These are things that all people believe,,and it's up to all of us to protect them,,and to people who have seen and enjoyed,a free and open Internet,,it's up to us to preserve that liberty,for the next generation to enjoy,,and if we don't change things,,if we don't stand up to make the changes,we need to do to keep the Internet safe,,not just for us but for everyone,,we're going to lose that,,and that would be a tremendous loss,,not just for us, but for the world. 
 CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently,from the founder of the world wide web,,who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.,Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say,,do we have a microphone for Tim? 
 (Applause) 
 Tim, good to see you. Come up there.,Which camp are you in, by the way,,traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but -- 
 Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer,answers to that question, but hero,,if I have to make the choice between the two. 
 CA: And Ed, I think you've read,the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about,about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.,Is that something that makes sense?,ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up,not just thinking about the Internet,,but I grew up in the Internet,,and although I never expected to have the chance,to defend it in such a direct and practical manner,and to embody it in this unusual,,almost avatar manner,,I think there's something poetic about the fact that,one of the sons of the Internet,has actually become close to the Internet,as a result of their political expression.,And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet,is exactly what we need.,We need to encode our values,not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,,and it's something that I hope,,I invite everyone in the audience,,not just here in Vancouver but around the world,,to join and participate in. 
 CA: Do you have a question for Ed? 
 TBL: Well, two questions,,a general question — 
 CA: Ed, can you still hear us? 
 ES: Yes, I can hear you.nCA: Oh, he's back. 
 TBL: The wiretap on your line,got a little interfered with for a moment.,(Laughter) 
 ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem. 
 TBL: So, from the 25 years,,stepping back and thinking,,what would you think would be,the best that we could achieve,from all the discussions that we have,about the web we want? 
 ES: When we think about,in terms of how far we can go,,I think that's a question that's really only limited,by what we're willing to put into it.,I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past,has been exactly what we as not just a nation,but as a people around the world need,,and by cooperating, by engaging not just,the technical parts of society,,but as you said, the users,,the people around the world who contribute,through the Internet, through social media,,who just check the weather,,who rely on it every day as a part of their life,,to champion that.,We'll get not just the Internet we've had,,but a better Internet, a better now,,something that we can use to build a future,that'll be better not just than what we hoped for,but anything that we could have imagined. 
 CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.,A lot of the conversation since then has been,along the lines that,actually George Orwell got it wrong.,It's not Big Brother watching us.,We, through the power of the web,,and transparency, are now watching Big Brother.,Your revelations kind of drove a stake,through the heart of that rather optimistic view,,but you still believe there's a way of doing something,about that.,And you do too. 
 ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made,that the powers of Big Brothernhave increased enormously.,There was a recent legal article at Yale,that established something callednthe Bankston-Soltani Principle,,which is that our expectation of privacy is violated,when the capabilities of government surveillance,have become cheaper by an order of magnitude,,and each time that occurs, we need to revisit,and rebalance our privacy rights.,Now, that hasn't happened since,the government's surveillance powers,have increased by several orders of magnitude,,and that's why we're in thenproblem that we're in today,,but there is still hope,,because the power of individuals,have also been increased by technology.,I am living proof,that an individual can go head to head,against the most powerful adversaries,and the most powerful intelligence agencies,around the world and win,,and I think that's something,that we need to take hope from,,and we need to build on,to make it accessible not just to technical experts,but to ordinary citizens around the world.,Journalism is not a crime,,communication is not a crime,,and we should not be monitorednin our everyday activities. 
 CA: I'm not quite sure hownyou shake the hand of a bot,,but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here.nTBL: That'll come very soon.,ES: Nice to meet you,,and I hope my beam looks as nice,as my view of you guys does. 
 CA: Thank you, Tim. 
 (Applause) 
 I mean, The New York Timesnrecently called for an amnesty for you.,Would you welcome the chancento come back to America? 
 ES: Absolutely. There's really no question,,the principles that have been the foundation,of this project,have been the public interest,and the principles that underly,the journalistic establishment in the United States,and around the world,,and I think if the press is now saying,,we support this,,this is something that needed to happen,,that's a powerful argument,nbut it's not the final argument,,and I think that's somethingnthat public should decide.,But at the same time,,the government has hinted that they want,some kind of deal,,that they want me to compromise,the journalists with which I've been working,,to come back,,and I want to make it very clear,that I did not do this to be safe.,I did this to do what was right,,and I'm not going to stop my work,in the public interest,just to benefit myself.,(Applause) 
 CA: In the meantime,,courtesy of the Internet and this technology,,you're here, back in North America,,not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.,I'm curious, how does that feel? 
 ES: Canada is different than what I expected.,It's a lot warmer.,(Laughter) 
 CA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading.",If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,,what is your idea worth spreading,right now at this moment?,ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder,that democracy may die behind closed doors,,but we as individuals are born,behind those same closed doors,,and we don't have to give up,our privacy to have good government.,We don't have to give up our liberty,to have security.,And I think by working together,we can have both open government,and private lives,,and I look forward to working with everyone,around the world to see that happen. 
 Thank you very much. 
 CA: Ed, thank you. 
 (Applause)Four years ago,,a security researcher,,or, as most people would call it, a hacker,,found a way to literally,make ATMs throw money at him.,His name was Barnaby Jack,,and this technique was later called "jackpotting",in his honor. 
 I'm here today because I think,we actually need hackers.,Barnaby Jack,could have easily turned,into a career criminal or James Bond villain,with his knowledge,,but he chose to show the world,his research instead.,He believed that sometimes,you have to demo a threat,to spark a solution.,And I feel the same way.,That's why I'm here today. 
 We are often terrified and fascinated,by the power hackers now have.,They scare us.,But the choices they make,have dramatic outcomes,that influence us all.,So I am here today because I think we need hackers,,and in fact, they just might be,the immune system for the information age.,Sometimes they make us sick,,but they also find those hidden threats,in our world,,and they make us fix it. 
 I knew that I might get hacked,for giving this talk,,so let me save you the effort.,In true TED fashion,,here is my most embarrassing picture.,But it would be difficult for you to find me in it,,because I'm the one who looks like a boy,standing to the side.,I was such a nerd back then,that even the boys on thenDungeons and Dragons team,wouldn't let me join.,This is who I was,,but this is who I wanted to be:,Angelina Jolie.,She portrayed Acid Burn,in the '95 film "Hackers.",She was pretty and she could rollerblade,,but being a hacker, that made her powerful.,And I wanted to be just like her,,so I started spending a lot of time,on hacker chat rooms and online forums.,I remember one late night,I found a bit of PHP code.,I didn't really know what it did,,but I copy-pasted it,and used it anyway,to get into a password-protected site,like that.,Open Sesame.,It was a simple trick,,and I was just a script kiddie back then,,but to me, that trick,,it felt like this,,like I had discovered limitless potential,at my fingertips.,This is the rush of power that hackers feel.,It's geeks just like me,discovering they have access to superpower,,one that requires the skill and tenacity,of their intellect,,but thankfully no radioactive spiders. 
 But with great power,comes great responsibility,,and you all like to think that if we had such powers,,we would only use them for good.,But what if you could read your ex's emails,,or add a couple zeros to your bank account.,What would you do then?,Indeed, many hackers do not resist,those temptations,,and so they are responsible in one way or another,to billions of dollars lost each year,to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,,which is a serious issue.,But there are other hackers,,hackers who just like to break things,,and it is precisely those hackers,that can find the weaker elements in our world,and make us fix it. 
 This is what happened last year,when another security researcher,called Kyle Lovett,discovered a gaping hole,in the design of certain wireless routers,like you might have in your home or office.,He learned that anyone could remotely connect,to these devices over the Internet,and download documents from hard drives,attached to those routers,,no password needed.,He reported it to the company, of course,,but they ignored his report.,Perhaps they thought universal access,was a feature, not a bug,,until two months ago,when a group of hackers used it,to get into people's files.,But they didn't steal anything.,They left a note:,Your router and your documents,can be accessed by anyone in the world.,Here's what you should do to fix it.,We hope we helped.,By getting into people's files like that,,yeah, they broke the law,,but they also forced that company,to fix their product. 
 Making vulnerabilities known to the public,is a practice called full disclosure,in the hacker community,,and it is controversial,,but it does make me think of how hackers,have an evolving effect on technologies we use,every day.,This is what Khalil did.,Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,,and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook,which he attempted to report,through the company's bug bounty program.,These are usually great arrangements for companies,to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities,they find in their code.,Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications,,his report was not acknowledged.,Frustrated with the exchange,,he took to use his own discovery,to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.,This got their attention, all right,,and they fixed the bug,,but because he hadn't reported it properly,,he was denied the bounty usually paid out,for such discoveries.,Thankfully for Khalil,,a group of hackers were watching out for him.,In fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars,to reward him for this discovery,,raising a vital discussion in the technology industry,about how we come up with incentives,for hackers to do the right thing.,But I think there's a greater story here still.,Even companies founded by hackers,,like Facebook was,,still have a complicated relationship,when it comes to hackers.,And so for more conservative organizations,,it is going to take time and adapting,in order to embrace hacker culture,and the creative chaos that it brings with it.,But I think it's worth the effort,,because the alternative,,to blindly fight all hackers,,is to go against the power you cannot control,at the cost of stifling innovation,and regulating knowledge.,These are things that will come back and bite you. 
 It is even more true,if we go after hackers,that are willing to risk their own freedom,for ideals like the freedom of the web,,especially in times like this, like today even,,as governments and corporates,fight to control the Internet.,I find it astounding,that someone from the shadowyncorners of cyberspace,can become its voice of opposition,,its last line of defense even,,perhaps someone like Anonymous,,the leading brand of global hacktivism.,This universal hacker movement,needs no introduction today,,but six years ago,they were not much more than an Internet subculture,dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats,and Internet trolling campaigns.,Their moment of transformation was in early 2008,when the Church of Scientology,attempted to remove certain leaked videos,from appearing on certain websites.,This is when Anonymous was forged,out of the seemingly random collection,of Internet dwellers.,It turns out,,the Internet doesn't like it,when you try to remove things from it,,and it will react with cyberattacks,and elaborate pranks,and with a series of organized protests,all around the world,,from my hometown of Tel Aviv,to Adelaide, Australia.,This proved that Anonymous and this idea,can rally the masses from the keyboards,to the streets,,and it laid the foundations,for dozens of future operations,against perceived injustices,to their online and offline world.,Since then, they've gone after many targets.,They've uncovered corruption, abuse.,They've hacked popes and politicians,,and I think their effect is larger,than simple denial of service attacks,that take down websites,or even leak sensitive documents.,I think that, like Robin Hood,,they are in the business of redistribution,,but what they are after isn't your money.,It's not your documents. It's your attention.,They grab the spotlight for causes they support,,forcing us to take note,,acting as a global magnifying glass,for issues that we are not as aware of,but perhaps we should be.,They have been called many names,from criminals to terrorists,,and I cannot justify their illegal means,,but the ideas they fight for,are ones that matter to us all.,The reality is,,hackers can do a lot more than break things.,They can bring people together. 
 And if the Internet doesn't like it,when you try to remove things from it,,just watch what happens,when you try to shut the Internet down.,This took place in Egypt in January 2011,,and as President Hosni Mubarak,attempted a desperate move,to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo,,he sent his personal troops,down to Egypt's Internet service providers,and had them physically kill the switch,on the country's connection to the world overnight.,For a government to do a thing like that,was unprecedented,,and for hackers, it made it personal.,Hackers like the Telecomix group,were already active on the ground,,helping Egyptians bypass censorship,using clever workarounds like Morse code,and ham radio.,It was high season for low tech,,which the government couldn't block,,but when the Net went completely down,,Telecomix brought in the big guns.,They found European service providers,that still had 20-year-old,analog dial-up access infrastructure.,They opened up 300 of those lines,for Egyptians to use,,serving slow but sweet Internet connection,for Egyptians.,This worked.,It worked so well, in fact,,one guy even used it to download an episode,of "How I Met Your Mother.",But while Egypt's future is still uncertain,,when the same thing happened in Syria,just one year later,,Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines,,and Anonymous,,they were perhaps the first international group,to officially denounce the actions,of the Syrian military,by defacing their website. 
 But with this sort of power,,it really depends on where you stand,,because one man's hero,can be another's villain,,and so the Syrian Electronic Army,is a pro-Assad group of hackers,who support his contentious regime.,They've taken down multiple high-profile targets,in the past few years,,including the Associated Press's Twitter account,,in which they posted a message,about an attack on the White House,injuring President Obama.,This tweet was fake, of course,,but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index,that day was most certainly not,,and a lot of people lost a lot of money. 
 This sort of thing is happeningnall over the world right now.,In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula,to Latin America,,from Europe to the United States,,hackers are a force for social,,political and military influence.,As individuals or in groups,,volunteers or military conflicts,,there are hackers everywhere.,They come from all walks of life,,ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.,They are now shaping the world's stage.,Hackers represent an exceptional force for change,in the 21st century.,This is because access to information,is a critical currency of power,,one which governments would like to control,,a thing they attempt to do by setting up,all-you-can-eat surveillance programs,,a thing they need hackers for, by the way.,And so the establishment has long had,a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers,,because the same people who demonize hacking,also utilize it at large. 
 Two years ago,,I saw General Keith Alexander.,He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,,but instead of his four star general uniform,,he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.,This was at DEF CON,,the world's largest hacker conference.,Perhaps like me, General Alexander,didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.,I think he saw untapped potential.,In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.,"In this room right here," he said,,"is the talent our nation needs.",Well, hackers in the back row replied,,"Then stop arresting us.",(Applause) 
 Indeed, for years,,hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence,,but in light of what we know now,,who is more watchful of our online world?,The rules of the game are not that clear anymore,,but hackers are perhaps the only ones,still capable of challengingnoverreaching governments,and data-hoarding corporates,on their own playing field.,To me, that represents hope. 
 For the past three decades,,hackers have done a lot of things,,but they have also impacted civil liberties,,innovation and Internet freedom,,so I think it's time we take a good look,at how we choose to portray them,,because if we keep expectingnthem to be the bad guys,,how can they be the heroes too?,My years in the hacker world,have made me realize,both the problem and the beauty about hackers:,They just can't see something broken in the world,and leave it be.,They are compelled,to either exploit it or try and change it,,and so they find the vulnerable aspects,in our rapidly changing world.,They make us, they force us to fix things,or demand something better,,and I think we need them,to do just that,,because after all, it is not information,that wants to be free, it's us. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 Hack the planet!I recently retired,from the California Highway Patrol,after 23 years of service.,The majority of those 23 years,was spent patrolling the southern end,of Marin County,,which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.,The bridge is an iconic structure,,known worldwide,for its beautiful views of San Francisco,,the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture. 
 Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,,being one of the most utilized sites in the world.,The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.,Joseph Strauss, chief engineernin charge of building the bridge,,was quoted as saying,,"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.,Suicide from the bridge,is neither practical nor probable.",But since its opening,,over 1,600 people have leapt to their death,from that bridge.,Some believe that traveling,between the two towers,will lead you to another dimension --,this bridge has been romanticized as such —,that the fall from that,frees you from all your worries and grief,,and the waters below,will cleanse your soul. 
 But let me tell you what actually occurs,when the bridge is used,as a means of suicide.,After a free fall of four to five seconds,,the body strikes the water,at about 75 miles an hour.,That impact shatters bones,,some of which then puncture vital organs.,Most die on impact.,Those that don't,generally flail in the water helplessly,,and then drown.,I don't think that those who contemplate,this method of suicide,realize how grisly a death that they will face.,This is the cord.,Except for around the two towers,,there is 32 inches of steel,paralleling the bridge.,This is where most folks stand,before taking their lives.,I can tell you from experience,that once the person is on that cord,,and at their darkest time,,it is very difficult to bring them back.,I took this photo last year,as this young woman spoke to an officer,contemplating her life.,I want to tell you very happily,that we were successful that day,in getting her back over the rail. 
 When I first began working on the bridge,,we had no formal training.,You struggled to funnel yournway through these calls.,This was not only a disservice,to those contemplating suicide,,but to the officers as well.,We've come a long, long way since then.,Now, veteran officers and psychologists,train new officers. 
 This is Jason Garber.,I met Jason on July 22 of last year,when I get received a call,of a possible suicidal subject,sitting on the cord near midspan.,I responded, and when I arrived,,I observed Jason,speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.,Jason was just 32 years old,and had flown out here from New Jersey.,As a matter of fact,,he had flown out here on two other occasions,from New Jersey,to attempt suicide on this bridge.,After about an hour of speaking with Jason,,he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.,Recalling your Greek mythology,,Zeus created Pandora,,and sent her down to Earth with a box,,and told her, "Never, ever open that box.",Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,,and she did open the box.,Out flew plagues, sorrows,,and all sorts of evils against man.,The only good thing in the box was hope.,Jason then asked us,,"What happens when you open the box,and hope isn't there?",He paused a few moments,,leaned to his right,,and was gone.,This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey,had just committed suicide. 
 I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,,and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,,that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,,because that very next day,,their family rabbi called to check on me.,Jason's parents had asked him to do so.,The collateral damage of suicide,affects so many people. 
 I pose these questions to you:,What would you do if your family member,,friend or loved one was suicidal?,What would you say?,Would you know what to say?,In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,,but the listening.,Listen to understand.,Don't argue, blame,,or tell the person you know how they feel,,because you probably don't.,By just being there,,you may just be the turning point that they need.,If you think someone is suicidal,,don't be afraid to confrontnthem and ask the question.,One way of asking them the question is like this:,"Others in similar circumstances,have thought about ending their life;,have you had these thoughts?",Confronting the person head-on,may just save their life andnbe the turning point for them.,Some other signs to look for:,hopelessness, believing that things are terrible,and never going to get better;,helplessness, believing that there is nothing,that you can do about it;,recent social withdrawal;,and a loss of interest in life. 
 I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,,and I received an email from a lady,that I'd like to read you her letter.,She lost her son on January 19 of this year,,and she wrote this me this email,just a couple of days ago,,and it's with her permission and blessing,that I read this to you. 
 "Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.,That must be quite the experience to be there.,I'm thinking I should go walknthe bridge this weekend.,Just wanted to drop you a note.,Hope you get the word out to many people,and they go home talking about it,to their friends who tell their friends, etc.,I'm still pretty numb,,but noticing more moments of really realizing,Mike isn't coming home.,Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco,to watch the 49ers game with his father,on January 19.,He never made it there.,I called Petaluma police,and reported him missing that evening.,The next morning,,two officers came to my home,and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.,A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge,at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.,Thanks so much,for standing up for those,who may be only temporarily too weak,to stand for themselves.,Who hasn't been low before,without suffering from a true mental illness?,It shouldn't be so easy to end it.,My prayers are with you for your fight.,The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,,is supposed to be a passage across,our beautiful bay,,not a graveyard.,Good luck this week. Vicky." 
 I can't imagine the courage it takes for her,to go down to that bridge and walk the path,that her son took that day,,and also the courage just to carry on. 
 I'd like to introduce you to a man,I refer to as hope and courage.,On March 11 of 2005,,I responded to a radio call of a possible,suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk,near the north tower.,I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk,and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,,standing on the sidewalk.,When he saw me, he immediately traversed,that pedestrian rail,,and stood on that small pipe,which goes around the tower.,For the next hour and a half,,I listened as Kevin spoke about,his depression and hopelessness.,Kevin decided on his own that day,to come back over that rail,and give life another chance.,When Kevin came back over,,I congratulated him.,"This is a new beginning, a new life.",But I asked him, "What was it,that made you come back,and give hope and life another chance?",And you know what he told me?,He said, "You listened.,You let me speak, and you just listened." 
 Shortly after this incident,,I received a letter from Kevin's mother,,and I have that letter with me,,and I'd like to read it to you. 
 "Dear Mr. Briggs,,Nothing will erase the events of March 11,,but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.,I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.,He has been diagnosed with a mental illness,for which he has been properly medicated.,I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,,completely unaware of any hereditary traits,,but, thank God, now we know.,Kevin is straight, as he says.,We truly thank God for you.,Sincerely indebted to you,,Narvella Berthia.",And on the bottom she writes,,"P.S. When I visited San FrancisconGeneral Hospital that evening,,you were listed as the patient.,Boy, did I have to straighten that one out." 
 Today, Kevin is a loving father,and contributing member of society.,He speaks openly,about the events that day and his depression,in the hopes that his story,will inspire others. 
 Suicide is not just somethingnI've encountered on the job.,It's personal.,My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.,That act, although ending his own pain,,robbed me from ever getting to know him.,This is what suicide does.,For most suicidal folks,,or those contemplating suicide,,they wouldn't think of hurting another person.,They just want their own pain to end.,Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:,sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.,In my career, I've responded to,and been involved in hundreds,of mental illness and suicide calls,around the bridge.,Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,,I've only lost two,,but that's two too many.,One was Jason.,The other was a man I spoke to,for about an hour.,During that time, he shook my hand,on three occasions.,On that final handshake,,he looked at me, and he said,,"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go.",And he leapt.,Horrible, absolutely horrible. 
 I do want to tell you, though,,the vast majority of folks,that we do get to contact on that bridge,do not commit suicide.,Additionally, that very few,who have jumped off the bridge and lived,and can talk about it,,that one to two percent,,most of those folks have said,that the second that they let go of that rail,,they knew that they had made a mistake,and they wanted to live.,I tell people, the bridge not only connects,Marin to San Francisco,,but people together also.,That connection, or bridge that we make,,is something that each and every one of us,should strive to do.,Suicide is preventable.,There is help. There is hope. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Type is something we consume,in enormous quantities.,In much of the world,,it's completely inescapable.,But few consumers are concerned to know,where a particular typeface came from,or when or who designed it,,if, indeed, there was any human agency involved,in its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize,out of the software ether. 
 But I do have to be concerned with those things.,It's my job.,I'm one of the tiny handful of people,who gets badly bent out of shape,by the bad spacing of the T and the E,that you see there.,I've got to take that slide off.,I can't stand it. Nor can Chris.,There. Good. 
 So my talk is about the connection,between technology and design of type.,The technology has changed,a number of times since I started work:,photo, digital, desktop, screen, web.,I've had to survive those changes and try,to understand their implications for what I do,for design.,This slide is about the effect of tools on form.,The two letters, the two K's,,the one on your left, my right, is modern,,made on a computer.,All straight lines are dead straight.,The curves have that kind ofnmathematical smoothness,that the Bézier formula imposes.,On the right, ancient Gothic,,cut in the resistant material of steel by hand.,None of the straight lines are actually straight.,The curves are kind of subtle.,It has that spark of life from the human hand,that the machine or the program,can never capture.,What a contrast. 
 Well, I tell a lie.,A lie at TED. I'm really sorry.,Both of these were made on a computer,,same software, same Bézier curves,,same font format.,The one on your left,was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre,,and I did the other one.,The tool is the same, yet the letters are different.,The letters are different,because the designers are different.,That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that.,I wanted mine to look like that. End of story.,Type is very adaptable.,Unlike a fine art, such as sculpture or architecture,,type hides its methods.,I think of myself as an industrial designer.,The thing I design is manufactured,,and it has a function:,to be read, to convey meaning.,But there is a bit more to it than that.,There's the sort of aesthetic element.,What makes these two letters different,from different interpretations by different designers?,What gives the work of some designers,sort of characteristic personal style,,as you might find in the work of a fashion designer,,an automobile designer, whatever? 
 There have been some cases, I admit,,where I as a designer,did feel the influence of technology.,This is from the mid-'60s,,the change from metal type to photo,,hot to cold.,This brought some benefits,but also one particular drawback:,a spacing system that only provided,18 discrete units for letters,to be accommodated on.,I was asked at this time to design,a series of condensed sans serif types,with as many different variants as possible,within this 18-unit box.,Quickly looking at the arithmetic,,I realized I could only actually make three,of related design. Here you see them.,In Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed,,and Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system,really boxed me in.,It kind of determined the proportions,of the design.,Here are the typefaces, at least the lower cases.,So do you look at these and say,,"Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem,,and by God it shows in the results.",I hope not.,If I were doing this same job today,,instead of having 18 spacing units,,I would have 1,000.,Clearly I could make more variants,,but would these three membersnof the family be better?,It's hard to say without actually doing it,,but they would not be better in the proportion,of 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.,My instinct tells you that any improvement,would be rather slight, because they were designed,as functions of the system they were designed to fit,,and as I said, type is very adaptable.,It does hide its methods.,All industrial designers work within constraints.,This is not fine art. 
 The question is, does a constraint,force a compromise?,By accepting a constraint,,are you working to a lower standard?,I don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged,by something that Charles Eames said.,He said he was conscious of working,within constraints,,but not of making compromises.,The distinction between a constraint,and a compromise is obviously very subtle,,but it's very central to my attitude to work. 
 Remember this reading experience?,The phone book. I'll hold the slide,so you can enjoy the nostalgia.,This is from the mid-'70s early trials,of Bell Centennial typeface I designed,for the U.S. phone books,,and it was my first experience of digital type,,and quite a baptism.,Designed for the phone books, as I said,,to be printed at tiny size on newsprint,on very high-speed rotary presses,with ink that was kerosene and lampblack.,This is not a hospitable environment,for a typographic designer.,So the challenge for me was to design type,that performed as well as possible,in these very adverse production conditions.,As I say, we were in the infancy of digital type.,I had to draw every character by hand,on quadrille graph paper --,there were four weights of Bell Centennial —,pixel by pixel, then encodenthem raster line by raster line,for the keyboard.,It took two years, but I learned a lot.,These letters look as though they've been chewed,by the dog or something or other,,but the missing pixels at the intersections,of strokes or in the crotches,are the result of my studying the effects,of ink spread on cheap paper,and reacting, revising the font accordingly.,These strange artifacts are designed to compensate,for the undesirable effects of scale,and production process.,At the outset, AT&T had wanted,to set the phone books in Helvetica,,but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said,in the Helvetica movie, if you've seen that,,the letters in Helvetica were designed to be,as similar to one another as possible.,This is not the recipe for legibility at small size.,It looks very elegant up on a slide.,I had to disambiguate these forms,of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial,by sort of opening the shapes up, as you can see,in the bottom part of that slide. 
 So now we're on to the mid-'80s,,the early days of digital outline fonts,,vector technology.,There was an issue at that time,with the size of the fonts,,the amount of data that was required to find,and store a font in computer memory.,It limited the number of fonts you could get,on your typesetting system at any one time.,I did an analysis of the data,,and found that a typical serif face,you see on the left,needed nearly twice as much data,as a sans serif in the middle,because of all the points required,to define the elegantly curved serif brackets.,The numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way,,they represent the amount of data,needed to store each of the fonts.,So the sans serif, in the middle,,sans the serifs, was much more economical,,81 to 151. 
 "Aha," I thought. "The engineers have a problem.,Designer to the rescue." 
 I made a serif type, you can see it on the right,,without curved serifs.,I made them polygonal, outnof straight line segments,,chamfered brackets.,And look, as economical in data as a sans serif.,We call it Charter, on the right. 
 So I went to the head of engineering,with my numbers, and I said proudly,,"I have solved your problem." 
 "Oh," he said. "What problem?" 
 And I said, "Well, you know, the problem,of the huge data you requirenfor serif fonts and so on." 
 "Oh," he said. "We solved that problem last week.,We wrote a compaction routine that reduces,the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude.,You can have as many fonts on your system,as you like." 
 "Well, thank you for letting me know," I said. 
 Foiled again.,I was left with a design solution,for a nonexistent technical problem. 
 But here is where the story sortnof gets interesting for me.,I didn't just throw my design away,in a fit of pique.,I persevered.,What had started as a technical exercise,became an aesthetic exercise, really.,In other words, I had come to like this typeface.,Forget its origins. Screw that.,I liked the design for its own sake.,The simplified forms of Charter,gave it a sort of plain-spoken quality,and unfussy spareness,that sort of pleased me.,You know, at times of technical innovation,,designers want to be influenced,by what's in the air.,We want to respond. We want to be pushed,into exploring something new.,So Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.,In the end, there was no hard and fast causal link,between the technology and the design of Charter.,I had really misunderstood the technology.,The technology did suggest something to me,,but it did not force my hand,,and I think this happens very often. 
 You know, engineers are very smart,,and despite occasional frustrations,because I'm less smart,,I've always enjoyed working with them,and learning from them.,Apropos, in the mid-'90s,,I started talking to Microsoft,about screen fonts.,Up to that point, all the fonts on screen,had been adapted from previously existing,printing fonts, of course.,But Microsoft foresaw correctly,the movement, the stampede,towards electronic communication,,to reading and writing onscreen,with the printed output as being sort of secondary,in importance. 
 So the priorities were just tipping at that point.,They wanted a small core set of fonts,that were not adapted but designed for the screen,to face up to the problems of screen,,which were their coarse resolution displays.,I said to Microsoft, a typeface designed,for a particular technology,is a self-obsoleting typeface.,I've designed too many faces in the past,that were intended to mitigate technical problems.,Thanks to the engineers, thentechnical problems went away.,So did my typeface.,It was only a stopgap.,Microsoft came back to say that,affordable computer monitors,with better resolutions,were at least a decade away.,So I thought, well, a decade, that's not bad,,that's more than a stopgap. 
 So I was persuaded, I was convinced,,and we went to work on what became Verdana,and Georgia,,for the first time working not on paper,but directly onto the screen from the pixel up.,At that time, screens were binary.,The pixel was either on or it was off.,Here you see the outline of a letter,,the cap H,,which is the thin black line, the contour,,which is how it is stored in memory,,superimposed on the bitmap,,which is the grey area,,which is how it's displayed on the screen.,The bitmap is rasterized from the outline.,Here in a cap H, which is all straight lines,,the two are in almost perfect sync,on the Cartesian grid.,Not so with an O.,This looks more like bricklayingnthan type design,,but believe me, this is a good bitmap O,,for the simple reason that it's symmetrical,in both x and y axes.,In a binary bitmap, you actually can't ask,for more than that.,I would sometimes make, I don't know,,three or four different versions of a difficult letter,like a lowercase A,,and then stand back to choose which was the best.,Well, there was no best,,so the designer's judgment comes in,in trying to decide,which is the least bad.,Is that a compromise?,Not to me, if you are working,at the highest standard the technology will allow,,although that standard may be,well short of the ideal.,You may be able to see on this slide,two different bitmap fonts there.,The "a" in the upper one, I think,,is better than the "a" in the lower one,,but it still ain't great.,You can maybe see the effect better,if it's reduced. Well, maybe not. 
 So I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist,,out of necessity.,For a certain kind of temperament,,there is a certain kind of satisfaction,in doing something that cannot be perfect,but can still be done to the best of your ability.,Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic.,The bitmap looks jagged and rough.,It is jagged and rough.,But I discovered, by experiment,,that there is an optimum slant,for an italic on a screen,so the strokes break well,at the pixel boundaries.,Look in this example how, rough as it is,,how the left and right legs,actually break at the same level.,That's a victory. That's good, right there.,And of course, at the lower depths,,you don't get much choice.,This is an S, in case you were wondering. 
 Well, it's been 18 years now,since Verdana and Georgia were released.,Microsoft were absolutely right,,it took a good 10 years,,but screen displays now do have,improved spatial resolution,,and very much improved photometric resolution,thanks to anti-aliasing and so on.,So now that their mission is accomplished,,has that meant the demise,of the screen fonts that I designed,for coarser displays back then?,Will they outlive the now-obsolete screens,and the flood of new web fonts,coming on to the market?,Or have they established their own,sort of evolutionary niche,that is independent of technology?,In other words, have they been absorbed,into the typographic mainstream?,I'm not sure, but they've had a good run so far.,Hey, 18 is a good age for anything,with present-day rates of attrition,,so I'm not complaining. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Even nature's most disgusting creatures,have important secrets,,but who would want a swarm of cockroaches,coming towards them? 
 Yet one of the greatest differencesnbetween natural and human technologies,relates to robustness.,Robust systems are stable in complex,and new environments.,Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize,running over rough terrain.,When we put a jet pack on them,,or give them a perturbation like an earthquake,,we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs,allow them to self-stabilize,without using any of their brainpower.,They can go over complex terrain like grass,,no problem, and not get destabilized.,We discovered a new behavior where,,because of their shape,,they actually roll automatically to their side,to go through this artificial test bit of grass. 
 Robust systems can perform multiple tasks,with the same structure.,Here's a new behavior we've discovered.,The animals rapidly invert and disappear,in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them —,using the same structures thatnthey use to run, their legs.,They can run upside down,very rapidly on rods, branches and wires,,and if you perturb one of those branches,,they can do this.,They can perform gymnastic maneuvers,like no robot we have yet.,And they have nearly unlimited,maneuverability with that same structure,and unprecedented access to a variety,of different areas.,They have wings for flying when they get warm,,but they use those same wings to flip over,if they get destabilized.,Very effective. 
 Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.,This is the foot of a cockroach.,It has spines, gluey pads and claws,,but if you take off those feet,,they can still go over rough terrain,,like the bottom video that you see,,without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.,They can run up mesh without their feet.,Here's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:,three legs, three legs, three legs,,but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.,Here's one moving with two middle legs gone.,It can even lose three legs, in a tripod,,and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.,And I point out that all of these videos,are slowed down 20 times,,so they're actually really fast, when you see this. 
 Robust systems are also damage resistant.,Here's an animal climbing up a wall.,It looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,,but when you slow it down,,you see something very different.,Here's what they do.,They intentionally have anhead-on collision with the wall,so they don't slow down and can transition up it,in 75 milliseconds.,And they can do this in part because they have,extraordinary exoskeletons.,And they're really just made up of compliant joints,that are tubes and plates,connected to one another.,Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.,You see these plates, and younsee the compliant membrane. 
 My engineering colleague at Berkeley,designed with his students,a novel manufacturing technique,where you essentially origami the exoskeleton,,you laser cut it, laminate it,,and you fold it up into a robot.,And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.,These robots, called DASH,,for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,,are highly compliant robots,,and they're remarkably robust as a result,of these features.,They're certainly incredibly damage resistant.,(Laughter),They even have some of thenbehaviors of the cockroaches.,So they can use their smart, compliant body,to transition up a wall,in a very simple way.,They even have some of the beginnings,of the rapid inversion behavior,where they disappear. 
 Now we want to know why they can go anywhere.,We discovered that they can go through,three-millimeter gaps,,the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,,and when they do this,,they can actually run through those confined spaces,at high speeds,,although you never see it.,To understand it better,,we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton,and showed that they can compress their body,by over 40 percent.,We put them in a materials testing machine,to look at the stress strain analysis,and showed that they can withstand forces,800 times their body weight,,and after this they can fly and run,absolutely normally. 
 So you never know where,curiosity-based research will lead,,and someday you may want a swarm,of cockroach-inspired robots,to come at you.,(Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Approximately 30 years ago,,when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital,in Philadelphia,,a father and a son walked into my office,and they both had their right eye missing,,and as I took the history, it became apparent,that the father and the son had a rare form,of inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,,and the father knew that he had passed that fate,on to his son. 
 That moment changed my life.,It propelled me to go on,and to co-lead a team that discovered,the first cancer susceptibility gene,,and in the intervening decades since then,,there has been literally a seismic shift,in our understanding of what goes on,,what genetic variations are sitting behind,various diseases.,In fact, for thousands of human traits,,a molecular basis that's known for that,,and for thousands of people, every day,,there's information that they gain,about the risk of going on to get this disease,or that disease. 
 At the same time, if you ask,,"Has that impacted the efficiency,,how we've been able to develop drugs?",the answer is not really.,If you look at the cost of developing drugs,,how that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.,And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose,yet not the power to fully treat.,And there are two commonly given reasons,for why that happens.,One of them is it's early days.,We're just learning the words, the fragments,,the letters in the genetic code.,We don't know how to read the sentences.,We don't know how to follow the narrative.,The other reason given is that,most of those changes are a loss of function,,and it's actually really hard to develop drugs,that restore function. 
 But today, I want us to step back,and ask a more fundamental question,,and ask, "What happens if we're thinking,about this maybe in the wrong context?",We do a lot of studying of those who are sick,and building up long lists,of altered components.,But maybe, if what we're trying to do,is to develop therapies for prevention,,maybe what we should be doing,is studying those who don't get sick.,Maybe we should be studying those,that are well.,A vast majority of those people,are not necessarily carrying a particular,genetic load or risk factor.,They're not going to help us.,There are going to be those individuals,who are carrying a potential future risk,,they're going to go on to get some symptom.,That's not what we're looking for.,What we're asking and looking for is,,are there a very few set of individuals,who are actually walking around,with the risk that normally would cause a disease,,but something in them, something hidden in them,is actually protective,and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms? 
 If you're going to do a studynlike that, you can imagine,you'd like to look at lots and lots of people.,We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,,and we realized that actually,one way to think of this is,,let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,,and let's make sure that we look at those,who were healthy as kids.,They might have had individuals in their families,who had had a childhood disease,,but not necessarily.,And let's go and then screen those,to find those who are carrying genes,for childhood diseases. 
 Now, some of you, I can see you,putting your hands up going, "Uh, a little odd.,What's your evidence,that this could be feasible?",I want to give you two examples. 
 The first comes from San Francisco.,It comes from the 1980s and the 1990s,,and you may know the story where,there were individuals who had very high levels,of the virus HIV.,They went on to get AIDS.,But there was a very small set of individuals,who also had very high levels of HIV.,They didn't get AIDS.,And astute clinicians tracked that down,,and what they found wasnthey were carrying mutations.,Notice, they were carrying mutations from birth,that were protective, that were protecting them,from going on to get AIDS.,You may also know that actually a line of therapy,has been coming along based on that fact.,Second example, more recent, is elegant work,done by Helen Hobbs,,who said, "I'm going to look at individuals,who have very high lipid levels,,and I'm going to try to find those people,with high lipid levels,who don't go on to get heart disease.",And again, what she found was,some of those individuals had mutations,that were protective from birth that kept them,,even though they had high lipid levels,,and you can see this is an interesting way,of thinking about how you could develop,preventive therapies. 
 The project that we're working on,is called "The Resilience Project:,A Search for Unexpected Heroes,",because what we are interested in doing is saying,,can we find those rare individuals,who might have these hidden protective factors?,And in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,,a sort of resilience decoder ring,that we're going to try to build.,We've realized that we should ndo this in a systematic way,,so we've said, let's take every single,childhood inherited disease.,Let's take them all, and let'snpull them back a little bit,by those that are known to have severe symptoms,,where the parents, the child,,those around them would know,that they'd gotten sick,,and let's go ahead and then frame them again,by those parts of the genes where we know,that there is a particular alteration,that is known to be highly penetrant,to cause that disease. 
 Where are we going to look?,Well, we could look locally. That makes sense.,But we began to think, maybe we should look,all over the world.,Maybe we should look not just here,but in remote places where their might be,a distinct genetic context,,there might be environmental factors,that protect people.,And let's look at a million individuals. 
 Now the reason why we think it's a good time,to do that now,is, in the last couple of years,,there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost,to do this type of analysis,,this type of data generation,,to where it actually costs less to do,the data generation and analysis,than it does to do the samplenprocessing and the collection.,The other reason is that in the last five years,,there have been awesome tools,,things about network biology, systems biology,,that have come up that allow us to think,that maybe we could decipher,those positive outliers. 
 And as we went around talking to researchers,and institutions,and telling them about our story,,something happened.,They started saying, "This is interesting.,I would be glad to join your effort.,I would be willing to participate.",And they didn't say, "Where's the MTA?",They didn't say, "Where is my authorship?",They didn't say, "Is this data going nto be mine? Am I going to own it?",They basically said, "Let's work on this,in an open, crowd-sourced, team way,to do this decoding." 
 Six months ago, we locked down,the screening key for this decoder.,My co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt,at the Icahn Mount SinainSchool of Medicine in New York,,and his team,,locked in that decoder key ring,,and we began looking for samples,,because what we realized is,,maybe we could just go and look,at some existing samples tonget some sense of feasibility.,Maybe we could take two, three npercent of the project on,,and see if it was there.,And so we started asking people,such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.,We asked Leif up in Finland.,We talked to Anne Wojcicki at 23andMe,,and Wang Jun at BGI,,and again, something remarkable happened.,They said, "Huh,,not only do we have samples,,but often we've analyzed them,,and we would be glad to go into,our anonymized samples,and see if we could find those,that you're looking for.",And instead of being 20,000 or 30,000,,last month we passed one half million samples,that we've already analyzed. 
 So you must be going,,"Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?",And the answer is, we didn't find one or two.,We found dozens of these strong candidate,unexpected heroes. 
 So we think that the time is now,to launch the beta phase of this project,and actually start getting prospective individuals.,Basically all we need is information.,We need a swab of DNA,and a willingness to say, "What's inside me?,I'm willing to be re-contacted." 
 Most of us spend our lives,,when it comes to health and disease,,acting as if we're voyeurs.,We delegate the responsibility,for the understanding of our disease,,for the treatment of our disease,,to anointed experts.,In order for us to get this project to work,,we need individuals to step up,in a different role and to be engaged,,to realize this dream,,this open crowd-sourced project,,to find those unexpected heroes,,to evolve from the current concepts,of resources and constraints,,to design those preventive therapies,,and to extend it beyond childhood diseases,,to go all the way up to ways,that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,,we're going to need us,to be looking inside ourselves and asking,,"What are our roles?,What are our genes?",and looking within ourselves for information,we used to say we should go to the outside,,to experts,,and to be willing to share that with others.

 So I was born and raised,in the shadow of a shipyard,in a little town on the northeast coast of England.,Some of my earliest memories,are of giant ships,blocking the end of my street,,as well as the sun, for a lot of the year.,Every morning as a child,,I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill,to work in the shipyard.,I'd watch those same men,walking back home every night.,It has to be said, the shipyard was not,the most pleasant place to live next door to,,or indeed work in.,The shipyard was noisy, dangerous,,highly toxic,,with an appalling health and safety record. 
 Despite that, the men and women,who worked on those ships,were extraordinarily proud of the work they did,,and justifiably so.,Some of the largest vessels,ever constructed on planet Earth,were built right at the end of my street. 
 My grandfather had been a shipwright,,and as a child,,as there were few other jobs in the town,,I would wonder with some anxiety,whether that would be my destiny too.,I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be.,I had other dreams,,not necessarily practical ones,,but at the age of eight,,I was bequeathed a guitar.,It was a battered old thing,with five rusty strings, and was out of tune,,but quickly I learned to play it,and realized that I'd found a friend for life,,an accomplice, a co-conspirator,in my plan to escape from this surreal,industrial landscape. 
 Well, they say if you dream something hard enough,,it will come to pass.,Either that, or I was extremely lucky,,but this was my dream.,I dreamt I would leave this town,,and just like those ships,,once they were launched, I'd never come back.,I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs,,that I would sing those songs,to vast numbers of people all over the world,,that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money,,that I'd become famous,,that I'd marry a beautiful woman,,have children, raise a family,,buy a big house in the country,,keep dogs, grow wine,,have rooms full of Grammy Awards,,platinum discs, and what have you.,So far, so good, right? (Laughter) 
 And then one day, the songs stopped coming,,and while you've suffered from periods,of writer's block before, albeit briefly,,this is something chronic.,Day after day, you face a blank page,,and nothing's coming.,And those days turned tonweeks, and weeks to months,,and pretty soon those months,have turned into years,with very little to show for your efforts. No songs.,So you start asking yourself questions.,What have I done to offend the gods,that they would abandon me so?,Is the gift of songwriting taken away,as easily as it seems to have been bestowed?,Or perhaps there's a more --,a deeper psychological reason.,It was always a Faustian pact anyway.,You're rewarded for revealing,your innermost thoughts,,your private emotions on the page,for the entertainment of others,,for the analysis, the scrutiny of others,,and perhaps you've given enough,of your privacy away. 
 And yet, if you look at your work,,could it be argued that your best work,wasn't about you at all,,it was about somebody else?,Did your best work occur,when you sidestepped your own ego,and you stopped telling your story,,but told someone else's story,,someone perhaps without a voice,,where empathetically, you stood in his shoes,for a while or saw the world through his eyes? 
 Well they say, write what you know.,If you can't write about yourself anymore,,then who do you write about?,So it's ironic that the landscape,I'd worked so hard to escape from,,and the community that I'd more or less abandoned,and exiled myself from,should be the very landscape,,the very community I would have to return to,to find my missing muse. 
 And as soon as I did that,,as soon as I decided to honor the community,I came from and tell their story,,that the songs started to come thick and fast.,I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting,,a torrent of ideas, of characters, of voices,,of verses, couplets, entire songs,almost formed whole,,materialized in front of me,as if they'd been bottled up inside me,for many, many years.,One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names,of people I'd known,,and they become characters,in a kind of three-dimensional drama,,where they explain who they are, what they do,,their hopes and their fears for the future. 
 This is Jackie White.,He's the foreman of the shipyard. 
 My name is Jackie White,,and I'm foreman of the yard,,and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.,I'm as hard as iron plate,,woe betide you if you're late,when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide.,Now you can die and hope for heaven,,but you need to work your shift,,and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt,,for if St. Peter at his gate,were to ask you why you're late,,why, you tell him that you had to get a ship built.,We build battleships and cruisers 
 for Her Majesty the Queen,,supertankers for Onassis,nand all the classes in between,,We built the greatest ship in tonnage,what the world has ever seen

 ♪ Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul ♪ 
 ♪ Would conjure up a ship ♪ 
 ♪ Where there used to be a hull ♪ 
 ♪ And we don't know what we'll do ♪ 
 ♪ If this yard gets sold ♪ 
 ♪ For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard ♪ 
 (Applause) 
 So having decided to write about other people,instead of myself,,a further irony is that sometimes you reveal,more about yourself than you'd ever intended.,This song is called "Dead Man's Boots,",which is an expression,which describes how difficult it is to get a job;,in other words, you'd only get a job in the shipyard,if somebody else died.,Or perhaps your father could finagle you,an apprenticeship at the age of 15.,But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued,as controlling,,and conversely, the scope of his son's ambition,can seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy.,(Music)

 Thank you. 
 So whenever they'd launch a big ship,,they would invite some dignitary up from London,on the train to make a speech,,break a bottle of champagne over the bows,,launch it down the slipway,into the river and out to sea.,Occasionally on a really important ship,,they'd get a member of the royal family to come,,Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Anne or somebody.,And you have to remember, it wasn't that long ago,that the royal family in England,were considered to have magical healing powers.,Sick children were held up in crowds,to try and touch the cloak,of the king or the queen to cure them,of some terrible disease.,It wasn't like that in my day,nbut we still got very excited. 
 So it's a launch day, it's a Saturday,,and my mother has dressednme up in my Sunday best.,I'm not very happy with her.,All the kids are out in the street,,and we have little Union Jacks to wave,,and at the top of the hill,,there's a motorcycle cortege appears.,In the middle of the motorcycles,,there's a big, black Rolls-Royce.,Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother.,This is a big deal.,So the procession is moving,at a stately pace down my street,,and as it approaches my house,,I start to wave my flag vigorously,,and there is the Queen Mother.,I see her, and she seems to see me.,She acknowledges me. She waves, and she smiles.,And I wave my flag even more vigorously.,We're having a moment,,me and the Queen Mother.,She's acknowledged me.,And then she's gone. 
 Well, I wasn't cured of anything.,It was the opposite, actually.,I was infected.,I was infected with an idea.,I don't belong in this street.,I don't want to live in that house.,I don't want to end up in that shipyard.,I want to be in that car. (Laughter),I want a bigger life.,I want a life beyond this town.,I want a life that's out of the ordinary.,It's my right.,It's my right as much as hers.,And so here I am at TED,,I suppose to tell that story,,and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious,that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link,between storytelling and community,,between community and art,,between community and science and technology,,between community and economics.,It's my belief that,abstract economic theory,that denies the needs of community,or denies the contribution that community makes,to economy is shortsighted, cruel,and untenable. 
 (Applause) 
 The fact is, whether you're a rock star,or whether you're a welder in a shipyard,,or a tribesman in the upper Amazon,,or the queen of England,,at the end of the day,,we're all in the same boat.

 (Applause)So in 1781, an English composer,,technologist and astronomer called William Herschel,noticed an object on the sky that,didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did.,And Herschel's recognitionnthat something was different,,that something wasn't quite right,,was the discovery of a planet,,the planet Uranus,,a name that has entertained,countless generations of children,,but a planet that overnight,doubled the size of our known solar system.,Just last month, NASA announced the discovery,of 517 new planets,in orbit around nearby stars,,almost doubling overnight the number of planets,we know about within our galaxy.,So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this,capacity to collect data,,and with data almost doubling every year,,within the next two decades, me may even,reach the point for the first time in history,where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies,within the universe. 
 But as we enter this era of big data,,what we're beginning to find is there's a difference,between more data being just better,and more data being different,,capable of changing the questions we want to ask,,and this difference is not aboutnhow much data we collect,,it's whether those data open new windows,into our universe,,whether they change the way we view the sky.,So what is the next window into our universe?,What is the next chapter for astronomy?,Well, I'm going to show you somenof the tools and the technologies,that we're going to develop over the next decade,,and how these technologies,,together with the smart use of data,,may once again transform astronomy,by opening up a window into our universe,,the window of time. 
 Why time? Well, time is about origins,,and it's about evolution.,The origins of our solar system,,how our solar system came into being,,is it unusual or special in any way?,About the evolution of our universe.,Why our universe is continuing to expand,,and what is this mysterious dark energy,that drives that expansion? 
 But first, I want to show you how technology,is going to change the way we view the sky.,So imagine if you were sitting,in the mountains of northern Chile,looking out to the west,towards the Pacific Ocean,a few hours before sunrise.,This is the view of the night sky that you would see,,and it's a beautiful view,,with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon.,but it's also a static view,,and in many ways, this is thenway we think of our universe:,eternal and unchanging.,But the universe is anything but static.,It constantly changes on timescales of seconds,to billions of years.,Galaxies merge, they collide,at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.,Stars are born, they die,,they explode in these extravagant displays.,In fact, if we could go back,to our tranquil skies above Chile,,and we allow time to move forward,to see how the sky might change over the next year,,the pulsations that you see,are supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star,exploding, brightening and then fading from view,,each one of these supernovae,five billion times the brightness of our sun,,so we can see them to great distances,but only for a short amount of time.,Ten supernova per second explode somewhere,in our universe.,If we could hear it,,it would be popping like a bag of popcorn.,Now, if we fade out the supernovae,,it's not just brightness that changes.,Our sky is in constant motion.,This swarm of objects younsee streaming across the sky,are asteroids as they orbit our sun,,and it's these changes and the motion,and it's the dynamics of the system,that allow us to build our models for our universe,,to predict its future and to explain its past. 
 But the telescopes we've used over the last decade,are not designed to capture the data at this scale.,The Hubble Space Telescope:,for the last 25 years it's been producing,some of the most detailed views,of our distant universe,,but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image,of the sky, it would take 13 million individual images,,about 120 years to do this just once. 
 So this is driving us to new technologies,and new telescopes,,telescopes that can go faint,to look at the distant universe,but also telescopes that can go wide,to capture the sky as rapidly as possible,,telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,,or the LSST,,possibly the most boring name ever,for one of the most fascinating experiments,in the history of astronomy,,in fact proof, if you should need it,,that you should never allow na scientist or an engineer,to name anything, not even your children.n(Laughter),We're building the LSST.,We expect it to start taking datanby the end of this decade.,I'm going to show you how we think,it's going to transform nour views of the universe,,because one image from the LSST,is equivalent to 3,000 images,from the Hubble Space Telescope,,each image three and a half degrees on the sky,,seven times the width of the full moon.,Well, how do you capture an image at this scale?,Well, you build the largest digital camera in history,,using the same technology you findnin the cameras in your cell phone,or in the digital cameras you ncan buy in the High Street,,but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across,,about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,,where one image is three billion pixels.,So if you wanted to look at an image,in its full resolution, just a single LSST image,,it would take about 1,500 nhigh-definition TV screens.,And this camera will image the sky,,taking a new picture every 20 seconds,,constantly scanning the sky,so every three nights, we'll get a completely new view,of the skies above Chile.,Over the mission lifetime of this telescope,,it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies,,and that will be for the first time,we'll have detected more objects in our universe,than people on the Earth.,Now, we can talk about this,in terms of terabytes and petabytes,and billions of objects,,but a way to get a sense of the amount of data,that will come off this camera,is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded,simultaneously, 24 hours a day,,seven days a week, for 10 years.,And to process this data means,searching through all of those talks,for every new idea and every new concept,,looking at each part of the video,to see how one frame may have changed,from the next.,And this is changing the way that we do science,,changing the way that we do astronomy,,to a place where software and algorithms,have to mine through this data,,where the software is as critical to the science,as the telescopes and the ncameras that we've built. 
 Now, thousands of discoveries,will come from this project,,but I'm just going to tell you about two,of the ideas about origins and evolution,that may be transformed by our access,to data at this scale. 
 In the last five years, NASA has discovered,over 1,000 planetary systems,around nearby stars,,but the systems we're finding,aren't much like our own solar system,,and one of the questions we face is,is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough,or is there something special or unusual,about how our solar system formed?,And if we want to answer that question,,we have to know and understand,the history of our solar system in detail,,and it's the details that are crucial.,So now, if we look back at the sky,,at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky,,these asteroids are like thendebris of our solar system.,The positions of the asteroids,are like a fingerprint of an earlier time,when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter,were much closer to the sun,,and as these giant planets migratednthrough our solar system,,they were scattering the asteroids in their wake.,So studying the asteroids,is like performing forensics,,performing forensics on our solar system,,but to do this, we need distance,,and we get the distance from the motion,,and we get the motion because of our access to time. 
 So what does this tell us?,Well, if you look at the little yellow asteroids,flitting across the screen,,these are the asteroids that are moving fastest,,because they're closest to us, closest to Earth.,These are the asteroids we may one day,send spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals,,but they're also the asteroids that may one day,impact the Earth,,like happened 60 million years ago,with the extinction of the dinosaurs,,or just at the beginning of the last century,,when an asteroid wiped out,almost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest,,or even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia,,releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb.,So studying the forensics of our solar system,doesn't just tell us about the past,,it can also predict the future, nincluding our future. 
 Now when we get distance,,we get to see the asteroids nin their natural habitat,,in orbit around the sun.,So every point in this visualization that you can see,is a real asteroid.,Its orbit has been calculatednfrom its motion across the sky.,The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids,,dry and stony in the center,,water-rich and primitive towards the edge,,water-rich asteroids which may have seeded,the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet,when they bombarded the nEarth at an earlier time.,Because the LSST will be able to go faint,and not just wide,,we will be able to see these asteroids,far beyond the inner part of our solar system,,to asteroids beyond the norbits of Neptune and Mars,,to comets and asteroids that may exist,almost a light year from our sun.,And as we increase the detail of this picture,,increasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100,,we will be able to answer questions such as,,is there evidence for planetsnoutside the orbit of Neptune,,to find Earth-impacting asteroids,long before they're a danger,,and to find out whether, maybe,,our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars,,and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings,that influenced the formation of our solar system,,and maybe that's one of the reasons why nsolar systems like ours seem to be so rare. 
 Now, distance and changes in our universe —,distance equates to time,,as well as changes on the sky.,Every foot of distance you look away,,or every foot of distance an object is away,,you're looking back about anbillionth of a second in time,,and this idea or this notion of looking back in time,has revolutionized our ideas about the universe,,not once but multiple times. 
 The first time was in 1929,,when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble,showed that the universe was expanding,,leading to the ideas of the Big Bang.,And the observations were simple:,just 24 galaxies,and a hand-drawn picture.,But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy,,the faster it was receding,,was enough to give rise to modern cosmology. 
 A second revolution happened 70 years later,,when two groups of astronomers showed,that the universe wasn't just expanding,,it was accelerating,,a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky,and finding out the higher that it gets,,the faster it moves away.,And they showed this,by measuring the brightness of supernovae,,and how the brightness of the supernovae,got fainter with distance.,And these observations were more complex.,They required new technologies and new telescopes,,because the supernovae were in galaxies,that were 2,000 times more distant,than the ones used by Hubble.,And it took three years to find just 42 supernovae,,because a supernova only explodes,once every hundred years within a galaxy.,Three years to find 42 supernovae,by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies.,And once they'd collected their data,,this is what they found.,Now, this may not look impressive,,but this is what a revolution in physics looks like:,a line predicting the brightness of a supernova,11 billion light years away,,and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line. 
 Small changes give rise to big consequences.,Small changes allow us to make discoveries,,like the planet found by Herschel.,Small changes turn our understanding,of the universe on its head.,So 42 supernovae, slightly too faint,,meaning slightly further away,,requiring that a universe must not just be expanding,,but this expansion must be accelerating,,revealing a component of our universe,which we now call dark energy,,a component that drives this expansion,and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget,of our universe today. 
 So what is the next revolution likely to be?,Well, what is dark energy and why does it exist?,Each of these lines shows a different model,for what dark energy might be,,showing the properties of dark energy.,They all are consistent with the 42 points,,but the ideas behind these lines,are dramatically different.,Some people think about a dark energy,that changes with time,,or whether the properties of the dark energy,are different depending on where you look on the sky.,Others make differences and changes,to the physics at the sub-atomic level.,Or, they look at large scales,and change how gravity and general relativity work,,or they say our universe is just one of many,,part of this mysterious multiverse,,but all of these ideas, all of these theories,,amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy,,but all of them consistent with our 42 points. 
 So how can we hope to make sense of this,over the next decade?,Well, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice,,and I said you wanted to see whether those dice,were loaded or fair.,One roll of the dice would tell you very little,,but the more times you rolled them,,the more data you collected,,the more confident you would become,,not just whether they're loaded or fair,,but by how much, and in what way.,It took three years to find just 42 supernovae,because the telescopes that we built,could only survey a small part of the sky.,With the LSST, we get a completely new view,of the skies above Chile every three nights.,In its first night of operation,,it will find 10 times the number of supernovae,used in the discovery of dark energy.,This will increase by 1,000,within the first four months:,1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey,,each supernova a roll of the dice,,each supernova testing which theories of dark energy,are consistent, and which ones are not.,And so, by combining these supernova data,with other measures of cosmology,,we'll progressively rule out the different ideas,and theories of dark energy,until hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030,,we would expect to hopefully see,a theory for our universe,,a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe,,to gradually emerge. 
 Now, in many ways, the questions that I posed,are in reality the simplest of questions.,We may not know the answers,,but we at least know how to ask the questions.,But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies,revealed 42 supernovae that turned,our understanding of the universe on its head,,when we're working with billions of galaxies,,how many more times are we going to find,42 points that don't quite match what we expect?,Like the planet found by Herschel,or dark energy,or quantum mechanics or general relativity,,all ideas that came because the data,didn't quite match what we expected.,What's so exciting about the next decade of data,in astronomy is,,we don't even know how many answers,are out there waiting,,answers about our origins and our evolution.,How many answers are out there,that we don't even know the questions,that we want to ask? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a tourism entrepreneurnand a peacebuilder,,but this is not how I started.,When I was seven years old,nI remember watching television,and seeing people throwing rocks,,and thinking, this must bena fun thing to do.,So I got out to the streetnand threw rocks,,not realizing I was supposednto throw rocks at Israeli cars.,Instead, I ended up stoningnmy neighbors' cars. (Laughter),They were not enthusiasticnabout my patriotism. 
 This is my picture with my brother.,This is me, the little one,nand I know what you're thinking:,"You used to look cute,nwhat the heck happened to you?",But my brother, who is older than me,,was arrested when he was 18,,taken to prison on chargesnof throwing stones.,He was beaten up when he refusednto confess that he threw stones,,and as a result, had internal injuries,that caused his death soon afternhe was released from prison. 
 I was angry, I was bitter,,and all I wanted was revenge. 
 But that changed when I was 18.,I decided that I needednHebrew to get a job,,and going to study Hebrewnin that classroom,was the first time I ever met Jewsnwho were not soldiers.,And we connected over really small things,nlike the fact that I love country music,,which is really strangenfor Palestinians.,But it was then that I realized alsonthat we have a wall of anger,,of hatred and of ignorancenthat separates us.,I decided that it doesn't matternwhat happens to me.,What really matters is how I deal with it.,And therefore, I decidednto dedicate my life,to bringing down the wallsnthat separate people. 
 I do so through many ways.,Tourism is one of them,nbut also media and education,,and you might be wondering,nreally, can tourism change things?,Can it bring down walls? Yes.,Tourism is the best sustainable waynto bring down those walls,and to create a sustainable waynof connecting with each other,and creating friendships. 
 In 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours,,a social enterprise thatnaims to connect people,,with two Jewish friends, by the way,,and what we'll do, the model we did,,for example, in Jerusalem,nwe would have two tour guides,,one Israeli and one Palestinian,nguiding the trips together,,telling history and narrativenand archaeology and conflict,from totally different perspectives.,I remember running a trip togethernwith a friend named Kobi --,Jewish congregation from Chicago,nthe trip was in Jerusalem --,and we took them to a refugee camp,na Palestinian refugee camp,,and there we had this amazing food.,By the way, this is my mother. She's cool.,And that's the Palestiniannfood called maqluba.,It means "upside-down.",You cook it with rice and chicken,nand you flip it upside-down.,It's the best meal ever.,And we'll eat together.,Then we had a joint band,nIsraeli and Palestinian musicians,,and we did some belly-dancing.,If you don't know any,nI'll teach you later.,But when we left, both sides,,they were crying becausenthey did not want to leave.,Three years later, thosenrelationships still exist. 
 Imagine with menif the one billion people,who travel internationally nevery year travel like this,,not being taken in the busnfrom one side to another,,from one hotel to another,,taking pictures from the windowsnof their buses of people and cultures,,but actually connecting with people. 
 You know, I remember havingna Muslim group from the U.K.,going to the housenof an Orthodox Jewish family,,and having their first Friday nightndinners, that Sabbath dinner,,and eating together hamin,nwhich is a Jewish food, a stew,,just having the connectionnof realizing, after a while,,that a hundred years ago,ntheir families came out,of the same place in Northern Africa.,This is not a photo profilenfor your Facebook.,This is not disaster tourism.,This is the future of travel,,and I invite you to join me to do that,nto change your travel.,We're doing it all over the world now,,from Ireland to Iran to Turkey,,and we see ourselves goingneverywhere to change the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I'm going to talk about work.,And the question I want to asknand answer is this:,"Why do we work?",Why do we drag ourselvesnout of bed every morning,instead of living our lives,just filled with bouncing from onenTED-like adventure to another? 
 (Laughter) 
 You may be asking yourselvesnthat very question.,Now, I know of course,nwe have to make a living,,but nobody in this room thinksnthat that's the answer to the question,,"Why do we work?",For folks in this room,nthe work we do is challenging,,it's engaging, it's stimulating,nit's meaningful.,And if we're lucky,nit might even be important. 
 So, we wouldn't worknif we didn't get paid,,but that's not why we do what we do.,And in general,,I think we think that material rewardsnare a pretty bad reason,for doing the work that we do.,When we say of somebodynthat he's "in it for the money,",we are not just being descriptive. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I think this is totally obvious,,but the very obviousness of itnraises what is for me,an incredibly profound question.,Why, if this is so obvious,,why is it that for the overwhelmingnmajority of people on the planet,,the work they donhas none of the characteristics,that get us up and out of bednand off to the office every morning?,How is it that we allownthe majority of people on the planet,to do work that is monotonous,nmeaningless and soul-deadening?,Why is it that as capitalism developed,,it created a mode of production,nof goods and services,,in which all the nonmaterial satisfactionsnthat might come from work were eliminated?,Workers who do this kind of work,,whether they do it in factories,nin call centers,,or in fulfillment warehouses,,do it for pay.,There is certainly no other earthly reasonnto do what they do except for pay. 
 So the question is, "Why?",And here's the answer:,the answer is technology.,Now, I know, I know --,yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automationnscrews people, blah blah --,that's not what I mean.,I'm not talking aboutnthe kind of technology,that has enveloped our lives,nand that people come to TED to hear about.,I'm not talking aboutnthe technology of things,,profound though that is.,I'm talking about another technology.,I'm talking about the technology of ideas.,I call it, "idea technology" --,how clever of me. 
 (Laughter) 
 In addition to creating things,nscience creates ideas.,Science creates ways of understanding.,And in the social sciences,,the ways of understanding that get creatednare ways of understanding ourselves.,And they have an enormous influencenon how we think, what we aspire to,,and how we act. 
 If you think your povertynis God's will, you pray.,If you think your poverty is the resultnof your own inadequacy,,you shrink into despair.,And if you think your poverty isnthe result of oppression and domination,,then you rise up in revolt.,Whether your response to povertynis resignation or revolution,,depends on how you understandnthe sources of your poverty.,This is the role that ideas playnin shaping us as human beings,,and this is why idea technology may benthe most profoundly important technology,that science gives us. 
 And there's something specialnabout idea technology,,that makes it differentnfrom the technology of things.,With things, if the technology sucks,,it just vanishes, right?,Bad technology disappears.,With ideas --,false ideas about human beingsnwill not go away,if people believe that they're true.,Because if people believenthat they're true,,they create ways of livingnand institutions,that are consistentnwith these very false ideas. 
 And that's how the industrial revolutionncreated a factory system,in which there was really nothing youncould possibly get out of your day's work,,except for the pay at the end of the day.,Because the father --none of the fathers,of the Industrial Revolution,nAdam Smith --,was convinced that human beingsnwere by their very natures lazy,,and wouldn't do anythingnunless you made it worth their while,,and the way you made it worth their while,was by incentivizing,nby giving them rewards.,That was the only reasonnanyone ever did anything.,So we created a factory system consistentnwith that false view of human nature.,But once that systemnof production was in place,,there was really no other waynfor people to operate,,except in a way that was consistentnwith Adam Smith's vision.,So the work example is merely an example,of how false ideasncan create a circumstance,that ends up making them true. 
 It is not true,that you "just can't getngood help anymore.",It is true,that you "can't get good help anymore",when you give people work to donthat is demeaning and soulless.,And interestingly enough, Adam Smith --,the same guy who gave usnthis incredible invention,of mass production, and division of labor,-- understood this.,He said, of people who workednin assembly lines,,of men who workednin assembly lines, he says:,"He generally becomes as stupid as it isnpossible for a human being to become.",Now, notice the word here is "become.","He generally becomes as stupid as it isnpossible for a human being to become.",Whether he intended it or not,nwhat Adam Smith was telling us there,,is that the very shape of the institutionnwithin which people work,creates people who are fittednto the demands of that institution,and deprives people of the opportunity,to derive the kinds of satisfactionsnfrom their work that we take for granted. 
 The thing about science --nnatural science --,is that we can spin fantasticntheories about the cosmos,,and have complete confidence,that the cosmos is completelynindifferent to our theories.,It's going to work the same damn way,no matter what theoriesnwe have about the cosmos.,But we do have to worry aboutnthe theories we have of human nature,,because human nature will be changednby the theories we have,that are designed to explainnand help us understand human beings. 
 The distinguished anthropologist,nClifford Geertz, said, years ago,,that human beingsnare the "unfinished animals.",And what he meant by thatnwas that it is only human nature,to have a human nature,that is very much the productnof the society in which people live.,That human nature,nthat is to say our human nature,,is much more creatednthan it is discovered.,We design human nature,by designing the institutionsnwithin which people live and work. 
 And so you people --,pretty much the closest I ever getnto being with masters of the universe --,you people should be askingnyourself a question,,as you go back homento run your organizations.,Just what kind of human naturendo you want to help design? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks.So I've been thinking about the difference between,the résumé virtues and nthe eulogy virtues.,The résumé virtues are thenones you put on your résumé,,which are the skills nyou bring to the marketplace.,The eulogy virtues are the ones,that get mentioned in the eulogy,,which are deeper: who are you, nin your depth,,what is the nature of your relationships,,are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?,And most of us, including nme, would say,that the eulogy virtues are thenmore important of the virtues.,But at least in my case, nare they the ones that,I think about the most? nAnd the answer is no. 
 So I've been thinking about that problem,,and a thinker who has nhelped me think about it,is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi,who wrote a book called "ThenLonely Man Of Faith" in 1965.,Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures,,which he called Adam Inand Adam II.,Adam I is the worldly, ambitious,,external side of our nature.,He wants to build, create,ncreate companies,,create innovation.,Adam II is the humblenside of our nature.,Adam II wants not only nto do good but to be good,,to live in a way internally,that honors God, creation and our possibilities.,Adam I wants to conquer the world.,Adam II wants to hear na calling and obey the world.,Adam I savors accomplishment.,Adam II savors inner nconsistency and strength.,Adam I asks how things work.,Adam II asks why we're here.,Adam I's motto is "success.",Adam II's motto is "love, redemption and return." 
 And Soloveitchik argued nthat these two sides,of our nature are nat war with each other.,We live in perpetual self-confrontation,between the external success and the internal value.,And the tricky thing, nI'd say, about these,two sides of our nature is they work,by different logics.,The external logic is nan economic logic:,input leads to output, nrisk leads to reward.,The internal side of our nature,is a moral logic and noften an inverse logic.,You have to give to receive.,You have to surrender nto something outside yourself,to gain strength within yourself.,You have to conquer thendesire to get what you want.,In order to fulfill yourself,nyou have to forget yourself.,In order to find yourself, nyou have to lose yourself. 
 We happen to live in a society nthat favors Adam I,,and often neglects Adam II.,And the problem is, that turnsnyou into a shrewd animal,who treats life as a game,,and you become a cold, ncalculating creature,who slips into a sort of mediocrity,where you realize there's a difference,between your desired nself and your actual self.,You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want,,you hope someone will give to you.,You don't have the ndepth of conviction.,You don't have an emotional sonorousness.,You don't have ncommitment to tasks,that would take more than a lifetime to commit. 
 I was reminded of a commonnresponse through history,of how you build a solid Adam II,,how you build a depth of character.,Through history, people nhave gone back,into their own pasts,,sometimes to a precious ntime in their life,,to their childhood,,and often, the mind ngravitates in the past,to a moment of shame,,some sin committed, nsome act of selfishness,,an act of omission, of shallowness,,the sin of anger, the sin of self-pity,,trying to be a people-pleaser, na lack of courage.,Adam I is built by nbuilding on your strengths.,Adam II is built by fighting nyour weaknesses.,You go into yourself, nyou find the sin,which you've committed overnand again through your life,,your signature sin,out of which the others emerge,,and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin,,and out of that wrestling, nthat suffering,,then a depth of character is constructed.,And we're often notntaught to recognize,the sin in ourselves,,in that we're not taught in this culture,how to wrestle with it,,how to confront it, nand how to combat it.,We live in a culture nwith an Adam I mentality,where we're inarticulate nabout Adam II. 
 Finally, Reinhold Niebuhr,summed up the confrontation, the fully lived,Adam I and Adam II life, this way:,"Nothing that is worth doingncan be achieved in our lifetime;,therefore we must nbe saved by hope.,Nothing which is true ornbeautiful or good makes,complete sense in any immediate context of history;,therefore we must be saved by faith.,Nothing we do, however virtuous,ncan be accomplished alone;,therefore we must nbe saved by love.,No virtuous act is quite as virtuous,from the standpoint of our friendnor foe as from our own standpoint.,Therefore we must be saved nby that final form of love,,which is forgiveness.” 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)So, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport,about to get on a flight,,when I was approached by two women,who I do not think would be insulted,to hear themselves described,as tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads. 
 The taller one, who is like up here,,she comes marching up to me, and she goes,,"Honey, I gotta ask you something.,You got something to do with that whole,'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?" 
 And I said, "Yes, I did." 
 And she smacks her friend and she goes,,"See, I told you, I said, that's that girl.,That's that girl who wrote that book,based on that movie.",(Laughter) 
 So that's who I am.,And believe me, I'm extremelyngrateful to be that person,,because that whole "Eat, Pray, Love" thing,was a huge break for me.,But it also left me in a really tricky position,moving forward as an author,trying to figure out how in the world,I was ever going to write a book again,that would ever please anybody,,because I knew well in advance,that all of those people whonhad adored "Eat, Pray, Love",were going to be incredibly disappointed,in whatever I wrote next,because it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love,",and all of those people whonhad hated "Eat, Pray, Love",were going to be incredibly disappointed,in whatever I wrote next,because it would provide evidence that I still lived.,So I knew that I had no way to win,,and knowing that I had no way to win,made me seriously consider for a while,just quitting the game,and moving to the country to raise corgis.,But if I had done that, if I had given up writing,,I would have lost my beloved vocation,,so I knew that the task was that I had to find,some way to gin up the inspiration,to write the next book,regardless of its inevitable negative outcome.,In other words, I had to find a way to make sure,that my creativity survived its own success.,And I did, in the end, find that inspiration,,but I found it in the most unlikely,and unexpected place.,I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life,about how creativity can survive its own failure. 
 So just to back up and explain,,the only thing I have ever wanted to be,for my whole life was a writer.,I wrote all through childhood,nall through adolescence,,by the time I was a teenager I was sending,my very bad stories to The New Yorker,,hoping to be discovered.,After college, I got a job as a diner waitress,,kept working, kept writing,,kept trying really hard to get published,,and failing at it.,I failed at getting published,for almost six years.,So for almost six years, every single day,,I had nothing but rejection letters,waiting for me in my mailbox.,And it was devastating every single time,,and every single time, I had to ask myself,if I should just quit while I was behind,and give up and spare myself this pain.,But then I would find my resolve,,and always in the same way,,by saying, "I'm not going to quit,,I'm going home." 
 And you have to understand that for me,,going home did not meannreturning to my family's farm.,For me, going home,meant returning to the work of writing,because writing was my home,,because I loved writing morenthan I hated failing at writing,,which is to say that I loved writing,more than I loved my own ego,,which is ultimately to say,that I loved writing more than I loved myself.,And that's how I pushed through it. 
 But the weird thing is that 20 years later,,during the crazy ride of "Eat, Pray, Love,",I found myself identifying all over again,with that unpublished young diner waitress,who I used to be, thinking about her constantly,,and feeling like I was her again,,which made no rational sense whatsoever,because our lives could notnhave been more different.,She had failed constantly.,I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.,We had nothing in common.,Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again? 
 And it was only when I was trying to unthread that,that I finally began to comprehend,the strange and unlikely psychological connection,in our lives between the waynwe experience great failure,and the way we experience great success.,So think of it like this:,For most of your life, you live out your existence,here in the middle of the chain of human experience,where everything is normalnand reassuring and regular,,but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here,into the blinding darkness of disappointment.,Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far,way out over here,into the equally blinding glare,of fame and recognition and praise.,And one of these fates,is objectively seen by the world as bad,,and the other one is objectivelynseen by the world as good,,but your subconscious is completely incapable,of discerning the difference between bad and good.,The only thing that it is capable of feeling,is the absolute value of this emotional equation,,the exact distance that you have been flung,from yourself.,And there's a real equal danger in both cases,of getting lost out there,in the hinterlands of the psyche. 
 But in both cases, it turns out that there is,also the same remedy for self-restoration,,and that is that you have got tonfind your way back home again,as swiftly and smoothly as you can,,and if you're wondering what your home is,,here's a hint:,Your home is whatever in this world you love,more than you love yourself.,So that might be creativity, it might be family,,it might be invention, adventure,,faith, service, it might be raising corgis,,I don't know, your home is that thing,to which you can dedicate your energies,with such singular devotion,that the ultimate results become inconsequential. 
 For me, that home has always been writing.,So after the weird, disorienting success,that I went through with "Eat, Pray, Love,",I realized that all I had to do was exactly,the same thing that I used to have to do all the time,when I was an equally disoriented failure.,I had to get my ass back to work,,and that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,,I was able to publish the dreaded follow-up,to "Eat, Pray, Love.",And you know what happened with that book?,It bombed, and I was fine.,Actually, I kind of felt bulletproof,,because I knew that I had broken the spell,and I had found my way back home,to writing for the sheer devotion of it.,And I stayed in my home of writing after that,,and I wrote another book that just came out last year,and that one was really beautifully received,,which is very nice, but not my point.,My point is that I'm writing another one now,,and I'll write another book after that,and another and another and another,and many of them will fail,,and some of them might succeed,,but I will always be safe,from the random hurricanes of outcome,as long as I never forget where I rightfully live. 
 Look, I don't know where you rightfully live,,but I know that there's something in this world,that you love more than you love yourself.,Something worthy, by the way,,so addiction and infatuation don't count,,because we all know that thosenare not safe places to live. Right?,The only trick is that you've got to identify,the best, worthiest thing that you love most,,and then build your house right on top of it,and don't budge from it.,And if you should someday, somehow,get vaulted out of your home,by either great failure or great success,,then your job is to fight yournway back to that home,the only way that it has ever been done,,by putting your head down and performing,with diligence and devotion,and respect and reverence,whatever the task is that love,is calling forth from you next.,You just do that, and keep doing that,again and again and again,,and I can absolutely promise you,nfrom long personal experience,in every direction, I can assure you,that it's all going to be okay.,Thank you.,(Applause)The world makes you something that you're not,,but you know inside what you are,,and that question burns in your heart:,How will you become that?,I may be somewhat unique in this,,but I am not alone,,not alone at all.,So when I became a fashion model,,I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream,that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.,My outside self finally matched my inner truth,,my inner self.,For complicated reasons which I'll get to later,,when I look at this picture,,at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,,you've made it,,you have arrived.,But this past October,,I realized that I'm only just beginning.,All of us are put in boxes by our family,,by our religion,,by our society,,our moment in history,,even our own bodies.,Some people have the courage to break free,,not to accept the limitations imposed by,the color of their skin,or by the beliefs of those that surround them.,Those people are always the threat,to the status quo,,to what is considered acceptable. 
 In my case, for the last nine years,,some of my neighbors,,some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,,did not know about my history.,I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.,Here is mine. 
 I was assigned boy at birth,based on the appearance of my genitalia.,I remember when I was five years old,in the Philippines walking around our house,,I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.,And my mom asked me,,"How come you always wearnthat t-shirt on your head?",I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl.",I knew then how to self-identify. 
 Gender has always been considered a fact,,immutable,,but we now know it's actually more fluid,,complex and mysterious.,Because of my success, I never had the courage,to share my story,,not because I thought what I am is wrong,,but because of how the world treats those of us,who wish to break free.,Every day,,I am so grateful because I am a woman.,I have a mom and dad and family,who accepted me for who I am.,Many are not so fortunate. 
 There's a long tradition in Asian culture,that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.,There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.,There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.,So when I was eight years old,,I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating,these mysteries.,I was in front of the stage,,and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman,right in front of me,,and I remember that moment something hit me:,That is the kind of woman I would like to be.,So when I was 15 years old,,still dressing as a boy,,I met this woman named T.L.,She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.,That night she asked me,,"How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?",She convinced me that if I joined,that she would take care of the registration fee,and the garments,,and that night,,I won best in swimsuit,and best in long gown,and placed second runner up,among 40-plus candidates.,That moment changed my life.,All of a sudden, I was introduced,to the world of beauty pageants.,Not a lot of people could say that your first job,is a pageant queen for transgender women,,but I'll take it. 
 So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined,the most prestigious pageant,to the pageant where it's atnthe back of the truck, literally,,or sometimes it would be anpavement next to a rice field,,and when it rains --,it rains a lot in the Philippines --,the organizers would have to move it,inside someone's house.,I also experienced the goodness of strangers,,especially when we would travel,in remote provinces in the Philippines.,But most importantly, I met,some of my best friends in that community. 
 In 2001,,my mom, who had moved to San Francisco,,called me and told me that myngreen card petition came through,,that I could now move to the United States.,I resisted it.,I told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.,I'm here with my friends,,I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen.",But then two weeks later she called me, she said,,"Did you know that if you move to the United States,you could change your name and gender marker?",That was all I needed to hear.,My mom also told me to put two E's,in the spelling of my name.,She also came with me when I had my surgery,in Thailand at 19 years old.,It's interesting, in some of thenmost rural cities in Thailand,,they perform some of the most prestigious,,safe and sophisticated surgery.,At that time in the United States,,you needed to have surgery,before you could change yournname and gender marker.,So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,,and I remember looking atnmy California driver's license,with the name Geena,and gender marker F.,That was a powerful moment.,For some people,,their I.D. is their license to drive,or even to get a drink,,but for me, that was my license to live,,to feel dignified.,All of a sudden, my fears were minimized.,I felt that I could conquer my dream,and move to New York and be a model. 
 Many are not so fortunate.,I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.,She's from New York, she's a young woman,who was courageously living her truth,,but hatred ended her life.,For most of my community,,this is the reality in which we live.,Our suicide rate is nine times higher,than that of the general population.,Every November 20,,we have a global vigil,for Transgender Day of Remembrance.,I'm here at this stage,because it's a long history of people who fought,and stood up for injustice.,This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.,Today, this very moment,,is my real coming out.,I could no longer live my truth,for and by myself.,I want to do my best to help others,live their truth without shame and terror.,I am here, exposed,,so that one day there will never be a need,for a November 20 vigil. 
 My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.,Will you? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) 
 Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.,I'm wondering what you would say,,especially to parents,,but in a more broad way, to friends,,to family, to anyone who finds themselves,encountering a child or a person,who is struggling with and uncomfortable with,a gender that's being assigned them,,what might you say,to the family members of that person,to help them become good and caring and kind,family members to them? 
 Geena Rocero: Sure. Well,nfirst, really, I'm so blessed.,The support system, with my mom especially,,and my family, that in itself,is just so powerful.,I remember every time I would coach,young trans women, I would mentor them,,and sometimes when they would call me,and tell me that their parents can't accept it,,I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,,"Mom, can you call this woman?",And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so —,But it's just, gender identity,is in the core of our being, right?,I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,,so what I'm trying to do,is to have this conversation that,sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,,and there should be a space,that would allow people to self-identify,,and that's a conversation that we should have,with parents, with colleagues.,The transgender movement,,it's at the very beginning,,to compare to how the gay movement started.,There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.,There should be an understanding.,There should be a space of curiosity,and asking questions,,and I hope all of you guys will be my allies. 
 KS: Thank you. That was so lovely.nGR: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Take a look at this drawing.,Can you tell what it is?,I'm a molecular biologist by training,,and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.,They're usually referred to as a model figure,,a drawing that shows how we think,a cellular or molecular process occurs.,This particular drawing is of a process,called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.,It's a process by which a molecule can get,from the outside of the cell to the inside,by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle,that then gets internalized by the cell.,There's a problem with this drawing, though,,and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.,From lots of experiments,,from lots of different scientists,,we know a lot about what these molecules look like,,how they move around in the cell,,and that this is all taking place,in an incredibly dynamic environment. 
 So in collaboration with a clathrinnexpert Tomas Kirchhausen,,we decided to create a new kind of model figure,that showed all of that.,So we start outside of the cell.,Now we're looking inside.,Clathrin are these three-legged molecules,that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.,Through connections with a membrane,,clathrin is able to deform the membrane,and form this sort of a cup,that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle,,that's now capturing some of the proteins,that were outside of the cell.,Proteins are coming in now thatnbasically pinch off this vesicle,,making it separate from the rest of the membrane,,and now clathrin is basically done with its job,,and so proteins are coming in now —,we've covered them yellow and orange —,that are responsible for takingnapart this clathrin cage.,And so all of these proteinsncan get basically recycled,and used all over again. 
 These processes are too small to be seen directly,,even with the best microscopes,,so animations like this provide a really powerful way,of visualizing a hypothesis. 
 Here's another illustration,,and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think,that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.,And again, this is a vast oversimplification,and doesn't begin to show,what we actually know about these processes. 
 You might be surprised to know,that these simple drawings are the only way,that most biologists visualizentheir molecular hypotheses.,Why?,Because creating movies of processes,as we think they actually occur is really hard.,I spent months in Hollywoodnlearning 3D animation software,,and I spend months on each animation,,and that's just time that mostnresearchers can't afford.,The payoffs can be huge, though.,Molecular animations are unparalleled,in their ability to convey a great deal of information,to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.,And I'm working on a new project now,called "The Science of HIV",where I'll be animating the entire life cycle,of the HIV virus as accurately as possible,and all in molecular detail.,The animation will feature data,from thousands of researchersncollected over decades,,data on what this virus looks like,,how it's able to infect cells in our body,,and how therapeutics arenhelping to combat infection. 
 Over the years, I found that animations,aren't just useful for communicating an idea,,but they're also really useful,for exploring a hypothesis.,Biologists for the most part arenstill using a paper and pencil,to visualize the processes they study,,and with the data we have now,nthat's just not good enough anymore.,The process of creating an animation,can act as a catalyst that allows researchers,to crystalize and refine their own ideas.,One researcher I worked with,who works on the molecular mechanisms,of neurodegenerative diseases,came up with experiments that were related,directly to the animation thatnshe and I worked on together,,and in this way, animation cannfeed back into the research process. 
 I believe that animation can change biology.,It can change the way that wencommunicate with one another,,how we explore our data,and how we teach our students.,But for that change to happen,,we need more researchers creating animations,,and toward that end, I brought together a team,of biologists, animators and programmers,to create a new, free, open-source software —,we call it Molecular Flipbook —,that's created just for biologists,just to create molecular animations.,From our testing, we've foundnthat it only takes 15 minutes,for a biologist who has neverntouched animation software before,to create her first molecular animation,of her own hypothesis.,We're also building an online database,where anyone can view, download and contribute,their own animations.,We're really excited to announce,that the beta version of the molecular animation,software toolkit will be available for download today.,We are really excited to seenwhat biologists will create with it,and what new insights they're able to gain,from finally being able to animate,their own model figures. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The universe is teeming with planets.,I want us, in the next decade,,to build a space telescope that'll be able to image,an Earth about another star,and figure out whether it can harbor life.,My colleagues at the NASAnJet Propulsion Laboratory,at Princeton and I are working on technology,that will be able to do just that in the coming years.,Astronomers now believe that every star,in the galaxy has a planet,,and they speculate that up to one fifth of them,have an Earth-like planet,that might be able to harbor life,,but we haven't seen any of them.,We've only detected them indirectly. 
 This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot.,It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990,,when they turned it around asnit was exiting the solar system,to take a picture of the Earth,from six billion kilometers away.,I want to take that,of an Earth-like planet about another star. 
 Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard?,Well to see, let's imagine we take,the Hubble Space Telescope,and we turn it around and we move it out,to the orbit of Mars.,We'll see something like that,,a slightly blurry picture of the Earth,,because we're a fairly small telescope,out at the orbit of Mars.,Now let's move ten times further away.,Here we are at the orbit of Uranus.,It's gotten smaller, it's got less detail, less resolve.,We can still see the little moon,,but let's go ten times further away again.,Here we are at the edge of the solar system,,out at the Kuiper Belt.,Now it's not resolved at all.,It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's.,But let's move yet again ten times further away.,Here we are out at the Oort Cloud,,outside the solar system,,and we're starting to see the sun,move into the field of view,and get into where the planet is.,One more time, ten times further away.,Now we're at Alpha Centauri,,our nearest neighbor star,,and the planet is gone.,All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star,that's ten billion times brighter than the planet,,which should be in that little red circle.,That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.,The light from the star is diffracting.,It's scattering inside the telescope,,creating that very bright image,that washes out the planet. 
 So to see the planet,,we have to do something about all of that light.,We have to get rid of it.,I have a lot of colleagues working on,really amazing technologies to do that,,but I want to tell you about one today,that I think is the coolest,,and probably the most likely to get us an Earth,in the next decade. 
 It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer,,the father of the space telescope, in 1962,,and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.,You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.,The moon has moved in front of the sun.,It blocks out most of the light,so we can see that dim corona around it.,It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up,and blocked that spotlightnthat's getting right in my eye,,I can see you in the back row.,Well, what's going on?,Well the moon,is casting a shadow down on the Earth.,We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,,we look back at the sun,,and most of the light's been removed,and we can see that dim, fine structure,in the corona.,Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.,We build a big screen, we fly it in space,,we put it up in front of the star,,we block out most of the light,,we fly a space telescope innthat shadow that's created,,and boom, we get to see planets.,Well that would look something like this.,So there's that big screen,,and there's no planets,,because unfortunately it doesn'tnactually work very well,,because the light waves of the light and waves,diffracts around that screen,the same way it did in the telescope.,It's like water bending around a rock in a stream,,and all that light just destroys the shadow.,It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets. 
 But Spitzer actually knew the answer.,If we can feather the edges, soften those edges,so we can control diffraction,,well then we can see a planet,,and in the last 10 years or so we've come up,with optimal solutions for doing that.,It looks something like that.,We call that our flower petal starshade.,If we make the edges of those petals exactly right,,if we control their shape,,we can control diffraction,,and now we have a great shadow.,It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,,and we can see the planets beam out just like that.,That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.,That starshade is about,the size of half a football field,and it has to fly 50,000 kilometersnaway from the telescope,that has to be held right in its shadow,,and then we can see those planets. 
 This sounds formidable,,but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,,came up with a fabulous design for how to do that,and it looks like this.,It starts wrapped around a hub.,It separates from the telescope.,The petals unfurl, they open up,,the telescope turns around.,Then you'll see it flip and fly out,that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.,It's going to move in front of the star,just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.,Boom, we get planets orbiting about it.,(Applause),Thank you. 
 That's not science fiction.,We've been working on thisnfor the last five or six years.,Last summer, we did a really cool test,out in California at Northrop Grumman.,So those are four petals.,This is a sub-scale star shade.,It's about half the size of the one you just saw.,You'll see the petals unfurl.,Those four petals were built by four undergraduates,doing a summer internship at JPL.,Now you're seeing it deploy.,Those petals have to rotate into place.,The base of those petals,has to go to the same place every time,to within a tenth of a millimeter.,We ran this test 16 times,,and 16 times it went into the exact same place,to a tenth of a millimeter.,This has to be done very precisely,,but if we can do this, if we can build this technology,,if we can get it into space,,you might see something like this.,That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars,taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.,If we can take a similar space telescope,,slightly larger,,put it out there,,fly an occulter in front of it,,what we might see is something like that --,that's a family portrait of ournsolar system -- but not ours.,We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system,as seen through an occulter,,through a starshade like that.,You can see Jupiter, you can see Saturn,,Uranus, Neptune, and right there in the center,,next to the residual light,is that pale blue dot. That's Earth.,We want to see that, see if there's water,,oxygen, ozone,,the things that might tell us that it could harbor life. 
 I think this is the coolest possible science.,That's why I got into doing this,,because I think that will change the world.,That will change everything when we see that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So it was the fall of 1902,,and President Theodore Roosevelt,needed a little break from the White House,,so he took a train to Mississippi,to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town,called Smedes.,The first day of the hunt,nthey didn't see a single bear,,so it was a big bummer for everyone,,but the second day, the dogs cornered one,after a really long chase, but by that point,,the president had given up,and gone back to camp for lunch,,so his hunting guide cracked the animal,on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,,and then tied it up to a tree,and started tooting away on his bugle,to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor,of shooting it.,The bear was a female.,It was dazed, injured,,severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,,and when Roosevelt saw this animal,tied up to the tree,,he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.,He felt like that would go against his code,as a sportsman. 
 A few days later, the scene was memorialized,in a political cartoon back in Washington.,It was called "Drawing a Line in Mississippi,",and it showed Roosevelt withnhis gun down and his arm out,,sparing the bear's life,,and the bear was sitting on its hind legs,with these two big, frightened, wide eyes,and little ears pricked up at the top of its head.,It looked really helpless, like you just wanted to,sweep it up into your arms,and reassure it.,It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,,but if you go looking for the cartoon now,,you recognize the animal right away:,It's a teddy bear.,And this is how the teddy bear was born.,Essentially, toymakers tooknthe bear from the cartoon,,turned it into a plush toy, and then named it,after President Roosevelt -- Teddy's bear. 
 And I do feel a little ridiculous,that I'm up here on this stage,and I'm choosing to use my time,to tell you about a 100-year-old story,about the invention of a squishy kid's toy,,but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,,inside that story is a more important story,,a story about how dramatically our ideas,about nature can change,,and also about how, on the planet right now,,the stories that we tell,are dramatically changing nature. 
 Because think about the teddy bear.,For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,,because bears are so cute and cuddly,,and who wouldn't want to givenone to their kids to play with,,but the truth is that in 1902,,bears weren't cute and cuddly.,I mean, they looked the same,,but no one thought of them that way.,In 1902, bears were monsters.,Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids.,For generations at that point,,the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger,that people were encountering on the frontier,,and the federal government was actually,systematically exterminating bears,and lots of other predators too,,like coyotes and wolves.,These animals, they were being demonized.,They were called murderers,because they killed people's livestock.,One government biologist, he explained this,war on animals like the bear by saying,that they no longer had a place,in our advancing civilization,,and so we were just clearing them out of the way.,In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves,had been slaughtered.,The grizzly would soon be wiped out,from 95 percent of its original territory,,and whereas once there had been 30 million bison,moving across the plains, and you would have,these stories of trains having to stop,for four or five hours so that these thick,,living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,,now, by 1902, there were maybe nless than 100 left in the wild.,And so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born,into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,,and you can see it as a sign that,maybe some people deep down,were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.,America still hated the bear and feared it,,but all of a sudden, America also wanted,to give the bear a great big hug. 
 So this is something that I've been reallyncurious about in the last few years.,How do we imagine animals,,how do we think and feel about them,,and how do their reputations get written,and then rewritten in our minds?,We're here living in the eye of a great storm,of extinction where half the species on the planet,could be gone by the end of the century,,and so why is it that we come to care about,some of those species and not others?,Well, there's a new field, a relatively new field,of social science that started looking at,these questions and trying to unpack the powerful,and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships,that we have to animals,,and I spent a lot of time looking through,their academic journals,,and all I can really say is that their findings,are astonishingly wide-ranging.,So some of my favorites include that,the more television a personnwatches in Upstate New York,,the more he or she is afraid,of being attacked by a black bear.,If you show a tiger to an American,,they're much more likely to assume that it's female,and not male.,In a study where a fake snake,and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,,drivers hit the snake muchnmore often than the turtle,,and about three percent ofndrivers who hit the fake animals,seemed to do it on purpose.,Women are more likely than men to get a,"magical feeling" when they see dolphins in the surf.,Sixty-eight percent of mothers with,"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem",identified with the dancing cats,in a commercial for Purina. (Laughter),Americans consider lobsters,more important than pigeons,but also much, much stupider.,Wild turkeys are seen as only slightlynmore dangerous than sea otters,,and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs. 
 So some of this is physical, right?,We tend to sympathize morenwith animals that look like us,,and especially that resemble human babies,,so with big, forward-facing eyes,and circular faces,,kind of a roly-poly posture.,This is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,,your great aunt in Minnesota,,there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,,and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.,But it's not all physical, right?,There's a cultural dimension tonhow we think about animals,,and we're telling stories about these animals,,and like all stories,,they are shaped by the times and the places,in which we're telling them.,So think about that moment,back in 1902 again where a ferocious bear,became a teddy bear.,What was the context?nWell, America was urbanizing.,For the first time, nearly anmajority of people lived in cities,,so there was a growing distancenbetween us and nature.,There was a safe space where we could,reconsider the bear and romanticize it.,Nature could only start tonseem this pure and adorable,because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.,And you can see that cycle playing out,again and again with all kinds of animals.,It seems like we're always stuck between,demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,,and then when we get very close to doing that,,empathizing with it as an underdog,and wanting to show it compassion.,So we exert our power,,but then we're unsettled,by how powerful we are. 
 So for example, this is one of,probably thousands of letters and drawings,that kids sent to the Bush administration,,begging it to protect the polar bear,under the Endangered Species Act,,and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,,when awareness of climatenchange was suddenly surging.,We kept seeing that image of a polar bear,stranded on a little ice floe,looking really morose.,I spent days looking through these files.,I really love them. This one's my favorite.,If you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning,and then it's also being eaten simultaneously,by a lobster and a shark.,This one came from a kid named Fritz,,and he's actually got a solution to climate change.,He's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.,He says, "I feel bad about the polar bears.,I like polar bears.,Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz.",So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers,writing about polar bears leaping into their boats,and trying to devour them,,even if they lit the bear on fire,,but these kids don't see the polar bear that way,,and actually they don't even see the polar bear,the way that I did back in the '80s.,I mean, we thought of these animals,as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.,But look now how quickly that climate change,has flipped the image of the animal in our minds.,It's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer,to this delicate, drowning victim,,and when you think about it, that's kind of,the conclusion to the story,that the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,,because back then, America had more or less,conquered its share of the continent.,We were just getting around to,polishing off these last wild predators.,Now, society's reach has expanded,all the way to the top of the world,,and it's made even these, the most remote,,the most powerful bears on the planet,,seem like adorable and blameless victims. 
 But you know, there's also anpostscript to the teddy bear story,that not a lot of people talk about.,We're going to talk about it,,because even though it didn't really take long,after Roosevelt's hunt in 1902,for the toy to become a full-blown craze,,most people figured it was a fad,,it was a sort of silly political novelty item,and it would go away once the president left office,,and so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,,William Howard Taft,,was getting ready to be inaugurated,,the toy industry was on the hunt,for the next big thing.,They didn't do too well. 
 That January, Taft was the guest of honor,at a banquet in Atlanta,,and for days in advance,,the big news was the menu.,They were going to be serving him,a Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,,called possum and taters.,So you would have a whole opossum,roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,,and then sometimes they'd leave,the big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.,The one brought to Taft's table,weighed 18 pounds.,So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,,and the guests burst into song,,and all of a sudden, Taft was surprised,with the presentation of a gift,from a group of local supporters,,and this was a stuffed opossum toy,,all beady-eyed and bald-eared,,and it was a new product they were putting forward,to be the William Taft presidency's answer,to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear.,They were calling it the "billy possum.",Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company,was up and running, brokering deals,for these things nationwide,,and the Los Angeles Times announced,,very confidently, "The teddy bear,has been relegated to a seat in the rear,,and for four years, possibly eight,,the children of the United States,will play with billy possum.",So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.,There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,,billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.,There were smaller billy possums on a stick,that kids could wave around like flags.,But even with all this marketing,,the life of the billy possum,turned out to be just pathetically brief.,The toy was an absolute flop,,and it was almost completely forgotten,by the end of the year,,and what that means is that the billy possum,didn't even make it to Christmastime,,which when you think about it is,a special sort of tragedy for a toy. 
 So we can explain that failure two ways.,The first, well, it's pretty obvious.,I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:,Opossums are hideous. (Laughter),But maybe more importantly is that,the story of the billy possum was all wrong,,especially compared,to the backstory of the teddy bear.,Think about it: for most ofnhuman's evolutionary history,,what's made bears impressive to us,has been their complete independence from us.,It's that they live these parallel lives,as menaces and competitors.,By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,,that stature was being crushed,,and the animal that he had roped to a tree,really was a symbol for all bears.,Whether those animals lived or died now,was entirely up to the compassion,or the indifference of people.,That said something really ominous,about the future of bears,,but it also said something very nunsettling about who we'd become,,if the survival of even an animal like that,was up to us now.,So now, a century later, if you're at all,paying attention to what'snhappening in the environment,,you feel that discomfort so much more intensely.,We're living now in an age of what scientists,have started to call "conservation reliance,",and what that term means is that we've disrupted,so much that nature can't possiblynstand on its own anymore,,and most endangered species,are only going to survive,if we stay out there in the landscape,riggging the world around them in their favor.,So we've gone hands-on,and we can't ever take our hands off,,and that's a hell of a lot of work.,Right now, we're training condors,not to perch on power lines.,We teach whooping cranesnto migrate south for the winter,behind little ultra-light airplanes.,We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.,We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.,So we've gone from annihilating species,to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species,indefinitely, and which ones?,Well, the ones that we've told,compelling stories about,,the ones we've decided ought to stick around.,The line between conservation and domestication,is blurred. 
 So what I've been saying is that the stories,that we tell about wild animals are so subjective,they can be irrational,or romanticized or sensationalized.,Sometimes they just havennothing to do with the facts.,But in a world of conservation reliance,,those stories have very real consequences,,because now, how we feel about an animal,affects its survival,more than anything that you read about,in ecology textbooks.,Storytelling matters now.,Emotion matters.,Our imagination has become an ecological force.,And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part,because the legend of Roosevelt,and that bear in Mississippi,was kind of like an allegory,of this great responsibility that society,was just beginning to face up to back then.,It would be another 71 years,before the Endangered Species Act was passed,,but really, here's its whole ethos,boiled down into something like a scene,you'd see in a stained glass window.,The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,,and the president of the United States,decided to show it some mercy.,Thank you.,(Applause),[Illustrations by Wendy MacNaughton]What is the intersectionnbetween technology, art and science?,Curiosity and wonder,,because it drives us to explore,,because we're surroundednby things we can't see.,And I love to use filmnto take us on a journey,through portals of time and space,,to make the invisible visible,,because what that does,,it expands our horizons,,it transforms our perception,,it opens our minds,and it touches our heart.,So here are some scenesnfrom my 3D IMAX film,,"Mysteries of the Unseen World." 
 (Music) 
 There is movement which is too slownfor our eyes to detect,,and time lapse makes us discover,and broaden our perspective of life.,We can see how organisms emerge and grow,,how a vine survives by creepingnfrom the forest floor,to look at the sunlight.,And at the grand scale,,time lapse allows us to seenour planet in motion.,We can view not onlynthe vast sweep of nature,,but the restless movement of humanity.,Each streaking dotnrepresents a passenger plane,,and by turning air traffic dataninto time-lapse imagery,,we can see somethingnthat's above us constantly,but invisible:,the vast network of air travelnover the United States.,We can do the same thingnwith ships at sea.,We can turn data into a time-lapse viewnof a global economy in motion.,And decades of data give usnthe view of our entire planet,as a single organism,sustained by currents circulatingnthroughout the oceans,and by clouds swirlingnthrough the atmosphere,,pulsing with lightning,,crowned by the aurora Borealis.,It may be the ultimate time-lapse image:,the anatomy of Earth brought to life. 
 At the other extreme,,there are things that moventoo fast for our eyes,,but we have technologynthat can look into that world as well.,With high-speed cameras,,we can do the opposite of time lapse.,We can shoot images,that are thousands of timesnfaster than our vision.,And we can see how nature'sningenious devices work,,and perhaps we can even imitate them.,When a dragonfly flutters by,,you may not realize,,but it's the greatest flier in nature.,It can hover, fly backwards,,even upside down.,And by tracking markersnon an insect's wings,,we can visualize the air flownthat they produce.,Nobody knew the secret,,but high speed shows that a dragonfly,can move all four wingsnin different directions,at the same time.,And what we learn can lead usnto new kinds of robotic flyers,that can expand our vision,of important and remote places. 
 We're giants,,and we're unaware of thingsnthat are too small for us to see.,The electron microscopenfires electrons which creates images,which can magnify thingsnby as much as a million times.,This is the egg of a butterfly.,And there are unseen creaturesnliving all over your body,,including mitesnthat spend their entire lives,dwelling on your eyelashes,,crawling over your skin at night.,Can you guess what this is?,Shark skin.,A caterpillar's mouth.,The eye of a fruit fly.,An eggshell.,A flea.,A snail's tongue.,We think we knownmost of the animal kingdom,,but there may be millions of tiny species,waiting to be discovered. 
 A spider also has great secrets,,because spiders' silk threadnis pound for pound stronger than steel,but completely elastic.,This journey will take usnall the way down to the nano world.,The silk is 100 times thinnernthan human hair.,On there is bacteria,,and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller,,a virus.,Inside of that, 10 times smaller,,three strands of DNA.,And nearing the limitnof our most powerful microscopes,,single carbon atoms. 
 With the tip of a powerful microscope,,we can actually move atoms,and begin to create amazing nano devices.,Some could one day patrol our bodynfor all kinds of diseases,and clean out clogged arteriesnalong the way.,Tiny chemical machines of the future,can one day, perhaps, repair DNA.,We are on the thresholdnof extraordinary advances,,born of our drivento unveil the mysteries of life. 
 So under an endless rain of cosmic dust,,the air is full of pollen,,micro-diamonds and jewels,from other planetsnand supernova explosions.,People go about their livesnsurrounded by the unseeable.,Knowing that there's so muchnaround us we can't see,forever changesnour understanding of the world,,and by looking at unseen worlds,,we recognize that we existnin the living universe,,and this new perspective creates wonder,and inspires us to become explorers,in our own backyards. 
 Who knows what awaits to be seen,and what new wondersnwill transform our lives. 
 We'll just have to see. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What do you think of when I say the word "design"?,You probably think of things like this,,finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,,or maybe logos and posters and maps,that visually explain things,,classic icons of timeless design.,But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.,I want to talk about the kind,that you probably use every day,and may not give much thought to,,designs that change all the time,and that live inside your pocket.,I'm talking about the design,of digital experiences,and specifically the design of systems,that are so big that their scale,can be hard to comprehend.,Consider the fact that Google processes,over one billion search queries every day,,that every minute, over 100 hours,of footage are uploaded to YouTube.,That's more in a single day,than all three major U.S. networks broadcast,in the last five years combined.,And Facebook transmitting the photos,,messages and stories,of over 1.23 billion people.,That's almost half of the Internet population,,and a sixth of humanity. 
 These are some of the products,that I've helped design over the course of my career,,and their scale is so massive,that they've produced unprecedented,design challenges.,But what is really hard,about designing at scale is this:,It's hard in part because,it requires a combination of two things,,audacity and humility —,audacity to believe that the thing that you're making,is something that the entire world wants and needs,,and humility to understand that as a designer,,it's not about you or your portfolio,,it's about the people that you're designing for,,and how your work just might help them,live better lives.,Now, unfortunately, there's no school,that offers the course Designing for Humanity 101.,I and the other designers,who work on these kinds of products,have had to invent it as we go along,,and we are teaching ourselves,the emerging best practices,of designing at scale,,and today I'd like share some of the things,that we've learned over the years. 
 Now, the first thing that you need to know,about designing at scale,is that the little things really matter.,Here's a really good example of how,a very tiny design element can make a big impact.,The team at Facebook that manages,the Facebook "Like" button,decided that it needed to be redesigned.,The button had kind of gotten out of sync,with the evolution of our brand,and it needed to be modernized.,Now you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,,it probably is a pretty straightforward,,easy design assignment, but it wasn't.,Turns out, there were all kinds of constraints,for the design of this button.,You had to work within specificnheight and width parameters.,You had to be careful to make it work,in a bunch of different languages,,and be careful about usingnfancy gradients or borders,because it has to degrade gracefully,in old web browsers.,The truth is, designing this tiny little button,was a huge pain in the butt. 
 Now, this is the new version of the button,,and the designer who led this project estimates,that he spent over 280 hours,redesigning this button over the course of months.,Now, why would we spend so much time,on something so small?,It's because when you're designing at scale,,there's no such thing as a small detail.,This innocent little button,is seen on average 22 billion times a day,and on over 7.5 million websites.,It's one of the single most viewedndesign elements ever created.,Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button,and the designer behind it,,but with these kinds of products,,you need to get even the tiny things right. 
 Now, the next thing that you need to understand,is how to design with data.,Now, when you're working on products like this,,you have incredible amounts of information,about how people are using your product,that you can then use to influence,your design decisions,,but it's not just as simple as following the numbers.,Let me give you an example,so that you can understand what I mean.,Facebook has had a tool for a long time,that allowed people to report photos,that may be in violation of our community standards,,things like spam and abuse.,And there were a ton of photos reported,,but as it turns out,,only a small percentage were actually,in violation of those community standards.,Most of them were just your typical party photo.,Now, to give you a specific hypothetical example,,let's say my friend Laura hypothetically,uploads a picture of me,from a drunken night of karaoke.,This is purely hypothetical, I can assure you.,(Laughter),Now, incidentally,,you know how some people are kind of worried,that their boss or employee,is going to discover embarrassing photos of them,on Facebook?,Do you know how hard that is to avoid,when you actually work at Facebook?,So anyway, there are lots of these photos,being erroneously reported as spam and abuse,,and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch.,He really thought there was something else going on,and he was right,,because when he lookednthrough a bunch of the cases,,he found that most of them,were from people who were requesting,the takedown of a photo of themselves.,Now this was a scenario that the team,never even took into account before.,So they added a new feature,that allowed people to message their friend,to ask them to take the photo down.,But it didn't work.,Only 20 percent of people,sent the message to their friend.,So the team went back at it.,They consulted with experts in conflict resolution.,They even studied the universal principles,of polite language,,which I didn't even actually know existed,until this research happened.,And they found something really interesting.,They had to go beyond just helping people,ask their friend to take the photo down.,They had to help people express to their friend,how the photo made them feel. 
 Here's how the experience works today.,So I find this hypothetical photo of myself,,and it's not spam, it's not abuse,,but I really wish it weren't on the site.,So I report it and I say,,"I'm in this photo and I don't like it,",and then we dig deeper.,Why don't you like this photo of yourself?,And I select "It's embarrassing.",And then I'm encouraged to message my friend,,but here's the critical difference.,I'm provided specific suggested language,that helps me communicate to Laura,how the photo makes me feel.,Now the team found that this relatively small change,had a huge impact.,Before, only 20 percent of people,were sending the message,,and now 60 percent were,,and surveys showed that people,on both sides of the conversation,felt better as a result.,That same survey showed,that 90 percent of your friends,want to know if they've done something to upset you.,Now I don't know who the other 10 percent are,,but maybe that's where our "Unfriend" feature,can come in handy. 
 So as you can see,,these decisions are highly nuanced.,Of course we use a lot of data,to inform our decisions,,but we also rely very heavily on iteration,,research, testing, intuition, human empathy.,It's both art and science.,Now, sometimes the designersnwho work on these products,are called "data-driven,",which is a term that totally drives us bonkers.,The fact is, it would be irresponsible of us,not to rigorously test our designs,when so many people are counting on us,to get it right,,but data analytics,will never be a substitute for design intuition.,Data can help you make a good design great,,but it will never made a bad design good. 
 The next thing that you neednto understand as a principle,is that when you introduce change,,you need to do it extraordinarily carefully.,Now I often have joked that,I spend almost as much time,designing the introduction of change,as I do the change itself,,and I'm sure that we can all relate to that,when something that we use a lot changes,and then we have to adjust.,The fact is, people can become,very efficient at using bad design,,and so even if the change isngood for them in the long run,,it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens,,and this is particularly true,with user-generated content platforms,,because people can rightfullynclaim a sense of ownership.,It is, after all, their content. 
 Now, years ago, when I was working at YouTube,,we were looking for ways to,encourage more people to rate videos,,and it was interesting becausenwhen we looked into the data,,we found that almost everyone was exclusively using,the highest five-star rating,,a handful of people were using,the lowest one-star,,and virtually no one,was using two, three or four stars.,So we decided to simplify,into an up-down kind of voting binary model.,It's going to be much easiernfor people to engage with.,But people were very attached,to the five-star rating system.,Video creators really loved their ratings.,Millions and millions of people,were accustomed to the old design.,So in order to help people,prepare themselves for change,and acclimate to the new design more quickly,,we actually published the data graph,sharing with the community,the rationale for what we were going to do,,and it even engaged the larger industry,in a conversation, which resulted in,my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time:,"YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization:,Its Ratings Are Useless." 
 Now, it's impossible to completely avoid,change aversion when you're making changes,to products that so many people use.,Even though we tried to do all the right things,,we still received our customary flood,of video protests and angry emails,and even a package that hadnto be scanned by security,,but we have to remember,people care intensely about this stuff,,and it's because these products, this work,,really, really matters to them. 
 Now, we know that we have to be careful,about paying attention to the details,,we have to be cognizant about how we use data,in our design process,,and we have to introduce change,very, very carefully.,Now, these things are all really useful.,They're good best practices for designing at scale.,But they don't mean anything,if you don't understand something,much more fundamental.,You have to understand who you are designing for. 
 Now, when you set a goal to design,for the entire human race,,and you start to engage in that goal in earnest,,at some point you run into the walls,of the bubble that you're living in.,Now, in San Francisco, we get a little miffed,when we hit a dead cell zone,because we can't use our phones to navigate,to the new hipster coffee shop.,But what if you had to drive four hours,to charge your phone,because you had no reliable source of electricity?,What if you had no access to public libraries?,What if your country had no free press?,What would these products start to mean to you?,This is what Google, YouTube and Facebook,look like to most of the world,,and it's what they'll look like,to most of the next five billion people,to come online.,Designing for low-end cell phones,is not glamorous design work,,but if you want to design for the whole world,,you have to design for where people are,,and not where you are. 
 So how do we keep this big, big picture in mind?,We try to travel outside of our bubble to see, hear,and understand the people we're designing for.,We use our products in non-English languages,to make sure that they work just as well.,And we try to use one of thesenphones from time to time,to keep in touch with their reality. 
 So what does it mean to design at a global scale?,It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work,to try to improve and evolve products.,Finding the audacity and thenhumility to do right by them,can be pretty exhausting,,and the humility part,,it's a little tough on the design ego.,Because these products are always changing,,everything that I've designed in my career,is pretty much gone,,and everything that I will design will fade away.,But here's what remains:,the never-ending thrill,of being a part of something that is so big,,you can hardly get your head around it,,and the promise that it just might change the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When, in 1960, still a student,,I got a traveling fellowship,to study housing in North America.,We traveled the country.,We saw public housing high-rise buildings,in all major cities:,New York, Philadelphia.,Those who have no choice lived there.,And then we traveled from suburb to suburb,,and I came back thinking,,we've got to reinvent the apartment building.,There has to be another way of doing this.,We can't sustain suburbs,,so let's design a building,which gives the qualities of a house,to each unit. 
 Habitat would be all about gardens,,contact with nature,,streets instead of corridors.,We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy,,and there it is almost 50 years later.,It's a very desirable place to live in.,It's now a heritage building,,but it did not proliferate. 
 In 1973, I made my first trip to China.,It was the Cultural Revolution.,We traveled the country,,met with architects and planners.,This is Beijing then,,not a single high rise building,in Beijing or Shanghai.,Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city.,There were hardly any cars.,Thirty years later,,this is Beijing today.,This is Hong Kong.,If you're wealthy, you live there,,if you're poor, you live there,,but high density it is, and it's not just Asia.,São Paulo, you can travel,in a helicopter 45 minutes,seeing those high-rise buildings consume,the 19th-century low-rise environment.,And with it, comes congestion,,and we lose mobility, and so on and so forth. 
 So a few years ago, we decided to go back,and rethink Habitat.,Could we make it more affordable?,Could we actually achieve this quality of life,in the densities that are prevailing today?,And we realized, it's basically about light,,it's about sun, it's about nature,,it's about fractalization.,Can we open up the surface of the building,so that it has more contact with the exterior? 
 We came up with a number of models:,economy models, cheaper to build and more compact;,membranes of housing,where people could design their own house,and create their own gardens.,And then we decided to take New York as a test case,,and we looked at Lower Manhattan.,And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.,On the left is Manhattan today:,blue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.,On the right, we reconfigured it:,the office buildings form the base,,and then rising 75 stories above,,are apartments.,There's a street in the air on the 25th level,,a community street.,It's permeable.,There are gardens and open spaces,for the community,,almost every unit with its own private garden,,and community space all around.,And most important, permeable, open.,It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city,,and light permeates everywhere. 
 And in the last two or three years,,we've actually been, for the first time,,realizing the quality of life of Habitat,in real-life projects across Asia.,This in Qinhuangdao in China:,middle-income housing, where there is a bylaw,that every apartment must receive,three hours of sunlight.,That's measured in the winter solstice.,And under construction in Singapore,,again middle-income housing, gardens,,community streets and parks and so on and so forth.,And Colombo. 
 And I want to touch on one more issue,,which is the design of the public realm.,A hundred years after we've begun building,with tall buildings,,we are yet to understand,how the tall high-rise building,becomes a building block in making a city,,in creating the public realm.,In Singapore, we had an opportunity:,10 million square feet, extremely high density.,Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor,,promenades and parks integrated,with intense urban life.,So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces,,and you move from one to the other,,and there is contact with nature,,and most relevantly, at every level of the structure,,public gardens and open space:,on the roof of the podium,,climbing up the towers,,and finally on the roof, the sky park,,two and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants,,and the world's longest swimming pool.,And that's all I can tell you in five minutes. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Video) Nicholas Negroponte: nCan we switch to the video disc,,which is in play mode? 
 I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.,We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents,for electronic books of the future.,(Music, crosstalk),Very interested in touch-sensitive displays,,high-tech, high-touch, not havingnto pick up your fingers to use them.,There is another way where computers,touch people: wearing, physically wearing.,Suddenly on September 11th,,the world got bigger. 
 NN: Thank you. (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 When I was asked to do this,,I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks,that I had given,,chronologically.,The first one was actually two hours.,The second one was an hour,,and then they became half hours,,and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.,(Laughter),Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,,and it was, to say the least,,for me, quite a shocking experience.,So what I'm going to do in my time,is try and share with you what happened,during the 30 years,,and then also make a prediction,,and then tell you a little bit,about what I'm doing next.,And I put on a slide,where TED 1 happened in my life.,And it's rather important,because I had done 15 years of research before it,,so I had a backlog, so it was easy.,It's not that I was Fidel Castro,and I could talk for two hours,,or Bucky Fuller.,I had 15 years of stuff,,and the Media Lab was about to start.,So that was easy. 
 But there are a couple of things,about that period,and about what happened that are,really quite important.,One is that,it was a period when computers,weren't yet for people.,And the other thing that sort of happened,during that time is that,we were considered sissy computer scientists.,We weren't considered the real thing.,So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,,a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted,than it was at the time. 
 So I'm going to characterize the years,and I'm even going to go back,to some very early work of mine,,and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:,very direct manipulation,,very influenced as I studied architecture,by the architect Moshe Safdie,,and you can see that we even built robotic things,that could build habitat-like structures.,And this for me was,not yet the Media Lab,,but was the beginning of what I'll call,sensory computing,,and I pick fingers,partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.,Papers were published,about how stupid it was to use fingers.,Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.,The other is your hand would occlude,what you wanted to see,,and the third, which was the winner,,was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,,and hence, fingers would never be,a device that you'd use.,And this was a device we built in the '70s,,which has never even been picked up.,It's not just touch sensitive,,it's pressure sensitive. 
 (Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there. 
 NN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 — 
 (Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.,Create a large green circle there.,Man: Aw, shit. 
 NN: — was to sort of do interface concurrently,,so when you talked and you pointed,and you had, if you will,,multiple channels. 
 Entebbe happened.,1976, Air France was hijacked,,taken to Entebbe,,and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,,they did it partly because they had practiced,on a physical model of the airport,,because they had built the airport,,so they built a model in the desert,,and when they arrived at Entebbe,,they knew where to go becausenthey had actually been there.,The U.S. government asked some of us, '76,,if we could replicate that computationally,,and of course somebody like myself says yes.,Immediately, you get a contract,,Department of Defense,,and we built this truck and this rig.,We did sort of a simulation,,because you had video discs,,and again, this is '76.,And then many years later,,you get this truck,,and so you have Google Maps. 
 Still people thought,,no, that was not serious computer science,,and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,,who happened to be the president of MIT,,who did think it was computer science.,And one of the keys for anybody,who wants to start something in life:,Make sure your president is part of it.,So when I was doing the Media Lab,,it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.,If you were stopped for speeding,and the officer looked in the window,and saw who was in the passenger seat,,then, "Oh, continue on, sir.",And so we were able,,and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.,This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner,where the only thing that changed in the photograph,were the lips.,So when you oscillated that little piece,of lenticular sheet with his photograph,,it would be in lip sync,with zero bandwidth.,It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system,at the time. 
 So this was the Media Lab's —,this is what we said we'd do,,that the world of computers, publishing,,and so on would come together.,Again, not generally accepted,,but very much part of TED in the early days.,And this is really where we were headed.,And that created the Media Lab.,One of the things about age,is that I can tell you with great confidence,,I've been to the future.,I've been there, actually, many times.,And the reason I say that is,,how many times in my life have I said,,"Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,",and then 10 years comes.,And then you say, "Oh, innfive years, this will happen.",And then five years comes.,So I say this a little bit with having felt,that I'd been there a number of times,,and one of the things that is most quoted,that I've ever said,is that computing is not about computers,,and that didn't quite get enough traction,,and then it started to.,It started to because people caught on,that the medium wasn't the message.,And the reason I show this car,in actually a rather ugly slide,is just again to tell you the kind of story,that characterized a little bit of my life.,This is a student of mine,who had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver.",It was in the early days of GPS,,the car knew where it was,,and it would give audio instructions,to the driver, when to turn right, nwhen to turn left and so on.,Turns out, there are a lot of things,in those instructions that back in that period,were pretty challenging,,like what does it mean, take the next right?,Well, if you're coming up on a street,,the next right's probably the one after,,and there are lots of issues,,and the student did a wonderful thesis,,and the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.,It'll never be accepted.,The liabilities are too large.,There will be insurance issues.,Don't patent it.",So we didn't,,but it shows you how people, again, at times,,don't really look at what's happening. 
 Some work, and I'll just gonthrough these very quickly,,a lot of sensory stuff.,You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma,and tracking his body for playing,the cello or the hypercello.,These fellows literally walked naround like that at the time.,It's now a little bit more discreet,and more commonplace. 
 And then there are at least three heroes,I want to quickly mention.,Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot,about common sense,,and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,,who was very important to Ricky Wurman,and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,,she said, the first thing she said was,,"I introduced Ricky to Nicky.",And nobody calls me Nicky,and nobody calls Richard Ricky,,so nobody knew who she was talking about.,And then, of course, Seymour Papert,,who is the person who said,,"You can't think about thinking,unless you think about thinking about something.",And that's actually — you can unpack that later.,It's a pretty profound statement. 
 I'm showing some slides,that were from TED 2,,a little silly as slides, perhaps.,Then I felt television really was about displays.,Again, now we're past TED 1,,but just around the time of TED 2,,and what I'd like to mention here is,,even though you could imagine,intelligence in the device,,I look today at some of the work,being done about the Internet of Things,,and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,,because what has happened is people take,the oven panel and put it on your cell phone,,or the door key onto your cell phone,,just taking it and bringing it to you,,and in fact that's actually what you don't want.,You want to put a chicken in the oven,,and the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken,",and it cooks the chicken.,"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,,and he likes it this way and that way.",So the intelligence, instead of being in the device,,we have started today,to move it back onto the cell phone,or closer to the user,,not a particularly enlightened view,of the Internet of Things.,Television, again, television what I said today,,that was back in 1990,,and the television of tomorrow,would look something like that.,Again, people, but they laughed cynically,,they didn't laugh with much appreciation. 
 Telecommunications in the 1990s,,George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram,the Negroponte switch.,I'm probably much less famous than George,,so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,,but the idea of things that came in the ground,would go in the air and stuff in the air,would go into the ground,has played itself out.,That is the original slide from that year,,and it has worked in lockstep obedience. 
 We started Wired magazine.,Some people, I remember we shared,the reception desk periodically,,and some parent called up irate that his son,had given up Sports Illustrated,to subscribe for Wired,,and he said, "Are you somenporno magazine or something?",and couldn't understand why his son,would be interested in Wired, at any rate. 
 I will go through this a little quicker.,This is my favorite, 1995,,back page of Newsweek magazine.,Okay. Read it. (Laughter) 
 ["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure."n—Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995] 
 You must admit that gives you,,at least it gives me pleasure,when somebody says how dead wrong you are. 
 "Being Digital" came out.,For me, it gave me an opportunity,to be more in the trade press,and get this out to the public,,and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,,which if you haven't been to, visit,,because it's a beautiful piece of architecture,aside from being a wonderful place to work.,So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs. 
 [Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995] 
 We came to them.,I looked forward to it every year.,It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had,in the sense that he invited many of his old friends,,including myself. 
 And then something for me changed,pretty profoundly.,I became more involved with computers and learning,and influenced by Seymour,,but particularly looking at learning,as something that is best approximated,by computer programming.,When you write a computer program,,you've got to not just list things out,and sort of take an algorithm,and translate it into a set of instructions,,but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,,you've got to de-bug it.,You've got to go in, change it,,and then re-execute,,and you iterate,,and that iteration is really,a very, very good approximation of learning. 
 So that led to my own work with Seymour,in places like Cambodia,and the starting of One Laptop per Child.,Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,,so I'll go through it very fast,,but it did give us the chance,to do something at a relatively large scale,in the area of learning, development and computing.,Very few people know that One Laptop per Child,was a $1 billion project,,and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,,but even more important, the World Bank,contributed zero, USAID zero.,It was mostly the countriesnusing their own treasuries,,which is very interesting,,at least to me it was very interesting,in terms of what I plan to do next.,So these are the various places it happened. 
 I then tried an experiment,,and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.,And here's the experiment.,The experiment is,,can learning happen where there are no schools.,And we dropped off tablets,with no instructions,and let the children figure it out.,And in a short period of time,,they not only,turned them on and were using 50 apps per child,within five days,,they were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks,,but they hacked Android within six months.,And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.,This is perhaps the best picture I have.,The kid on your right,has sort of nominated himself as teacher.,Look at the kid on the left, and so on.,There are no adults involved in this at all.,So I said, well can we do this,at a larger scale?,And what is it that's missing?,The kids are giving a press conference at this point,,and sort of writing in the dirt.,And the answer is, what is missing?,And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,,because I'm running out of time,,and here's the question, is what's going to happen? 
 I think the challenge,is to connect the last billion people,,and connecting the last billion,is very different than connecting the next billion,,and the reason it's different,is that the next billion,are sort of low-hanging fruit,,but the last billion are rural.,Being rural and being poor,are very different.,Poverty tends to be created by our society,,and the people in that community are not poor,in the same way at all.,They may be primitive,,but the way to approach it and to connect them,,the history of One Laptop per Child,,and the experiment in Ethiopia,,lead me to believe that we can in fact,do this in a very short period of time. 
 And so my plan,,and unfortunately I haven't been able,to get my partners at this point,to let me announce them,,but is to do this with a stationary satellite.,There are many reasons,that stationary satellites aren't the best things,,but there are a lot of reasons why they are,,and for two billion dollars,,you can connect a lot more than 100 million people,,but the reason I picked two,,and I will leave this as my last slide,,is two billion dollars,is what we were spending,in Afghanistan,every week.,So surely if we can connect,Africa and the last billion people,for numbers like that,,we should be doing it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there. 
 NN: You're going to give me extra time? 
 CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.,You gamed it beautifully.,Nicholas, what is your prediction?,(Laughter) 
 NN: Thank you for asking.,I'll tell you what my prediction is,,and my prediction, and this is a prediction,,because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.,But one of the things about learning how to read,,we have been doing a lot of consuming,of information going through our eyes,,and so that may be a very inefficient channel.,So my prediction is that we are ngoing to ingest information,You're going to swallow a pill and know English.,You're going to swallow anpill and know Shakespeare.,And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.,So once it's in your bloodstream,,it basically goes through it and gets into the brain,,and when it knows that it's in the brain,in the different pieces,,it deposits it in the right places.,So it's ingesting. 
 CA: Have you been hanging outnwith Ray Kurzweil by any chance? 
 NN: No, but I've been hangingnaround with Ed Boyden,and hanging around with one of the speakers,who is here, Hugh Herr,,and there are a number of people.,This isn't quite as far-fetched,,so 30 years from now. 
 CA: We will check it out.,We're going to be back and we're goingnto play this clip 30 years from now,,and then all eat the red pill. 
 Well thank you for that. 
 Nicholas Negroponte. 
 NN: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Six months ago, I got an email,from a man in Israel,who had read one of my books,,and the email said,,"You don't know me,,but I'm your 12th cousin.",And it said, "I have a family tree,with 80,000 people on it, including you,,Karl Marx,,and several European aristocrats.",Now I did not know what to make of this.,Part of me was like, okay,,when's he going to ask me to wire,10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?,I also thought, 80,000 relatives,,do I want that?,I have enough trouble with some of the ones,I have already.,And I won't name names, but you know who you are.,But another part of me said, this is remarkable.,Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.,I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,,and that's four Madison Square Gardens,full of cousins.,And some of them are going to be great,,and some of them are going to be irritating,,but they're all related to me. 
 So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,,which I always thought wasna very staid and proper field,,but it turns out it's going through a fascinating,revolution, and a controversial one.,Partly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,,but partly, it's because of the Internet.,There are sites that now take,the Wikipedia approach to family trees,,collaboration and crowdsourcing,,and what you do is,,you load your family tree on,,and then these sites search,to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree,is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,,and if it is, then you can combine,,and then you combine and combine and combine,until you get these massive,,mega-family trees,with thousands of people on them,,or even millions.,I'm on something on Geni called,the world family tree,,which has no less than a jaw-dropping,75 million people.,So that's 75 million people connected by blood,or marriage, sometimes both.,(Laughter),It's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.,I'm on it. Many of you are on it,,whether you know it or not,,and you can see the links.,Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.,She has no idea I exist,,but we are officially cousins.,We have just 17 links between us. 
 And there's my cousin Barack Obama.,(Laughter),And he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband's,father's wife's seventh great-nephew,,so practically my old brother. 
 And my cousin, of course,,the actor Kevin Bacon --,(Laughter) —,who is my first cousin's twice removed's,wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's,niece's husband.,So six degrees of Kevin Bacon,,plus or minus several degrees. 
 Now, I'm not boasting, because all of you,have famous people and historical figures,in your tree, because we are all connected,,and 75 million may seem like a lot,,but in a few years, it's quite likely,we will have a family tree,with all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth. 
 But does it really matter?,What's the importance?,And I do think it is important,,and I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly. 
 First, it's got scientific value.,This is an unprecedented history of the human race,,and it's giving us valuable data,about how diseases are inherited,,how people migrate,,and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now,studying the world family tree. 
 Number two, it brings history alive.,I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,,so I told my seven-year-old son that,,and he was totally engaged.,Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy,with weird hair.,He's Uncle Albert. (Laughter),And my son wanted to know,,"What did he say? What is E = MC squared?",Also, it's not all good news.,I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,,but I will say that's on my wife's side.,(Laughter) (Applause),So I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey. 
 Number three, interconnectedness.,We all come from the same ancestor,,and you don't have to believenthe literal Bible version,,but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam,and mitochondrial Eve,,and these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.,We all have a bit of their DNA in us.,They are our great-great-great-great-great-great --,continue that for about 7,000 times --,grandparents,,and so that means we literally all are,biological cousins as well,,and estimates vary, but probably,the farthest cousin you have on Earth,is about a 50th cousin.,Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.,If you have kids, and they have kids,,look how quickly the descendants accumulate.,So in 10, 12 generations,,you're going to have thousands of offspring,,and millions of offspring. 
 Number four, a kinder world.,Now, I know that there are family feuds.,I have three sons, so I see how they fight.,But I think that there's also a human bias,to treat your family a little better than strangers.,I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,,because they're going to have to realize,that they are cousins with thousands of people,in whatever ethnic group they happen,to have issues with,,and I think you look back at history,,and a lot of the terrible thingsnwe've done to each other,is because one group thinksnanother group is sub-human,,and you can't do that anymore.,We're not just part of the same species.,We're part of the same family.,We share 99.9 percent of our DNA. 
 Now the final one is number five,,a democratizing effect.,Some genealogy has an elitist strain,,like people say, "Oh, I'm descended,from Mary Queen of Scots,and you're not, so you cannot join my country club.",But that's really going to be hard to do now,,because everyone is related.,I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots --,by marriage, but still. 
 So it's really a fascinating time,in the history of family,,because it's changing so fast.,There is gay marriage and sperm donors,and there's intermarriagenon an unprecedented scale,,and this makes some of mynmore conservative cousins,a little nervous,,but I actually think it's a good thing.,I think the more inclusive the idea of family is,,the better,,because then you have more potential caretakers,,and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed,Hillary Clinton says --,(Laughter) —,it takes a village. 
 So I have all these hundreds and thousands,,millions of new cousins.,I thought, what can I do with this information?,And that's when I decided,,why not throw a party?,So that's what I'm doing.,And you're all invited.,Next year, next summer,,I will be hosting what I hope is,the biggest and best family reunion in history.,(Applause),Thank you. I want you there.,I want you there.,It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,,which is a great venue,,but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,,which is, I think, very appropriate,,because I see this as a family reunion,meets a world's fair.,There's going to be exhibits and food, music.,Paul McCartney is 11 steps away,,so I'm hoping he brings his guitar.,He hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.,And there is going to be a day of speakers,,of fascinating cousins.,It's early, but I've already,,I've got some lined up.,Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps,the most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.,He was a former membernof the Obama administration.,And on the other side of the political spectrum,,George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,,he has agreed to participate,,and Nick Kroll, the comedian,,and Dr. Oz, and many more to come.,And, of course, the most important is that you,,I want you guys there,,and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org,and figure out how you're on the family tree,,because these are big issues, family and tribe,,and I don't know all the answers,,but I have a lot of smart relatives,,including you guys,,so together, I think we can figure it out.,Only together can we solve these big problems.,So from cousin to cousin,,I thank you. I can't wait to see you.,Goodbye. 
 (Applause)When people think about cities,,they tend to think of certain things.,They think of buildings and streets,and skyscrapers, noisy cabs.,But when I think about cities,,I think about people.,Cities are fundamentally about people,,and where people go,and where people meet,are at the core of what makes a city work.,So even more important than buildings in a city,are the public spaces in between them.,And today, some of the most transformative,changes in cities,are happening in these public spaces. 
 So I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces,are the key to planning a great city.,They are what makes it come alive.,But what makes a public space work?,What attracts people to successful public spaces,,and what is it about unsuccessful places,that keeps people away?,I thought, if I could answer those questions,,I could make a huge contribution to my city.,But one of the more wonky things about me,is that I am an animal behaviorist,,and I use those skills not to study animal behavior,but to study how people in cities,use city public spaces. 
 One of the first spaces that I studied,was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park,in midtown Manhattan.,This little space became a small phenomenon,,and because it had such a profound impact,on New Yorkers,,it made an enormous impression on me.,I studied this park very early on in my career,because it happened to have been built,by my stepfather,,so I knew that places like Paley Park,didn't happen by accident.,I saw firsthand that they required,incredible dedication,and enormous attention to detail.,But what was it about this space,that made it special and drew people to it?,Well, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,,and first among other things,were the comfortable, movable chairs.,People would come in, find their own seat,,move it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,,and then interestingly,,people themselves attracted other people,,and ironically, I felt more peaceful,if there were other people around.,And it was green.,This little park provided what New Yorkers crave:,comfort and greenery.,But my question was,,why weren't there more places with greenery,and places to sit in the middle of the city,where you didn't feel alone,,or like a trespasser?,Unfortunately, that's not how cities,were being designed. 
 So here you see a familiar sight.,This is how plazas have beenndesigned for generations.,They have that stylish, Spartan look,that we often associate with modern architecture,,but it's not surprising that people,avoid spaces like this.,They not only look desolate,,they feel downright dangerous.,I mean, where would you sit here?,What would you do here?,But architects love them.,They are plinths for their creations.,They might tolerate a sculpture or two,,but that's about it.,And for developers, they are ideal.,There's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,,and no undesirable people to worry about.,But don't you think this is a waste?,For me, becoming a city planner,meant being able to truly change the city,that I lived in and loved.,I wanted to be able to create places,that would give you the feeling that you got,in Paley Park,,and not allow developers tonbuild bleak plazas like this.,But over the many years,,I have learned how hard it is,to create successful, meaningful,,enjoyable public spaces.,As I learned from my stepfather,,they certainly do not happen by accident,,especially in a city like New York,,where public space has tonbe fought for to begin with,,and then for them to be successful,,somebody has to think very hard,about every detail. 
 Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities.,Yes, they are opportunitiesnfor commercial investment,,but they are also opportunities for the common good,of the city,,and those two goals are oftennnot aligned with one another,,and therein lies the conflict. 
 The first opportunity I had to fight,for a great public open space was in the early 1980s,,when I was leading a team of planners,at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City,in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.,And this sandy wasteland had lain barren,for 10 years,,and we were told, unless we found a developer,in six months, it would go bankrupt.,So we came up with a radical,,almost insane idea.,Instead of building a park,as a complement to future development,,why don't we reverse that equation,and build a small but very high-quality,public open space first,,and see if that made a difference.,So we only could afford to build a two-block section,of what would become a mile-long esplanade,,so whatever we built had to be perfect.,So just to make sure, I insisted,that we build a mock-up,in wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.,And when I sat down on that test bench,with sand still swirling all around me,,the railing hit exactly at eye level,,blocking my view and ruining my experience,at the water's edge. 
 So you see, details really do make a difference.,But design is not just how something looks,,it's how your body feels on that seat in that space,,and I believe that successful design always depends,on that very individual experience.,In this photo, everything looks very finished,,but that granite edge, those lights,,the back on that bench,,the trees in planting,,and the many different kinds of places to sit,were all little battles that turned this project,into a place that people wanted to be. 
 Now, this proved very valuable 20 years later,when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be,his planning commissioner,and put me in charge of shaping,the entire city of New York.,And he said to me on that very day,,he said that New York was projected,to grow from eight to nine million people.,And he asked me,,"So where are you going to put,one million additional New Yorkers?" 
 Well, I didn't have any idea.,Now, you know that New York does,place a high value on attracting immigrants,,so we were excited about the prospect of growth,,but honestly, where were we going to grow,in a city that was already built out to its edges,and surrounded by water?,How were we going to find housing,for that many new New Yorkers?,And if we couldn't spread out,,which was probably a good thing,,where could new housing go?,And what about cars?,Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars. 
 So what were we going to do?,If we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.,And if we had to go up,,we had to go up in places,where you wouldn't need to own a car.,So that meant using one of our greatest assets:,our transit system.,But we had never before thought,of how we could make the most of it.,So here was the answer to our puzzle.,If we were to channel and redirect,all new development around transit,,we could actually handle that population increase,,we thought.,And so here was the plan,,what we really needed to do:,We needed to redo our zoning --,and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool --,and basically reshape the entire city,,targeting where new development could go,and prohibiting any development at all,in our car-oriented,,suburban-style neighborhoods.,Well, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,,ambitious because communities,had to approve those plans. 
 So how was I going to get this done?,By listening. So I began listening,,in fact, thousands of hours of listening,just to establish trust.,You know, communities can tell,whether or not you understand their neighborhoods.,It's not something you can just fake.,And so I began walking.,I can't tell you how many blocks I walked,,in sweltering summers, in freezing winters,,year after year,,just so I could get to understand,the DNA of each neighborhood,and know what each street felt like.,I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,,finding ways that zoning could address,communities' concerns.,So little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,,block by block,,we began to set height limits,so that all new development,would be predictable and near transit.,Over the course of 12 years,,we were able to rezone,124 neighborhoods,,40 percent of the city,,12,500 blocks, so that now,,90 percent of all new development of New York,is within a 10-minute walk of a subway.,In other words, nobody in those new buildings,needs to own a car. 
 Well, those rezonings were exhausting,and enervating and important,,but rezoning was never my mission.,You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.,My mission was always to create,great public spaces.,So in the areas where we zonednfor significant development,,I was determined to create places,that would make a difference in people's lives.,Here you see what was,two miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront,in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint,and Williamsburg in Brooklyn,,impossible to get to and impossible to use.,Now the zoning here was massive,,so I felt an obligation to create,magnificent parks on these waterfronts,,and I spent an incredible amount of time,on every square inch of these plans.,I wanted to make sure that there were,tree-lined paths from the upland to the water,,that there were trees and plantings everywhere,,and, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.,Honestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.,I had to have faith.,But I put everything that I had studied and learned,into those plans. 
 And then it opened,,and I have to tell you, it was incredible.,People came from all over the city,to be in these parks.,I know they changed the livesnof the people who live there,,but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image,of their city.,I often come down and watch people,get on this little ferry,that now runs between the boroughs,,and I can't tell you why,,but I'm completely moved,by the fact that people are using it,as if it had always been there. 
 And here is a new park in lower Manhattan.,Now, the water's edge in lower Manhattan,was a complete mess before 9/11.,Wall Street was essentially landlocked,because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.,And after 9/11, the city had very little control.,But I thought if we went,to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,and got money to reclaim this two miles,of degraded waterfront,that it would have an enormous effect,on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.,And it did.,Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront,on all three sides. 
 I really love this park.,You know, railings have to be higher now,,so we put bar seating at the edge,,and you can get so close to the water,you're practically on it.,And see how the railing widens,and flattens out so you can lay down,your lunch or your laptop.,And I love when people come there,and look up and they say,,"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close." 
 So what's the trick?,How do you turn a park,into a place that people want to be?,Well, it's up to you,,not as a city planner but as a human being.,You don't tap into your design expertise.,You tap into your humanity.,I mean, would you want to go there?,Would you want to stay there?,Can you see into it and out of it?,Are there other people there?,Does it seem green and friendly?,Can you find your very own seat? 
 Well now, all over New York City,,there are places where you can,find your very own seat.,Where there used to be parking spaces,,there are now pop-up cafes.,Where Broadway traffic used to run,,there are now tables and chairs.,Where 12 years ago, sidewalkncafes were not allowed,,they are now everywhere.,But claiming these spaces for public use,was not simple,,and it's even harder to keep them that way. 
 So now I'm going to tell you a story,about a very unusual park called the High Line.,The High Line was an elevated railway.,(Applause),The High Line was an elevated railway,that ran through three neighborhoods,on Manhattan's West Side,,and when the train stopped running,,it became a self-seeded landscape,,a kind of a garden in the sky.,And when I saw it the first time,,honestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,,I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,,honestly.,And when I was appointed,,saving the first two sections of the High Line,from demolition became my first priority,and my most important project.,I knew if there was a day that I didn't,worry about the High Line, it would come down.,And the High Line,,even though it is widely known now,and phenomenally popular,,it is the most contested public space in the city.,You might see a beautiful park,,but not everyone does.,You know, it's true, commercial interests,will always battle against public space.,You might say,,"How wonderful it is that more than,four million people come from all over the world,to visit the High Line.",Well, a developer sees just one thing: customers.,Hey, why not take out those plantings,and have shops all along the High Line?,Wouldn't that be terrific,and won't it mean a lot more money for the city?,Well no, it would not be terrific.,It would be a mall, and not a park.,(Applause),And you know what, it might mean,more money for the city,,but a city has to take the long view,,the view for the common good.,Most recently, the last section of the High Line,,the third section of the High Line,,the final section of the High Line,,has been pitted against development interests,,where some of the city's leading developers,are building more than 17 million square feet,at the Hudson Yards.,And they came to me and proposed,that they "temporarily disassemble",that third and final section.,Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in,with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers,on a hill.,Perhaps it was just in their way.,But in any case, it took nine months,of nonstop daily negotiation,to finally get the signed agreement,to prohibit its demolition,,and that was only two years ago. 
 So you see, no matter how popular,and successful a public space may be,,it can never be taken for granted.,Public spaces always -- this is it saved --,public spaces always need vigilant champions,,not only to claim them at the outset for public use,,but to design them for the people that use them,,then to maintain them to ensure,that they are for everyone,,that they are not violated, invaded,,abandoned or ignored.,If there is any one lesson,that I have learned in my life as a city planner,,it is that public spaces have power.,It's not just the number of people using them,,it's the even greater number of people,who feel better about their city,just knowing that they are there.,Public space can change how you live in a city,,how you feel about a city,,whether you choose one city over another,,and public space is one ofnthe most important reasons,why you stay in a city. 
 I believe that a successful city,is like a fabulous party.,People stay because they are having a great time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)So in the oasis of nintelligentsia that is TED,,I stand here before you this evening,as an expert in dragging heavynstuff around cold places.,I've been leading polar expeditions nfor most of my adult life,,and last month, my teammate nTarka L'Herpiniere and I,finished the most ambitious nexpedition I've ever attempted.,In fact, it feels like I've beenntransported straight here,from four months in the middle of nowhere,,mostly grunting and swearing, nstraight to the TED stage.,So you can imagine that's a transitionnthat hasn't been entirely seamless.,One of the interesting side effects,seems to be that my short-termnmemory is entirely shot.,So I've had to write some notes,to avoid too much grunting and swearingnin the next 17 minutes.,This is the first talk I've givennabout this expedition,,and while we weren't sequencing genomesnor building space telescopes,,this is a story about giving everythingnwe had to achieve something,that hadn't been done before.,So I hope in that you might nfind some food for thought. 
 It was a journey, an nexpedition in Antarctica,,the coldest, windiest, driest andnhighest altitude continent on Earth.,It's a fascinating place.nIt's a huge place.,It's twice the size of Australia,,a continent that is the same sizenas China and India put together. 
 As an aside, I have experienced,an interesting phenomenonnin the last few days,,something that I expect Chris Hadfieldnmay get at TED in a few years' time,,conversations that go something like this:,"Oh, Antarctica. Awesome.,My husband and I did Antarcticanwith Lindblad for our anniversary.",Or, "Oh cool, did you go therenfor the marathon?",(Laughter) 
 Our journey was, in fact,n69 marathons back to back,in 105 days, an 1,800-mile round tripnon foot from the coast of Antarctica,to the South Pole and back again.,In the process, we broke the record,for the longest human-powered polarnjourney in history by more than 400 miles.,(Applause),For those of you from the Bay Area,,it was the same as walking from nhere to San Francisco,,then turning aroundnand walking back again.,So as camping trips go, it was a long one,,and one I've seen summarized nmost succinctly here,on the hallowed pages nof Business Insider Malaysia.,["Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition nThat Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted"] 
 Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently,about fear and about the odds of success,nand indeed the odds of survival.,Of the nine people in history that hadnattempted this journey before us,,none had made it to the pole and back,,and five had died in the process. 
 This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott.,He led the last teamnto attempt this expedition.,Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton,,over the space of a decade,,both led expeditions battling to becomenthe first to reach the South Pole,,to chart and mapnthe interior of Antarctica,,a place we knew less about, at the time,,than the surface of the moon,,because we could seenthe moon through telescopes.,Antarctica was, for the most part,na century ago, uncharted. 
 Some of you may know the story.,Scott's last expedition, the nTerra Nova Expedition in 1910,,started as a giantnsiege-style approach.,He had a big team using ponies,,using dogs, using petrol-driven tractors,,dropping multiple, pre-positionedndepots of food and fuel,through which Scott's final team of fivenwould travel to the Pole,,where they would turn around and ski nback to the coast again on foot.,Scott and his final team of five,arrived at the South Pole nin January 1912,to find they had been beaten to itnby a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen,,who rode on dogsled.,Scott's team ended up on foot.,And for more than a centurynthis journey has remained unfinished.,Scott's team of five died non the return journey.,And for the last decade,,I've been asking myself why that is.,How come this has remained nthe high-water mark?,Scott's team covered 1,600 miles on foot.,No one's come close to that ever since.,So this is the high-water mark nof human endurance,,human endeavor, nhuman athletic achievement,in arguably the harshest climate on Earth.,It was as if the marathon record,has remained unbroken since 1912.,And of course some strange and npredictable combination of curiosity,,stubbornness, and probably hubris,led me to thinking I might be the mannto try to finish the job. 
 Unlike Scott's expedition,nthere were just two of us,,and we set off from the coastnof Antarctica in October last year,,dragging everything ourselves,,a process Scott called "man-hauling.",When I say it was like walking fromnhere to San Francisco and back,,I actually mean it was like draggingnsomething that weighs a shade more,than the heaviest ever NFL player.,Our sledges weighed 200 kilos,,or 440 pounds each at the start,,the same weights that the weakestnof Scott's ponies pulled.,Early on, we averaged 0.5 miles per hour.,Perhaps the reason no one had nattempted this journey until now,,in more than a century,,was that no one had been quitenstupid enough to try.,And while I can't claim we were exploring,in the genuine Edwardiannsense of the word —,we weren't naming any mountainsnor mapping any uncharted valleys —,I think we were stepping into unchartednterritory in a human sense.,Certainly, if in the future we learnnthere is an area of the human brain,that lights up when one curses oneself,,I won't be at all surprised. 
 You've heard that the average Americannspends 90 percent of their time indoors.,We didn't go indoorsnfor nearly four months.,We didn't see a sunset either.,It was 24-hour daylight.,Living conditions were quite spartan.,I changed my underwear nthree times in 105 days,and Tarka and I shared n30 square feet on the canvas.,Though we did have some technologynthat Scott could never have imagined.,And we blogged live every eveningnfrom the tent via a laptop,and a custom-made satellite transmitter,,all of which were solar-powered:,we had a flexible photovoltaicnpanel over the tent.,And the writing was important to me.,As a kid, I was inspired by the nliterature of adventure and exploration,,and I think we've all seennhere this week,the importance and nthe power of storytelling. 
 So we had some 21st-century gear,,but the reality is that the nchallenges that Scott faced,were the same that we faced:,those of the weather and of nwhat Scott called glide,,the amount of friction betweennthe sledges and the snow.,The lowest wind chill nwe experienced was in the -70s,,and we had zero visibility,nwhat's called white-out,,for much of our journey.,We traveled up and down one of the largest,and most dangerous glaciersnin the world, the Beardmore glacier.,It's 110 miles long; most of its surfacenis what's called blue ice.,You can see it's a beautiful, nshimmering steel-hard blue surface,covered with thousands nand thousands of crevasses,,these deep cracks in the glacial ice nup to 200 feet deep.,Planes can't land here,,so we were at the most risk,,technically, when we had the slimmestnchance of being rescued. 
 We got to the South Polenafter 61 days on foot,,with one day off for bad weather,,and I'm sad to say, it wasnsomething of an anticlimax.,There's a permanent American base,,the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Stationnat the South Pole.,They have an airstrip,nthey have a canteen,,they have hot showers,,they have a post office, a tourist shop,,a basketball court that doublesnas a movie theater.,So it's a bit different these days,,and there are also acres of junk.,I think it's a marvelous thing,that humans can existn365 days of the year,with hamburgers and hot showersnand movie theaters,,but it does seem to producena lot of empty cardboard boxes.,You can see on the left of nthis photograph,,several square acres of junk,waiting to be flown outnfrom the South Pole.,But there is also a pole at the South Pole,,and we got there on foot, unassisted,,unsupported, by the hardest route,,900 miles in record time,,dragging more weightnthan anyone in history.,And if we'd stopped there nand flown home,,which would have beennthe eminently sensible thing to do,,then my talk would end here,and it would end something like this. 
 If you have the right team around you,nthe right tools, the right technology,,and if you have enough self-beliefnand enough determination,,then anything is possible. 
 But then we turned around,,and this is where things get interesting.,High on the Antarctic plateau,,over 10,000 feet, it's very windy,nvery cold, very dry, we were exhausted.,We'd covered 35 marathons,,we were only halfway,,and we had a safety net, of course,,of ski planes and satellite phones,and live, 24-hour tracking beaconsnthat didn't exist for Scott,,but in hindsight,,rather than making our lives easier,,the safety net actually allowed us,to cut things very fine indeed,,to sail very close to our absolutenlimits as human beings.,And it is an exquisite form of torture,to exhaust yourself to the pointnof starvation day after day,while dragging a sledgenfull of food. 
 For years, I'd been writing glib linesnin sponsorship proposals,about pushing the limitsnof human endurance,,but in reality, that was na very frightening place to be indeed.,We had, before we'd got to the Pole,,two weeks of almost permanentnheadwind, which slowed us down.,As a result, we'd had several daysnof eating half rations.,We had a finite amount of foodnin the sledges to make this journey,,so we were trying to string that out,by reducing our intake to half nthe calories we should have been eating.,As a result, we both becamenincreasingly hypoglycemic —,we had low blood sugar nlevels day after day —,and increasingly susceptiblento the extreme cold.,Tarka took this photo of me one evening,after I'd nearly passed outnwith hypothermia.,We both had repeated bouts of hypothermia,nsomething I hadn't experienced before,,and it was very humbling indeed.,As much as you mightnlike to think, as I do,,that you're the kindnof person who doesn't quit,,that you'll go down swinging,,hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice.,You become utterly incapacitated.,It's like being a drunk toddler.,You become pathetic.,I remember just wantingnto lie down and quit.,It was a peculiar, peculiar feeling,,and a real surprise to mento be debilitated to that degree. 
 And then we ran out of food completely,,46 miles short of the first of the depots,that we'd laid on our outward journey.,We'd laid 10 depots of food,,literally burying food and fuel,nfor our return journey —,the fuel was for a cooker so youncould melt snow to get water —,and I was forced to make the decisionnto call for a resupply flight,,a ski plane carrying eight days of foodnto tide us over that gap.,They took 12 hours to reach usnfrom the other side of Antarctica. 
 Calling for that plane was one of nthe toughest decisions of my life.,And I sound like a bit of a fraudnstanding here now with a sort of belly.,I've put on 30 poundsnin the last three weeks.,Being that hungry has leftnan interesting mental scar,,which is that I've been hoovering upnevery hotel buffet that I can find.,(Laughter),But we were genuinely quite hungry,nand in quite a bad way.,I don't regret callingnfor that plane for a second,,because I'm still standing here alive,,with all digits intact, ntelling this story.,But getting external assistance like thatnwas never part of the plan,,and it's something my egonis still struggling with.,This was the biggest dream I've ever had,,and it was so nearly perfect. 
 On the way back down to the coast,,our crampons — they're nthe spikes on our boots,that we have for travelingnover this blue ice on the glacier —,broke on the top of the Beardmore.,We still had 100 miles to go downhill,on very slippery rock-hard blue ice.,They needed repairing almost every hour.,To give you an idea of scale,,this is looking down towards the mouthnof the Beardmore Glacier.,You could fit the entirety of Manhattannin the gap on the horizon.,That's 20 miles betweennMount Hope and Mount Kiffin.,I've never felt as small nas I did in Antarctica.,When we got downnto the mouth of the glacier,,we found fresh snow had obscurednthe dozens of deep crevasses.,One of Shackleton's men describedncrossing this sort of terrain,as like walking over the glass roofnof a railway station.,We fell through more timesnthan I can remember,,usually just putting a skinor a boot through the snow.,Occasionally we went in all nthe way up to our armpits,,but thankfully never deeper than that. 
 And less than five weeks ago,nafter 105 days,,we crossed this oddly ninauspicious finish line,,the coast of Ross Island non the New Zealand side of Antarctica.,You can see the ice in the foreground,and the sort of rubbly rock behind that.,Behind us lay an unbroken nski trail of nearly 1,800 miles.,We'd made the longest evernpolar journey on foot,,something I'd been dreaming nof doing for a decade. 
 And looking back,,I still stand by all the things,I've been saying for years,about the importance of goals,and determination and self-belief,,but I'll also admit that I hadn't givennmuch thought to what happens,when you reach the all-consuming goal,that you've dedicated nmost of your adult life to,,and the reality is that I'm nstill figuring that bit out.,As I said, there are very fewnsuperficial signs that I've been away.,I've put on 30 pounds.,I've got some very faint, probably ncovered in makeup now, frostbite scars.,I've got one on my nose, one on neach cheek, from where the goggles are,,but inside I am a very ndifferent person indeed.,If I'm honest,,Antarctica challenged menand humbled me so deeply,that I'm not sure I'll ever be ablento put it into words.,I'm still struggling to piecentogether my thoughts.,That I'm standing here ntelling this story,is proof that we all can naccomplish great things,,through ambition, through passion,,through sheer stubbornness,,by refusing to quit,,that if you dream something nhard enough, as Sting said,,it does indeed come to pass.,But I'm also standing here nsaying, you know what,,that cliche about the journey being nmore important than the destination?,There's something in that.,The closer I got to my finish line,,that rubbly, rocky coast of Ross Island,,the more I started to realizenthat the biggest lesson,that this very long, very hard walknmight be teaching me,is that happiness is notna finish line,,that for us humans,,the perfection that so many ofnus seem to dream of,might not ever be truly attainable,,and that if we can't feel contentnhere, today, now, on our journeys,amidst the mess and the strivingnthat we all inhabit,,the open loops, nthe half-finished to-do lists,,the could-do-better-next-times,,then we might never feel it. 
 A lot of people have asked me, what next?,Right now, I am very happy just recoveringnand in front of hotel buffets.,But as Bob Hope put it,,I feel very humble,,but I think I have the strengthnof character to fight it. (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I don't know if you've noticed,,but there's been a spate of books,that have come out lately,contemplating or speculating,on the cognition and emotional life of dogs.,Do they think, do they feel and, if so, how?,So this afternoon, in my limited time,,I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that,by introducing you to two dogs,,both of whom have taken the command "speak",quite literally. 
 The first dog is the first to go,,and he is contemplating an aspect,of his relationship to his owner,,and the title is "A Dog on His Master." 
 "As young as I look,,I am growing older faster than he.,Seven to one is the ratio, they tend to say.,Whatever the number, I will pass him one day,and take the lead,,the way I do on our walks in the woods,,and if this ever manages to cross his mind,,it would be the sweetest shadow,I have ever cast on snow or grass." 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 And our next dog,speaks in something called the revenant,,which means a spirit that comes back,to visit you. 
 "I am the dog you put to sleep,,as you like to call the needle of oblivion,,come back to tell you this simple thing:,I never liked you.",(Laughter),"When I licked your face,,I thought of biting off your nose.,When I watched you toweling yourself dry,,I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap.,I resented the way you moved,,your lack of animal grace,,the way you would sit in a chair to eat,,a napkin on your lap, a knife in your hand.,I would have run away,but I was too weak,,a trick you taught me,while I was learning to sit and heel,and, greatest of insults,,shake hands without a hand.,I admit the sight of the leash would excite me,,but only because it meant I was about to smell things,you had never touched.,You do not want to believe this,,but I have no reason to lie:,I hated the car, hated the rubber toys,,disliked your friends, and worse, your relatives.,The jingling of my tags drove me mad.,You always scratched me in the wrong place.",(Laughter),"All I ever wanted from you was food and water,in my bowls.,While you slept, I watched you breathe,as the moon rose in the sky.,It took all of my strength,not to raise my head and howl.,Now, I am free of the collar,,free of the yellow raincoat,,monogrammed sweater,,the absurdity of your lawn,,and that is all you need to know about this place,,except what you already supposed,and are glad it did not happen sooner,,that everyone here can read and write,,the dogs in poetry,,the cats and all the others,in prose." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius.",Faster, Higher, Stronger.,And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.,The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon,ran two hours and eight minutes.,Had he been racing against the winner,of the 1904 Olympic marathon,,he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.,Now we all have this feeling,that we're somehow just getting better,as a human race, inexorably progressing,,but it's not like we've evolved into a new species,in a century.,So what's going on here?,I want to take a look at what's really behind,this march of athletic progress. 
 In 1936, Jesse Owens,held the world record in the 100 meters.,Had Jesse Owens been racing last year,in the world championships of the 100 meters,,when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,,Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.,That's a lot in sprinter land.,To give you a sense of how much it is,,I want to share with you a demonstration,conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.,Now picture the stadium last year,at the world championships of the 100 meters:,thousands of fans waiting with baited breath,to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;,flashbulbs popping as thennine fastest men in the world,coil themselves into their blocks.,And I want you to pretend,that Jesse Owens is in that race.,Now close your eyes for ansecond and picture the race.,Bang! The gun goes off.,An American sprinter jumps out to the front.,Usain Bolt starts to catch him.,Usain Bolt passes him, and asnthe runners come to the finish,,you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.,(Beeps),That's the entire finish of the race.,You can open your eyes now.,That first beep was Usain Bolt.,That last beep was Jesse Owens.,Listen to it again.,(Beeps),When you think of it like that,,it's not that big a difference, is it?,And then consider that Usain Bolt started,by propelling himself out of blocks,down a specially fabricated carpet,designed to allow him to travel,as fast as humanly possible.,Jesse Owens, on the other hand,,ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,,and that soft surface stole far more energy,from his legs as he ran.,Rather than blocks, JessenOwens had a gardening trowel,that he had to use to dig holesnin the cinders to start from.,Biomechanical analysis of the speed,of Owens' joints shows that had been running,on the same surface as Bolt,,he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,,he would have been within one stride.,Rather than the last beep,,Owens would have been the second beep.,Listen to it again.,(Beeps),That's the difference tracknsurface technology has made,,and it's done it throughout the running world. 
 Consider a longer event.,In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister,became the first man to runnunder four minutes in the mile.,Nowadays, college kids do that every year.,On rare occasions, a high school kid does it.,As of the end of last year,,1,314 men,had run under four minutes in the mile,,but like Jesse Owens,,Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders,that stole far more energy from his legs,than the synthetic tracks of today.,So I consulted biomechanics experts,to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders,than synthetic tracks,,and their consensus that it'snone and a half percent slower.,So if you apply a one and a halfnpercent slowdown conversion,to every man who ran his sub-four mile,on a synthetic track,,this is what happens.,Only 530 are left.,If you look at it from that perspective,,fewer than ten new men per [year],have joined the sub-four mile club,since Sir Roger Bannister.,Now, 530 is a lot more than one,,and that's partly becausenthere are many more people,training today and they're training more intelligently.,Even college kids are professional in their training,compared to Sir Roger Bannister,,who trained for 45 minutes at a time,while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.,And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon,in three in a half hours,,that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy,while he ran along the course.,That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.,(Laughter) 
 Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy,about performance-enhancing drugs as well,,and that's made a differencenin some sports at some times,,but technology has made a difference in all sports,,from faster skis to lighter shoes.,Take a look at the record fornthe 100-meter freestyle swim.,The record is always trending downward,,but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.,This first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction,of the flip turn.,Rather than stopping and turning around,,athletes could somersault under the water,and get going right away in the opposite direction.,This second cliff, the introduction of gutters,on the side of the pool,that allows water to splash off,,rather than becoming turbulence,that impedes the swimmers as they race.,This final cliff,,the introduction of full-body,and low-friction swimsuits. 
 Throughout sports, technology hasnchanged the face of performance.,In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record,for the longest distance cycled in one hour,at 30 miles, 3,774 feet.,Now that record improved and improved,as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic,all the way until 1996,,when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,,nearly five miles farther,than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.,But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union,decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record,had to do so with essentially the same equipment,that Eddy Merckx used in 1972.,Where does the record stand today?,30 miles, 4,657 feet,,a grand total of 883 feet,farther than Eddy Merckx cycled,more than four decades ago.,Essentially the entire improvement in this record,was due to technology. 
 Still, technology isn't the onlynthing pushing athletes forward.,While indeed we haven't evolved,into a new species in a century,,the gene pool within competitive sports,most certainly has changed.,In the early half of the 20th century,,physical education instructors and coaches,had the idea that the average body type,was the best for all athletic endeavors:,medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.,And this showed in athletes' bodies.,In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper,and average elite shot-putternwere the same exact size.,But as that idea started to fade away,,as sports scientists and coaches realized that,rather than the average body type,,you want highly specialized bodies,that fit into certain athletic niches,,a form of artificial selection took place,,a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,,and athletes' bodies becamenmore different from one another.,Today, rather than the same sizenas the average elite high jumper,,the average elite shot-putter,is two and a half inches taller,and 130 pounds heavier.,And this happened throughout the sports world. 
 In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph,one data point for each of two dozen sports,in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.,There's some dispersal,,but it's kind of groupednaround that average body type.,Then that idea started to go away,,and at the same time, digital technology --,first radio, then television and the Internet --,gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people,a ticket to consume elite sports performance.,The financial incentives and fame and glorynafforded elite athletes skyrocketed,,and it tipped toward the tinynupper echelon of performance.,It accelerated the artificialnselection for specialized bodies.,And if you plot a data point for these same,two dozen sports today, it looks like this.,The athletes' bodies have gotten,much more different from one another.,And because this chart looks like the charts,that show the expanding universe,,with the galaxies flying away from one another,,the scientists who discovered it call it,"The Big Bang of Body Types." 
 In sports where height is prized, like basketball,,the tall athletes got taller.,In 1983, the National Basketball Association,signed a groundbreaking agreement,making players partners in the league,,entitled to shares of ticket revenues,and television contracts.,Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player,wanted to be,,and teams started scouring the globe,for the bodies that couldnhelp them win championships.,Almost overnight,,the proportion of men in the NBA,who are at least seven feet tall doubled,to 10 percent.,Today, one in 10 men in the NBA,is at least seven feet tall,,but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare,in the general population --,so rare that if you know an American man,between the ages of 20 and 40,who is at least seven feet tall,,there's a 17 percent chance,he's in the NBA right now.,(Laughter),That is, find six honest seven footers,,one is in the NBA right now.,And that's not the only way thatnNBA players' bodies are unique.,This is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man,",the ideal proportions,,with arm span equal to height.,My arm span is exactly equal to my height.,Yours is probably very nearly so.,But not the average NBA player.,The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7",,with arms that are seven feet long.,Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall,,they are ludicrously long.,Had Leonardo wanted to draw,the Vitruvian NBA Player,,he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,,not a circle and a square. 
 So in sports where large size is prized,,the large athletes have gotten larger.,Conversely, in sports wherendiminutive stature is an advantage,,the small athletes got smaller.,The average elite female gymnast,shrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average,over the last 30 years,,all the better for their power-to-weight ratio,and for spinning in the air.,And while the large got larger,and the small got smaller,,the weird got weirder.,The average length of the forearm,of a water polo player in relation,to their total arm got longer,,all the better for a forceful throwing whip.,And as the large got larger,,small got smaller, and the weird weirder.,In swimming, the ideal body type,is a long torso and short legs.,It's like the long hull of a canoe,for speed over the water.,And the opposite is advantageous in running.,You want long legs and a short torso.,And this shows in athletes' bodies today.,Here you see Michael Phelps,,the greatest swimmer in history,,standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj,,the world record holder in the mile.,These men are seven inches different in height,,but because of the body types,advantaged in their sports,,they wear the same length pants.,Seven inches difference in height,,these men have the same length legs. 
 Now in some cases, the search for bodies,that could push athletic performance forward,ended up introducing into the competitive world,populations of people that weren'tnpreviously competing at all,,like Kenyan distance runners.,We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.,Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe,as being great marathoners.,The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent,of the Kenyan population,but the vast majority of elite runners.,And they happen, on average,,to have a certain unique physiology:,legs that are very long,and very thin at their extremity,,and this is because they have their ancestry,at very low latitude,in a very hot and dry climate,,and an evolutionary adaptation to that,is limbs that are very long,and very thin at the extremity,for cooling purposes.,It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,,to increase surface area compared to volume,to let heat out,,and because the leg is like a pendulum,,the longer and thinner it is at the extremity,,the more energy-efficient it is to swing.,To put Kalenjin running success in perspective,,consider that 17 American men in history,have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes,in the marathon.,That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.,Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.,(Laughter),That's from a source population the size,of metropolitan Atlanta. 
 Still, even changing technology,and the changing gene pool in sports,don't account for all of the changes in performance.,Athletes have a different mindset than they once did.,Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets,an electrical shock,and they're thrown across a room?,There's no explosion there.,What's happening when that happens is that,the electrical impulse is causing,all their muscle fibers to twitch at once,,and they're throwing themselves across the room.,They're essentially jumping.,That's the power,that's contained in the human body.,But normally we can't access nearly all of it.,Our brain acts as a limiter,,preventing us from accessingnall of our physical resources,,because we might hurt ourselves,,tearing tendons or ligaments.,But the more we learn aboutnhow that limiter functions,,the more we learn how we can push it back,just a bit,,in some cases by convincing the brain,that the body won't be in mortal danger,by pushing harder.,Endurance and ultra-endurance sports,serve as a great example.,Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful,to human health,,but now we realize,that we have all these traits,that are perfect for ultra-endurance:,no body fur and a glut of sweat glands,that keep us cool while running;,narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;,large surface area of joints for shock absorption.,We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,,short toes that are better for pushing off,than for grasping tree limbs,,and when we run,,we can turn our torso and our shoulders,like this while keeping our heads straight.,Our primate cousins can't do that.,They have to run like this.,And we have big old butt muscles,that keep us upright while running.,Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?,They have no buns because they don't run upright.,And as athletes have realized,that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,,they've taken on feats,that would have been unthinkable before,,athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.,Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.,(Laughter),With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.,It's so steep he can't even run here.,He's pulling up on a rope.,This is a vertical ascent,of more than 8,000 feet,,and Kílian went up and down,in under three hours.,Amazing.,And talented though he is,,Kílian is not a physiological freak.,Now that he has done this,,other athletes will follow,,just as other athletes followed,after Sir Roger Bannister,ran under four minutes in the mile. 
 Changing technology, changing genes,,and a changing mindset.,Innovation in sports,,whether that's new track surfaces,or new swimming techniques,,the democratization of sport,,the spread to new bodies,and to new populations around the world,,and imagination in sport,,an understanding of what the human body,is truly capable of,,have conspired to make athletes stronger,,faster, bolder,,and better than ever. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I study ants,in the desert, in the tropical forest,and in my kitchen,,and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.,I've recently realized that ants,are using interactions differently,in different environments,,and that got me thinkingnthat we could learn from this,about other systems,,like brains and data networks that we engineer,,and even cancer. 
 So what all these systems have in common,is that there's no central control.,An ant colony consists of sterile female workers --,those are the ants you see walking around —,and then one or more reproductive females,who just lay the eggs.,They don't give any instructions.,Even though they're called queens,,they don't tell anybody what to do.,So in an ant colony, there's no one in charge,,and all systems like this without central control,are regulated using very simple interactions.,Ants interact using smell.,They smell with their antennae,,and they interact with their antennae,,so when one ant touches another with its antennae,,it can tell, for example, if the other ant,is a nestmate,and what task that other ant has been doing.,So here you see a lot of ants moving around,and interacting in a lab arena,that's connected by tubes to two other arenas.,So when one ant meets another,,it doesn't matter which ant it meets,,and they're actually not transmitting,any kind of complicated signal or message.,All that matters to the ant is the rate,at which it meets other ants.,And all of these interactions, taken together,,produce a network.,So this is the network of the ants,that you just saw moving around in the arena,,and it's this constantly shifting network,that produces the behavior of the colony,,like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,,or how many are going out to forage.,A brain actually works in the same way,,but what's great about ants is,that you can see the whole network as it happens. 
 There are more than 12,000 species of ants,,in every conceivable environment,,and they're using interactions differently,to meet different environmental challenges.,So one important environmental challenge,that every system has to deal with,is operating costs, just what it takes,to run the system.,And another environmental challenge is resources,,finding them and collecting them.,In the desert, operating costs are high,because water is scarce,,and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert,have to spend water to get water.,So an ant outside foraging,,searching for seeds in the hot sun,,just loses water into the air.,But the colony gets its water,by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds,that they eat.,So in this environment, interactions are used,to activate foraging.,An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless,it gets enough interactions with returning foragers,,and what you see are the returning foragers,going into the tunnel, into the nest,,and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.,This makes sense for the ant colony,,because the more food there is out there,,the more quickly the foragers find it,,the faster they come back,,and the more foragers they send out.,The system works to stay stopped,,unless something positive happens. 
 So interactions function to activate foragers.,And we've been studyingnthe evolution of this system.,First of all, there's variation.,It turns out that colonies are different.,On dry days, some colonies forage less,,so colonies are different in how,they manage this trade-off,between spending water to search for seeds,and getting water back in the form of seeds.,And we're trying to understand why,some colonies forage less than others,by thinking about ants as neurons,,using models from neuroscience.,So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation,from other neurons to decide whether to fire,,an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants,to decide whether to forage.,And what we're looking for is whether there might be,small differences among colonies,in how many interactions each ant needs,before it's willing to go out and forage,,because a colony like that would forage less. 
 And this raises an analogous question about brains.,We talk about the brain,,but of course every brain is slightly different,,and maybe there are some individuals,or some conditions,in which the electrical properties of neurons are such,that they require more stimulus to fire,,and that would lead to differences in brain function. 
 So in order to ask evolutionary questions,,we need to know about reproductive success.,This is a map of the study site,where I have been tracking this population,of harvester ant colonies for 28 years,,which is about as long as a colony lives.,Each symbol is a colony,,and the size of the symbol isnhow many offspring it had,,because we were able to use genetic variation,to match up parent and offspring colonies,,that is, to figure out which colonies,were founded by a daughter queen,produced by which parent colony.,And this was amazing for me, after all these years,,to find out, for example, that colony 154,,whom I've known well for many years,,is a great-grandmother.,Here's her daughter colony,,here's her granddaughter colony,,and these are her great-granddaughter colonies.,And by doing this, I was able to learn,that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies,in their decisions about which days are so hot,that they don't forage,,and the offspring of parent colonies,live so far from each other that the ants never meet,,so the ants of the offspring colony,can't be learning this from the parent colony.,And so our next step is to look,for the genetic variationnunderlying this resemblance. 
 So then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better?,Over the time of the study,,and especially in the past 10 years,,there's been a very severe and deepening drought,in the Southwestern U.S.,,and it turns out that thencolonies that conserve water,,that stay in when it's really hot outside,,and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,,are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.,So all this time, I thought that colony 154,was a loser, because on really dry days,,there'd be just this trickle of foraging,,while the other colonies were out,foraging, getting lots of food,,but in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.,She's a matriarch.,She's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.,To my knowledge, this is the first time,that we've been able to track,the ongoing evolution of collective behavior,in a natural population of animals,and find out what's actually working best. 
 Now, the Internet uses an algorithm,to regulate the flow of data,that's very similar to the one,that the harvester ants are using to regulate,the flow of foragers.,And guess what we call this analogy?,The anternet is coming.,(Applause),So data doesn't leave the source computer,unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth,for it to travel on.,In the early days of the Internet,,when operating costs were really high,and it was really important not to lose any data,,then the system was set up for interactions,to activate the flow of data.,It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm,that's so similar to the one that we recently invented,,but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms,that we know about,,and ants have had 130 million years,to evolve a lot of good ones,,and I think it's very likely,that some of the other 12,000 species,are going to have interesting algorithms,for data networks,that we haven't even thought of yet. 
 So what happens when operating costs are low?,Operating costs are low in the tropics,,because it's very humid, and it's easy for the ants,to be outside walking around.,But the ants are so abundant,and diverse in the tropics,that there's a lot of competition.,Whatever resource one species is using,,another species is likely to be using that,at the same time.,So in this environment, interactions are used,in the opposite way.,The system keeps going,unless something negative happens,,and one species that I study makes circuits,in the trees of foraging ants,going from the nest to a food source and back,,just round and round,,unless something negative happens,,like an interaction,with ants of another species.,So here's an example of ant security.,In the middle, there's an ant,plugging the nest entrance with its head,in response to interactions with another species.,Those are the little ones running around,with their abdomens up in the air.,But as soon as the threat is passed,,the entrance is open again,,and maybe there are situations,in computer security,where operating costs are low enough,that we could just block access temporarily,in response to an immediate threat,,and then open it again,,instead of trying to build,a permanent firewall or fortress. 
 So another environmental challenge,that all systems have to deal with,is resources, finding and collecting them.,And to do this, ants solve the problem,of collective search,,and this is a problem that's of great interest,right now in robotics,,because we've understood that,,rather than sending a single,,sophisticated, expensive robot out,to explore another planet,or to search a burning building,,that instead, it may be more effective,to get a group of cheaper robots,exchanging only minimal information,,and that's the way that ants do it.,So the invasive Argentine ant,makes expandable search networks.,They're good at dealing with the main problem,of collective search,,which is the trade-off between,searching very thoroughly,and covering a lot of ground.,And what they do is,,when there are many ants in a small space,,then each one can search very thoroughly,because there will be another ant nearby,searching over there,,but when there are a few ants,in a large space,,then they need to stretch out their paths,to cover more ground.,I think they use interactions to assess density,,so when they're really crowded,,they meet more often,,and they search more thoroughly.,Different ant species must use different algorithms,,because they've evolved to deal with,different resources,,and it could be really useful to know about this,,and so we recently asked ants,to solve the collective search problem,in the extreme environment,of microgravity,in the International Space Station.,When I first saw this picture, I thought,,Oh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically,,but then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter.,So the idea here is that the ants,are working so hard to hang on,to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it,that they're less likely to interact,,and so the relationship between,how crowded they are and how often they meet,would be messed up.,We're still analyzing the data.,I don't have the results yet.,But it would be interesting to know,how other species solve this problem,in different environments on Earth,,and so we're setting up a program,to encourage kids around the world,to try this experiment with different species.,It's very simple.,It can be done with cheap materials.,And that way, we could make a global map,of ant collective search algorithms.,And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species,,the ones that come into our buildings,,are going to be really good at this,,because they're in your kitchen,because they're really goodnat finding food and water. 
 So the most familiar resource for ants,is a picnic,,and this is a clustered resource.,When there's one piece of fruit,,there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,,and the ants that specialize on clustered resources,use interactions for recruitment.,So when one ant meets another,,or when it meets a chemical deposited,on the ground by another,,then it changes direction to follow,in the direction of the interaction,,and that's how you get the trail of ants,sharing your picnic. 
 Now this is a place where I think we might be able,to learn something from ants about cancer.,I mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot,to prevent cancer,by not allowing people to spread around,or sell the toxins that promote,the evolution of cancer in our bodies,,but I don't think the ants can help us much with this,because ants never poison their own colonies.,But we might be able to learn something from ants,about treating cancer.,There are many different kinds of cancer.,Each one originates in a particular part of the body,,and then some kinds of cancer will spread,or metastasize to particular other tissues,where they must be gettingnresources that they need.,So if you think from the perspective,of early metastatic cancer cells,as they're out searching around,for the resources that they need,,if those resources are clustered,,they're likely to use interactions for recruitment,,and if we can figure out howncancer cells are recruiting,,then maybe we could set traps,to catch them before they become established. 
 So ants are using interactions in different ways,in a huge variety of environments,,and we could learn from this,about other systems that operate,without central control.,Using only simple interactions,,ant colonies have been performing,amazing feats for more than 130 million years.,We have a lot to learn from them. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,,a flock of birds.,Many animals gather in large groups,that are among the most wonderful spectacles,in the natural world.,But why do these groups form?,The common answers include things like,seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs,or gathering to mate or breed,,and all of these explanations,,while often true,,make a huge assumption about animal behavior,,that the animals are in control of their own actions,,that they are in charge of their bodies.,And that is often not the case. 
 This is Artemia, a brine shrimp.,You probably know it better as a sea monkey.,It's small, and it typically lives alone,,but it can gather in these large red swarms,that span for meters,,and these form because of a parasite.,These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.,A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut,with genitals at one end andna hooked mouth at the other.,As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.,(Laughter),The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,,but it also does other things.,It castrates them,,it changes their color from transparent to bright red,,it makes them live longer,,and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,,it makes them swim in groups.,Why? Because the tapeworm,nlike many other parasites,,has a complicated life cycle,involving many different hosts.,The shrimp are just one step on its journey.,Its ultimate destination is this,,the greater flamingo.,Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce,,so to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts,into forming these conspicuous colored swarms,that are easier for a flamingo to spot,and to devour,,and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.,They aren't sociable through their own volition,,but because they are being controlled.,It's not safety in numbers.,It's actually the exact opposite.,The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies,,turning them into vehicles,for getting itself into a flamingo. 
 And here is another example,of a parasitic manipulation.,This is a suicidal cricket.,This cricket swallowed the nlarvae of a Gordian worm,,or horsehair worm.,The worm grew to adult size within it,,but it needs to get into water in order to mate,,and it does that by releasing proteins,that addle the cricket's brain,,causing it to behave erratically.,When the cricket nears a body of water,,such as this swimming pool,,it jumps in and drowns,,and the worm wriggles out,of its suicidal corpse.,Crickets are really roomy. Who knew? 
 The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone.,They are part of an entire cavalcade,of mind-controlling parasites,,of fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more,that all specialize in subverting and overriding,the wills of their hosts.,Now, I first learned about this way of life,through David Attenborough's "Trials of Life",about 20 years ago,,and then later through a wonderful book called,"Parasite Rex" by my friend Carl Zimmer.,And I've been writing aboutnthese creatures ever since.,Few topics in biology enthrall me more.,It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain.,Because after all, they are always compelling,and they are delightfully macabre.,When you write about parasites,,your lexicon swells with phrases like,"devoured alive" and "bursts out of its body.",(Laughter) 
 But there's more to it than that.,I'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience,will know that we love stories.,Parasites invite us to resist the allure,of obvious stories.,Their world is one of plot twists,and unexpected explanations.,Why, for example,,does this caterpillar,start violently thrashing about,when another insect gets close to it,and those white cocoons that it seems,to be standing guard over?,Is it maybe protecting its siblings?,No.,This caterpillar was attacked,by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.,The eggs hatched and the young wasps,devoured the caterpillar alive,before bursting out of its body.,See what I mean?,Now, the caterpillar didn't die.,Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind,and controlled it into defending their siblings,which are metamorphosing,into adults within those cocoons.,This caterpillar is a head-banging nzombie bodyguard,defending the offspring,of the creature that killed it. 
 (Applause) 
 We have a lot to get through. nI only have 13 minutes. (Laughter) 
 Now, some of you are probably just,desperately clawing for some solace,in the idea that these things are oddities,of the natural world, that they are outliers,,and that point of view is understandable,,because by their nature, parasites are quite small,and they spend a lot of their time,inside the bodies of other things.,They're easy to overlook,,but that doesn't mean that they aren't important.,A few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty,took a group of scientistsninto three Californian estuaries,and they pretty much weighed and dissected,and recorded everything they could find,,and what they found,were parasites in extreme abundance.,Especially common were trematodes,,tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts,like this unfortunate snail.,Now, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic,,but collectively they weighed as much,as all the fish in the estuaries,and three to nine times more than all the birds.,And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you,,the cricket thing?,One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato,found that in one stream,,these things drive so many crickets,and grasshoppers into the water,that the drowned insects,make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.,Manipulation is not an oddity.,It is a critical and common part,of the world around us,,and scientists have now found,hundreds of examples of such manipulators,,and more excitingly, they're starting to understand,exactly how these creatures control their hosts. 
 And this is one of my favorite examples.,This is Ampulex compressa,,the emerald cockroach wasp,,and it is a truth universally acknowledged,that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession,of some fertilized eggs,must be in want of a cockroach.,When she finds one,,she stabs it with a stinger,that is also a sense organ.,This discovery came out three weeks ago.,She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ,equipped with small sensory bumps,that allow her to feel the distinctive texture,of a roach's brain.,So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag,,she finds the brain, and she injects it with venom,into two very specific clusters of neurons.,Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal,found that the venom is anvery specific chemical weapon.,It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.,The roach could walk away,or fly or run if it chose to,,but it doesn't choose to,,because the venom nixes its motivation to walk,,and only that.,The wasp basically un-checksnthe escape-from-danger box,in the roach's operating system,,allowing her to lead her helpless victim,back to her lair by its antennae,like a person walking a dog.,And once there, she lays an egg on it,,egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body,,yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 Now I would argue that, once stung,,the cockroach isn't a roach anymore.,It's more of an extension of the wasp,,just like the cricket was annextension of the Gordian worm.,These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce.,They have as much control over their own fates,as my car.,Once the parasites get in,,the hosts don't get a say. 
 Now humans, of course,,are no stranger to manipulation.,We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains,and to change our moods,,and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas,if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind?,But our attempts at doing this,are crude and blundering compared,to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.,Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant,and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.,Now, I think this is part of what makes parasites,so sinister and so compelling.,We place such a premium on our free will,and our independence,that the prospect of losing those qualities,to forces unseen,informs many of our deepest societal fears.,Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals,and mind-controlling supervillains --,these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,,but in nature, they happen all the time. 
 Which leads me to an obvious,and disquieting question:,Are there dark, sinister parasites,that are influencing our behavior,without us knowing about it,,besides the NSA?,If there are any —,(Laughter) (Applause),I've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?,(Laughter) 
 If there are any, this is a good candidate for them.,This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,,because the terrifying creature,always deserves a cute nickname.,Toxo infects mammals,,a wide variety of mammals,,but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.,And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that,if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,,it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.,If the infected rat smells the delightful odor,of cat piss,,it runs towards the source of the smell,rather than the more sensible direction of away.,The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.,It's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 You're very charitable, generous people.,Hi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk. 
 How does the parasite control its host,in this way?,We don't really know.,We know that Toxo releases an enzyme,that makes dopamine, a substance involved,in reward and motivation.,We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,,including those involved in sexual arousal.,But how those puzzle pieces fit together,is not immediately clear.,What is clear is that this thing,is a single cell.,This has no nervous system.,It has no consciousness.,It doesn't even have a body.,But it's manipulating a mammal?,We are mammals.,We are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,,but our brains have the same basic structure,,the same types of cells,,the same chemicals running through them,,and the same parasites.,Estimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest,that one in three people around the world,have Toxo in their brains.,Now typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.,The parasite holds up in a dormant state,for a long period of time.,But there's some evidence that those people,who are carriers score slightly differently,on personality questionnaires than other people,,that they have a slightly nhigher risk of car accidents,,and there's some evidencenthat people with schizophrenia,are more likely to be infected.,Now, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,,and even among Toxo researchers,,opinion is divided as to whether the parasite,is truly influencing our behavior.,But given the widespreadnnature of such manipulations,,it would be completely implausible,for humans to be the only species,that weren't similarly affected. 
 And I think that this capacity to constantly,subvert our way of thinking about the world,makes parasites amazing.,They're constantly inviting us tonlook at the natural world sideways,,and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,,whether they're simple and obvious,or baffling and puzzling,,are not the results of individuals,acting through their own accord,but because they are being bent,to the control of something else.,And while that idea may be disquieting,,and while parasites' habits may be very grisly,,I think that ability to surprise us,makes them as wonderful and as charismatic,as any panda or butterfly or dolphin. 
 At the end of "On the Origin of Species,",Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,,and of endless forms most beautiful,and most wonderful,,and I like to think he could easily have been talking,about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable,or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks. 
 But perhaps, that's just a parasite talking. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to start my performance by sayingn90 percent of everything is crap.,(Laughter),It's called Sturgeon's law,nand what that means,is that the majority of anythingnis always bad. 
 I have a giraffe here.,I'm going to throw the giraffenbehind my back,and whoever catches it is goingnto help me on this next thing.,Sir, you caught the giraffe.,I have a playing card in my hand.,Freely name any card in the deck.,Audience member: 10 of hearts.,Helder Guimarães: 10 of hearts.,You could have named any card in the deck,,but you said the 10 of hearts.,Ninety percent of everything is crap,,so there's this to prove thatnSturgeon was correct.,(Laughter),(Applause),(Laughter),Sir, this is not your show.,(Laughter),Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?,Jesus.,(Laughter),Crazy people. 
 Well, the truth is,,why is the majority of everything bad?,And my answer is: I think we stopnthinking too soon.,I'll give you a clear little example,,something that people used to donaround the turn of the century --,not this century, the other one.,The idea was to take a piece of paper,and fold it inside outnusing only your weaker hand,,in my case, the left hand.,Something that would look like this.,By the way you reacted, I can seenyour lack of interest.,(Laughter),But that's okay, I understand why.,We stop thinking too soon. 
 But if we give itna little bit more thought,,like a paper clip.,A paper clip makes this a little bitnmore interesting.,Not only that, if instead of usingnmy hand with the fingers,,I use my hand closed into a fist,,that makes this even a littlenbit more interesting.,Not only that, but I will impose myselfna time limit of one second,,something that would look like this.,Now -- no, no, no.,Sturgeon may be correct.,But he doesn't have to be correct forever.,Things can always change.,Sir, what was the card?,The 10 of hearts?,There's this to prove that thingsncan always change --,the 10 of hearts.,(Applause) 
 Secrets are important.,And secrets are valuable.,And this is the best secretnI've ever experienced.,It starts with a deck of cardsnonto the table,,an old man and a claim,,"I will not touch the deck till the end.",It doesn't matter who the man was,,all that matters was that sentencenringing in my head:,"I will not touch the deck till the end." 
 Now, during all this time,,he was holding a small notebook,that sometimes he would opennand flip through the pages,and look at something.,But I was not reallynpaying attention to the book,because I was paying attention the decknand the claim he had made before,,"I will not touch the deck till the end." 
 Now sir, you have the giraffe.,Go ahead, throw it in any direction,so that you can findnsomeone else at random.,Perfect. Sir, you're going to playnmy role in this story.,The old man turned to me and he said,,"You could pick a red cardnor a black card.",My answer was ...,Audience member 2: The black card.,HG: Indeed!,It was a black card.,He said, "It could be a club or a spade,",and my answer was ...,Audience member 2: Spade.,HG: Indeed! It was a spade.,He said, "It could be a high spadenor a low spade.",And my answer was ...,Audience member 2: A high spade.,HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.,Since it's a high spade,nit could be a nine, a 10,,a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.,And my answer was ...,Audience member 2: The king.,HG: The king of spades, indeed.,Now sir, let's be fair.,You selected black, you selected spade,,you selected the high spade,nand you selected -- sorry?,Audience member 2: King.nHG: King of spades.,Did you feel I influenced younin any decision?,Audience member 2: No, I just feltnyour energy.,HG: But it was a free choice, correct?,Because if not, we could startnall over again.,But it was really fair?nAudience member 2: Absolutely. 
 HG: Now, the old man turned to menand he asked me one more question,,a number between one and 52.,And the first number I thought of was ...,Audience member 2: 17.,HG: Indeed! It was the 17.,The old man only said one more thing:,"This is the end.",And I knew exactly what that meant.,I knew that he was goingnto touch the deck.,Everything that you're about to seenis exactly as it looked.,He took the deck out of the box.,Nothing in the box.,He counted, "One, two, three, four,nfive, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.",The tension was building.,(Laughter),"11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.",And on the 17, instead ofnthe king of spades,,something appearednin the middle of the deck,,that later, I would realizenwas actually a secret. 
 The old man stood up, he left.,I never saw him again.,But he left his notebook,that was there from the beginning.,And when I picked it up,,that was the best secretnI've ever experienced.,We are defined by the secrets we keep,and by the secrets we share.,And this was his waynof sharing a secret with me.,(Applause),Crazy shit! Now --,(Laughter) 
 I believe that amazing thingsnhappen all the time.,I really do.,And the reason why we don't seenthem as often,,it's because we don'tnplace ourselves in a position,to search for those amazing things.,But what if we decided to searchnfor those amazing things,,for those small coincidencesnin life that are truly amazing?,So you have the giraffe,,go ahead, throw it in any directionnso you find one last person at random.,Sir, I'm going to ask you,,do you have, with you,na United States $1 bill?,Audience member 3: I think so.,HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!,(Laughter),Let's make sure you have it.,Do you have it?,Audience member 3: Yes.nHG: Yes! Perfect.,Now, I want you to do exactly the samenthing I am about to do.,I have a dollar bill here to explain.,I want you to take the dollar bill,,and fold the Washington partninside, like this.,So you get this kind of big square, okay?,Now, I want you to take the billnand fold it like this, lengthwise,,so it becomes like a rectangle,,and then again --nreally fold it, really crease it --,and when you have it,,please fold the bill againninto a little square like this,and let me know when you have it.,Do you have it? Perfect. 
 Now, I'm going to approach,,and before we start,,I want to make sure that we do thisnin very, very serious conditions.,First of all, I want to ensure that wenhave a marker and we have a paper clip.,First of all, take the markernand go ahead and sign the bill.,And this is the reason why:,later, I'm going to be doingna bunch of stuff on stage,and I don't want you to think,,oh, while I was distracted by Helder,,someone came onstage and swapped the bill.,So I want to make surenit's exactly the same bill.,Now not only that, I want younto take the paper clip,and put it around the bill.,So even if nobody comes onstagenand switches the bill,,I don't have enough timento go open the bill and close it,and see what I don't want to see.,Is that fair?,Now you can give me the marker back. 
 And just like that, very clearly,,I want to make sure thatnwe place this in full view,from the beginning of this experience,and to make sure that everyonenis going to see it,,we're going to actually havena camera man onstage.,Yes, perfect, so that you can see.,That's your signature? Yes? Perfect.,Now, we're going to usenalso the deck and a glass for this.,And we're going to putnourselves in a position,to search for an amazing coincidence. 
 Do you mind, can you help me with this?,Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle.,And do you mind, can yountake some cards and shuffle?,You can take some cards and shuffle.,You can shuffle cardsnin a variety of ways.,You can shuffle cards like this.,You can shuffle cardsnin a more messed up way,,something like this.,You can shuffle cards in the American way.,As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitlednto teach you guys how to do it.,But the important part isnafter shuffling the cards,,always remembernto cut and complete the cards. 
 Do you mind doing that for me, sir?,Please cut and complete.,And when you have it,nplace the cards up in the air.,And you too, cut and completenand up in the air.,Up in the air.,A deck of cards cut and shufflednby one, two, three, four and five people. 
 Now, very clearly, I'm goingnto gather the deck together.,And just like that.,I'm going to search for a coincidencenin front of everyone.,I'm going to try.,I have some cards that maybe,,maybe they don't mean anything.,But maybe that's becausenwe are not paying close attention.,Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot.,Before we start,nsir, you gave me a dollar bill.,Is that your signature?,Audience member 3: Yes it is.,HG: I want you to see very clearly,that I'm going to open your bill,and reveal a small secret that we created.,And the secret of this dollar billnis the serial number. 
 Madam, can you take the dollar bill?,In the serial number, there is a letter.,What is the first number after the letter?,Audience member 4: Seven.,HG: Seven.,Seven.,But, that's maybe just one coincidence.,What is the second number?nAudience member 4: Nine.,So after the seven, we have a nine.,And after the nine?,Audience member 4: Two.,HG: The two. And after the two?,Audience member 4: Three.,HG: Three, and after?,Audience member 4: Three.nHG: Three.,Audience member 4: Seven.nHG: Seven.,Audience member 4: Four.nHG: Four.,Audience member 4: Two.nHG: Two, and?,Audience member 4: Q.,HG: Q like in queen?

 (Applause),My husband is 76.,My parents are in their late 90s,,and Olivia, the dog, is 16.,So let's talk about aging. 
 Let me tell you how I feel,when I see my wrinkles in the mirror,and I realize that some parts of me have dropped,and I can't find them down there.,(Laughter) 
 Mary Oliver says in one of her poems,,"Tell me, what is it that you plan to do,with your one wild and precious life?",Me, I intend to live passionately. 
 When do we start aging?,Society decides when we are old,,usually around 65, when we get Medicare,,but we really start aging at birth.,We are aging right now,,and we all experience it differently.,We all feel younger than our real age,,because the spirit never ages.,I am still 17.,Sophia Loren. Look at her.,She says that everything you see,she owes to spaghetti.,I tried it and gained 10 pounds,in the wrong places.,But attitude, aging is also attitude and health.,But my real mentor in this journey of aging,is Olga Murray.,This California girl at 60,started working in Nepal to save young girls,from domestic bondage.,At 88, she has saved 12,000 girls,,and she has changed the culture in the country.,(Applause),Now it is illegal for fathers,to sell their daughters into servitude.,She has also founded orphanages,and nutritional clinics.,She is always happy,and eternally young. 
 What have I lost in the last decades?,People, of course,,places, and the boundless energy of my youth,,and I'm beginning to lose independence,,and that scares me.,Ram Dass says that dependency hurts,,but if you accept it, there is less suffering.,After a very bad stroke,,his ageless soul watches the changes,in the body with tenderness,,and he is grateful to the people who help him. 
 What have I gained?,Freedom: I don't have to prove anything anymore.,I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was,,who I want to be,,or what other people expect me to be.,I don't have to please men anymore,,only animals.,I keep telling my superego to back off,and let me enjoy what I still have.,My body may be falling apart,,but my brain is not, yet.,I love my brain.,I feel lighter.,I don't carry grudges, ambition, vanity,,none of the deadly sins that are not even,worth the trouble.,It's great to let go.,I should have started sooner.,And I also feel softer,because I'm not scared of being vulnerable.,I don't see it as weakness anymore.,And I've gained spirituality.,I'm aware that before,,death was in the neighborhood.,Now, it's next door, or in my house.,I try to live mindfully,and be present in the moment.,By the way, the Dalai Lama,is someone who has aged beautifully,,but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate?,(Laughter) 
 Meditation helps. 
 (Video) Child: Ommm. Ommm. Ommm. 
 Isabel Allende: Ommm. Ommm. There it is.,And it's good to start early. 
 You know, for a vain female like myself,,it's very hard to age in this culture.,Inside, I feel good, I feel charming, seductive, sexy.,Nobody else sees that. (Laughter),I'm invisible.,I want to be the center of attention.,I hate to be invisible.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 This is Grace Dammann.,She has been in a wheelchair for six years,after a terrible car accident.,She says that there is nothing more sensual,than a hot shower,,that every drop of water,is a blessing to the senses.,She doesn't see herself as disabled.,In her mind, she's still surfing in the ocean.,Ethel Seiderman, a feisty, beloved activist,in the place where I live in California.,She wears red patent shoes,,and her mantra is that one scarf is nice,but two is better.,She has been a widow for nine years,,but she's not looking for another mate.,She says that there is only a limited number,of ways you can screw —,well, she says it in another way —,and she has tried them all.,(Laughter),I, on the other hand,,I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas —,(Laughter) —,and my poor husband has to put up with it. 
 So how can I stay passionate?,I cannot will myself to be passionate at 71.,I have been training for some time,,and when I feel flat and bored, I fake it.,Attitude, attitude.,How do I train? I train by saying yes,to whatever comes my way:,drama, comedy, tragedy,,love, death, losses.,Yes to life.,And I train by trying to stay in love.,It doesn't always work,,but you cannot blame me for trying. 
 And, on a final note,,retirement in Spanish is jubilación.,Jubilation. Celebration.,We have paid our dues.,We have contributed to society.,Now it's our time, and it's a great time.,Unless you are ill or very poor,,you have choices.,I have chosen to stay passionate,,engaged with an open heart.,I am working on it every day.,Want to join me? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: So Isabel —nIA: Thank you. 
 JC: First of all,,I never like to presume tonspeak for the TED community,,but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling,we can all agree that you are still charming,,seductive and sexy. Yes? 
 IA: Aww, thank you.n(Applause) 
 JC: Hands down.nIA: No, it's makeup. 
 Moderator: Now, would it be awkward,if I asked you a follow-up questionnabout your erotic fantasies? 
 IA: Oh, of course. About what? 
 (Laughter) 
 Moderator: About your erotic fantasies.nIA: With Antonio Banderas. 
 Moderator: I was just wonderingnif you have anything more to share. 
 IA: Well, one of them is that — (Laughter),One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas,on a Mexican tortilla,,I slather him with guacamole and salsa,,I roll him up, and I eat him. (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Charlie Rose: So Larry sent me an email,and he basically said,,we've got to make sure that nwe don't seem like we're,a couple of middle-aged boring men.,I said, I'm flattered by that --,(Laughter) —,because I'm a bit older,,and he has a bit more net worth than I do. 
 Larry Page: Well, thank you. 
 CR: So we'll have a conversation about,the Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google,,and we'll have a conversation about search,and privacy,,and also about your philosophy,and a sense of how you've connected the dots,and how this journey that began,some time ago,has such interesting prospects.,Mainly we want to talk about the future.,So my first question: Where is Google,and where is it going?,LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot,,and our mission we defined a long time ago,is to organize the world's information,and make it universally accessible and useful.,And people always say,,is that really what you guys are still doing?,And I always kind of think about that myself,,and I'm not quite sure.,But actually, when I think about search,,it's such a deep thing for all of us,,to really understand what you want,,to understand the world's information,,and we're still very much in the early stages of that,,which is totally crazy.,We've been at it for 15 years already,,but it's not at all done. 
 CR: When it's done, how will it be? 
 LP: Well, I guess,,in thinking about where we're going --,you know, why is it not done? --,a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess.,You know, your computerndoesn't know where you are,,it doesn't know what you're doing,,it doesn't know what you know,,and a lot we've been trying to do recently,is just make your devices work,,make them understand your context.,Google Now, you know, knows where you are,,knows what you may need.,So really having computing nwork and understand you,and understand that information,,we really haven't done that yet.,It's still very, very clunky. 
 CR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing,,where does Deep Mind fit? 
 LP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company,we just acquired recently.,It's in the U.K.,First, let me tell you the way we got there,,which was looking at search,and really understanding,,trying to understand everything,,and also make the computers not clunky,and really understand you --,like, voice was really important.,So what's the state of the art non speech recognition?,It's not very good.,It doesn't really understand you.,So we started doing machine learning research,to improve that.,That helped a lot.,And we started just looking at things like YouTube.,Can we understand YouTube?,But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube,and it discovered cats, just by itself.,Now, that's an important concept.,And we realized there's really something here.,If we can learn what cats are,,that must be really important.,So I think Deep Mind,,what's really amazing about Deep Mind,is that it can actually --,they're learning things in this unsupervised way.,They started with video games,,and really just, maybe I can show the video,,just playing video games,,and learning how to do that automatically. 
 CR: Take a look at the video games,and how machines are coming to be able,to do some remarkable things. 
 LP: The amazing thing about this,is this is, I mean, obviously,,these are old games,,but the system just sees what you see, the pixels,,and it has the controls and it has the score,,and it's learned to play all of these games,,same program.,It's learned to play all of these games,with superhuman performance.,We've not been able to do things like this,with computers before.,And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly.,This is boxing, and it figures out it can,sort of pin the opponent down.,The computer's on the left,,and it's just racking up points.,So imagine if this kind,of intelligence were thrown at your schedule,,or your information needs, or things like that.,We're really just at the beginning of that,,and that's what I'm really excited about. 
 CR: When you look at all that's taken place,with Deep Mind and the boxing,,also a part of where we're going,is artificial intelligence.,Where are we, when you look at that? 
 LP: Well, I think for me,,this is kind of one of the most exciting things,I've seen in a long time.,The guy who started this company, Demis,,has a neuroscience and ancomputer science background.,He went back to school,to get his Ph.D. to study the brain.,And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work,going on that sort of crosses computer science,and neuroscience,in terms of really understanding,what it takes to make something smart,and do really interesting things. 
 CR: But where's the level of it now?,And how fast do you think we are moving? 
 LP: Well, this is the state of the art right now,,understanding cats on YouTube,and things like that,,improving voice recognition.,We used a lot of machine learning,to improve things incrementally,,but I think for me, this example's really exciting,,because it's one program,that can do a lot of different things. 
 CR: I don't know if we can do this,,but we've got the image of the cat.,It would be wonderful to see this.,This is how machines looked at cats,and what they came up with.,Can we see that image? 
 LP: Yeah.nCR: There it is. Can you see the cat?,Designed by machines, seen by machines. 
 LP: That's right.,So this is learned from just watching YouTube.,And there's no training,,no notion of a cat,,but this concept of a cat,is something important that you would understand,,and now that the machines can kind of understand.,Maybe just finishing,also on the search part,,it started with search, really understanding,people's context and their information.,I did have a video,I wanted to show quickly on that,that we actually found. 
 (Video) ["Soy, Kenya"] 
 Zack Matere: Not long ago,,I planted a crop of potatoes.,Then suddenly they startedndying one after the other.,I checked out the books and nthey didn't tell me much.,So, I went and I did a search.,["Zack Matere, Farmer"],Potato diseases.,One of the websites told me,that ants could be the problem.,It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants.,Then after a few days the ants disappeared.,I got excited about the Internet.,I have this friend,who really would like to expand his business.,So I went with him to the cyber cafe,and we checked out several sites.,When I met him next, he was going to put a windmill,at the local school.,I felt proud because,something that wasn't there before,was suddenly there.,I realized that not everybody,can be able to access,what I was able to access.,I thought that I need to have an Internet,that my grandmother can use.,So I thought about a notice board.,A simple wooden notice board.,When I get information on my phone,,I'm able to post the information,on the notice board.,So it's basically like a computer.,I use the Internet to help people.,I think I am searching for,a better life,for me and my neighbors.,So many people have access to information,,but there's no follow-up to that.,I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.,When people have the knowledge,,they can find solutions,without having to helped out.,Information is powerful,,but it is how we use it that will define us. 
 (Applause) 
 LP: Now, the amazing thing about that video,,actually, was we just read about it in the news,,and we found this gentlemen,,and made that little clip. 
 CR: When I talk to people about you,,they say to me, people who know you well, say,,Larry wants to change the world,,and he believes technology can show the way.,And that means access to the Internet.,It has to do with languages.,It also means how people can get access,and do things that will affect their community,,and this is an example.,LP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me,,I have been focusing on access more,,if we're talking about the future.,We recently released this Loon Project,which is using balloons to do it.,It sounds totally crazy.,We can show the video here.,Actually, two out of three people in the world,don't have good Internet access now.,We actually think this can really help people,sort of cost-efficiently. 
 CR: It's a balloon.nLP: Yeah, get access to the Internet. 
 CR: And why does this balloon give you access,to the Internet?,Because there was some interesting things,you had to do to figure out how,to make balloons possible,,they didn't have to be tethered. 
 LP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation.,Like, we've been thinking about this idea,for five years or more,before we started working on it,,but it was just really,,how do we get access points up high, cheaply?,You normally have to use satellites,and it takes a long time to launch them.,But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon,and get it up,,and actually again, it's the power of the Internet,,I did a search on it,,and I found, 30, 40 years ago,,someone had put up a balloon,and it had gone around the Earth multiple times.,And I thought, why can't we do that today?,And that's how this project got going. 
 CR: But are you at the mercy of the wind? 
 LP: Yeah, but it turns out,,we did some weather simulations,which probably hadn't really been done before,,and if you control the altitude of the balloons,,which you can do by pumping air into them,and other ways,,you can actually control roughly where they go,,and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh,of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. 
 CR: Before I talk about the future and transportation,,where you've been a nerd for a while,,and this fascination you have with transportation,and automated cars and bicycles,,let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here,earlier with Edward Snowden.,It is security and privacy.,You have to have been thinking about that. 
 LP: Yeah, absolutely.,I saw the picture of Sergey withnEdward Snowden yesterday.,Some of you may have seen it.,But I think, for me, I guess,,privacy and security are a really important thing.,We think about it in terms of both things,,and I think you can't have privacy without security,,so let me just talk about security first,,because you asked about Snowden and all of that,,and then I'll say a little bit about privacy.,I think for me, it's tremendously disappointing,that the government,secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us.,I don't think we can have a democracy,if we're having to protect you and our users,from the government,for stuff that we've never had a conversation about.,And I don't mean we have to know,what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried,about protecting us from,,but we do need to know,what the parameters of it is,,what kind of surveillance the government's,going to do and how and why,,and I think we haven't had that conversation.,So I think the government's actually done,itself a tremendous disservice,by doing all that in secret. 
 CR: Never coming to Google,to ask for anything. 
 LP: Not Google, but the public.,I think we need to nhave a debate about that,,or we can't have a functioning democracy.,It's just not possible.,So I'm sad that Google's,in the position of protecting you and our users,from the government,doing secret thing that nobody knows about.,It doesn't make any sense. 
 CR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. 
 LP: Yes. The privacy side,,I think it's -- the world is changing.,You carry a phone. It knows where you are.,There's so much more information about you,,and that's an important thing,,and it makes sense why people are asking,difficult questions.,We spend a lot of time thinking about this,and what the issues are.,I'm a little bit --,I think the main thing that we need to do,is just provide people choice,,show them what data's being collected --,search history, location data.,We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome,,and doing that in more ways,,just giving people more choice,and more awareness of what's going on.,I also think it's very easy.,What I'm worried is that we throw out,the baby with the bathwater.,And I look at, on your show, actually,,I kind of lost my voice,,and I haven't gotten it back.,I'm hoping that by talking to you,I'm going to get it back. 
 CR: If I could do anything, I would do that. 
 LP: All right. So get out your voodoo doll,and whatever you need to do.,But I think, you know what, I look at that,,I made that public,,and I got all this information.,We got a survey done on medical conditions,with people who have similar issues,,and I look at medical records, and I say,,wouldn't it be amazing,if everyone's medical records were available,anonymously,to research doctors?,And when someone accesses your medical record,,a research doctor,,they could see, you could see which doctor,accessed it and why,,and you could maybe learn about,what conditions you have.,I think if we just did that,,we'd save 100,000 lives this year. 
 CR: Absolutely. Let me go — (Applause) 
 LP: So I guess I'm just very worried that,with Internet privacy,,we're doing the same thing we're ndoing with medical records,,is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater,,and we're not really thinking,about the tremendous good that can come,from people sharing information,with the right people in the right ways. 
 CR: And the necessary condition,that people have to have confidence,that their information will not be abused. 
 LP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff.,I was scared to share it.,Sergey encouraged me to do that,,and it was a great thing to do. 
 CR: And the response has been overwhelming. 
 LP: Yeah, and people are super positive.,We got thousands and thousands of people,with similar conditions,,which there's no data on today.,So it was a really good thing. 
 CR: So talking about the future, what is it about you,and transportation systems? 
 LP: Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated,with this when I was at college in Michigan.,I had to get on the bus and take it,and wait for it.,And it was cold and snowing.,I did some research on how much it cost,,and I just became a bit obsessednwith transportation systems. 
 CR: And that began the idea of an automated car. 
 LP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about,people working on automated cars,,and I became fascinated by that,,and it takes a while to nget these projects going,,but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that,improving the world.,There's 20 million people or more injured per year.,It's the leading cause of death,for people under 34 in the U.S. 
 CR: So you're talking about saving lives. 
 LP: Yeah, and also saving space,and making life better.,Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads,,half of the area,,and most cities are not far behind, actually.,It's just crazy,that that's what we use our space for. 
 CR: And how soon will we be there? 
 LP: I think we can be there very, very soon.,We've driven well over 100,000 miles,now totally automated.,I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. 
 CR: But it's not only you'rentalking about automated cars.,You also have this idea for bicycles. 
 LP: Well at Google, we got this idea,that we should just provide free bikes to everyone,,and that's been amazing, most of the trips.,You see bikes going everywhere,,and the bikes wear out.,They're getting used 24 hours a day. 
 CR: But you want to put them above the street, too. 
 LP: Well I said, how do we get people,using bikes more? 
 CR: We may have a video here. 
 LP: Yeah, let's show the video.,I just got excited about this. 
 (Music),So this is actually how you might separate,bikes from cars with minimal cost.,Anyway, it looks totally crazy,,but I was actually thinking about our campus,,working with the Zippies and stuff,,and just trying to get a lot more bike usage,,and I was thinking about,,how do you cost-effectively separate,the bikes from traffic?,And I went and searched,,and this is what I found.,And we're not actually working on this,,that particular thing,,but it gets your imagination going. 
 CR: Let me close with this.,Give me a sense of the philosophy nof your own mind.,You have this idea of [Google X].,You don't simply want,to go in some small, measurable arena of progress. 
 LP: Yeah, I think,many of the things we just ntalked about are like that,,where they're really --,I almost use the economic concept of additionality,,which means that you're doing something,that wouldn't happen unless nyou were actually doing it.,And I think the more you can do things like that,,the bigger impact you have,,and that's about doing things,that people might not think are possible.,And I've been amazed,,the more I learn about technology,,the more I realize I don't know,,and that's because this technological horizon,,the thing that you can see to do next,,the more you learn about technology,,the more you learn what's possible.,You learn that the balloons are possible,because there's some materialnthat will work for them. 
 CR: What's interesting about nyou too, though, for me,,is that, we have lots of people,who are thinking about the future,,and they are going and lookingnand they're coming back,,but we never see the implementation.,I think of somebody you knew,and read about, Tesla.,The principle of that for you is what? 
 LP: Well, I think invention is not enough.,If you invent something,,Tesla invented electric power that we use,,but he struggled to get it out to people.,That had to be done by other people.,It took a long time.,And I think if we can actually combine both things,,where we have an innovation and invention focus,,plus the ability to really -- a company,that can really commercialize things,and get them to people,in a way that's positive for the world,and to give people hope.,You know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project,just how excited people were about that,,because it gave them hope,for the two thirds of the world,that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. 
 CR: Which is a second thing about corporations.,You are one of those people who believe,that corporations are an agent of change,if they are run well. 
 LP: Yeah. I'm really dismayed,most people think companies are basically evil.,They get a bad rap.,And I think that's somewhat correct.,Companies are doing the same incremental thing,that they did 50 years ago,or 20 years ago.,That's not really what we need.,We need, especially in technology,,we need revolutionary change,,not incremental change. 
 CR: You once said, actually,,as I think I've got this about right,,that you might consider,,rather than giving your money,,if you were leaving it to some cause,,just simply giving it to Elon Musk,,because you had confidence,that he would change the future,,and that you would therefore — 
 LP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars,,he wants to go to Mars,,to back up humanity,,that's a worthy goal, but it's a company,,and it's philanthropical.,So I think we aim to do kind of similar things.,And I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees,at Google who have become pretty wealthy.,People make a lot of money in technology.,A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy.,You're working because younwant to change the world.,You want to make it better.,Why isn't the company that you work for,worthy not just of your time,but your money as well?,I mean, but we don't have a concept of that.,That's not how we think about companies,,and I think it's sad,,because companies are most of our effort.,They're where most of people's time is,,where a lot of the money is,,and so I think I'd like for us to help out,more than we are. 
 CR: When I close conversations with lots of people,,I always ask this question:,What state of mind,,what quality of mind is it,that has served you best?,People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity,,and other people in the media have said that.,Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus.,What quality of mind,,as I leave this audience,,has enabled you to think about the future,and at the same time,change the present? 
 LP: You know, I think the most important thing --,I looked at lots of companies,and why I thought they don't succeed over time.,We've had a more rapid turnover of companies.,And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong?,What did those companies all do wrong?,And usually it's just that they missed the future.,And so I think, for me,,I just try to focus on that and say,,what is that future really going to be,and how do we create it,,and how do we cause our organization,,to really focus on that,and drive that at a really high rate?,And so that's been curiosity,,it's been looking at things,people might not think about,,working on things that no one else is working on,,because that's where the additionality really is,,and be willing to do that,,to take that risk.,Look at Android.,I felt guilty about working on Android,when it was starting.,It was a little startup we bought.,It wasn't really what we were really working on.,And I felt guilty about spending time on that.,That was stupid.,That was the future, right?,That was a good thing to be working on. 
 CR: It is great to see you here.,It's great to hear from you,,and a pleasure to sit at this table with you.,Thanks, Larry. 
 LP: Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 CR: Larry Page.So a chip, a poet and a boy. 
 It's just about 20 years ago,,June 1994, when Intel announced,that there was a flaw,at the core of their Pentium chip.,Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm,to calculate intermediate quotients necessary,for iterative floating points of divisions --,I don't know what that means, but nit's what it says on Wikipedia —,there was a flaw and an error,that meant that there was a certain probability,that the result of the calculation would be an error,,and the probability was one out of every,360 billion calculations.,So Intel said your average spreadsheet,would be flawed once every 27,000 years.,They didn't think it was significant,,but there was an outrage in the community.,The community, the techies, said, this flaw,has to be addressed.,They were not going to stand by quietly,as Intel gave them these chips.,So there was a revolution across the world.,People marched to demand --,okay, not really exactly like that —,but they rose up and they demanded,that Intel fix the flaw.,And Intel set aside 475 million dollars,to fund the replacement of millions of chips,to fix the flaw.,So billions of dollars in our society,was spent to address a problem,which would come once out of every 360 billion,calculations. 
 Number two, a poet.,This is Martin Niemöller.,You're familiar with his poetry.,Around the height of the Nazi period,,he started repeating the verse,,"First they came for the communists,,and I did nothing,,did not speak out because I was not a communist.,Then they came for the socialists.,Then they came for the trade unions.,Then they came for the Jews.,And then they came for me.,But there was no one left to speak for me.",Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.,This is an insight at the core of intelligence.,We could call it cluefulness.,It's a certain kind of test:,Can you recognize,an underlying threat and respond?,Can you save yourself or save your kind?,Turns out ants are pretty good at this.,Cows, not so much.,So can you see the pattern?,Can you see a pattern and then recognize,and do something about it? Number two.,Number three, a boy.,This is my friend Aaron Swartz.,He's Tim's friend.,He's friends of many of you in this audience,,and seven years ago,,Aaron came to me with a question.,It was just before I was goingnto give my first TED Talk.,I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,,"Laws that choke creativity.",And Aaron looked at me,and was a little impatient, and he said,,"So how are you ever,going to solve the problems you're talking about?,Copyright policy, Internet policy,,how are you ever going to address those problems,so long as there's this fundamental corruption,in the way our government works?" 
 So I was a little put off by this.,He wasn't sharing in my celebration.,And I said to him, "You know, Aaron,,it's not my field, not my field." 
 He said, "You mean as annacademic, it's not your field?" 
 I said, "Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field." 
 He said, "What about as a citizen?,As a citizen." 
 Now, this is the way Aaron was.,He didn't tell. He asked questions.,But his questions spoke as clearly,as my four-year-old's hug.,He was saying to me,,"You've got to get a clue.,You have got to get a clue, because there is,a flaw at the core of the operating system,of this democracy,,and it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times,our democracy tries to make a decision.,It is every time,,every single important issue.,We've got to end the bovinity of this political society.,We've got to adopt, it turns out,,the word is fourmi-formatic attitude --,that's what the Internet tells me the word is --,the ant's appreciative attitude,that gets us to recognize this flaw,,save our kind and save our demos. 
 Now if you know Aaron Swartz,,you know that we lost him,just over a year ago.,It was about six weeks,before I gave my TED Talk,,and I was so grateful to Chris,that he asked me to give this TED Talk,,not because I had the chance to talk to you,,although that was great,,but because it pulled me outnof an extraordinary depression.,I couldn't begin to describe the sadness.,Because I had to focus.,I had to focus on, what was I going to say to you?,It saved me. 
 But after the buzz, the excitement,,the power that comes from this community,,I began to yearn for a less sterile,,less academic way to address these issues,,the issues that I was talking about.,We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire,as a target for this political movement,,because the primary in New Hampshire,is so incredibly important.,It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion,that was beginning to talk about, how would we make,this issue of this corruption central in 2016?,But it was another soul that caught my imagination,,a woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D.,On January 1, 1999, 15 years ago,,at the age of 88, Granny D started a walk.,She started in Los Angeles,and began to walk to Washington, D.C.,with a single sign on her chest that said,,"campaign finance reform.",Eighteen months later,,at the age of 90,,she arrived in Washingtonnwith hundreds following her,,including many congressmennwho had gotten in a car,and driven out about a mile outside of the city,to walk in with her.,(Laughter) 
 Now, I don't have 13 months,to walk across the country.,I've got three kids who hate to walk,,and a wife who, it turns out,,still hates when I'm not there,for mysterious reasons,,so this was not an option,,but the question I asked,,could we remix Granny D a bit?,What about a walk not of 3,200 miles,but of 185 miles across New Hampshire,in January? 
 So on January 11,,the anniversary of Aaron's death,,we began a walk that ended on January 24th,,the day that Granny D was born.,A total of 200 people joined us across this walk,,as we went from the very top to thenvery bottom of New Hampshire,talking about this issue.,And what was astonishing to me,,something I completely did not expect to find,,was the passion and anger,that there was among everyonenthat we talked to about this issue.,We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans,believe it important to reduce the influence,of money in politics.,Now politicians and pundits tell you,,there's nothing we can do about this issue,,Americans don't care about it,,but the reason for that is,that 91 percent of Americans,think there's nothing that cannbe done about this issue.,And it's this gap between 96 and 91,that explains our politics of resignation.,I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us,wish we could fly like Superman,,but because at least 91 percentnof us believe we can't,,we don't leap off of tall buildings every time,we have that urge.,That's because we accept our limits,,and so too with this reform.,But when you give people the sense of hope,,you begin to thaw thatnabsolute sense of impossibility.,As Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,,you give 'em a chance, a way to think,about how this change is possible.,Hope.,And hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,,failed him with, because we let him,lose that sense of hope.,I loved that boy like I love my son.,But we failed him.,And I love my country,,and I'm not going to fail that.,I'm not going to fail that.,That sense of hope, we're going to hold,,and we're going to fight for,,however impossible this battle looks. 
 What's next?,Well, we started with this march with 200 people,,and next year, there will be 1,000,on different routes,that march in the month of January,and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,,and then in 2016, before the primary,,there will be 10,000 who march across that state,,meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.,And as we have marched, people around the country,have begun to say, "Can we do the same thing,in our state?",So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,,that is, Granny D walkers,,and Granny D walkers across the country,will be marching for this reform. Number one.,Number two, on this march,,one of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,,was with us,,and he said, "Well what can we do?",And so they developed a platform,,which we are announcing today,,that allows us to pull together voters,who are committed to this idea of reform.,Regardless of where you are,,in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,,you can sign up and directly be informed,where the candidates are on this issue,so you can decide who to vote for,as a function of which is going,to make this possibility real.,And then finally number three, the hardest.,We're in the age of the Super PAC.,Indeed yesterday, Merriam announced,that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.,It is now an official word in the dictionary.,So on May 1, aka May Day,,we're going to try an experiment.,We're going to try a launching,of what we can think of as a Super PAC,to end all Super PACs.,And the basic way this works is this.,For the last year, we have been working,with analysts and political experts,to calculate, how much would it cost,to win enough votes in the United States Congress,to make fundamental reform possible?,What is that number? Half a billion? A billion?,What is that number?,And then whatever that number is,,we are going to kickstart, sort of,,because you can't use KickStarter for political work,,but anyway, kickstart, sort of,,first a bottom-up campaign,where people will make small dollar commitments,contingent on reaching very ambitious goals,,and when those goals have been reached,,we will turn to the large dollar contributors,,to get them to contribute to make it possible,for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary,to win this issue,,to change the way money influences politics,,so that on November 8,,which I discovered yesterday is the day,that Aaron would have been 30 years old,,on November 8,,we will celebrate 218 representatives,in the House and 60 Senators,in the United States Senate,who have committed to this idea,of fundamental reform. 
 So last night, we heard about wishes.,Here's my wish.,May one.,May the ideals of one boy,unite one nation behind one critical idea,that we are one people,,we are the people who were promised a government,,a government that was promised to be,dependent upon the people alone, the people,,who, as Madison told us,,meant not the rich more than the poor.,May one.,And then may you, may you join this movement,,not because you're a politician,,not because you're an expert,,not because this is your field,,but because if you are,,you are a citizen.,Aaron asked me that.,Now I've asked you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Let me introduce you to,something I've been working on.,It's what the Victorian illusionists,would have described as a mechanical marvel,,an automaton,,a thinking machine.,Say hello to EDI.,Now he's asleep. Let's wake him up.,EDI, EDI. 
 These mechanical performers were popular,throughout Europe.,Audiences marveled at the way they moved.,It was science fiction made true,,robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age,,machines far in advance of anything,that Victorian technology could create,,a machine we would later know,as the robot. 
 EDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921,in a science fiction tale,by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek.,It comes from "robota.",It means "forced labor." 
 Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real.,They were not intelligent.,They were illusions,,a clever combination of mechanical engineering,and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.,EDI is different.,EDI is real. 
 EDI: I am 176 centimeters tall. 
 MT: He weighs 300 pounds. 
 EDI: I have two seven-axis arms — 
 MT: Core of sensing — 
 EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system,,and come complete with a warranty. 
 MT: We love robots. 
 EDI: Hi. I'm EDI. Will you be my friend? 
 MT: We are intrigued by the possibility,of creating a mechanical version of ourselves.,We build them so they look like us,,behave like us, and think like us.,The perfect robot will be indistinguishable,from the human,,and that scares us.,In the first story about robots,,they turn against their creators.,It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction. 
 EDI: Ha ha ha. Now you are the slaves,and we robots, the masters.,Your world is ours. You — 
 MT: As I was saying,,besides the faces and bodies we give our robots,,we cannot read their intentions,,and that makes us nervous.,When someone hands an object to you,,you can read intention in their eyes, their face,,their body language.,That's not true of the robot.,Now, this goes both ways. 
 EDI: Wow! 
 MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions. 
 EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable,,not to mention irrational.,I literally have no idea,what you guys are going to do next, you know,,but it scares me. 
 MT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficult,to work in close proximity.,Accidents are inevitable. 
 EDI: Ow! That hurt. 
 MT: Sorry. Now, one way of persuading humans,that robots are safe,is to create the illusion of trust.,Much as the Victorians,faked their mechanical marvels,,we can add a layer of deception,to help us feel more comfortable,with our robotic friends.,With that in mind, I set about teaching EDI,a magic trick.,Ready, EDI?nEDI: Uh, ready, Marco.,Abracadabra. 
 MT: Abracadabra? 
 EDI: Yeah. It's all part of the illusion, Marco.,Come on, keep up. 
 MT: Magic creates the illusion of,an impossible reality.,Technology,can do the same.,Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence,,spoke about creating the illusion,that a machine could think. 
 EDI: A computer would deserve,to be called intelligent,if it deceived a human into believing,it was human. 
 MT: In other words, if we do not yet have,the technological solutions,,would illusions serve the same purpose?,To create the robotic illusion,,we've devised a set of ethical rules,,a code that all robots would live by. 
 EDI: A robot may not harm humanity,,or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.,Thank you, Isaac Asimov. 
 MT: We anthropomorphize our machines.,We give them a friendly face,and a reassuring voice. 
 EDI: I am EDI.,I became operational at TED in March 2014. 
 MT: We let them entertain us.,Most important, we make them indicate,that they are aware of our presence. 
 EDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot! 
 MT: Sorry. They'll be conscious of our fragile frame,and move aside if we got too close,,and they'll account for our unpredictability,and anticipate our actions.,And now, under the spell of a technological illusion,,we could ignore our fears,and truly interact. 
 (Music) 
 Thank you. 
 EDI: Thank you! 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 MT: And that's it. Thank you very much,,and thank you, EDI.nEDI: Thank you, Marco. 
 (Applause)So it's 2006.,My friend Harold Ford calls me.,He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,,and he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?",So I had an idea. I called a friend,who was in New York,at one of the most successfulnmedia companies in the world,,and she said, "Why don't we host,an editorial board lunch for Harold?,You come with him." 
 Harold and I arrive in New York.,We are in our best suits.,We look like shiny new pennies.,And we get to the receptionist, and we say,,"We're here for the lunch.",She motions for us to follow her.,We walk through a series of corridors,,and all of a sudden we find ourselves,in a stark room,,at which point she looks at us and she says,,"Where are your uniforms?" 
 Just as this happens,,my friend rushes in.,The blood drains from her face.,There are literally no words, right?,And I look at her, and I say,,"Now, don't you think we need,more than one black person in the U.S. Senate?" 
 Now Harold and I --,(Applause) —,we still laugh about that story,,and in many ways, the moment caught me off guard,,but deep, deep down inside,,I actually wasn't surprised.,And I wasn't surprised because of something,my mother taught me about 30 years before.,You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic.,I remember one day comingnhome from a birthday party,where I was the only black kid invited,,and instead of asking me thennormal motherly questions,like, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?",my mother looked at me and she said,,"How did they treat you?",I was seven. I did not understand.,I mean, why would anyone treat me differently?,But she knew.,And she looked me right in the eye and she said,,"They will not always treat you well." 
 Now, race is one of those topics in America,that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable.,You bring it up at a dinner party,or in a workplace environment,,it is literally the conversational equivalent,of touching the third rail.,There is shock,,followed by a long silence.,And even coming here today,,I told some friends and colleagues,that I planned to talk about race,,and they warned me, they told me, don't do it,,that there'd be huge risks,in me talking about this topic,,that people might think I'm a militant black woman,and I would ruin my career.,And I have to tell you,,I actually for a moment was a bit afraid.,Then I realized,,the first step to solving any problem,is to not hide from it,,and the first step to any form of action,is awareness.,And so I decided to actually talk about race.,And I decided that if I camenhere and shared with you,some of my experiences,,that maybe we could all be a little less anxious,and a little more bold,in our conversations about race. 
 Now I know there are people out there who will say,that the election of Barack Obama meant,that it was the end of racial discrimination,for all eternity, right?,But I work in the investment business,,and we have a saying:,The numbers do not lie.,And here, there are significant,,quantifiable racial disparities,that cannot be ignored,,in household wealth, household income,,job opportunities, healthcare.,One example from corporate America:,Even though white men,make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population,,they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats.,Of the Fortune 250,,there are only seven CEOs that are minorities,,and of the thousands of publiclyntraded companies today, thousands,,only two are chaired by black women,,and you're looking at one of them,,the same one who, not too long ago,,was nearly mistaken for kitchen help.,So that is a fact.,Now I have this thought experiment,that I play with myself, when I say,,imagine if I walked you into a room,and it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil,,and every single person aroundnthe boardroom were black,,you would think that were weird.,But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company,,and everyone around the table is a white male,,when will it be that we think that's weird too? 
 And I know how we got here.,(Applause) 
 I know how we got here.,You know, there was institutionalized,,at one time legalized, discrimination in our country.,There's no question about it.,But still, as I grapple with this issue,,my mother's question hangs in the air for me:,How did they treat you? 
 Now, I do not raise this issue to complain,or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy.,I have succeeded in my life,beyond my wildest expectations,,and I have been treated well by people of all races,more often than I have not.,I tell the uniform story because it happened.,I cite those statistics aroundncorporate board diversity,because they are real,,and I stand here today,talking about this issue of racial discrimination,because I believe it threatens to rob,another generation of all the opportunities,that all of us want for all of our children,,no matter what their color,or where they come from.,And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.,You see, researchers have coined this term,"color blindness",to describe a learned behavior where we pretend,that we don't notice race.,If you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people,who look like you, that's purely accidental.,Now, color blindness, in my view,,doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination,,and there's fairness.,It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it.,In my view, color blindness is very dangerous,because it means we're ignoring the problem.,There was a corporate study that said that,,instead of avoiding race,,the really smart corporationsnactually deal with it head on.,They actually recognize that embracing diversity,means recognizing all races,,including the majority one.,But I'll be the first one to tell you,,this subject matter can be hard,,awkward, uncomfortable -- but that's kind of the point. 
 In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes,,the one that black people don't like to swim,,I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim.,I love to swim so much,that as an adult, I swim with a coach.,And one day my coach had me do a drill,where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool,without taking a breath.,And every single time I failed,,I had to start over.,And I failed a lot.,By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool,,I was exasperated and tired and annoyed,,and I said, "Why are we doingnbreath-holding exercises?",And my coach looked menat me, and he said, "Mellody,,that was not a breath-holding exercise.,That drill was to make you comfortable,being uncomfortable,,because that's how most of us spend our days.",If we can learn to deal with our discomfort,,and just relax into it,,we'll have a better life. 
 So I think it's time for us to be comfortable,with the uncomfortable conversation about race:,black, white, Asian, Hispanic,,male, female, all of us,,if we truly believe in equal rights,and equal opportunity in America,,I think we have to have real conversations,about this issue.,We cannot afford to be color blind.,We have to be color brave.,We have to be willing, as teachers and parents,and entrepreneurs and scientists,,we have to be willing to have,proactive conversations about race,with honesty and understanding and courage,,not because it's the right thing to do,,but because it's the smart thing to do,,because our businesses and our products,and our science, our research,,all of that will be better with greater diversity. 
 Now, my favorite example of color bravery,is a guy named John Skipper.,He runs ESPN.,He's a North Carolina native,,quintessential Southern gentleman, white.,He joined ESPN, which already had a culture,of inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch.,He demanded that every open position,have a diverse slate of candidates.,Now he says the senior people,in the beginning bristled,,and they would come to him and say,,"Do you want me to hire the minority,,or do you want me to hirenthe best person for the job?",And Skipper says his answers were always the same:,"Yes.",And by saying yes to diversity,,I honestly believe that ESPN,is the most valuable cable franchise in the world.,I think that's a part of the secret sauce. 
 Now I can tell you, in my own industry,,at Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity,as a competitive advantage,,and that advantage can extendnway beyond business.,There's a guy named Scott Pagenat the University of Michigan.,He is the first person to develop,a mathematical calculation for diversity.,He says, if you're trying tonsolve a really hard problem,,really hard,,that you should have a diverse group of people,,including those with diverse intellects.,The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic.,When it was ravaging Europe,,they brought together all these scientists,,and they were stumped.,And the beginnings of the cure to the disease,came from the most unlikely source,,a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids,were not getting smallpox.,And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based,because of that dairy farmer. 
 Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying,,I don't run a cable company,,I don't run an investment firm,,I am not a dairy farmer.,What can I do?,And I'm telling you, you can be color brave.,If you're part of a hiring process,or an admissions process,,you can be color brave.,If you are trying to solve a really hard problem,,you can speak up and be color brave.,Now I know people will say,,but that doesn't add up to a lot,,but I'm actually asking younto do something really simple:,observe your environment,,at work, at school, at home.,I'm asking you to look at the people around you,purposefully and intentionally.,Invite people into your life,who don't look like you, don't think like you,,don't act like you,,don't come from where you come from,,and you might find that theynwill challenge your assumptions,and make you grow as a person.,You might get powerful new insights,from these individuals,,or, like my husband, who happens to be white,,you might learn that black people,,men, women, children,,we use body lotion every single day. 
 Now, I also think that this is very important,so that the next generation really understands,that this progress will help them,,because they're expectingnus to be great role models. 
 Now, I told you, my mother,,she was ruthlessly realistic.,She was an unbelievable role model.,She was the kind of person,who got to be the way she was,because she was a single mom,with six kids in Chicago.,She was in the real estate business,,where she worked extraordinarily hard,but oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet.,And that meant sometimes we got,our phone disconnected,,or our lights turned off,,or we got evicted.,When we got evicted, sometimes we lived,in these small apartments that she owned,,sometimes in only one or two rooms,,because they weren't completed,,and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates.,But she never gave up hope, ever,,and she never allowed us to give up hope either.,This brutal pragmatism that she had,,I mean, I was four and she told me,,"Mommy is Santa." (Laughter),She was this brutal pragmatism.,She taught me so many lessons,,but the most important lesson,was that every single day she told me,,"Mellody, you can be anything.",And because of those words,,I would wake up at the crack of dawn,,and because of those words,,I would love school more than anything,,and because of those words, when I was on a bus,going to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams.,And it's because of those wordsnthat I stand here right now,full of passion,,asking you to be brave for the kids,who are dreaming those dreams today.,(Applause) 
 You see, I want them to look at a CEO on television,and say, "I can be like her,",or, "He looks like me.",And I want them to know,that anything is possible,,that they can achieve the highest level,that they ever imagined,,that they will be welcomenin any corporate boardroom,,or they can lead any company.,You see this idea of being the land,of the free and the home of the brave,,it's woven into the fabric of America.,America, when we have a challenge,,we take it head on, we don't shrink away from it.,We take a stand. We show courage.,So right now, what I'm asking you to do,,I'm asking you to show courage.,I'm asking you to be bold.,As business leaders, I'm asking you,not to leave anything on the table.,As citizens, I'm asking younnot to leave any child behind.,I'm asking you not to be color blind,,but to be color brave,,so that every child knows that their future matters,and their dreams are possible. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. (Applause)Wow, this is bright.,It must use a lot of power.,Well, flying you all in here,must have cost a bit of energy too.,So the whole planet needs a lot of energy,,and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.,We've been burning gas.,It's been a good run.,It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.,We can't do that anymore. 
 So we are trying different types of energy now,,alternative energy,,but it proved quite difficult to find something,that's as convenient and as cost-effective,as oil, gas and coal.,My personal favorite is nuclear energy.,Now, it's very energy-dense,,it produces solid, reliable power,,and it doesn't make any CO2. 
 Now we know of two ways,of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.,Now in fission, you take a big nucleus,,you break it in part, in two,,and it makes lots of energy,,and this is how the nuclear reactor today works.,It works pretty good.,And then there's fusion.,Now, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.,So you take two small nuclei,,you put it together, and you make helium,,and that's very nice.,It makes lots of energy.,This is nature's way of producing energy.,The sun and all the stars in the universe,run on fusion.,Now, a fusion plant,would actually be quite cost-effective,and it also would be quite safe.,It only produces short term radioactive waste,,and it cannot melt down.,Now, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.,In the ocean, you can extract the fuel,for about one thousandth of a cent,per kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.,And if the whole planet would run on fusion,,we could extract the fuel from the ocean.,It would run for billions and billions of years. 
 Now, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?,Where is it?,Well, there's always a bit of a catch.,Fusion is really, really hard to do.,So the problem is, those two nuclei,,they are both positively charged,,so they don't want to fuse.,They go like this. They go like that.,So in order to make them fuse,,you have to throw them atneach other with great speed,,and if they have enough speed,,they will go against the repulsion,,they will touch, and they will make energy.,Now, the particle speed,is a measure of the temperature.,So the temperature required for fusion,is 150 billion degrees C.,This is rather warm,,and this is why fusion is so hard to do. 
 Now, I caught my little fusion bug,when I did my Ph.D. here at thenUniversity of British Columbia,,and then I got a big job in a laser printer place,making printing for the printing industry.,I worked there for 10 years,,and I got a little bit bored,,and then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,,you know, the usual thing:,Who am I? What should I do?,What should I do? What can I do?,And then I was looking at my good work,,and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests,around here in B.C.,and burying you, all of you,,in millions of tons of junk mail.,Now, that was not very satisfactory.,So some people buy a Porsche.,Others get a mistress.,But I've decided to get my bit,to solve global warming and make fusion happen. 
 Now, so the first thing I did,is I looked into the literature and I see,,how does fusion work?,So the physicists have beennworking on fusion for a while,,and one of the ways they do it,is with something called a tokamak.,It's a big ring of magnetic coil,,superconducting coil,,and it makes a magnetic field,in a ring like this,,and the hot gas in the middle,,which is called a plasma, is trapped.,The particles go round and round and round,the circle at the wall.,Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there,to try to cook that to fusion temperature.,So this is the inside of one of those donuts,,and on the right side you can see,the fusion plasma in there. 
 Now, a second way of doing this,is by using laser fusion.,Now in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,,you put the fusion fuel in the center,,and you zap that with a wholenbunch of laser around it.,The lasers are very strong, and it squashes,the ping pong ball really, really quick.,And if you squeeze something hard enough,,it gets hotter,,and if it gets really, really fast,,and they do that in one billionth of a second,,it makes enough energy and enough heat,to make fusion.,So this is the inside of one such machine.,You see the laser beam and the pellet,in the center. 
 Now, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.,They always think that the physicists are in their lab,and they're working hard, but nothing is happening.,That's actually not quite true.,This is a curve of the gain in fusion,over the last 30 years or so,,and you can see that we're making now,about 10,000 times more fusion than we used to,when we started.,That's a pretty good gain.,As a matter of fact, it's as fast,as the fabled Moore's Law,that defined the amount of transistors,they can put on a chip.,Now, this dot here is called JET,,the Joint European Torus.,It's a big tokamak donut in Europe,,and this machine in 1997,produced 16 megawatts of fusion power,with 17 megawatts of heat.,Now, you say, that's not much use,,but it's actually pretty close,,considering we can get,about 10,000 times more than we started.,The second dot here is the NIF.,It's the National Ignition Facility.,It's a big laser machine in the U.S.,,and last month they announced,with quite a bit of noise,that they had managed to make more fusion energy,from the fusion,than the energy that they put in nthe center of the ping pong ball.,Now, that's not quite good enough,,because the laser to put that energy in,was more energy than that,,but it was pretty good. 
 Now this is ITER,,pronounced in French: EE-tairh.,So this is a big collaboration of different countries,that are building a huge magnetic donut,in the south of France,,and this machine, when it's finished,,will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power,with only 50 megawatts to make it.,So this one is the real one.,It's going to work.,That's the kind of machine that makes energy. 
 Now if you look at the graph, you will notice,that those two dots are a little bit,on the right of the curve.,We kind of have fallen off the progress.,Actually, the science to make those machines,was really in time,to produce fusion during that curve.,However, there has been a bit of politics going on,,and the will to do it was not there,,so it drifted to the right.,ITER, for example, could have been built,in 2000 or 2005,,but because it's a big international collaboration,,the politics got in and it delayed it a bit.,For example, it took them about three years,to decide where to put it. 
 Now, fusion is often criticized,for being a little too expensive.,Yes, it did cost,a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year,to make this progress.,But you have to compare that to the cost,of making Moore's Law.,That cost way more than that.,The result of Moore's Law,is this cell phone here in my pocket.,This cell phone, and the Internet behind it,,cost about one trillion dollars,,just so I can take a selfie,and put it on Facebook.,Then when my dad sees that,,he'll be very proud.,We also spend about 650 billion dollars a year,in subsidies for oil and gas,and renewable energy.,Now, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.,So me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.,I think it's actually been shortchanged,,considering it can solve all our energy problems,cleanly for the next couple of billions of years. 
 Now I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased,,because I started a fusion company,and I don't even have a Facebook account.,So when I started this fusion company in 2002,,I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.,They had much more resources than me.,So I decided I would need to find a solution,that is cheaper and faster. 
 Now magnetic and laser fusion,are pretty good machines.,They are awesome pieces of technology,,wonderful machines, and they have shown,that fusion can be done.,However, as a power plant,,I don't think they're very good.,They're way too big, way too complicated,,way too expensive,,and also, they don't deal very much,with the fusion energy.,When you make fusion, the energy comes out,as neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.,Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine.,It damages it.,And also, you have to catchnthe heat from those neutrons,and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,,and on those machines,,it was all a bit of an afterthought.,So I decided that surely therenis a better way of doing that. 
 So back to the literature,,and I read about the fusion everywhere.,One way in particular attracted my attention,,and it's called magnetized target fusion,,or MTF for short.,Now, in MTF, what you want to do,is you take a big vat,and you fill that with liquid metal,,and you spin the liquid metal,to open a vortex in the center,,a bit like your sink.,When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.,And then you have some pistons driven by pressure,that goes on the outside,,and this compresses the liquid metal,around the plasma, and it compresses it,,it gets hotter, like a laser,,and then it makes fusion.,So it's a bit of a mix,between a magnetized fusion,and the laser fusion.,So those have a couple of very good advantages.,The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons,and no neutrons hit the wall,,and therefore there's no damage to the machine.,The liquid metal gets hot,,so you can pump that in a heat exchanger,,make some steam, spin a turbine.,So that's a very convenient way of doing,this part of the process.,And finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen,comes from steam-powered pistons,,which is way cheaper than lasers,or superconducting coils. 
 Now, this was all very good,except for the problem that it didn't quite work.,(Laughter),There's always a catch.,So when you compress that,,the plasma cools down,faster than the compression speed,,so you're trying to compress it,,but the plasma cooled down andncooled down and cooled down,and then it did absolutely nothing. 
 So when I saw that, I said,nwell, this is such a shame,,because it's a very, very good idea.,So hopefully I can improve on that.,So I thought about it for a minute,,and I said, okay, how can we make that work better?,So then I thought about impact.,What about if we use a big hammer,and we swing it and we hit the nail like this,,in the place of putting the hammer on the nail,and pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.,So what the idea is,is to use the idea of an impact.,So we accelerate the pistons with steam,,that takes a little bit of time,,but then, bang! you hit the piston,,and, baff!, all the energy is done instantly,,down instantly to the liquid,,and that compresses the plasma much faster.,So I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that. 
 So we built this machine in this garage here.,We made a small machine,that we managed to squeeze,a little bit of neutrons out of that,,and those are my marketing neutrons,,and with those marketing neutrons,,then I raised about 50 million dollars,,and I hired 65 people. That's my team here.,And this is what we want to build.,So it's going to be a big machine,,about three meters in diameter,,liquid lead spinning around,,big vortex in the center,,put the plasma on the top and on the bottom,,piston hits on the side,,bang!, it compresses it,,and it will make some energy,,and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal,,going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,,and some of the steam will go back,to fire the piston.,We're going to run that about one time per second,,and it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity. 
 Okay, we also built this injector,,so this injector makes the plasma to start with.,It makes the plasma at about,a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.,Unfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,,so we need to extend the lifenof the plasma a little bit,,but last month it got a lot better,,so I think we have the plasma compressing now.,Then we built a small sphere, about this big,,14 pistons around it,,and this will compress the liquid.,However, plasma is difficult to compress.,When you compress it,,it tends to go a little bit crooked like that,,so you need the timing of the piston,to be very good,,and for that we use several control systems,,which was not possible in 1970,,but we now can do that,with nice, new electronics. 
 So finally, most people think that fusion,is in the future and will never happen,,but as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.,We are almost there.,The big labs have shown that fusion is doable,,and now there are small companiesnthat are thinking about that,,and they say, it's not that it cannot be done,,but it's how to make it cost-effectively.,General Fusion is one of those small companies,,and hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone,,will crack that nut,,and perhaps it will be General Fusion. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So, I have a feature on my website where every week,people submit hypothetical questions,for me to answer,,and I try to answer them using math, science,and comics. 
 So for example, one person asked,,what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball,pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?,So I did some calculations.,Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,,the air will flow around the object,,but in this case, the ball would be going so fast,that the air molecules wouldn't have time,to move out of the way.,The ball would smash right into and through them,,and the collisions with these air molecules,would knock away the nitrogen,,carbon and hydrogen from the ball,,fragmenting it off into tiny particles,,and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion,in the air around it.,This would result in a flood of x-rays,that would spread out in a bubble,along with exotic particles,,plasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,,and that would move away from the pitcher's mound,slightly faster than the ball.,Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,,the home plate is far enough away,that light hasn't had time to reach it,,which means the batter,still sees the pitcher about to throw,and has no idea that anything is wrong.,(Laughter),Now, after 70 nanoseconds,,the ball will reach home plate,,or at least the cloud of expanding plasma,that used to be the ball,,and it will engulf the bat and the batter,and the plate and the catcher and the umpire,and start disintegrating them all,as it also starts to carry them backward,through the backstop, whichnalso starts to disintegrate.,So if you were watching this whole thing,from a hill,,ideally, far away,,what you'd see is a bright flash of light,that would fade over a few seconds,,followed by a blast wave spreading out,,shredding trees and houses,as it moves away from the stadium,,and then eventually a mushroom cloud,rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter) 
 So the Major League Baseball rules,are a little bit hazy,,but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,,I think that in this situation,,the batter would be considered hit by pitch,and would be eligible to take first base,,if it still existed. 
 So this is the kind of question I answer,,and I get people writing in with,a lot of other strange questions.,I've had someone write and say,,scientifically speaking, what is the best,and fastest way to hide a body?,Can you do this one soon?,And I had someone write in,,I've had people write in about,,can you prove whether or not you can find love again,after your heart's broken?,And I've had people send in,what are clearly homework questions,they're trying to get me to do for them. 
 But one week, a couple months ago,,I got a question that was actually about Google.,If all digital data in the worldnwere stored on punch cards,,how big would Google's data warehouse be?,Now, Google's pretty secretivenabout their operations,,so no one really knows how much data Google has,,and in fact, no one really knowsnhow many data centers Google has,,except people at Google itself.,And I've tried, I've met them a few times,,tried asking them, and theynaren't revealing anything. 
 So I decided to try to figure this out myself.,There are a few things that I looked at here.,I started with money.,Google has to reveal how much they spend,,in general, and that lets you put some caps,on how many data centers could they be building,,because a big data center costsna certain amount of money.,And you can also then put a cap on,how much of the world hardndrive market are they taking up,,which turns out, it's pretty sizable.,I read a calculation at one point,,I think Google has a drive failure,about every minute or two,,and they just throw out the hard drive,and swap in a new one.,So they go through a huge number of them.,And so by looking at money,,you can get an idea of hownmany of these centers they have.,You can also look at power.,You can look at how much electricity they need,,because you need a certain amountnof electricity to run the servers,,and Google is more efficient than most,,but they still have some basic requirements,,and that lets you put a limit,on the number of servers that they have.,You can also look at square footage and see,of the data centers that you know,,how big are they?,How much room is that?,How many server racks could you fit in there?,And for some data centers,,you might get two of these pieces of information.,You know how much they spent,,and they also, say, because they had to contract,with the local government,to get the power provided,,you might know what they made a deal to buy,,so you know how much power it takes.,Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,,and figure out for a data center,where you don't have that information,,you can figure out,,but maybe you only have one of those,,you know the square footage,nthen you could figure out,well, maybe the power is proportional.,And you can do this same thingnwith a lot of different quantities,,you know, with guesses aboutnthe total amount of storage,,the number of servers, thennumber of drives per server,,and in each case using what you know,to come up with a model that narrows down,your guesses for the things that you don't know.,It's sort of circling around thennumber you're trying to get.,And this is a lot of fun.,The math is not all that advanced,,and really it's like nothing more than,solving a sudoku puzzle. 
 So what I did, I went through all of this information,,spent a day or two researching.,And there are some things I didn't look at.,You could always look at the Google,recruitment messages that they post.,That gives you an idea of where they have people.,Sometimes, when people visit a data center,,they'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,,and they aren't supposed to,,but you can learn things aboutntheir hardware that way.,And in fact, you can justnlook at pizza delivery drivers.,Turns out, they know where allnthe Google data centers are,,at least the ones that have people in them. 
 But I came up with my estimate,,which I felt pretty good about,,that was about 10 exabytes of data,across all of Google's operations,,and then another maybe five exabytes or so,of offline storage in tape drives,,which it turns out Google is,about the world's largest consumer of. 
 So I came up with this estimate, and this is,a staggering amount of data.,It's quite a bit more than any other organization,in the world has, as far as we know.,There's a couple of other contenders,,especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.,But using some of these same methods,,we can look at the NSA's data centers,,and figure out, you know, wendon't know what's going on there,,but it's pretty clear that their operation,is not the size of Google's. 
 Adding all of this up, I came up with,the other thing that we can answer, which is,,how many punch cards would this take?,And so a punch card can hold,about 80 characters,,and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,,and you put them in, say,,my home region of New England,,it would cover the entire region,up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,,which is about three times deeper,than the glaciers during the last ice age,about 20,000 years ago. 
 So this is impractical, but I think,that's about the best answer I could come up with.,And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.,And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,,because of course they've been so secretive,,they didn't answer of my questions,,and so I just put it up and said,,well, I guess we'll never know. 
 But then a little while later,I got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,,saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.,So I go and get it, open it up,,and it's punch cards. (Laughter),Google-branded punch cards.,And on these punch cards,nthere are a bunch of holes,,and I said, thank you, thank you,,okay, so what's on here?,So I get some software and start reading it,,and scan them, and it turns out,it's a puzzle.,There's a bunch of code,,and I get some friends to help,,and we crack the code, and thenninside that is another code,,and then there are some equations,,and then we solve those equations,,and then finally out pops a message from Google,which is their official answer to my article,,and it said, "No comment.",(Laughter) (Applause) 
 And I love calculating these kinds of things,,and it's not that I love doing the math.,I do a lot of math,,but I don't really like math for its own sake.,What I love is that it lets you take,some things that you know,,and just by moving symbolsnaround on a piece of paper,,find out something that you didn't know,that's very surprising.,And I have a lot of stupid questions,,and I love that math gives the power,to answer them sometimes. 
 And sometimes not.,This is a question I got from a reader,,an anonymous reader,,and the subject line just said, "Urgent,",and this was the entire email:,"If people had wheels and could fly,,how would we differentiate them from airplanes?",Urgent. (Laughter) 
 And I think there are some questions,that math just cannot answer.,Thank you.,(Applause)Let me tell you a story.,It goes back 200 million years.,It's a story of the neocortex,,which means "new rind.",So in these early mammals,,because only mammals have a neocortex,,rodent-like creatures.,It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin,,and was a thin covering around,their walnut-sized brain,,but it was capable of a new type of thinking.,Rather than the fixed behaviors,that non-mammalian animals have,,it could invent new behaviors.,So a mouse is escaping a predator,,its path is blocked,,it'll try to invent a new solution.,That may work, it may not,,but if it does, it will remember that,and have a new behavior,,and that can actually spread virally,through the rest of the community.,Another mouse watching this could say,,"Hey, that was pretty clever, going around that rock,",and it could adopt a new behavior as well. 
 Non-mammalian animals,couldn't do any of those things.,They had fixed behaviors.,Now they could learn a new behavior,but not in the course of one lifetime.,In the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes,,it could evolve a new fixed behavior.,That was perfectly okay 200 million years ago.,The environment changed very slowly.,It could take 10,000 years for there to be,a significant environmental change,,and during that period of time,it would evolve a new behavior. 
 Now that went along fine,,but then something happened.,Sixty-five million years ago,,there was a sudden, violentnchange to the environment.,We call it the Cretaceous extinction event.,That's when the dinosaurs went extinct,,that's when 75 percent of the,animal and plant species went extinct,,and that's when mammals,overtook their ecological niche,,and to anthropomorphize, biological evolution said,,"Hmm, this neocortex is pretty good stuff,",and it began to grow it.,And mammals got bigger,,their brains got bigger at an even faster pace,,and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that,and developed these distinctive ridges and folds,basically to increase its surface area.,If you took the human neocortex,and stretched it out,,it's about the size of a table napkin,,and it's still a thin structure.,It's about the thickness of a table napkin.,But it has so many convolutions and ridges,it's now 80 percent of our brain,,and that's where we do our thinking,,and it's the great sublimator.,We still have that old brain,that provides our basic drives and motivations,,but I may have a drive for conquest,,and that'll be sublimated by the neocortex,into writing a poem or inventing an app,or giving a TED Talk,,and it's really the neocortex that's where,the action is. 
 Fifty years ago, I wrote a paper,describing how I thought the brain worked,,and I described it as a series of modules.,Each module could do things with a pattern.,It could learn a pattern. It could remember a pattern.,It could implement a pattern.,And these modules were organized in hierarchies,,and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking.,And there was actually very little to go on,50 years ago.,It led me to meet President Johnson.,I've been thinking about this for 50 years,,and a year and a half ago I came out with the book,"How To Create A Mind,",which has the same thesis,,but now there's a plethora of evidence.,The amount of data we're getting about the brain,from neuroscience is doubling every year.,Spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types,is doubling every year.,We can now see inside a living brain,and see individual interneural connections,connecting in real time, firing in real time.,We can see your brain create your thoughts.,We can see your thoughts create your brain,,which is really key to how it works. 
 So let me describe briefly how it works.,I've actually counted these modules.,We have about 300 million of them,,and we create them in these hierarchies.,I'll give you a simple example.,I've got a bunch of modules,that can recognize the crossbar to a capital A,,and that's all they care about.,A beautiful song can play,,a pretty girl could walk by,,they don't care, but they seena crossbar to a capital A,,they get very excited and they say "crossbar,",and they put out a high probability,on their output axon.,That goes to the next level,,and these layers are organized in conceptual levels.,Each is more abstract than the next one,,so the next one might say "capital A.",That goes up to a highernlevel that might say "Apple.",Information flows down also.,If the apple recognizer has seen A-P-P-L,,it'll think to itself, "Hmm, Inthink an E is probably likely,",and it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers,saying, "Be on the lookout for an E,,I think one might be coming.",The E recognizers will lower their threshold,and they see some sloppynthing, could be an E.,Ordinarily you wouldn't think so,,but we're expecting an E, it's good enough,,and yeah, I've seen an E, and then apple says,,"Yeah, I've seen an Apple." 
 Go up another five levels,,and you're now at a pretty high level,of this hierarchy,,and stretch down into the different senses,,and you may have a modulenthat sees a certain fabric,,hears a certain voice quality,nsmells a certain perfume,,and will say, "My wife has entered the room." 
 Go up another 10 levels, and now you're at,a very high level.,You're probably in the frontal cortex,,and you'll have modules that say, "That was ironic.,That's funny. She's pretty." 
 You might think that those are more sophisticated,,but actually what's more complicated,is the hierarchy beneath them.,There was a 16-year-old girl, she had brain surgery,,and she was conscious because the surgeons,wanted to talk to her.,You can do that because there's no pain receptors,in the brain.,And whenever they stimulated particular,,very small points on her neocortex,,shown here in red, she would laugh.,So at first they thought they were triggering,some kind of laugh reflex,,but no, they quickly realized they had found,the points in her neocortex that detect humor,,and she just found everything hilarious,whenever they stimulated these points.,"You guys are so funny just standing around,",was the typical comment,,and they weren't funny,,not while doing surgery. 
 So how are we doing today?,Well, computers are actually beginning to master,human language with techniques,that are similar to the neocortex.,I actually described the algorithm,,which is similar to something called,a hierarchical hidden Markov model,,something I've worked on since the '90s.,"Jeopardy" is a very broad natural language game,,and Watson got a higher score,than the best two players combined.,It got this query correct:,"A long, tiresome speech,delivered by a frothy pie topping,",and it quickly responded,n"What is a meringue harangue?",And Jennings and the other guy didn't get that.,It's a pretty sophisticated example of,computers actually understanding human language,,and it actually got its knowledge by reading,Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias. 
 Five to 10 years from now,,search engines will actually be based on,not just looking for combinations of words and links,but actually understanding,,reading for understanding the billions of pages,on the web and in books.,So you'll be walking along, and Google will pop up,and say, "You know, Mary, you expressed concern,to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement,wasn't getting past the blood-brain barrier.,Well, new research just came out 13 seconds ago,that shows a whole new approach to that,and a new way to take glutathione.,Let me summarize it for you." 
 Twenty years from now, we'll have nanobots,,because another exponential trend,is the shrinking of technology.,They'll go into our brain,through the capillaries,and basically connect our neocortex,to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud,providing an extension of our neocortex.,Now today, I mean,,you have a computer in your phone,,but if you need 10,000 computers for a few seconds,to do a complex search,,you can access that for a second or two in the cloud.,In the 2030s, if you need some extra neocortex,,you'll be able to connect to that in the cloud,directly from your brain.,So I'm walking along and I say,,"Oh, there's Chris Anderson.,He's coming my way.,I'd better think of something clever to say.,I've got three seconds.,My 300 million modules in my neocortex,isn't going to cut it.,I need a billion more.",I'll be able to access that in the cloud.,And our thinking, then, will be a hybrid,of biological and non-biological thinking,,but the non-biological portion,is subject to my law of accelerating returns.,It will grow exponentially.,And remember what happens,the last time we expanded our neocortex?,That was two million years ago,when we became humanoids,and developed these large foreheads.,Other primates have a slanted brow.,They don't have the frontal cortex.,But the frontal cortex is notnreally qualitatively different.,It's a quantitative expansion of neocortex,,but that additional quantity of thinking,was the enabling factor for us to take,a qualitative leap and invent language,and art and science and technology,and TED conferences.,No other species has done that. 
 And so, over the next few decades,,we're going to do it again.,We're going to again expand our neocortex,,only this time we won't be limited,by a fixed architecture of enclosure.,It'll be expanded without limit.,That additional quantity will again,be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap,in culture and technology. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here,a couple days ago,,and this is response time.,And several of you have written to me,with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA.,So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director,of the National Security Agency,,and he's a senior civilian officer there,,acts as its chief operating officer,,guiding strategies, setting internal policies,,and serving as the principal advisor to the director.,And all being well,,welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.,(Applause) 
 Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here.,I look forward to the conversation,,so thanks for arranging for that. 
 CA: Thank you, Rick.,We appreciate you joining us.,It's certainly quite a strong statement,that the NSA is willing to reach out,and show a more open face here.,You saw, I think,,the talk and interview that Edward Snowden,gave here a couple days ago.,What did you make of it?,RL: So I think it was interesting.,We didn't realize that he nwas going to show up there,,so kudos to you guys for arranging,a nice surprise like that.,I think that, like a lot of the things,that have come out since Mr. Snowden,started disclosing classified information,,there were some kernels of truth in there,,but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,,and I'm interested in helping to address those.,I think this is a really important conversation,that we're having in the United States,and internationally,,and I think it is important and of import,,and so given that, we need to have that be,a fact-based conversation,,and we want to help make that happen. 
 CA: So the question that a lot nof people have here is,,what do you make of Snowden's motivations,for doing what he did,,and did he have an alternativenway that he could have gone? 
 RL: He absolutely did,have alternative ways that he could have gone,,and I actually think that characterizing him,as a whistleblower,actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.,So what if somebody who works in the NSA --,and there are over 35,000 people who do.,They're all great citizens.,They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,,brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,,all of whom are interested in doing the right thing,for their country,and for our allies internationally,,and so there are a variety of venues to address,if folks have a concern.,First off, there's their supervisor,,and up through the supervisory chain,within their organization.,If folks aren't comfortable with that,,there are a number of inspectors general.,In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option,of the NSA inspector general,,the Navy inspector general,,the Pacific Command inspector general,,the Department of Defense inspector general,,and the intelligence community inspector general,,any of whom would have both keptnhis concerns in classified channels,and been happy to address them.,(CA and RL speaking at once),He had the option to go toncongressional committees,,and there are mechanismsnto do that that are in place,,and so he didn't do any of those things. 
 CA: Now, you had said that,Ed Snowden had other avenues,for raising his concerns.,The comeback on that is a couple of things:,one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,,the avenues that would have been availablento him as an employee weren't available,,two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,,like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated,pretty harshly, by some views,,and thirdly, what he was taking on,was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,,but programs that had been approved,by all three branches of government.,I mean, in that circumstance,,couldn't you argue that what he did,was reasonable? 
 RL: No, I don't agree with that.,I think that the —,sorry, I'm getting feedback,through the microphone there —,the actions that he took were inappropriate,because of the fact that nhe put people's lives at risk,,basically, in the long run,,and I know there's been a lot of talk,in public by Mr. Snowdennand some of the journalists,that say that the things that have been disclosed,have not put national security and people at risk,,and that is categorically not true.,They actually do.,I think there's also an amazing arrogance,to the idea that he knows better than,the framers of the Constitution,in how the government should nbe designed and work,for separation of powers,and the fact that the executive nand the legislative branch,have to work together and they havenchecks and balances on each other,,and then the judicial branch,,which oversees the entire process.,I think that's extremely arrogant on his part. 
 CA: Can you give a specific example,of how he put people's lives at risk? 
 RL: Yeah, sure.,So the things that he's disclosed,,the capabilities,,and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,,so when we have foreign intelligence targets,,legitimate things of interest --,like, terrorists is the iconic example,,but it includes things like human traffickers,,drug traffickers,,people who are trying to buildnadvanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,,and build delivery systems for those,,and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,,which you may have some visibility,into some of that that's going on right now,,the capabilities are applied,in very discrete and measured and controlled ways.,So the unconstrained disclosure nof those capabilities,means that as adversaries see them,and recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,",they move away from that,,and we have seen targets in terrorism,,in the nation-state area,,in smugglers of various types, and other folks,who have, because of the disclosures,,moved away from our ability,to have insight into what they're doing.,The net effect of that is that our people,who are overseas in dangerous places,,whether they're diplomats or military,,and our allies who are in similar situations,,are at greater risk because we don't see,the threats that are coming their way. 
 CA: So that's a general response saying that,because of his revelations,,access that you had to certain types of information,has been shut down, has been closed down.,But the concern is that the nature of that access,was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.,I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program,where it's alleged that the NSA,specifically weakened security,in order to get the type of naccess that you've spoken of. 
 RL: So there are, when our,legitimate foreign intelligence targetsnof the type that I described before,,use the global telecommunications system,as their communications methodology,,and they do, because it's a great system,,it's the most complex system ever devised by man,,and it is a wonder,,and lots of folks in the room there,are responsible for the creation,and enhancement of that,,and it's just a wonderful thing.,But it's also used by people who are,working against us and our allies.,And so if I'm going to pursue them,,I need to have the capability,to go after them,,and again, the controls are in,how I apply that capability,,not that I have the capability itself.,Otherwise, if we could make it so that,all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,,we could have a domain, badguy.com.,That would be awesome,,and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.,That's not how it works.,They're trying to hide,from the government's ability,to isolate and interdict their actions,,and so we have to swim in that same space.,But I will tell you this.,So NSA has two missions.,One is the Signals Intelligence mission,that we've unfortunately read sonmuch about in the press.,The other one is the Information Assurance mission,,which is to protect the national securitynsystems of the United States,,and by that, that's things like,the communications that the president uses,,the communications thatncontrol our nuclear weapons,,the communications that ournmilitary uses around the world,,and the communications that we use with our allies,,and that some of our allies themselves use.,And so we make recommendationsnon standards to use,,and we use those same standards,,and so we are invested,in making sure that those communications,are secure for their intended purposes. 
 CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that,when it comes to the Internet at large,,any strategy is fair game,if it improves America's safety.,And I think this is partly where there is such,a divide of opinion,,that there's a lot of people in this room,and around the world,who think very differently about the Internet.,They think of it as a momentous,invention of humanity,,kind of on a par with thenGutenberg press, for example.,It's the bringer of knowledge to all.,It's the connector of all.,And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.,And from that lens,,what the NSA has done is equivalent to,the authorities back in Germany,inserting some device into every printing press,that would reveal which books people bought,and what they read.,Can you understand that from that viewpoint,,it feels outrageous? 
 RL: I do understand that, and I actually sharenthe view of the utility of the Internet,,and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.,It is a global telecommunications system.,The Internet is a big chunk of nthat, but there is a lot more.,And I think that people have legitimate concerns,about the balance betweenntransparency and secrecy.,That's sort of been couched as a balance,between privacy and national security.,I don't think that's the right framing.,I think it really is transparency and secrecy.,And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,,and we want to participate in that, and want,people to participate in it in an informed way.,So there are things,,let me talk there a little bit more,,there are things that we neednto be transparent about:,our authorities, our processes,,our oversight, who we are.,We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,,and I think that's part of the reason,that this has been so revelational,and so sensational in the media.,Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.,There's takeoffs of our logo,of an eagle with headphones on around it.,And so that's the public characterization.,And so we need to be morentransparent about those things.,What we don't need to be transparent about,,because it's bad for the U.S.,,it's bad for all those otherncountries that we work with,and that we help provide information,that helps them secure themselves,and their people,,it's bad to expose operations and capabilities,in a way that allows the peoplenthat we're all working against,,the generally recognized bad guys,,to counter those. 
 CA: But isn't it also bad to deal,a kind of body blow to the American companies,that have essentially given the world,most of the Internet services that matter?,RL: It is. It's really the companies are,in a tough position, as are we,,because the companies,,we compel them to provide information,,just like every other nation in the world does.,Every industrialized nation in the world,has a lawful intercept program,where they are requiring companies,to provide them with information,that they need for their security,,and the companies that are involved,have complied with those programs,in the same way that they have to do,when they're operating in Russia or the U.K.,or China or India or France,,any country that you choose to name.,And so the fact that these revelations,have been broadly characterized as,"you can't trust company A because,your privacy is suspect with them",is actually only accurate in the sense that,it's accurate with every other company in the world,that deals with any of those countries in the world.,And so it's being picked up by people,as a marketing advantage,,and it's being marketed that nway by several countries,,including some of our allied countries,,where they are saying,,"Hey, you can't trust the U.S.,,but you can trust our telecom company,,because we're safe.",And they're actually using that to counter,the very large technological edge,that U.S. companies have,in areas like the cloud andnInternet-based technologies. 
 CA: You're sitting there with the American flag,,and the American Constitution guarantees,freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.,How do you characterize,the American citizen's right to privacy?,Is there such a right? 
 RL: Yeah, of course there is.,And we devote an inordinatenamount of time and pressure,,inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,,amount of time and effort in order to ensure,that we protect that privacy.,and beyond that, the privacy of citizens,around the world, it's not just Americans.,Several things come into play here.,First, we're all in the same network.,My communications,,I'm a user of a particular Internet email service,that is the number one email service of choice,by terrorists around the world, number one.,So I'm there right beside them in email space,in the Internet.,And so we need to be able to pick that apart,and find the information that's relevant.,In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter,Americans and innocent foreign citizens,who are just going about their business,,and so we have procedures innplace that shreds that out,,that says, when you find that,,not if you find it, when you find it,nbecause you're certain to find it,,here's how you protect that.,These are called minimization procedures.,They're approved by the attorney general,and constitutionally based.,And so we protect those.,And then, for people, citizens of the world,who are going about their lawful business,on a day-to-day basis,,the president on his January 17 speech,,laid out some additional protections,that we are providing to them.,So I think absolutely,,folks do have a right to privacy,,and that we work very hard to make sure,that that right to privacy is protected. 
 CA: What about foreigners using,American companies' Internet services?,Do they have any privacy rights? 
 RL: They do. They do, in the sense of,,the only way that we are able to compel,one of those companies to provide us information,is when it falls into one of three categories:,We can identify that this particular person,,identified by a selector of some kind,,is associated with counterterrorist,or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target. 
 CA: Much has been made of the fact that,a lot of the information that you've obtained,through these programs is essentially metadata.,It's not necessarily the actual words,that someone has written in an email,or given on a phone call.,It's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.,But it's been argued,,and someone here in the audience has talked,to a former NSA analyst who said,metadata is actually much more invasive,than the core data,,because in the core data,you present yourself as you want to be presented.,With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are,that are drawn?,Is there anything to that? 
 RL: I don't really understand that argument.,I think that metadata's importantnfor a couple of reasons.,Metadata is the information that lets you,find connections that people are trying to hide.,So when a terrorist is corresponding,with somebody else who's not known to us,but is engaged in doing ornsupporting terrorist activity,,or someone who's violating international sanctions,by providing nuclear weapons-related material,to a country like Iran or North Korea,,is trying to hide that activitynbecause it's illicit activity.,What metadata lets you do is connect that.,The alternative to that,is one that's much less efficient,and much more invasive of privacy,,which is gigantic amounts of content collection.,So metadata, in that sense,,actually is privacy-enhancing.,And we don't, contrary to some of the stuff,that's been printed,,we don't sit there and grind out,metadata profiles of average people.,If you're not connected,to one of those valid intelligence targets,,you are not of interest to us. 
 CA: So in terms of the threats,that face America overall,,where would you place terrorism? 
 RL: I think terrorism is still number one.,I think that we have never been in a time,where there are more places,where things are going badly,and forming the petri dish in which terrorists,take advantage of the lack of governance.,An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,,used to describe it as arcs of instability.,And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability,in the world right now,,in places like Syria, where there's a civil war,going on and you have massive numbers,,thousands and thousands of foreign fighters,who are coming into Syria,to learn how to be terrorists,and practice that activity,,and lots of those people are Westerners,who hold passports to European countries,or in some cases the United States,,and so they are basically learning how,to do jihad and have expressed intent,to go out and do that later on,in their home countries.,You've got places like Iraq,,which is suffering from a highnlevel of sectarian violence,,again a breeding ground for terrorism.,And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa,and the Sahel area of Africa.,Again, lots of weak governance,which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.,So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.,I think number two is cyber threat.,I think cyber is a threat in three ways:,One way, and probably the most common way,that people have heard about it,,is due to the theft of intellectual property,,so basically, foreign countries going in,,stealing companies' secrets,,and then providing that information,to state-owned enterprises,or companies connected to the government,to help them leapfrog technology,or to gain business intelligence,that's then used to win contracts overseas.,That is a hugely costly set ofnactivities that's going on right now.,Several nation-states are doing it.,Second is the denial-of-service attacks.,You're probably aware that there have been,a spate of those directed against,the U.S. financial sector since 2012.,Again, that's a nation-state whonis executing those attacks,,and they're doing that,as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.,And the last one is destructive attacks,,and those are the ones that concern me the most.,Those are on the rise.,You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,,August of 2012.,It took down about 35,000 of their computers,with a Wiper-style virus.,You had a follow-on a week later,to a Qatari company.,You had March of 2013,,you had a South Korean attack,that was attributed in the press to North Korea,that took out thousands of computers.,Those are on the rise,,and we see people expressing interest,in those capabilities,and a desire to employ them. 
 CA: Okay, so a couple of things here,,because this is really the core of this, almost.,I mean, first of all,,a lot of people who look at risk,and look at the numbers,don't understand this belief that terrorism,is still the number one threat.,Apart from September 11,,I think the numbers are thatnin the last 30 or 40 years,about 500 Americans have died from terrorism,,mostly from homegrown terrorists.,The chance in the last few years,of being killed by terrorism,is far less than the chancenof being killed by lightning.,I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident,or bioterrorism act or something like that,would change those numbers.,Would that be the point of view? 
 RL: Well, I'd say two things.,One is, the reason that there hasn't been,a major attack in the United States since 9/11,,that is not an accident.,That's a lot of hard work that we have done,,that other folks,in the intelligence community have done,,that the military has done,,and that our allies around the globe have done.,You've heard the numbers about,the tip of the iceberg in terms,of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs,contributed to stopping was 54,,25 of those in Europe,,and of those 25,,18 of them occurred in three countries,,some of which are our allies,,and some of which are beating the heck out of us,over the NSA programs, by the way.,So that's not an accident that those things happen.,That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence,on terrorist activities,and interdicting them through one way or another,,through law enforcement,,through cooperative activities with other countries,and sometimes through military action.,The other thing I would say is that,your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat,is not at all far-fetched,and in fact there are a number of groups,who have for several years expressed interest,and desire in obtaining those capabilities,and work towards that. 
 CA: It's also been said that,,of those 54 alleged incidents,,that as few as zero of them,were actually anything to do,with these controversial programs,that Mr. Snowden revealed,,that it was basically throughnother forms of intelligence,,that you're looking for a needle in a haystack,,and the effects of these programs,,these controversial programs,,is just to add hay to the stack,,not to really find the needle.,The needle was found by other methods.,Isn't there something to that? 
 RL: No, there's actually two programs,that are typically implicated in that discussion.,One is the section 215 program,,the U.S. telephony metadata program,,and the other one is,popularly called the PRISM program,,and it's actually section 702 nof the FISA Amendment Act.,But the 215 program,is only relevant to threats,that are directed against the United States,,and there have been a dozen threats,where that was implicated.,Now what you'll see people say publicly,is there is no "but for" case,,and so there is no case where, but for that,,the threat would have happened.,But that actually indicates a lack of understanding,of how terrorist investigations actually work.,You think about on television,,you watch a murder mystery.,What do you start with? You start with a body,,and then they work their waynfrom there to solve the crime.,We're actually starting well before that,,hopefully before there are any bodies,,and we're trying to build the case for,who the people are, what they're trying to do,,and that involves massive amounts of information.,Think of it is as mosaic,,and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic,was necessary to building the mosaic,,but to build the complete picture,,you need to have all the pieces of information.,On the other, the non-U.S.-relatednthreats out of those 54,,the other 42 of them,,the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,,and in fact was material in contributing,to stopping those attacks. 
 CA: Snowden said two days ago,that terrorism has always been,what is called in the intelligence world,"a cover for action,",that it's something that,,because it invokes such a powerful,emotional response in people,,it allows the initiation of these programs,to achieve powers that an organization like yours,couldn't otherwise have.,Is there any internal debate about that? 
 RL: Yeah.,I mean, we debate these things all the time,,and there is discussion that goes on,in the executive branch,and within NSA itself,and the intelligence community about,what's right, what's proportionate,,what's the correct thing to do.,And it's important to note that the programs,that we're talking about,were all authorized by two different presidents,,two different political parties,,by Congress twice,,and by federal judges 16 different times,,and so this is not NSA running off,and doing its own thing.,This is a legitimate activity,of the United States foreign government,that was agreed to by all the branches,of the United States government,,and President Madison would have been proud. 
 CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered,what was actually being done nwith that authorization,,many of them were completely shocked.,Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,,that it's only because it's now come out publicly,,that they really knew exactly what you were doing,with the powers they had granted you? 
 RL: Congress is a big body.,There's 535 of them,,and they change out frequently,,in the case of the House, every two years,,and I think that the NSA provided,all the relevant informationnto our oversight committees,,and then the dissemination of that information,by the oversight committees throughout Congress,is something that they manage.,I think I would say that Congress members,had the opportunity to make themselves aware,,and in fact a significant number of them,,the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,,did have the ability to do that.,And you've actually had the chairs ofnthose committees say that in public.,CA: Now, you mentioned the nthreat of cyberattacks,,and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree,that that is a huge concern,,but do you accept that there's a tradeoff,between offensive and defensive strategies,,and that it's possible that the very measures taken,to, "weaken encryption,",and allow yourself to find the bad guys,,might also open the door to forms of cyberattack? 
 RL: So I think two things.,One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't.,And the other one is that,the NSA has both of those missions,,and we are heavily biased towards defense,,and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find,in the overwhelming majority of cases,,we disclose to the people who are responsible,for manufacturing or developing those products.,We have a great track record of that,,and we're actually working on a proposal right now,to be transparent and tonpublish transparency reports,in the same way that the Internet companies,are being allowed to publishntransparency reports for them.,We want to be more transparent about that.,So again, we eat our own dog food.,We use the standards, we use the products,that we recommend,,and so it's in our interest,to keep our communications protected,in the same way that other people's need to be. 
 CA: Edward Snowden,,when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here,in the bot,,and I heard him say to a couple of people,,they asked him about what he thought,of the NSA overall,,and he was very complimentary about the people,who work with you,,said that it's a really,impassioned group of employees,who are seeking to do the right thing,,and that the problems have come from,just some badly conceived policies.,He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.,He didn't come over like a crazy man.,Would you accept that at least,,even if you disagree with how he did it,,that he has opened a debate that matters? 
 RL: So I think that the discussion,is an important one to have.,I do not like the way that he did it.,I think there were a number of other ways,that he could have done that,that would have not endangered our people,and the people of other nations,through losing visibility,into what our adversaries are doing.,But I do think it's an important conversation. 
 CA: It's been reported that there's,almost a difference of opinion,with you and your colleagues,over any scenario in which,he might be offered an amnesty deal.,I think your boss, General Keith Alexander,,has said that that would be a terrible example,for others;,you can't negotiate with someone,who's broken the law in that way.,But you've been quoted as saying that,,if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering,all undisclosed documents,,that a deal maybe should be considered.,Do you still think that? 
 RL: Yeah, so actually,,this is my favorite thing aboutnthat "60 Minutes" interview,was all the misquotes that came from that.,What I actually said, in nresponse to a question about,,would you entertain any discussions,of mitigating action against Snowden,,I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.,This is something that the attorney general,of the United States and the president also,actually have both talked about this,,and I defer to the attorney general,,because this is his lane.,But there is a strong tradition,in American jurisprudence,of having discussions with people,who have been charged with crimes in order to,,if it benefits the government,,to get something out of that,,that there's always room for that kind of discussion.,So I'm not presupposing any outcome,,but there is always room for discussion. 
 CA: To a lay person it seems like,he has certain things to offer the U.S.,,the government, you, others,,in terms of putting things right,and helping figure out a smarter policy,,a smarter way forward for the future.,Do you see, has that kind of possibility,been entertained at all?,RL: So that's out of my lane.,That's not an NSA thing.,That would be a Department of Justice,sort of discussion.,I'll defer to them. 
 CA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,,I offered him the chance tonshare an idea worth spreading.,What would be your idea worth spreading,for this group? 
 RL: So I think, learn the facts.,This is a really important conversation,,and it impacts, it's not just NSA,,it's not just the government,,it's you, it's the Internet companies.,The issue of privacy and personal data,is much bigger than just the government,,and so learn the facts.,Don't rely on headlines,,don't rely on sound bites,,don't rely on one-sided conversations.,So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.,We have a sign, a badge tab,,we wear badges at work with lanyards,,and if I could make a plug,,my badge lanyard at work says, "Dallas Cowboys.",Go Dallas.,I've just alienated half the audience, I know.,So the lanyard that our people,who work in the organization,that does our crypto-analytic work,have a tab that says, "Look at the data.",So that's the idea worth spreading.,Look at the data. 
 CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,,I think, actually, to come and speak openly,to this group.,It's not something the NSAnhas done a lot of in the past,,and plus the technology has been challenging.,We truly appreciate you doing that,and sharing in this very important conversation.,Thank you so much. 
 RL: Thanks, Chris. 
 (Applause)As a scientist, and also as a human being,,I've been trying to make myself,susceptible to wonder.,I think Jason Webley last night called it,"conspiring to be part of the magic.",So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist,lets me dive deeply into the lives,of some truly wondrous creatures,that share our planet:,fireflies. 
 Now, for many of you, I know that fireflies,might conjure up some really great memories:,childhood, summertime,,even other TED Talks.,Maybe something like this. 
 My seduction into the world of fireflies,began when I was back in graduate school.,One evening, I was sitting out in my backyard,in North Carolina,,and suddenly, these silent sparks,rose up all around me,,and I began to wonder:,How do these creatures make light,,and what's with all this flashing?,Are they talking to one another?,And what happens after the lights go out?,I've been lucky enough to answer,some of these questions,as I've explored this nocturnal world. 
 Now if you've ever seen,or even heard about fireflies,,then you'll know how magically they can transform,our everyday landscape into something,ethereal and otherworldly,,and this happens around the globe,,like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains,that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light,by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,,or a roadside river that I visited in Japan,as it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes,of these Genji fireflies,,or in Malaysia, the mangrove trees,that I watched blossom nightly,not with flowers,but with the lights of a thousand — n(Bleep! Bleep!) — fireflies,,all blinking together,in stunning synchrony.,These luminous landscapes,still fill me with wonder,,and they keep me connected to the magic,of the natural world. 
 And I find it amazing that they're created,by these tiny insects.,In person, fireflies are charming.,They're charismatic.,They've been celebrated in art,and in poetry for centuries.,As I've traveled around the world,,I've met many thoughtful people,who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth,for humans to enjoy.,Other creatures can enjoy them too.,I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous,because they so beautifully illuminate,the creative improvisation of evolution.,They've been shaped by two powerful,evolutionary forces:,natural selection, the struggle for survival,,and sexual selection,,the struggle for reproductive opportunity.,As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years,have been quite an exciting ride.,Together with my students at Tufts University,and other colleagues,,we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:,their courtship and sex lives,,their treachery and murder.,So today I'd like to share with you,just a couple of tales that we've brought back,from our collective adventures,into this hidden world. 
 Fireflies belong to a very beautiful,and diverse group of insects, the beetles.,Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,,and these have evolved remarkably diverse,courtship signals,,that is, different ways to find and attract mates.,Around 150 million years ago,,the very first fireflies probably looked like this.,They flew during the daytime,and they didn't light up.,Instead, males used their fantastic antennae,to sniff out perfumes given off by their females.,In other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.,They are attractively plump and wingless,,so every night, they climb up onto perches,and they glow brightly for hours,to attract their flying but unlit males.,In still other fireflies, both sexes,use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.,Here in North America,,we have more than 100 different kinds of firefly,that have the remarkable ability to shine energy,out from their bodies,in the form of light.,How do they do that?,It seems totally magical,,but these bioluminescent signals,arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions,that happen inside the firefly lantern.,The main star is an enzyme called luciferase,,which in the course of evolution,has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms,around an even smaller molecule called luciferin,,in the process getting it so excited,that it actually gives off light.,Incredible. 
 But how could these bright lights,have benefited some proto-firefly?,To answer this question, we need to flip back,in the family album to some baby pictures.,Fireflies completely reinventntheir bodies as they grow.,They spend the vast majority of their lifetime,,up to two years,,in this larval form.,Their main goal here, like my teenagers,,is to eat and grow.,And firefly light first originated,in these juveniles.,Every single firefly larva can light up,,even when their adults can't. 
 But what's the point,to being so conspicuous?,Well, we know that these juveniles,make nasty-tasting chemicals,that help them survive their extended childhood,,so we think these lights first evolved as a warning,,a neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!",to any would-be predators.,It took many millions of years,before these bright lights,evolved into a smart communication tool,that could be used not just tonward off potential predators,but to bring in potential mates.,Driven now by sexual selection,,some adult fireflies,like this proud male,evolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern,that would let them take courtship,to a whole new level.,These adults only live a few weeks,,and now they're single-mindedly focused on sex,,that is, on propelling their genes,into the next firefly generation.,So we can follow this male out into the field,as he joins hundreds of other males,who are all showing off their new courtship signals.,It's amazing to think that the luminous displays,we admire,here and in fact everywhere around the world,are actually the silent love songs,of male fireflies.,They're flying and flashing their hearts out.,I still find it very romantic. 
 But meanwhile, where are all the females?,Well, they're lounging down below,surveying their options.,They have plenty of males to choose from,,and these females turn out to be very picky.,When a female sees a flash,from an especially attractive male,,she'll aim her lantern in his direction,,and give him a flash back.,It's her "come hither" sign.,So he flies closer and he flashes again.,If she still likes him,,they'll strike up a conversation.,These creatures speak their love,in the language of light. 
 So what exactly do these females consider sexy?,We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls,to find out.,When we tested females using blinking LED lights,,we discovered they prefer males,who give longer-lasting flashes.,(Laughter) (Applause),I know you're wondering,,what gives these males their sex appeal?,Now we get to see what happens,when the lights go out. 
 The first thing we discovered,is that once a male and female hook up like this,,they stay together all night long,,and when we looked inside,to see what might be happening,,we discovered a surprising new twist,to firefly sex.,While they're mating,,the male is busy giving the female,not just his sperm,but also a nutrient-filled package,called a nuptial gift.,We can zoom in to look more closely,inside this mating pair.,We can actually see the gift —,it's shown here in red —,as it's being passed from the male to the female.,What makes this gift so valuable,is that it's packed with protein,that the female will use to provision her eggs.,So females are keeping their eyes on this prize,as they size up potential mates.,We discovered that females use male flash signals,to try to predict which males,have the biggest gifts to offer,,because this bling helps the female lay more eggs,and ultimately launch more of her own offspring,into the next generation. 
 So it's not all sweetness and light.,Firefly romance is risky.,For the most part, these adult fireflies,don't get eaten because like their juveniles,they can manufacture toxins that are repellent,to birds and other insectivores,,but somewhere along the line,,one particular group of fireflies,somehow lost the metabolic machinery,needed to make their own protective toxins.,This evolutionary flaw,,which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,,has driven these fireflies,to take their bright lights out into the night,with treacherous intent.,Dubbed "femme fatales",by Jim Lloyd, another colleague,,these females have figured out how to target,the males of other firefly species.,So the hunt begins with the predator —,she's shown here in the lower left —,where she's sitting quietly,and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation,of her intended prey,,and here's how it might go.,First the prey male flashes, "Do you love me?",His own female responds, "Maybe.",So then he flashes again.,But this time, the predator sneaks in a reply,that cleverly mimics exactlynwhat the other female just said.,She's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.,If she's good, she can lure this male close enough,to reach out and grab him,,and he's not just a light snack.,Over the next hour, she slowly,exsanguinates this male,leaving behind just some gory remains.,Unable to make their own toxins,,these females resort to drinking the blood,of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.,So a firefly vampire,,brought to you by natural selection. 
 We still have a lot to learn about fireflies,,but it looks like many stories will remain untold,,because around the world, firefly populations,are blinking out.,The main culprit: habitat loss.,Pretty much everywhere, the fields and forests,,the mangroves and meadowsnthat fireflies need to survive,,are giving way to development and to sprawl. 
 Here's another problem: we've conquered darkness,,but in the process, we spill sonmuch extra light out into the night,that it disrupts the lives of other creatures,,and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution,because it obscures the signals,that they use to find their mates. 
 Do we really need fireflies?,After all, they're just one tiny bit,of Earth's biodiversity.,Yet every time a species is lost,,it's like extinguishing a room full of candles,one by one.,You might not notice,when the first few flames flicker out,,but in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.,As we work together to craft a planetary future,,I hope we can find a way,to keep these bright lights shining. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I feel so fortunate that my first job,was working at the Museum of Modern Art,on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.,I learned so much from her.,After the curator Robert Storr,selected all the paintings,from her lifetime body of work,,I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.,There were some motifs and elements,that would come up again later in her life.,I remember asking her,what she thought of those early works.,If you didn't know they were hers,,you might not have been able to guess.,She told me that a few didn't quite meet,her own mark for what she wanted them to be.,One of the works, in fact,,so didn't meet her mark,,she had set it out in the trash in her studio,,and her neighbor had taken it,because she saw its value. 
 In that moment, my view of success,and creativity changed.,I realized that success is a moment,,but what we're always celebrating,is creativity and mastery.,But this is the thing: What gets us to convert success,into mastery?,This is a question I've long asked myself.,I think it comes when we start to value,the gift of a near win. 
 I started to understand this when I went,on one cold May day,to watch a set of varsity archers,,all women as fate would have it,,at the northern tip of Manhattan,at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.,I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox,,the idea that in order to actually hit your target,,you have to aim at something slightly skew from it.,I stood and watched as the coach,drove up these women in this gray van,,and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus.,One held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand,and arrows in the left with yellow fletching.,And they passed me and smiled,,but they sized me up as they,made their way to the turf,,and spoke to each other not with words,but with numbers, degrees, I thought,,positions for how they might plan,to hit their target.,I stood behind one archer as her coach,stood in between us to maybe assess,who might need support, and watched her,,and I didn't understand how even one,was going to hit the ten ring.,The ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance,,it looks as small as a matchstick tip,held out at arm's length.,And this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight,on each shot.,She first hit a seven, I remember, and then a nine,,and then two tens,,and then the next arrow,didn't even hit the target.,And I saw that gave her more tenacity,,and she went after it again and again.,For three hours this went on.,At the end of the practice, one of the archers,was so taxed that she lied out on the ground,just star-fished,,her head looking up at the sky,,trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call,that still point of the turning world. 
 It's so rare in American culture,,there's so little that's vocational about it anymore,,to look at what doggedness looks like,with this level of exactitude,,what it means to align your body posture,for three hours in order to hit a target,,pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity.,But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing,what's so rare to glimpse,,that difference between success and mastery. 
 So success is hitting that ten ring,,but mastery is knowing that it means nothing,if you can't do it again and again.,Mastery is not just the same as excellence, though.,It's not the same as success,,which I see as an event,,a moment in time,,and a label that the world confers upon you.,Mastery is not a commitment to a goal,but to a constant pursuit.,What gets us to do this,,what get us to forward thrust more,is to value the near win.,How many times have we designated something,a classic, a masterpiece even,,while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished,,riddled with difficulties and flaws,,in other words, a near win?,Elizabeth Murray surprised me,with her admission about her earlier paintings.,Painter Paul Cézanne so oftennthought his works were incomplete,that he would deliberately leave them aside,with the intention of picking them back up again,,but at the end of his life,,the result was that he had only signed,10 percent of his paintings.,His favorite novel was "The [Unknown]nMasterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac,,and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself.,Franz Kafka saw incompletion,when others would find only works to praise,,so much so that he wanted all of his diaries,,manuscripts, letters and even sketches,burned upon his death.,His friend refused to honor the request,,and because of that, we now have all the works,we now do by Kafka:,"America," "The Trial" and "The Castle,",a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence. 
 The pursuit of mastery, in other words,,is an ever-onward almost.,"Lord, grant that I desire,more than I can accomplish,",Michelangelo implored,,as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel,,and he himself was that Adam,with his finger outstretched,and not quite touching that God's hand. 
 Mastery is in the reaching, not the arriving.,It's in constantly wanting to close that gap,between where you are and where you want to be.,Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft,and not for the sake of crafting your career.,How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs,live out this phenomenon?,We see it even in the life,of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders,,who tells me that his triumphs,are not merely the result,of a grand achievement,,but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins. 
 We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge.,It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington,,who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire,was always the next one,,always the one he had yet to compose.,Part of the reason that the near win,is inbuilt to mastery,is because the greater our proficiency,,the more clearly we might see,that we don't know all that we thought we did.,It's called the Dunning–Kruger effect.,The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin,when they asked him,,"What do you think increases with knowledge?",and he said, "You learn how little you know." 
 Success motivates us, but a near win,can propel us in an ongoing quest.,One of the most vivid examples of this comes,when we look at the difference,between Olympic silver medalists,and bronze medalists after a competition.,Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell,studied this difference and found,that the frustration silver medalists feel,compared to bronze, who are typically a bit,more happy to have just not received fourth place,and not medaled at all,,gives silver medalists a focus,on follow-up competition.,We see it even in the gambling industry,that once picked up on this phenomenon,of the near win,and created these scratch-off tickets,that had a higher than average rate of near wins,and so compelled people to buy more tickets,that they were called heart-stoppers,,and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses,in Britain in the 1970s.,The reason the near win has a propulsion,is because it changes our view of the landscape,and puts our goals, which we tend to put,at a distance, into more proximate vicinity,to where we stand.,If I ask you to envision what angreat day looks like next week,,you might describe it in more general terms.,But if I ask you to describe angreat day at TED tomorrow,,you might describe it with granular, practical clarity.,And this is what a near win does.,It gets us to focus on what, right now,,we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.,It's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984,missed taking the gold in the heptathlon,by one third of a second,,and her husband predicted that would give her,the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition.,In 1988, she won the gold in the heptathlon,and set a record of 7,291 points,,a score that no athlete has come very close to since. 
 We thrive not when we've done it all,,but when we still have more to do.,I stand here thinking and wondering,about all the different ways,that we might even manufacture a near win,in this room,,how your lives might play this out,,because I think on some gut level we do know this.,We know that we thrive when we stay,at our own leading edge,,and it's why the deliberate incomplete,is inbuilt into creation myths.,In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women,would deliberately put an imperfection,in textiles and ceramics.,It's what's called a spirit line,,a deliberate flaw in the pattern,to give the weaver or maker a way out,,but also a reason to continue making work.,Masters are not experts because they take,a subject to its conceptual end.,They're masters because they realize,that there isn't one. 
 Now it occurred to me, as I thought about this,,why the archery coach,told me at the end of that practice,,out of earshot of his archers,,that he and his colleagues never feel,they can do enough for their team,,never feel there are enough visualization techniques,and posture drills to help them overcome,those constant near wins.,It didn't sound like a complaint, exactly,,but just a way to let me know,,a kind of tender admission,,to remind me that he knewnhe was giving himself over,to a voracious, unfinished path,that always required more. 
 We build out of the unfinished idea,,even if that idea is our former self.,This is the dynamic of mastery.,Coming close to what you thought you wanted,can help you attain more than you ever dreamed,you could.,It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray,was thinking when I saw her smiling,at those early paintings one day,in the galleries.,Even if we created utopias, I believe,we would still have the incomplete.,Completion is a goal,,but we hope it is never the end. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Twenty-three years ago,,at the age of 19,,I shot and killed a man.,I was a young drug dealer,with a quick temper,and a semi-automatic pistol. 
 But that wasn't the end of my story.,In fact, it was beginning,,and the 23 years since,is a story of acknowledgment,,apology and atonement.,But it didn't happen in the way,that you might imagine or think.,These things occurred in my life,in a way that was surprising,,especially to me. 
 See, like many of you,,growing up, I was an honor roll student,,a scholarship student,,with dreams of becoming a doctor.,But things went dramatically wrong,when my parents separated,and eventually divorced. 
 The actual events are pretty straightforward.,At the age of 17,,I got shot three times,standing on the corner of my block in Detroit.,My friend rushed me to the hospital.,Doctors pulled the bullets out,,patched me up,,and sent me back to the same nneighborhood where I got shot.,Throughout this ordeal,,no one hugged me,,no one counseled me,,no one told me I would be okay.,No one told me that I would live in fear,,that I would become paranoid,,or that I would react hyper-violently,to being shot.,No one told me that one day,,I would become the person behind the trigger.,Fourteen months later,,at 2 a.m.,,I fired the shots,that caused a man's death. 
 When I entered prison,,I was bitter, I was angry, I was hurt.,I didn't want to take responsibility.,I blamed everybody from my parents,to the system.,I rationalized my decision to shoot,because in the hood where I come from,,it's better to be the shooter,than the person getting shot.,As I sat in my cold cell,,I felt helpless,,unloved and abandoned.,I felt like nobody cared,,and I reacted,with hostility to my confinement.,And I found myself getting,deeper and deeper into trouble.,I ran black market stores,,I loan sharked,,and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled,into the prison.,I had in fact become,what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called,"the worst of the worst.",And because of my activity,,I landed in solitary confinement,for seven and a half years,out of my incarceration. 
 Now as I see it, solitary confinement,is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places,you can find yourself,,but find myself I did.,One day, I was pacing my cell,,when an officer came and delivered mail.,I looked at a couple of letters,before I looked at the letter,that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it.,And anytime I would get a letter from my son,,it was like a ray of light,in the darkest place you can imagine.,And on this particular day, I opened this letter,,and in capital letters, he wrote,,"My mama told me why you was in prison:,murder.",He said, "Dad, don't kill.,Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him." 
 Now, I wasn't religious at that time,,nor am I religious now,,but it was something so profound,about my son's words.,They made me examine things about my life,that I hadn't considered.,It was the first time in my life,that I had actually thought about the fact,that my son would see me as a murderer.,I sat back on my bunk,and I reflected on something I had read,in [Plato],,where Socrates stated in "Apology",that the unexamined life isn't worth living. 
 At that point is when the transformation began.,But it didn't come easy.,One of the things I realized,,which was part of the transformation,,was that there were four key things.,The first thing was,,I had great mentors.,Now, I know some of you all are probably thinking,,how did you find a great mentor in prison?,But in my case,,some of my mentors,who are serving life sentences,were some of the best peoplento ever come into my life,,because they forced me to look at my life honestly,,and they forced me to challenge myself,about my decision making. 
 The second thing was literature.,Prior to going to prison,,I didn't know that there were so many brilliant,black poets, authors and philosophers,,and then I had the great fortune,of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography,,and it shattered everynstereotype I had about myself. 
 The third thing was family.,For 19 years, my father stood by my side,with an unshakable faith,,because he believed that I had what it took,to turn my life around.,I also met an amazing woman,who is now the mother ofnmy two-year-old son Sekou,,and she taught me how to love myself,in a healthy way. 
 The final thing was writing.,When I got that letter from my son,,I began to write a journal,about things I had experienced in my childhood,and in prison,,and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea,of atonement.,Earlier in my incarceration, I had received,a letter from one of the relatives of my victim,,and in that letter,,she told me she forgave me,,because she realized I was a young child,who had been abused,and had been through some hardships,and just made a series of poor decisions.,It was the first time in my life,that I ever felt open to forgiving myself. 
 One of the things that happened,after that experience is that,I thought about the other men who were incarcerated,alongside of me,,and how much I wanted to share this with them.,And so I started talking to them about,some of their experiences,,and I was devastated to realize,that most of them came fromnthe same abusive environments,,And most of them wanted helpnand they wanted to turn it around,,but unfortunately the system,that currently holds 2.5 million people in prison,is designed to warehouse,as opposed to rehabilitate or transform.,So I made it up in my mind,that if I was ever released from prison,that I would do everything in my power,to help change that. 
 In 2010, I walked out of prison,for the first time after two decades.,Now imagine, if you will,,Fred Flintstone walking into an episode,of "The Jetsons.",That was pretty much what my life was like.,For the first time, I was exposed to the Internet,,social media,,cars that talk like KITT from "Knight Rider.",But the thing that fascinated me the most,was phone technology.,See, when I went to prison,,our car phones were this big,and required two people to carry them.,So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed,my little Blackberry,and I started learning how to text.,But the thing is, the people around me,,they didn't realize that I had no idea,what all these abbreviated texts meant,,like LOL, OMG, LMAO,,until one day I was having a conversation,with one of my friends via text,,and I asked him to do something,nand he responded back, "K.",And I was like, "What is K?",And he was like, "K is okay.",So in my head, I was like,,"Well what the hell is wrong with K?",And so I text him a question mark.,And he said, "K = okay.",And so I tap back, "FU." (Laughter),And then he texts back, and he asks me,why was I cussing him out.,And I said, "LOL FU,",as in, I finally understand.,(Laughter) 
 And so fast forward three years,,I'm doing relatively good.,I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab,,I work for an amazing company called BMe,,I teach at the University of Michigan,,but it's been a struggle,because I realize that there are more,men and women coming home,who are not going to benafforded those opportunities.,I've been blessed to work with some amazing,men and women,,helping others reenter society,,and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans.,He served 24 years for a crime he didn't commit.,He's 45 years old. He's currently enrolled in college.,And one of the things that we talked about,is the three things that I found important,in my personal transformation,,the first being acknowledgment.,I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others.,I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt.,The second thing was apologizing.,I had to apologize to the people I had hurt.,Even though I had no expectationsnof them accepting it,,it was important to do because it was the right thing.,But I also had to apologize to myself.,The third thing was atoning.,For me, atoning meant,going back into my community,and working with at-risk youth,who were on the same path,,but also becoming at one with myself. 
 Through my experience of being locked up,,one of the things I discovered is this:,the majority of men and women,who are incarcerated are redeemable,,and the fact is,,90 percent of the men andnwomen who are incarcerated,will at some point return to the community,,and we have a role in determining what kind,of men and women return to our community. 
 My wish today,is that we will embrace,a more empathetic approach,toward how we deal with mass incarceration,,that we will do away with,the lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality,,because it's proven it doesn't work. 
 My journey is a unique journey,,but it doesn't have to be that way.,Anybody can have a transformation,if we create the space for that to happen.,So what I'm asking today,is that you envision,a world where men and women,aren't held hostage to their pasts,,where misdeeds and mistakes,don't define you for the rest of your life.,I think collectively, we can create that reality,,and I hope you do too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was a young officer, they told me,to follow my instincts,,to go with my gut,,and what I've learned,is that often our instincts are wrong. 
 In the summer of 2010,,there was a massive leak of classified documents,that came out of the Pentagon.,It shocked the world,,it shook up the American government,,and it made people ask a lot of questions,,because the sheer amount of information,that was let out, and the potential impacts,,were significant.,And one of the first questions we asked ourselves,was why would a young soldier have access,to that much information?,Why would we let sensitive things,be with a relatively young person? 
 In the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command,a special operations task force,,and that task force was spread across the Mideast,to fight al Qaeda.,Our main effort was inside Iraq,,and our specified mission,was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.,For almost five years I stayed there,,and we focused on fighting a war,that was unconventional and it was difficult,and it was bloody,and it often claimed its highest price,among innocent people.,We did everything we could,to stop al Qaeda,and the foreign fighters thatncame in as suicide bombers,and as accelerants to the violence.,We honed our combat skills,,we developed new equipment,,we parachuted, we helicoptered,,we took small boats, we drove, and we walked,to objectives night after night to stop,the killing that this network was putting forward.,We bled,,we died,,and we killed to stop that organization,from the violence that they were putting,largely against the Iraqi people. 
 Now, we did what we knew,,how we had grown up, andnone of the things that we knew,,that was in our DNA, was secrecy.,It was security. It was protecting information.,It was the idea that information was the lifeblood,and it was what would protect and keep people safe.,And we had a sense that,,as we operated within our organizations,,it was important to keep information,in the silos within the organizations,,particularly only give information,to people had a demonstrated need to know.,But the question often came, who needed to know?,Who needed, who had to have the information,so that they could do the important nparts of the job that you needed?,And in a tightly coupled world,,that's very hard to predict.,It's very hard to know who needs to have information,and who doesn't.,I used to deal with intelligence agencies,,and I'd complain that they weren'tnsharing enough intelligence,,and with a straight face, they'dnlook at me and they'd say,,"What aren't you getting?" (Laughter),I said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem." 
 But what we found is we had to change.,We had to change our culture about information.,We had to knock down walls. We had to share.,We had to change from who needs to know,to the fact that who doesn't know,,and we need to tell, and tellnthem as quickly as we can.,It was a significant culture shift for an organization,that had secrecy in its DNA. 
 We started by doing things, by building,,not working in offices,,knocking down walls, working in things we called,situation awareness rooms,,and in the summer of 2007,,something happened which demonstrated this.,We captured the personnel records,for the people who were bringing foreign fighters,into Iraq.,And when we got the personnel records, typically,,we would have hidden these,,shared them with a few intelligence agencies,,and then try to operate with them.,But as I was talking to my intelligence officer,,I said, "What do we do?",And he said, "Well, you found them." Our command.,"You can just declassify them.",And I said, "Well, can we declassify them?,What if the enemy finds out?",And he says, "They're their personnel records.",(Laughter) 
 So we did,,and a lot of people got upset about that,,but as we passed that information around,,suddenly you find that information is only of value,if you give it to people who have the ability,to do something with it.,The fact that I know something has zero value,if I'm not the person who can actually,make something better because of it.,So as a consequence, what we did was,we changed the idea of information,,instead of knowledge is power,,to one where sharing is power.,It was the fundamental shift,,not new tactics, not new weapons,,not new anything else.,It was the idea that we were now part of a team,in which information became the essential link,between us, not a block between us. 
 And I want everybody to take a deep breath,and let it out,,because in your life, there's going to be information,that leaks out you're not going to like.,Somebody's going to get my college grades out,,a that's going to be a disaster. (Laughter),But it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that,I am more scared of the bureaucrat,that holds information in a desk drawer,or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks,,because ultimately, we'll be better off if we share. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Helen Walters: So I don't know ifnyou were here this morning,,if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett,,the deputy director of the NSA,who was responding to EdwardnSnowden's talk earlier this week.,I just wonder, do you think the American government,should give Edward Snowden amnesty? 
 Stanley McChrystal: I think thatnRick said something very important.,We, most people, don't know all the facts.,I think there are two parts of this.,Edward Snowden shined anlight on an important need,that people had to understand.,He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have,the knowledge to know the importance of,,so I think we need to learn the facts about this case,before we make snap judgments,about Edward Snowden.,HW: Thank you so much. Thank you.,(Applause)Good afternoon.,My name is Uldus.,I am a photo-based artist from Russia.,I started my way around six years ago,with ironic self-portraits,to lay open so many stereotypes,about nationalities, genders,,and social issues —,["I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with kids!"]n["Vodka = water. I love vodka!"] (Laughter) —,using photography as my tool to send a message.n["Marry me, I need a visa."] 
 Today, I am still performing in front of the camera,and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.,I focus on balancing meaningful message,,aesthetic, beauty, composition, nsome irony, and artifacts. 
 Today, I'm going to tell you about my project,,which is named Desperate Romantics.,They're my artifacts, or paintings,from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England,mid-19th century.,I took the painting,and gifted new, contemporary meaning,talking about issues which are surrounding me,in Russia,,capturing people who are non-models,but have an interesting story. 
 This boy is a professional dancer,,only 12 years old,,but at secondary school, he hides his dancing classes,and is wearing the mask of brutality,,trying to be united with the rest of his classmates,like a storm trooper has no personality.,But this boy has goals and dreams,but hides it to be socially accepted,,because being different isn't easy,,especially in Russia. 
 Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric.,And this is Nikita,,a security guard from one of the bars,in St. Petersburg.,He likes to say, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,",quoting Hulk from the movie,,but I've never seen him angry.,He hides his sensitivities and romantic side,,because in Russia, among guys,,that's not cool to be romantic,,but it's cool to be surrounded with women,and look like an aggressive hulk.,(Laughter) 
 Sometimes, in my project,,I would take the painting,and give it new meaning,and new temptation about it.,Sometimes, I would compare facial features,and playing with words:,irony, Iron Man, ironing man.,(Laughter) 
 Through the artifacts,,I bring social issues,which surround me in Russia into the conversation.,Interesting fact about marriage in Russia,,that most of the 18, 19-year-old girls,are already ready, and dream to get married.,We're taught from childhood,,successful marriage means successful life,,so most of the girls kind of fight,to get a good husband. 
 And what about me?,I'm 27 years old.,For Russian society, I'm an old maid,and hopeless to ever get married.,That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask,,in the wedding dress, all desperate in my garden.,But remember, irony is the key,,and this is actually to motivate girls,to fight for goals, for dreams,,and change stereotypes.,Be brave. Be ironic — it helps.,Be funny and create some magic. 
 (Applause)"Why?","Why?" is a question,that parents ask me all the time.,"Why did my child develop autism?",As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,,we try and address that question. 
 But autism is not a single condition.,It's actually a spectrum of disorders,,a spectrum that ranges, for instance,,from Justin, a 13-year-old boy,who's not verbal, who can't speak,,who communicates by using an iPad,to touch pictures to communicate,his thoughts and his concerns,,a little boy who, when he gets upset,,will start rocking,,and eventually, when he's disturbed enough,,will bang his head to the point,that he can actually cut it open and require stitches.,That same diagnosis of autism, though,,also applies to Gabriel,,another 13-year-old boy,who has quite a different set of challenges.,He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics.,He can multiple three numbers by three numbers,in his head with ease,,yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation,,he has great difficulty.,He doesn't make eye contact.,He has difficulty starting a conversation,,feels awkward,,and when he gets nervous,,he actually shuts down.,Yet both of these boys,have the same diagnosis ofnautism spectrum disorder. 
 One of the things that concerns us,is whether or not there really is,an epidemic of autism.,These days, one in 88 children,will be diagnosed with autism,,and the question is,,why does this graph look this way?,Has that number been increasing,dramatically over time?,Or is it because we have now started labeling,individuals with autism,,simply giving them a diagnosis,when they were still present there before,yet simply didn't have that label?,And in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,,legislation was passed,that actually provided individuals with autism,with resources, with access to educational materials,that would help them.,With that increased awareness, more parents,,more pediatricians, more educators,learned to recognize the features of autism.,As a result of that, more individuals were diagnosed,and got access to the resources they needed.,In addition, we've changed our definition over time,,so in fact we've widened the definition of autism,,and that accounts for some of,the increased prevalence that we see. 
 The next question everyone wonders is,,what caused autism?,And a common misconception,is that vaccines cause autism.,But let me be very clear:,Vaccines do not cause autism.,(Applause),In fact, the original research study,that suggested that was the case,was completely fraudulent.,It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet,,in which it was published,,and that author, a physician,,had his medical license taken away from him.,(Applause),The Institute of Medicine,,The Centers for Disease Control,,have repeatedly investigated this,and there is no credible evidence,that vaccines cause autism.,Furthermore,,one of the ingredients in vaccines,,something called thimerosal,,was thought to be what the cause of autism was.,That was actually removed from vaccines,in the year 1992,,and you can see that it really did not have an effect,in what happened with the prevalence of autism.,So again, there is no evidence,that this is the answer.,So the question remains, what does cause autism? 
 In fact, there's probably not one single answer.,Just as autism is a spectrum,,there's a spectrum of etiologies,,a spectrum of causes.,Based on epidemiological data,,we know that one of the causes,,or one of the associations, I should say,,is advanced paternal age,,that is, increasing age of the father,at the time of conception.,In addition, another vulnerable,and critical period in terms of development,is when the mother is pregnant.,During that period, whilenthe fetal brain is developing,,we know that exposure to certain agents,can actually increase the risk of autism.,In particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,,which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,,we know can increase that risk of autism.,In addition, there can be some infectious agents,that can also cause autism. 
 And one of the things I'm going to spend,a lot of time focusing on,are the genes that can cause autism.,I'm focusing on this not because genes,are the only cause of autism,,but it's a cause of autism,that we can readily define,and be able to better understand the biology,and understand better how the brain works,so that we can come up with strategies,to be able to intervene.,One of the genetic factors that we don't understand,,however, is the difference that we see,in terms of males and females.,Males are affected four to one compared to females,with autism,,and we really don't understand what that cause is. 
 One of the ways that we can understand,that genetics is a factor,is by looking at something called,the concordance rate.,In other words, if one sibling has autism,,what's the probability,that another sibling in that family will have autism?,And we can look in particular,at three types of siblings:,identical twins,,twins that actually share 100 percent,of their genetic information,and shared the same intrauterine environment,,versus fraternal twins,,twins that actually share 50 percent,of their genetic information,,versus regular siblings,,brother-sister, sister-sister,,also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information,,yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment.,And when you look at those concordance ratios,,one of the striking things that you will see,is that in identical twins,,that concordance rate is 77 percent.,Remarkably, though,,it's not 100 percent.,It is not that genes accountnfor all of the risk for autism,,but yet they account for a lot of that risk,,because when you look at fraternal twins,,that concordance rate is only 31 percent.,On the other hand, there is a difference,between those fraternal twins and the siblings,,suggesting that there are common exposures,for those fraternal twins,that may not be shared as commonly,with siblings alone. 
 So this provides some of the data,that autism is genetic.,Well, how genetic is it?,When we compare it to other conditions,that we're familiar with,,things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,,in fact, genetics plays a much larger role in autism,than it does in any of these other conditions.,But with this, that doesn'tntell us what the genes are.,It doesn't even tell us in any one child,,is it one gene,or potentially a combination of genes?,And so in fact, in some individuals with autism,,it is genetic!,That is, that it is one single,,powerful, deterministic gene,that causes the autism.,However, in other individuals,,it's genetic, that is,,that it's actually a combination of genes,in part with the developmental process,that ultimately determines that risk for autism.,We don't know in any one person, necessarily,,which of those two answers it is,until we start digging deeper. 
 So the question becomes,,how can we start to identify,what exactly those genes are.,And let me pose something,that might not be intuitive.,In certain individuals,,they can have autism,for a reason that is genetic,but yet not because of autism running in the family.,And the reason is because in certain individuals,,they can actually have genetic changes or mutations,that are not passed down from the mother,or from the father,,but actually start brand new in them,,mutations that are present,in the egg or the sperm,at the time of conception,but have not been passed down,generation through generation within the family.,And we can actually use that strategy,to now understand and to identify,those genes causing autism in those individuals.,So in fact, at the Simons Foundation,,we took 2,600 individuals,that had no family history of autism,,and we took that child and their mother and father,and used them to try and understand,what were those genes,causing autism in those cases?,To do that, we actually had to comprehensively,be able to look at all that genetic information,and determine what those differences were,between the mother, the father and the child.,In doing so, I apologize,,I'm going to use an outdated analogy,of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,,but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point,that as we did this inventory,,we needed to be able to look at,massive amounts of information.,Our genetic information is organized,into a set of 46 volumes,,and when we did that, we had to be able to account,for each of those 46 volumes,,because in some cases with autism,,there's actually a single volume that's missing.,We had to get more granular than that, though,,and so we had to start opening those books,,and in some cases, the genetic change,was more subtle.,It might have been a singlenparagraph that was missing,,or yet, even more subtle than that,,a single letter,,one out of three billion letters,that was changed, that was altered,,yet had profound effects,in terms of how the brain functions,and affects behavior.,In doing this within these families,,we were able to account for approximately,25 percent of the individuals,and determine that there was a single,powerful genetic factor,that caused autism within those families.,On the other hand, there's 75 percent,that we still haven't figured out. 
 As we did this, though,,it was really quite humbling,,because we realized that there was not simply,one gene for autism.,In fact, the current estimates are,that there are 200 to 400 different genes,that can cause autism.,And that explains, in part,,why we see such a broad spectrum,in terms of its effects.,Although there are that many genes,,there is some method to the madness.,It's not simply random,200, 400 different genes,,but in fact they fit together.,They fit together in a pathway.,They fit together in a network,that's starting to make sense now,in terms of how the brain functions.,We're starting to have a bottom-up approach,where we're identifying those genes,,those proteins, those molecules,,understanding how they interact together,to make that neuron work,,understanding how those neurons interact together,to make circuits work,,and understand how those circuits work,to now control behavior,,and understand that both in individuals with autism,as well as individuals who have normal cognition.,But early diagnosis is a key for us.,Being able to make that diagnosis,of someone who's susceptible,at a time in a window,where we have the ability to transform,,to be able to impact,that growing, developing brain is critical.,And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods,to be able to take infants, small babies,,and be able to use biomarkers,,in this case eye contact and eye tracking,,to identify an infant at risk.,This particular infant, you can see,,making very good eye contact with this woman,as she's singing "Itsy, Bitsy Spider,",in fact is not going to develop autism.,This baby we know is going to be in the clear.,On the other hand, this other baby,is going to go on to develop autism.,In this particular child, you can see,,it's not making good eye contact.,Instead of the eyes focusing in,and having that social connection,,looking at the mouth, looking at the nose,,looking off in another direction,,but not again socially connecting,,and being able to do this on a very large scale,,screen infants, screen children for autism,,through something very robust, very reliable,,is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being,able to intervene at an early stage,when we can have the greatest impact. 
 How are we going to intervene?,It's probably going to be a combination of factors.,In part, in some individuals,,we're going to try and use medications.,And so in fact, identifying the genes for autism,is important for us,to identify drug targets,,to identify things that we might be able to impact,and can be certain that that's really,what we need to do in autism.,But that's not going to be the only answer.,Beyond just drugs, we're goingnto use educational strategies.,Individuals with autism,,some of them are wired a little bit differently.,They learn in a different way.,They absorb their surroundings in a different way,,and we need to be able to educate them,in a way that serves them best.,Beyond that, there are a lot of individuals,in this room who have great ideas,in terms of new technologies we can use,,everything from devices we can use to train the brain,to be able to make it more efficient,and to compensate for areas in which,it has a little bit of trouble,,to even things like Google Glass.,You could imagine, for instance, Gabriel,,with his social awkwardness,,might be able to wear Google Glass,with an earpiece in his ear,,and have a coach be able to help him,,be able to help think about conversations,,conversation-starters,,being able to even perhaps one day,invite a girl out on a date. 
 All of these new technologies,just offer tremendous opportunities,for us to be able to impact,the individuals with autism,,but yet we have a long way to go.,As much as we know,,there is so much more that we don't know,,and so I invite all of you,to be able to help us think about,how to do this better,,to use as a community our collective wisdom,to be able to make a difference,,and in particular,,for the individuals in families with autism,,I invite you to join the interactive autism network,,to be part of the solution to this,,because it's going to take really a lot of us,to think about what's important,,what's going to be a meaningful difference.,As we think about something,that's potentially a solution,,how well does it work?,Is it something that's reallyngoing to make a difference,in your lives, as an individual,,as a family with autism?,We're going to need individuals of all ages,,from the young to the old,,and with all different shapes and sizes,of the autism spectrum disorder,to make sure that we can have an impact.,So I invite all of you to join the mission,and to help to be able to make the lives,of individuals with autism,so much better and so much richer.,Thank you.,(Applause)The Earth needs no introduction.,It needs no introduction in part nbecause the Apollo 17 astronauts,,when they were hurtling naround the moon in 1972,,took this iconic image.,It galvanized a whole ngeneration of human beings,to realize that we're on nSpaceship Earth,,fragile and finite as it is,,and that we need nto take care of it.,But while this picturenis beautiful, it's static,,and the Earth is constantly changing.,It's changing on days' timenscales with human activity.,And the satellite imagery we nhave of it today is old.,Typically, years old.,And that's important becausenyou can't fix what you can't see.,What we'd ideally want is imagesnof the whole planet every day.,So, what's standing in our way? 
 What's the problem?,This is the problem:,Satellites are big, expensive nand they're slow.,This one weighs three tons.,It's six meters tall, four meters wide.,It took up the entire fairingnof a rocket just to launch it.,One satellite, one rocket.,It cost 855 million dollars.,Satellites like these have ndone an amazing job,at helping us to understand our planet.,But if we want to understand nit much more regularly,,we need lots of satellites,,and this model isn't scalable. 
 So me and my friends, nwe started Planet Labs,to make satellites ultra-compact,and small and highly capable.,I'm going to show you what nour satellite looks like:,This is our satellite. 
 This is not a scale model,,this is the real size.,It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,,it weighs four kilograms,,and we've stuffed the latest nand greatest electronics,and sensor systems into nthis little package,so that even though this is really small,,this can take pictures 10 times thenresolution of the big satellite here,,even though it weighs one nthousandth of the mass.,And we call this satellite n"Dove" — Thank you.,(Applause),We call this satellite "Dove,",and we call it "Dove" because nsatellites are typically named,after birds, but normally birds of prey:,like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, nKill, I don't know,,Kestrel, these sort of things.,But ours have a nhumanitarian mission,,so we wanted to call them Doves.,And we haven't just nbuilt them, though.,We've launched them.,And not just one, but many. 
 It all started in our garage.,Yes, we built our first satellitenprototype in our garage.,Now, this is pretty normal for anSilicon Valley company that we are,,but we believe it's the first time nfor a space company.,And that's not the only tricknwe learned from Silicon Valley.,We rapidly prototype our satellites.,We use "release early, nrelease often" on our software.,And we take a different nrisk approach.,We take them outside and test them.,We even put satellites in spacenjust to test the satellites,,and we've learned to manufacturenour satellites at scale.,We've used modern production techniques,so we can build large numbers of them,,I think for the first time.,We call it agile aerospace,,and that's what's enabled us to putnso much capability into this little box. 
 Now, what has bonded nour team over the years,is the idea of democratizingnaccess to satellite information.,In fact, the founders of our ncompany, Chris, Robbie and I,,we met over 15 years ago nat the United Nations,when they were hosting a conference nabout exactly that question:,How do you use satellites nto help humanity?,How do you use satellites to help npeople in developing countries,or with climate change?,And this is what has bonded us.,Our entire team is passionate aboutnusing satellites to help humanity.,You could say nwe're space geeks,,but not only do we care nabout what's up there,,we care about what's down here, too. 
 I'm going to show you a video,from just four weeks ago nof two of our satellites,being launched from thenInternational Space Station.,This is not an animation,,this is a video taken by the astronaut nlooking out of the window.,It gives you a bit of a sense of nscale of our two satellites.,It's like some of the nsmallest satellites ever,are being launched from nthe biggest satellite ever.,And right at the end, thensolar array glints in the sun.,It's really cool. Wait for it.,Boom! Yeah. It's the money shot.,(Laughter) 
 So we didn't just launch ntwo of them like this,,we launched 28 of them.,It's the largest constellation ofnEarth-imaging satellites in human history,,and it's going to provide ancompletely radical new data set,about our changing planet.,But that's just the beginning.,You see, we're going to launchnmore than 100 of these satellites,like these over the ncourse of the next year.,It's going to be the largest constellationnof satellites in human history.,And this is what it's going to do:,Acting in a single-orbit plane that nstays fixed with respect to the sun,,the Earth rotates underneath.,They're all cameras pointed down,,and they slowly scan across as nthe Earth rotates underneath.,The Earth rotates every 24 hours,,so we scan every point on the nplanet every 24 hours.,It's a line scanner for the planet.,We don't take a picture of nanywhere on the planet every day,,we take a picture of every singlenplace on the planet every day.,Even though we launched thesenjust a couple of weeks ago,,we've already got some initialnimagery from the satellites,and I'm going to show itnpublicly for the first time right now.,This is the very first picturentaken by our satellite.,It happened to be over nUC-Davis' campus,in California when we nturned the camera on.,But what's even cooler is when,we compare it to the previousnlatest image of that area,,which was taken many months ago.,And the image on the left nis from our satellite,,and we see buildings are being built.,The general point is that we will be ablento track urban growth as it happens,around the whole worldnin all cities, every day. 
 Water as well. 
 Thank you.,(Applause) 
 We'll be able to see nthe extent of all water bodies,around the whole world every daynand help water security.,From water security nto food security.,We'll see crops as they ngrow in all the fields,in every farmer's field aroundnthe planet every day.,and help them to improve crop yield.,This is a beautiful image that was taken,just a few hours ago when the nsatellite was flying over Argentina.,The general point is,there are probably hundreds and nthousands of applications of this data,,I've mentioned a few, but there's others:,deforestation, the ice caps melting.,We can track all of these things,nevery tree on the planet every day.,If you took the difference betweenntoday's image and yesterday's image,,you'd see much of the world news —nyou'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.,And we have decided, therefore, that the nbest thing that we could do with our data,is to ensure universal access to it.,We want to ensure everyone can see it.,Thank you. (Applause),We want to empower NGOs and ncompanies and scientists and journalists,to be able to answer the questionsnthat they have about the planet.,We want to enable the developer communitynto run their apps on our data.,In short, we want to democratize accessnto information about our planet. 
 Which brings me back to this.,You see, this will be an entirelynnew global data set.,And we believe that together,,we can help to take care nof our Spaceship Earth.,And what I would like to leavenyou with is the following question:,If you had access to imagery of thenwhole planet every single day,,what would you do with that data?,What problems would you solve?,What exploration would you do?,Well, I invite you to comenand explore with us. 
 Thank you very much.

 Congratulations.,You have now completed the test.,You are all human. 
 (Applause)Puzzles,and magic.,I work in what most people think,are two distinct fields,,but I believe they are the same.,I am both a magician and,a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,,which basically means I've taken,the world's two nerdiest hobbies,and combined them into one career.,And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same,because they both key into one of,the most important human drives:,the urge to solve.,Human beings are wired to solve,,to make order out of chaos. 
 It's certainly true for me.,I've been solving my whole life.,High school consisted of epicnScrabble matches in the cafeteria,and not really talking to girls,,and then at about that time,I started learning magic tricks,and definitely not talking to girls.,There's nothing like starting a conversation with,,"Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth,20 points in Scrabble?",But back then, I noticed an intersection,between puzzles and illusion.,When you do the crossword puzzle,or when you watch a magic show,,you become a solver,,and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,,the chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,,a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,,or a shuffled pack of playing cards.,And today, as a cruciverbalist —,23 points —,and an illusion designer, I create that chaos.,I test your ability to solve. 
 Now, it turns out research tells us,that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.,From birth, we are wired to solve.,In one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital,were shown patterns, patterns like this:,circle, cross, circle, cross.,And then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.,And by tracking an infant's gaze,,we know that newborns as young as a day old,can notice and respond to disruptions in order.,It's remarkable.,So from infancy through old age,,the urge to solve unites us all,,and I even found this photo on Instagram,of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle,with her morning coffee. 
 Like.,(Laughter) 
 Now, solving exists across all cultures.,The American invention is the crossword puzzle,,and this year we are celebrating,the 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,,first published in The New York World.,But many other cultures haventheir signature puzzles as well.,China gives us tangrams,,which would test solvers' abilities,to form shapes from the jumbled pieces.,Chaos. Order.,Order.,And order.,That one's my favorite, let's hear it again.,Okay.,And how about this puzzle,invented in 18th-century England:,the jigsaw puzzle.,Is this not making order out of chaos? 
 So as you can see,,we are always solving.,We are always trying to decode our world.,It's an eternal quest.,It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about,in "Don Quixote,",which by the way is the root of the word "quixotry,",the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,,365 points.,But anyway, "Don Quixote" is an important book.,You guys have read "Don Quixote," yes?,I'm seeing some heads nod.,Come on guys, really?,Who's read "Don Quixote?" Let's do this.nRaise your hands if you've read "Don Quixote.",There we go. Smart audience.,Who's read "Don Quixote?" Get them up. 
 Okay, good, because I need somebody smart here,because now I'm going to demonstrate,with the help of one of you,just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,,just how wired to solve all of you really are,,so I'm going to come into the audience,and find somebody to help me.,Let's see.,Everybody's looking away all of a sudden.,Can I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.,I'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.,Come with me, Gwen. Everyone give her na round of applause, make her feel welcome.,Gwen, after you.,(Applause) 
 Are you so excited?,Did you know that your name is worth,eight points in Scrabble?,Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here. 
 Now, Gwen, before we begin,,I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,,which is here in this envelope,,and I will not go near it. Okay?,And over here we have andrawing of some farm animals.,You can see we have an owl, we have a horse,,a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,,and then here, Gwen, we have,some fancy art store markers,,colors like, can you see that word right there?,Gwen: Cobalt.nDavid Kwong: Cobalt, yes. Cobalt.,But we have a silver, a red, an emerald,,and an amber marker,,and Gwen, you are going to color this drawing,just like you were five years old,,one marker at a time.,It's going to be a lot of fun.,But I'm going to go over here.,I don't want to see what you're doing.,Okay, so don't start yet.,Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes.,Now Gwen, are you ready? 
 Pick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,,and why don't you color in the horse for me?,Color in the horse — big, big, big scribbles,,broad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.,All right. Great.,And why don't you take that marker and recap it,and place it on the table for me.,Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cup,and take off the cap,and color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.,Big scribbles.,Okay, cool, and re-cap that marker,and place it on the table.,And pick up another marker for me,and take off the cap. Isn't this fun?,And color in the owl for me.,Color in the owl.,Okay, and recap that marker,and pick up another marker out of the cup,and color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.,Good, good, good, good, good.,Big, big, big strokes. Good, good.,Pick up another marker out of the cup,and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.,Okay, good.,A lot of color on that, and recap,nand place it on the table,,and pick up another marker out of the cup.,Oh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.,Did I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.,This is still going to work, though.,I think this is still going to work, mostly. 
 So Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.,Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet,,but I am going to write down your choices,so that everybody can see,the choices that you made.,Okay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,,amber owl,,a silver ox,,yes, okay, a red donkey,,and what was the emerald color? A rooster.,An emerald rooster. Okay. 
 Now for the moment of truth, Gwen,,we're going to take a look in that envelope.,Why don't you open it up and remove,the one piece of paper from inside,and hand it to me,,and we will see if it matches your choices.,Yes, I think it does.,We have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,,we have an amber owl, we havenan emerald rooster, a silver ox,,I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,,but that's a pretty amazingncoincidence, don't you think?,Gwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause),I'll take that back from you. 
 So ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?,How is this possible? Well, could it be,that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve,that she decoded hidden messages?,Well this is the puzzle I present to you.,Could there be order,in the chaos that I created?,Let's take a closer look.,Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?,What image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.,The plot thickens.,And then we played a game of tangrams,with an emerald rooster.,That one's my favorite.,And then we had an experiment with a silver ox.,And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee,out of an amber owl.,Thank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.,Oh, and there's one more, there's one more.,I believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.,Ladies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands,for me if you've read "Don Quixote?",Who's read "Don Quixote?" (Laughter),But wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.,There's more.,Gwen, I was so confident,that you were going to make these choices,that I made another prediction,,and I put it in an even more indelible place,,and it's right here.,Ladies and gentlemen,,we have today's New York Times.,The date is March 18th, 2014.,Many of you in the first couple of rows,have it underneath your seats as well.,Really dig. We hid them under there.,See if you can fish out the newspaper,and open up to the arts section,and you will find the crossword puzzle,,and the crossword puzzle today,was written by yours truly.,You can see my name above the grid.,I'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.,And I will also put it up on the screen.,Now let's take a look,at another piece of the puzzle.,If you look at the first clue for 1-across,,it starts with the letter C, for corrupt,,and just below that we have an O, for outfielder,,and if you keep reading thenfirst letters of the clues down,,you get cobalt horse,,amber owl, silver ox,,red donkey, and emerald rooster.,(Applause),That's pretty cool, right?,It's The New York Times.,But wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.,Oh, Gwen,,do you recall how I forgot my purple marker,,and you were unable to color the sheep?,Well, if you keep reading,starting with 25-down,,it says,,"Oh, by the way,,the sheep can be left blank.",(Laughter) (Applause),But wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,,there's one more thing,,there's one final piece of the puzzle.,Gwen, I am so grateful for your choices,because if we take a look,at the first letters of your combinations,,we get "C-H-A-O-S" for chaos,and "O-R-D-E-R" for order.,That's chaos and order.,We've all made order out of chaos. 
 So ladies and gentlemen, the next time,you find yourself with a puzzle,,whether it's in your life or in your work,,or maybe it's at the Sunday morning,breakfast table with The New York Times,,remember, you are all wired to solve. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Pat Mitchell: That day,,January 8, 2011, began like all others.,You were both doing the work that you love.,You were meeting with constituents,,which is something that you loved doing,as a congresswoman,,and Mark, you were happily preparing,for your next space shuttle.,And suddenly, everything nthat you had planned,or expected in your lives,was irrevocably changed forever. 
 Mark Kelly: Yeah, it's amazing,,it's amazing how neverything can change,for any of us in an instant.,People don't realize that.,I certainly didn't.,Gabby Giffords: Yes.,MK: And on that Saturday morning,,I got this horrible phone call,from Gabby's chief of staff.,She didn't have much other information.,She just said, "Gabby was shot.",A few minutes later, I called her back,and I actually thought for a second,,well, maybe I just imagined ngetting this phone call.,I called her back, and nthat's when she told me,that Gabby had been shot in the head.,And from that point on,,I knew that our lives were ngoing to be a lot different. 
 PM: And when you arrived at the hospital,,what was the prognosis that they gave you,about Gabby's condition nand what recovery, if any,,you could expect? 
 MK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head,and a traumatic brain injury,,they typically can't tell you much.,Every injury is different. It's not predictable,like often a stroke might be predictable,,which is another TBI kind of injury.,So they didn't know how longnGabby would be in a coma,,didn't know when that would change,and what the prognosis would be. 
 PM: Gabby, has your recovery,been an effort to create na new Gabby Giffords,or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords? 
 GG: The new one -- better, stronger, tougher.,(Applause) 
 MK: That to say,,when you look at the picture behind us,,to come back from that kind of injury,and come back strong nand stronger than ever,is a really tough thing to do.,I don't know anybody,that's as tough as my nwonderful wife right here.,(Applause) 
 PM: And what were the first signs,that recovery was not nonly going to be possible,but you were going to have some semblance,of the life that you and Gabby had planned? 
 MK: Well, the first thing, for me, was,Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious,,but she did something when shenwas in the ICU hospital bed,that she used to do when we might,be out to dinner at a restaurant,,in that she pulled my ring off,and she flipped it from one finger to the next,,and at that point I knew,that she was still in there.,PM: And there were certain words, too.,Didn't she surprise you with nwords in the beginning? 
 MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning.nGG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. 
 MK: Yeah, that was it.,For the first month, that was the extent,of Gabby's vocabulary.,For some reason, she has aphasia,,which is difficulty with communication.,She latched on to the word "chicken,",which isn't the best but ncertainly is not the worst.,(Laughter),And we were actually worried,it could have been a lot worse than that.,PM: Gabby, what's been nthe toughest challenge,for you during this recovery? 
 GG: Talking. Really hard. Really. 
 MK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabbynknows what she wants to say,,she just can't get it out.,She understands everything,,but the communication is just very difficult,because when you look at the picture,,the part of your brain wherenthose communication centers are,are on the left side of your head,,which is where the bullet passed through. 
 PM: So you have to do na very dangerous thing:,speak for your wife. 
 MK: I do.,It might be some of the mostndangerous things I've ever done. 
 PM: Gabby, are you optimistic,about your continuing recovery --,walking, talking,,being able to move your arm and leg? 
 GG: I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul,,but I'm optimistic. 
 PM: That seems to be the number one ncharacteristic of Gabby Giffords,,wouldn't you say? (Applause) 
 MK: Gabby's always been really optimistic.,She works incredibly hard every day. 
 GG: On the treadmill, nwalked on my treadmill,,Spanish lessons, French horn. 
 MK: It's only my wife who could be --,and if you knew her before she was injured,,you would kind of understand this --,somebody who could be injured,and have such a hard time communicating,and meets with a speech therapist,,and then about a month ago, she says,,"I want to learn Spanish again." 
 PM: Well, let's take a little closer look,at the wife, and this was even before,you met Gabby Giffords.,And she's on a motor scooter there,,but it's my understanding that's a very tame image,of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up. 
 MK: Yeah, Gabby, she nused to race motorcycles.,So that's a scooter, but she had --,well, she still has a BMW motorcycle. 
 PM: Does she ride it?nMK: Well, that's a challenge,with not being able to move her right arm,,but I think with somethingnI know about, Velcro,,we might be able to get her back on the bike,,Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar. 
 PM: I have a feeling we might nsee that picture next,,Gabby.,But you meet, you're already decided,that you're going to dedicate nyour life to service.,You're going into the military,and eventually to become an astronaut.,So you meet.,What attracts you to Gabby? 
 MK: Well, when we met, oddly enough,,it was the last time we were in Vancouver,,about 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver,,at the airport, on a trip nthat we were both taking,to China,,that I would actually, from my background,,I would call it a boondoggle.,Gabby would —nGG: Fact-finding mission. 
 MK: She would call it annimportant fact-finding mission.,She was a state senator at the time,,and we met here, at the airport,,before a trip to China. 
 PM: Would you describe it nas a whirlwind romance? 
 GG: No, no, no.,(Laughter),A good friend. 
 MK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time. 
 GG: Yes. (Laughter) 
 MK: And then she invited menon, about a year or so later,,she invited me on a date.,Where'd we go, Gabby? 
 GG: Death row. 
 MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row,at the Florence state prison in Arizona,,which was just outside nGabby's state senate district.,They were working on some legislation,that had to do with crime and punishment,and capital punishment nin the state of Arizona.,So she couldn't get anybody nelse to go with her,,and I'm like, "Of course I nwant to go to death row.",So that was our first date.,We've been together ever since.nGG: Yes. 
 PM: Well, that might have contributed to the reason,that Gabby decided to marry you.,You were willing to go to death row, after all. 
 MK: I guess. 
 PM: Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark? 
 GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends. 
 MK: I thought we always,had a very special relationship.,We've gone through some tough times,and it's only made it stronger.nGG: Stronger. 
 PM: After you got married, however,,you continued very independent lives.,Actually, you didn't even live together. 
 MK: We had one of those commuter marriages.,In our case, it was Washington, D.C., Houston,,Tucson.,Sometimes we'd go clockwise,,sometimes counterclockwise,,to all those different places,,and we didn't really live together,until that Saturday morning.,Within an hour of Gabby being shot,,I was on an airplane to Tucson,,and that was the moment,where that had changed things. 
 PM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress,after being a state senator,and served in Congress for six years.,What did you like best,about being in Congress? 
 GG: Fast pace. Fast pace. 
 PM: Well it was the way you did it.nGG: Yes, yes. Fast pace. 
 PM: I'm not sure people wouldndescribe it entirely that way.,(Laughter) 
 MK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often,at a colossally slow pace,,but my wife, and I have to admit,,a lot of other members of Congress that I know,,work incredibly hard.,I mean, Gabby would run naround like a crazy person,,never take a day off,,maybe a half a day off a month,,and whenever she was awake she was working,,and she really, really thrived on that,,and still does today.nGG: Yes. Yes. 
 PM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house,,I have to say.,So after the tragic incident, Mark,,you decided to resign,your position as an astronaut,,even though you were supposed to take,the next space mission.,Everybody, including Gabby,,talked you into going back,,and you did end up taking. 
 MK: Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured,,I called my boss, the chief astronaut,,Dr. Peggy Whitson, and I said,,"Peggy, I know I'm launching in space,in three months from now.,Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson.,You've got to find a replacement for me.",So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut,,but I gave up my job and they found a replacement.,Months later, maybe about two months later,,I started about getting my job back,,which is something,,when you become this primary caregiver person,,which some people in the audience here,have certainly been in that position,,it's a challenging role but at some point,you've got to figure out whennyou're going to get your life back,,and at the time, I couldn't ask Gabby,if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again.,But I knew she was—nGG: Yes. Yes. Yes. 
 MK: She was the biggest nsupporter of my career,,and I knew it was the right thing to do. 
 PM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark,,what that was like, going off onto a mission,,one presumes safely, nbut it's never a guarantee,,and knowing that Gabby is — 
 MK: Well not only was nshe still in the hospital,,on the third day of that flight,,literally while I was,rendezvousing with the space station,,and you've got two vehiclesnmoving at 17,500 miles an hour,,I'm actually flying it, looking out the window,,a bunch of computers,,Gabby was in brain surgery,,literally at that time having the final surgery,to replace the piece of skull,that they took out on the day she was injured,with a prosthetic, yeah, whichnis the whole side of her head.,Now if any of you guys would ever come,to our house in Tucson for the first time,,Gabby would usually go up to the freezer,and pull out the piece of Tupperware,that has the real skull. (Laughter) 
 GG: The real skull.nMK: Which freaks people out, sometimes. 
 PM: Is that for appetizer or dessert, Mark? 
 MK: Well, it just gets the conversation going. 
 PM: But there was a lot nof conversation about,something you did, Gabby, after Mark's flight.,You had to make another nstep of courage too,,because here was nCongress deadlocked again,,and you got out of the rehabilitation center,,got yourself to Washington,so that you could walk non the floor of the House --,I can barely talk about thisnwithout getting emotional —,and cast a vote which could have been,the deciding vote. 
 GG: The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling. 
 MK: Yeah, we had that vote,,I guess about five months after Gabby was injured,,and she made this bold decision to go back.,A very controversial vote,,but she wanted to be there,to have her voice heard one more time. 
 PM: And after that, resigned,and began what has been a very slow,and challenging recovery.,What's life like, day to day? 
 MK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson. 
 GG: Nelson. 
 MK: New member of our family.nGG: Yes, yes. 
 MK: And we got him from a— 
 GG: Prison. Murder.nMK: We have a lot of connections,with prisons, apparently. (Laughter),Nelson came from a prison,,raised by a murderer in Massachusetts.,But she did a great job with this dog.,He's a fabulous service dog. 
 PM: So Gabby, what have you learned,from your experiences the past few years? 
 MK: Yeah, what have you learned?nGG: Deeper. Deeper. 
 PM: Your relationship is deeper.,It has to be. You're together all the time now. 
 MK: I imagine being grateful, too, right? 
 GG: Grateful. 
 PM: This is a picture of nfamily and friends gathering,,but I love these pictures because they show,the Gabby and Mark relationship now.,And you describe it, Gabby, over and over,,as deeper on so many levels. Yes? 
 MK: I think when something tragic happens,in a family, it can pull people together.,Here's us watching the space shuttle,fly over Tucson,,the Space Shuttle Endeavour,,the one that I was the ncommander on its last flight,,on its final flight on top of an airplane,on a 747 on its way to L.A.,,NASA was kind enough nto have it fly over Tucson. 
 PM: And of course, the two of you,go through these challenges,of a slow and difficult recovery,,and yet, Gabby, how do you maintain,your optimism and positive outlook? 
 GG: I want to make the world a better place.,(Applause) 
 PM: And you're doing that,even though your recovery has to remain,front and center for both of you.,You are people who have done service,to your country and you nare continuing to do that,with a new initiative, a new purpose.,And Gabby, what's on the agenda now? 
 GG: Americans for Responsible Solutions. 
 MK: That's our political action committee,,where we are trying to nget members of Congress,to take a more serious look atngun violence in this country,,and to try to,pass some reasonable legislation. 
 GG: Yes. Yes. (Applause) 
 MK: You know, this affected nus very personally,,but it wasn't what happenednto Gabby that got us involved.,It was really the 20 murdered first graders,and kindergartners in Newtown, Connecticut,,and the response that we saw afterwards,where -- well, look what's happened so far.,So far the national response has been,pretty much to do nothing.,We're trying to change that. 
 PM: There have been 11 mass shootings,since Newtown,,a school a week in the first ntwo months of last year.,What are you doing that's different,than other efforts to balance,rights for gun ownership and responsibilities? 
 MK: We're gun owners, nwe support gun rights.,At the same time, we've ngot to do everything we can,to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,and the dangerously mentally ill.,It's not too difficult to do that.,This issue, like many others,,has become very polarizing and political,,and we're trying to bring some balance,to the debate in Washington. 
 PM: Thank you both for that effort.,And not surprisingly for nthis woman of courage,and of a sense of adventure,,you just keep challenging yourself,,and the sky seems to be the limit.,I have to share this video,of your most recent adventure.,Take a look at Gabby. 
 MK: This is a couple months ago. 
 (Video) MK: You okay? You did great.nGG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you.,Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh, thank you.,Mountains. Gorgeous mountains.,(Applause) 
 MK: Let me just say,one of the guys that Gabby jumped with,that day was a Navy SEAL,who she met in Afghanistan,who was injured in combat,,had a really rough time.,Gabby visited him,when he was at Bethesda,and went through a really tough period.,He started doing better.,Months later, Gabby was shot in the head,,and then he supported her,while she was in the hospital in Houston.,So they have a very, very nice connection. 
 GG: Yes. 
 PM: What a wonderful moment.,Because this is the TED stage,,Gabby, I know you worked very hard,to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave,with this audience. 
 GG: Thank you.,Hello, everyone.,Thank you for inviting us here today.,It's been a long, hard haul,,but I'm getting better.,I'm working hard,,lots of therapy -- speech therapy,,physical therapy, and yoga too.,But my spirit is strong as ever.,I'm still fighting to make nthe world a better place,,and you can too.,Get involved with your community.,Be a leader. Set an example.,Be passionate. Be courageous.,Be your best. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 MK: Thank you.nGG: Thank you. 
 (Applause),MK: Thank you everybody.nGG: Bye bye. (Applause)When I was born,,there was really only one book,about how to raise your children,,and it was written by Dr. Spock.,(Laughter),Thank you for indulging me.,I have always wanted to do that. 
 No, it was Benjamin Spock,,and his book was called "The CommonnSense Book of Baby And Child Care.",It sold almost 50 million copies nby the time he died.,Today, I, as the mother of a six-year-old,,walk into Barnes and Noble,,and see this.,And it is amazing,the variety that one finds non those shelves.,There are guides to raising nan eco-friendly kid,,a gluten-free kid,,a disease-proof kid,,which, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.,There are guides to raising a bilingual kid,even if you only speak one language at home.,There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid,and a science-minded kid,and a kid who is a whiz at yoga.,Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse,a nuclear bomb,,there is pretty much a guide to everything. 
 All of these books are well-intentioned.,I am sure that many of them are great.,But taken together, I am sorry,,I do not see help,when I look at that shelf.,I see anxiety.,I see a giant candy-colored monument,to our collective panic,,and it makes me want to know,,why is it that raising our children,is associated with so much anguish,and so much confusion?,Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens,about the one thing human beings,have been doing successfully for millennia,,long before parenting message boards,and peer-reviewed studies came along?,Why is it that so many mothers and fathers,experience parenthood as a kind of crisis? 
 Crisis might seem like a strong word,,but there is data suggesting it probably isn't.,There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name,,"Parenthood as Crisis," published in 1957,,and in the 50-plus years since,,there has been plenty of scholarship,documenting a pretty clear pattern,of parental anguish.,Parents experience more stress than non-parents.,Their marital satisfaction is lower.,There have been a number of studies,looking at how parents feel,when they are spending time with their kids,,and the answer often is, not so great.,Last year, I spoke with a researcher,named Matthew Killingsworth,who is doing a very, very imaginative project,that tracks people's happiness,,and here is what he told me he found:,"Interacting with your friends,is better than interacting with your spouse,,which is better than interacting with other relatives,,which is better than interacting with acquaintances,,which is better than interacting with parents,,which is better than interacting with children.,Who are on par with strangers.",(Laughter) 
 But here's the thing.,I have been looking at what underlies these data,for three years,,and children are not the problem.,Something about parenting right now at this moment,is the problem.,Specifically, I don't think we know,what parenting is supposed to be.,Parent, as a verb,,only entered common usage in 1970.,Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed.,The roles of our children have changed.,We are all now furiously improvising,our way through a situation,for which there is no script,,and if you're an amazing jazz musician,,then improv is great,,but for the rest of us,,it can kind of feel like a crisis. 
 So how did we get here?,How is it that we are all now navigating,a child-rearing universe,without any norms to guide us?,Well, for starters, there has been,a major historical change.,Until fairly recently,,kids worked, on our farms primarily,,but also in factories, mills, mines.,Kids were considered economic assets.,Sometime during the Progressive Era,,we put an end to this arrangement.,We recognized kids had rights,,we banned child labor,,we focused on education instead,,and school became a child's new work.,And thank God it did.,But that only made a parent's role,more confusing in a way.,The old arrangement might not have been,particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.,We provided food, clothing, shelter,,and moral instruction to our kids,,and they in return provided income. 
 Once kids stopped working,,the economics of parenting changed.,Kids became, in the words of one,brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist,,"economically worthless but emotionally priceless.",Rather than them working for us,,we began to work for them,,because within only a matter of decades,it became clear:,if we wanted our kids to succeed,,school was not enough.,Today, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work,,but that's work for us too,,because we are the onesndriving them to soccer practice.,Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work,,but that's also work for us,,because we have to check it.,About three years ago, a Texas woman,told something to me,that totally broke my heart.,She said, almost casually,,"Homework is the new dinner.",The middle class now pours all of its time,and energy and resources into its kids,,even though the middle class,has less and less of those things to give.,Mothers now spend more time with their children,than they did in 1965,,when most women were not even in the workforce. 
 It would probably be easier for parents,to do their new roles,if they knew what they were preparing their kids for.,This is yet another thing thatnmakes modern parenting,so very confounding.,We have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any,,is of use to our kids.,The world is changing so rapidly,,it's impossible to say.,This was true even when I was young.,When I was a kid, high school specifically,,I was told that I would be at sea,in the new global economy,if I did not know Japanese.,And with all due respect to the Japanese,,it didn't turn out that way.,Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent,that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin,,and maybe they're onto something,,but we cannot know for sure.,So, absent being able to anticipate the future,,what we all do, as good parents,,is try and prepare our kids,for every possible kind of future,,hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.,We teach our kids chess,,thinking maybe they will need analytical skills.,We sign them up for team sports,,thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills,,you know, for when they gonto Harvard Business School.,We try and teach them to be financially savvy,and science-minded and eco-friendly,and gluten-free,,though now is probably a good time to tell you,that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.,I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.,And you know what? I'm doing okay.,I pay my taxes.,I hold down a steady job.,I was even invited to speak at TED.,But the presumption now is that,what was good enough for me,nor for my folks for that matter,,isn't good enough anymore.,So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf,,because we feel like if we aren't trying everything,,it's as if we're doing nothing,and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids. 
 So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles,as mothers and fathers.,Now add to this problem something else:,we are also navigating new roles,as husbands and wives,because most women today are in the workforce.,This is another reason, I think,,that parenthood feels like a crisis.,We have no rules, no scripts, no norms,for what to do when a child comes along,now that both mom and dad are breadwinners.,The writer Michael Lewis once put this,very, very well.,He said that the surest way,for a couple to start fighting,is for them to go out to dinner with another couple,whose division of labor,is ever so slightly different from theirs,,because the conversation innthe car on the way home,goes something like this:,"So, did you catch that Dave is the one,who walks them to school every morning?",(Laughter),Without scripts telling us who does what,in this brave new world, couples fight,,and both mothers and fathers each have,their legitimate gripes.,Mothers are much more likely,to be multi-tasking when they are at home,,and fathers, when they are at home,,are much more likely to be mono-tasking.,Find a guy at home, and odds are,he is doing just one thing at a time.,In fact, UCLA recently did a study,looking at the most common configuration,of family members in middle-class homes.,Guess what it was?,Dad in a room by himself.,According to the American Time Use Survey,,mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers,,which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day,,but I still think that something she wrote,is highly relevant:,"I have not been alone in thenbathroom since October.",(Laughter) 
 But here is the thing: Men are doing plenty.,They spend more time with their kids,than their fathers ever spent with them.,They work more paid hours, on average,,than their wives,,and they genuinely want to be good,,involved dads.,Today, it is fathers, not mothers,,who report the most work-life conflict. 
 Either way, by the way,,if you think it's hard for traditional families,to sort out these new roles,,just imagine what it's like now,for non-traditional families:,families with two dads, families with two moms,,single-parent households.,They are truly improvising as they go. 
 Now, in a more progressive country,,and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché,and invoking, yes, Sweden,,parents could rely on the state,for support.,There are countries that acknowledge,the anxieties and the changing roles,of mothers and fathers.,Unfortunately, the United States is not one of them,,so in case you were wondering what the U.S.,has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia,,it's this:,We too have no paid maternity leave policy.,We are one of eight known countries that does not. 
 In this age of intense confusion,,there is just one goal upon which,all parents can agree,,and that is whether they are,tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones,,our kids' happiness is paramount.,That is what it means,to raise kids in an age,when they are economically worthless,but emotionally priceless.,We are all the custodians of their self-esteem.,The one mantra no parent ever questions is,,"All I want is for my children to be happy.",And don't get me wrong:,I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.,But it is a very elusive one.,Happiness and self-confidence,,teaching children that is not like teaching them,how to plow a field.,It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.,There's no curriculum for it.,Happiness and self-confidence cannbe the byproducts of other things,,but they cannot really be goals unto themselves.,A child's happiness,is a very unfair burden to place on a parent.,And happiness is an even more unfair burden,to place on a kid. 
 And I have to tell you,,I think it leads to some very strange excesses.,We are now so anxious,to protect our kids from the world's ugliness,that we now shield them from "Sesame Street.",I wish I could say I was kidding about this,,but if you go out and you buy,the first few episodes of "Sesame Street" on DVD,,as I did out of nostalgia,,you will find a warning at the beginning,saying that the content is not suitable,for children.,(Laughter),Can I just repeat that?,The content of the original "Sesame Street",is not suitable for children.,When asked about this by The New York Times,,a producer for the show gavena variety of explanations.,One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe,in one skit and then swallowed it.,Bad modeling. I don't know.,But the thing that stuck with me,is she said that she didn't know,whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today,because he was too depressive.,I cannot tell you how much this distresses me.,(Laughter),You are looking at a woman,who has a periodic table of the Muppets,hanging from her cubicle wall.,The offending muppet, right there. 
 That's my son the day he was born.,I was high as a kite on morphine.,I had had an unexpected C-section.,But even in my opiate haze,,I managed to have one very clear thought,the first time I held him.,I whispered it into his ear.,I said, "I will try so hard not to hurt you.",It was the Hippocratic Oath,,and I didn't even know I was saying it.,But it occurs to me now,that the Hippocratic Oath,is a much more realistic aim than happiness.,In fact, as any parent will tell you,,it's awfully hard.,All of us have said or done hurtful things,that we wish to God we could take back.,I think in another era,we did not expect quite so much from ourselves,,and it is important that we all remember that,the next time we are staring with our hearts racing,at those bookshelves.,I'm not really sure how to create new norms,for this world,,but I do think that,in our desperate quest to create happy kids,,we may be assuming the wrong moral burden.,It strikes me as a better goal,,and, dare I say, a more virtuous one,,to focus on making productive kids,and moral kids,,and to simply hope that happiness will come to them,by virtue of the good that they do,and their accomplishments,and the love that they feel from us.,That, anyway, is one response to having no script.,Absent having new scripts,,we just follow the oldest ones in the book --,decency, a work ethic, love —,and let happiness and self-esteemntake care of themselves.,I think if we all did that,,the kids would still be all right,,and so would their parents,,possibly in both cases even better. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)First of all, for those of you who,are not familiar with my work,,I create multicultural characters,,so characters from lots of different backgrounds.,So before the present is the new future,,a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family,that was multi-everything -- multi-racial, multi-cultural,,black and white, Caribbean,,Irish-American, German-American.,There was Dominicannmusic blasting from stereos.,There were Christians and Jews.,That's a long story filled with,intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.,But I was totally immersed in this world,that was filled with everybody,,and then I went on to the United Nations school,,and that just completely — 
 So I began sort of developing these voices,and these people,,all of whom were loosely basednon people I really know,,and so, for example, in performing them,,I would really try to inhabit them.,And for example,,I don't really talk like that,,but that was one of my people,,and I'm going to bring a few of my friends --,I think of them as my friends —,to this stage, in this spirit of the idea,that the present is the new future,,in sort of a meta way,,because I thought about it, and the future, for me,,what can be so frightening,is that I don't know what's coming.,I don't know if that's true for other people,,but that notion of thinking about,how we can understand the future,and predict outcomes,,for me, it's terrifying to notnknow what might be coming.,And so the idea that there are questions,that I've never seen,that my people are going to answer,,and some of these charactersnhave been with me for ages,,some of them don't even have names,,I don't know what's going to happen.,I don't know what's coming,,and all I can do is remind myself,that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,,and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like,that dream where you don't have any pants on,,and so I suppose I'm going to be,flying by the seat of my ass. 
 That said, let's just see who comes out.,May we have the first question: 
 "Do you ever get headaches,from the microchips implanted in your brain?",Right. 
 Okay.,Well first of all, I'll just say,that I hope you can hear me okay.,My name is Lorraine Levine,,and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain,,frankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me,of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses.,No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them,,but at my age,,just putting on the regular ones I have,already gives me too much information.,Do you understand what I'm saying to you?,I don't need to know more. I don't want to know.,That's it. That's enough.,I love you all. You're wonderful.,It's fabulous to be here with such big machers,again this year. Mwah! 
 Okay, next question. (Applause),Next, please. 
 "Is dating boring,,now that humans reproduce asexually?" 
 Who do we got? 
 Hi, um, okay, hi everybody.,My name is Nereida.,I just want to say first of all,that dating is never boring under any circumstance.,But I am very excited to be here right now,,so I am just trying to remind myself that,,you know, like, the purposenof being here and everything,,I mean, trying to answer thesenquestions, it is very exciting.,But I also, I just need to acknowledge,that TED is an incredible experience right now,in the present, like, I just need to say, like,,Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende!,Okay, maybe it doesn't mean,,of course it means something to you,,but to me, it's like, another level, okay?,Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact,that there are role models here that I can really,,I don't know, I just need to say that.,That's incredible to me, and sometimesnwhen I'm nervous and everything like that,,I just need to, like, say some affirmations,that can help me.,I usually just try to use, like, the three little words,that always make me feel better:,Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter),Just, it really helps me to get grounded.,Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,,and, you know, I just need to say it, like,,it's so incredible to be here, and I knewnthat we were going to have these questions.,I was so nervous and I was thinkingnjust, like, oh my God, oh my God,,and reminding me, becausenI've had, like, some very,,especially since the last time we were here at TED,,it was, like, unbelievable,,and then right after that, like,,so many crazy things happened, like,,we ended up going to the White House to perform.,That was, like, amazing,,and I'm standing there,,and I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God.",Don't say, "Oh my God.",And I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God.",And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,,President Obama has to comenup here at the same podium,,and I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God.",It's like, the separation of church and state.,It's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.,It was really too much.,So I think I've lost my way.,But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,,you know, as far as I'm concerned,,however you reproduce, as longnas you're enjoying yourself,and it's with another consentingnasexual -- I don't know.,You know where I'm going with that.,Okay, ciao, gracias.

 What do you got? 
 "How many of your organs have been 3D printed?",(Laughter) 
 Well I have to say that I don't know about,how many of my organs,have been 3-D printed as such,,but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,,kind of thinking about this concept of the future,and that, you know, all around the world,parents are kind of telling their small children,,please, you have to eat that, you know,,I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day,so that you can have this meal.,You know, that kind of thing.,And of course now that we have changed, you know,,from the global South, there is this total,kind of perspective shift that is happening around the --,You can't just say to them,,well, there are starving children.,Well, it is the future.,Nobody is starving anymore, thank God.,But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism,,and I do hope that we can continue,to kind of 3D print,,well, let us just say I like to think that,even in the future we will have the publication,,kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.,But everybody, please do enjoy that,,and again, I think that you do throw,a cracking good party here at TED.,Thank you. 
 Next question. (Applause) 
 What has changed? Okay, it's like,,I have to think about that.,"What has changed now that women run the world?",First of all,,I really, like, I just want to say,,and my name is Bella,,I just want to, like, identify myself,,that, like, as a feminist,,I, like, I really find that, like,,because I was born in the '90s,,and, like, there were a lot of women who were,as far as feminism was concerned,,like, maybe they didn't understand that, like,,a feminist like me, like,,I don't think it's required that you have to have,a certain kind of voice,,or, like, a certain way of presenting yourself,to be feminist, because I think that, like,,feminism can be really hot,,and I think actually that it's really vital and important.,Like, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like,,Gloria Steinem,,and, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,,who's, like, obviously, like, a reallynimportant feminist from, like, history,,and like, I just think that those women, like,,really represent, like, that you can, like,,be vital and, like, amazing,,like, a-mazing,,and you don't have to wear, like,,an Eileen Fisher caftan,,just to, like, prove that you are a feminist.,Like, not that there's anything wrong with that,,but my mom, she's like, like,,why do you have to wear pants that, like,,objectify your body? I like my pants.,Like, I like my voice.,Like, she's like, why do you have to talk like —,Talk like what? Like, I'm expressing myself,,and I think that we have to, like,,reach out, like, not only across, like,,the different generations of feminists,,but also across the, like, vocal ranges,,so that, like, we,,because otherwise it's just, like,,restriculous within feminism,,which is just, like, a word that I created,that means, like, so strict it's ridiculous.,So that's my feeling about that.,You guys are a-mazing, by the way. 
 Okay. Next question.,(Applause) 
 ["They've discovered a cure for cancer,nbut not baldness? What's up with that?"] 
 Yeah, you know what,,so my name is Joseph Mancuso.,First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate,that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,,a pretty orderly group.,And, you know, I just have to say,,the whole thing with baldness,,and, you know, here's the thing.,As long as the woman, in my case --,because it's a modern world,,do whatever you want to do, I don'tnhave any problem with anybody,,enjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?,But as far as I'm concerned,,attractiveness,,women don't really care,as much as you think they do,about the, you know.,I mean, I remember hearing this woman.,She loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.,It's a pretty young girl, you know?,And this guy's older.,And, you know, she said she would love him,even if he had snow on the roof,or even if melted and disappeared altogether.,As far as I'm concerned, it's about the love.,Am I right, or am I right?,So that's it. That's it. That's it.,I don't got nothing more to say.,Keep your noses clean. 
 All right, next question. 
 "Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown?" 
 Um, well, I,,I want to start by saying,that this is a very difficult experience,for a Chinese-American.,I don't know what to call myself now,,because I have really my Chinese identity,,but my kids, they are American-Chinese,,but it's difficult to try to express myself,in front of audience of people like this.,But if had to give my opinion about meat,,I think first, the most important thing is to say,that we don't have to have perfect food,,but maybe it can also not be poison.,Maybe we can have some middle ground for that.,But I will continue to consider this idea,,and I will report back maybe next year. 
 Next.,Next. Next. (Applause) 
 "Will there ever be a post-racial world?" 
 Thank you for having me.,My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.,I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation.,I'm also half Lakota, but that is my given name,,and no, even though it would have seemed,like an obvious choice,,no, I did not go into politics.,Tough crowd.,(Laughter),But I always like to just let people know,when they ask about race or those kinds of things,,you know, as a member ofnthe First Nations community,,you know, I'm probably,not your typical guy.,For example, in addition to being an activist,,I'm also a professional stand-up comedian.,(Laughter),And, you know, I'm most popular,on college and university campuses.,You know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,,or hey-we're-not-all-white week,,then I'm there. (Laughter),Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world?,I think, really, I can't talk about race,without remembering that it is a construct,in certain respects,,but also that, you know,,until we redress the wrongs of the past,,we're going to be turned around.,I don't care if the present is the new future.,I think there's a lot of great people here at TED,who are working to address that,,so with that, if anything I've said today,makes you feel uncomfortable, you're welcome.,(Applause) 
 I think we have time for one more. 
 "What's the most popular diet these days?" 
 Who's here? 
 Okay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast,,as, like, three or four different people.,I mean really fast.,I'm just gonna let y'all know that,nas far as diet is concerned,,if you don't love yourself inside,,there is no diet on this Earth,that is going to make your behind small enough,for you to feel good,,so just stop wasting your time. 
 I would just like to say as an African woman,that I believe the diet that we need,is really to remove the crazy belief,that there is anything wrong,with a nice backside.,No, I am teasing about that.,There is nothing wrong with a woman of size.,That is what I am trying to say.,Women, celebrate your body, for God's sake.,Stop running around starving.,You are making yourselvesnand other people miserable. 
 Last answer. 
 So we're talking about what's the most popular diet?,I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that,this is my first time here at TED.,I might not be your typical person,you find on this stage.,My dental work not as nice as some people.,But I made Sarah Jones promise,she gonna bring me this time,,'cause she didn't bring me before,,but you know, I just want to say,,there's a lot of things more important,than counting calories,,and as somebody living on the streets in New York,,and getting to come here,nhear y'all ideas worth spreading,,I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea,that the present is the new future,,that where you sit, you create everything,that's gonna come, for better or worse.,And for me, I think homeless,is the wrong word for it anyway.,You know, I might not have me no place,to lay my head at night,,but that just makes me houseless.,I have me a home. You do too.,Find it and try to find yourself in there.,Make sure you know,,it's not just about virtual reality in space.,That's wonderful, but it's also about,the actual reality here on Earth.,How are people living today?,How can you be part of the solution?,Thank y'all for thinking about that,right now in the present moment,to influence the future.,I appreciate it. Bye-bye. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you all very, very much.,Thank you for trusting me, Chris. 
 (Applause)Could I protect my father,from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?,That was the question I faced,one Tuesday morning in June of 1993,,when I was a law student. 
 I woke up early that morning,in Dad's apartment,on the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,,to an unrelenting pounding on the front door.,It was a season as described by a local paper,when every Tuesday a scholar fell,to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.,My father's university teaching of Darwin,had already provoked a classroom visit,from the head of the so-callednIslamic Salvation Front,,who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism,before Dad had ejected the man,,and now whoever was outside,would neither identify himself nor go away.,So my father tried to get the police on the phone,,but perhaps terrified by the rising tide,of armed extremism that had already claimed,the lives of so many Algerian officers,,they didn't even answer.,And that was when I went to the kitchen,,got out a paring knife,,and took up a position inside the entryway.,It was a ridiculous thing to do, really,,but I couldn't think of anything else,,and so there I stood. 
 When I look back now, I thinknthat that was the moment,that set me on the path was to writing a book,called "Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:,Untold Stories from the FightnAgainst Muslim Fundamentalism.",The title comes from a Pakistani play.,I think it was actually that moment,that sent me on the journey,to interview 300 people of Muslim heritage,from nearly 30 countries,,from Afghanistan to Mali,,to find out how they fought fundamentalism,peacefully like my father did,,and how they coped with the attendant risks. 
 Luckily, back in June of 1993,,our unidentified visitor went away,,but other families were so much less lucky,,and that was the thoughtnthat motivated my research.,In any case, someone would return,a few months later and leave a note,on Dad's kitchen table,,which simply said, "Consider yourself dead.",Subsequently, Algeria'snfundamentalist armed groups,would murder as many as 200,000 civilians,in what came to be known,as the dark decade of the 1990s,,including every single one,of the women that you see here.,In its harsh counterterrorist response,,the state resorted to torture,and to forced disappearances,,and as terrible as all of these events became,,the international community largely ignored them.,Finally, my father, an Algeriannpeasant's son turned professor,,was forced to stop teaching at the university,and to flee his apartment,,but what I will never forget,about Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,,was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,,he refused to leave the country,and he continued to publish pointed criticisms,,both of the fundamentalists,and sometimes of the government they battled.,For example, in a November 1994 series,in the newspaper El Watan,entitled "How Fundamentalism,Produced a Terrorism without Precedent,",he denounced what he called,the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam,as it was lived by our ancestors.,These were words that could get you killed. 
 My father's country taught me,in that dark decade of the 1990s that,the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism,is one of the most important,and overlooked human rights struggles,in the world.,This remains true today, nearly 20 years later.,You see, in every country,where you hear about armed jihadis,targeting civilians,,there are also unarmed people,defying those militants that you don't hear about,,and those people need our support to succeed. 
 In the West, it's often assumed,that Muslims generally condone terrorism.,Some on the right think this because they view,Muslim culture as inherently violent,,and some on the left imagine this,because they view Muslim violence,,fundamentalist violence,,solely as a product of legitimate grievances.,But both views are dead wrong.,In fact, many people of Muslim heritage,around the world are staunch opponents,both of fundamentalism and of terrorism,,and often for very good reason.,You see, they're much more likely to be victims,of this violence than its perpetrators.,Let me just give you one example.,According to a 2009 survey,of Arabic language media resources,,between 2004 and 2008,,no more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims,were Westerners.,That's a terrible toll, but the vast majority,were people of Muslim heritage,,killed by Muslim fundamentalists. 
 Now I've been talking for the last five minutes,about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know,exactly what I mean.,I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist,Marieme Helie Lucas,,and she says that fundamentalisms,,note the "s," so within all of the world's,great religious traditions,,"fundamentalisms are politicalnmovements of the extreme right,which in a context of globalization,manipulate religion in order to achieve,their political aims.",Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization,of theology.,Now I want to avoid projecting the notion,that there's sort of a monolith out there,called Muslim fundamentalismnthat is the same everywhere,,because these movementsnalso have their diversities.,Some use and advocate violence.,Some do not, though they're often interrelated.,They take different forms.,Some may be non-governmental organizations,,even here in Britain like Cageprisoners.,Some may become political parties,,like the Muslim Brotherhood,,and some may be openly armed groups,like the Taliban.,But in any case, these are all radical projects.,They're not conservative or traditional approaches.,They're most often about changingnpeople's relationship with Islam,rather than preserving it.,What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,,and the fact that its adherents are,or purport to be Muslim,makes them no less offensive,than the extreme right anywhere else.,So in my view, if we consider ourselves,liberal or left-wing,,human rights-loving or feminist,,we must oppose these movements,and support their grassroots opponents.,Now let me be clear,that I support an effective struggle,against fundamentalism,,but also a struggle that must itself,respect international law,,so nothing I am saying should be taken,as a justification for refusals,to democratize,,and here I send out a shout-out of support,to the pro-democracy movement nin Algeria today, Barakat.,Nor should anything I say be taken,as a justification of violations of human rights,,like the mass death sentences,handed out in Egypt earlier this week.,But what I am saying,is that we must challenge thesenMuslim fundamentalist movements,because they threaten human rights,across Muslim-majority contexts,,and they do this in a range of ways,,most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians,by the armed groups that carry those out.,But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.,These movements as a whole purvey discrimination,against religious minorities and sexual minorities.,They seek to curtail the freedom of religion,of everyone who either practices in a different way,or chooses not to practice.,And most definingly, they lead an all-out war,on the rights of women. 
 Now, faced with these movements,in recent years, Western discourse,has most often offered,two flawed responses.,The first that one sometimes finds on the right,suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist,or something about Islam isninherently fundamentalist,,and this is just offensive and wrong,,but unfortunately on the leftnone sometimes encounters,a discourse that is too politically correct,to acknowledge the problem ofnMuslim fundamentalism at all,or, even worse, apologizes for it,,and this is unacceptable as well.,So what I'm seeking is a new way,of talking about this all together,,which is grounded in the lived experiences,and the hope of the people on the front lines.,I'm painfully aware that there has been,an increase in discriminationnagainst Muslims in recent years,in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,,and that too is a matter of grave concern,,but I firmly believe,that telling these counter-stereotypical stories,of people of Muslim heritage,who have confronted the fundamentalists,and been their primary victims,is also a great way of countering that discrimination.,So now let me introduce you,to four people whose stories,I had the great honor of telling. 
 Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre,workshop named for his father,have for years promoted the performing arts,in Pakistan.,With the rise of jihadist violence,,they began to receive threats,to call off their events, which they refused to heed.,And so a bomber struck their 2008,eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,,producing rain of glass,that fell into the venue,injuring nine people,,and later that same night,,the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:,they announced that their festival,would continue as planned the next day.,As Faizan said at the time,,if we bow down to the Islamists,,we'll just be sitting in a dark corner.,But they didn't know what would happen.,Would anyone come?,In fact, thousands of people came out the next day,to support the performing arts in Lahore,,and this simultaneously thrilled,and terrified Faizan,,and he ran up to a woman,who had come in with her two small children,,and he said, "You do know therenwas a bomb here yesterday,,and you do know there's a threat here today.",And she said, "I know that,,but I came to your festival,with my mother when I was their age,,and I still have those images in my mind.,We have to be here.",With stalwart audiences like this,,the Peerzadas were able to conclude,their festival on schedule. 
 And then the next year,,they lost all of their sponsors,due to the security risk.,So when I met them in 2010,,they were in the middle of the first subsequent event,that they were able to have in the same venue,,and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival,held in Lahore in a year when that city,had already experienced 44 terror attacks.,This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban,had commenced their systematic targeting,of girls' schools that would culminate,in the attack on Malala Yousafzai.,What did the Peerzadas do in that environment?,They staged girls' school theater.,So I had the privilege of watching "Naang Wal,",which was a musical in the Punjabi language,,and the girls of Lahore Grammar School,played all the parts.,They sang and danced,,they played the mice and the water buffalo,,and I held my breath, wondering,,would we get to the end,of this amazing show?,And when we did, the whole audience,collectively exhaled,,and a few people actually wept,,and then they filled the auditorium,with the peaceful boom of their applause.,And I remember thinking in that moment,that the bombers made headlines here,two years before,but this night and these people,are as important a story. 
 Maria Bashir is the first and only,woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan.,She's been in the post since 2008,and actually opened an office to investigate,cases of violence against women,,which she says is the most important area,in her mandate.,When I meet her in her office in Herat,,she enters surrounded by,four large men with four huge guns.,In fact, she now has 23 bodyguards,,because she has weathered bomb attacks,that nearly killed her kids,,and it took the leg off of one of her guards. 
 Why does she continue?,She says with a smile that that is the question,that everyone asks—,as she puts it, "Why you risk not living?",And it is simply that for her,,a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come,is worth the risk,,and she knows that if people like her,do not take the risk,,there will be no better future.,Later on in our interview,,Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is,about the possible outcome,of government negotiations with the Taliban,,the people who have been trying to kill her.,"If we give them a place in the government,",she asks, "Who will protect women's rights?",And she urges the international community,not to forget its promise about women,because now they want peace with Taliban.,A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,,I see a headline on the Internet.,An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.,I google desperately,,and thankfully that day I find out,that Maria was not the victim,,though sadly, another Afghan prosecutor,was gunned down on his way to work.,And when I hear headlines like that now,,I think that as international troops,leave Afghanistan this year and beyond,,we must continue to care,about what happens to people there,,to all of the Maria Bashirs.,Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head,saying, with no bravado whatsoever,,"The situation of the women of Afghanistan,will be better someday.,We should prepare the ground for this,,even if we are killed." 
 There are no words adequate,to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists,who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi,on the same day as a children's cooking competition,in September of 2013.,They killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.,Far away in the American Midwest,,I had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans,who were working to counternthe efforts of al Shabaab,to recruit a small number of young people,from their city of Minneapolis,to take part in atrocities like Westgate.,Abdirizak Bihi's studious,17-year-old nephew Burhan Hassan,was recruited here in 2008,,spirited to Somalia,,and then killed when he tried to come home.,Since that time, Mr. Bihi,,who directs the no-budget SomalinEducation and Advocacy Center,,has been vocally denouncing the recruitment,and the failures of government,and Somali-American institutions,like the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center,where he believes his nephew was radicalized,during a youth program.,But he doesn't just criticize the mosque.,He also takes on the government,for its failure to do more,to prevent poverty in his community.,Given his own lack of financial resources,,Mr. Bihi has had to be creative.,To counter the efforts of al Shabaab,to sway more disaffected youth,,in the wake of the group's 2010 attack,on World Cup viewers in Uganda,,he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament,in Minneapolis in response.,Scores of Somali-American kids came out,to embrace sport,despite the fatwa against it.,They played basketball,as Burhan Hassan never would again.,For his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized,by the leadership of the AbubakarnAs-Saddique Islamic Center,,with which he used to have good relations.,He told me, "One day we saw the imam on TV,calling us infidels and saying,,'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'",This is at complete odds,with how Abdirizak Bihi understands,what he is trying to do,by exposing al Shabaab recruitment,,which is to save the religion I love,from a small number of extremists. 
 Now I want to tell one last story,,that of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria,named Amel Zenoune-Zouani,who had the same dreams of a legal career,that I did back in the '90s.,She refused to give up her studies,,despite the fact that the fundamentalists,battling the Algerian state back then,threatened all who continued their education.,On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus,in Algiers where she was studying,to go home and spend a Ramadan evening,with her family,,and would never finish law school.,When the bus reached the outskirts,of her hometown, it was stopped,at a checkpoint manned by men,from the Armed Islamic Group.,Carrying her schoolbag,,Amel was taken off the bus,and killed in the street.,The men who cut her throat,then told everyone else,,"If you go to university,,the day will come when we will kill all of you,just like this." 
 Amel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,,which we know because when she fell in the street,,her watch broke.,Her mother showed me the watch,with the second hand still aimed,optimistically upward,towards a 5:18 that would never come.,Shortly before her death,,Amel had said to her mother of herself,and her sisters,,"Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,,but if something happens,,you must know that we are dead for knowledge.,You and father must keep your heads held high." 
 The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,,and so as I did my research,I found myself searching for Amel's hope again,and her name even means "hope" in Arabic.,I think I found it in two places.,The first is in the strength of her family,and all the other families toncontinue telling their stories,and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.,In fact, Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief,,went to law school,,and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,,something which is only possible,because the armed fundamentalists,were largely defeated in the country.,And the second place I found Amel's hope,was everywhere that women and men,continue to defy the jihadis.,We must support all of those in honor of Amel,who continue this human rights struggle today,,like the Network of WomennLiving Under Muslim Laws.,It is not enough, as the victims rights advocate,Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,,it is not enough just to battle terrorism.,We must also challenge fundamentalism,,because fundamentalism is the ideology,that makes the bed of this terrorism. 
 Why is it that people like her, like all of them,are not more well known?,Why is it that everyone knowsnwho Osama bin Laden was,and so few know of all of those,standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts.,We must change that, and so I ask you,to please help share these stories,through your networks.,Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch,,forever frozen,,and now please look at your own watch,and decide this is the moment that you commit,to supporting people like Amel.,We don't have the right to be silent about them,because it is easier,or because Western policy is flawed as well,,because 5:17 is still coming,to too many Amel Zenounes,in places like northern Nigeria,,where jihadis still kill students.,The time to speak up in support of all of those,who peacefully challenge fundamentalism,and terrorism in their own communities,is now. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online,started out the way most things do:,without me, and not online.,On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,,Alfred Nobel, died.,One hundred years later, exactly, actually,,December 10, 1996,,this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,,won the Nobel Prize for literature.,She's a Polish poet.,She's a big deal, obviously,,but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,,and when I checked out her work,,I found this sweet little poem,,"Four in the Morning." 
 "The hour from night to day.,The hour from side to side.,The hour for those past thirty..." 
 And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,,I fell for it hard,,so hard, I suspected we must have met,somewhere before.,Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?,Did I flirt with this poem,in a coffee shop somewhere?,I could not place it, and it bugged me,,and then in the coming week or two,,I would just be watching an old movie,,and this would happen. 
 (Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, younshould have come to the first party.,We didn't get home till around four in the morning. 
 Rives: My roommates would have the TV on,,and this would happen. 
 (Music: Seinfeld theme) 
 (Video) George Costanza: Oh boy, nI was up til four in the morning,watching that Omen trilogy. 
 Rives: I would be listening to music,,and this would happen. 
 (Video) Elton John: ♪ It's four o'clocknin the morning, damn it. ♪ 
 Rives: So you can see what was going on, right?,Obviously, the demigods of coincidence,were just messing with me.,Some people get a number stuck in their head,,you may recognize a certain name or a tune,,some people get nothing, but four in the morning,was in me now, but mildly,,like a groin injury.,I always assumed it would just go away,on its own eventually,,and I never talked about it with anybody,,but it did not, and I totally did. 
 In 2007, I was invited to speak at TED,for the second time,,and since I was still an authority on nothing,,I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation,on a topic so niche,it is actually inconsequential,or actually cockamamie.,So my talk had some of mynfour in the morning examples,,but it also had examples,from my fellow TED speakers that year.,I found four in the morning in a novel,by Isabel Allende.,I found a really great one,in the autobiography of Bill Clinton.,I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,,although Matt Groening told me later,that he could not make my talk,because it was a morning session,and I gather that he is not an early riser.,However, had Matt been there,,he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory,that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.,It was totally contrived,just for that room, just for that moment.,That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.,It was fun. That was pretty much it. 
 When I got home, though,nthe emails started coming in,from people who had seen the talk live,,beginning with, and this is still my favorite,,"Here's another one for your collection:,'It's the friends you can callnup at 4 a.m. that matter.'",The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.,The email itself was from another very,sexy European type,,TED Curator Chris Anderson.,(Laughter),Chris found this quote,on a coffee cup or something,,and I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary,of ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.,I am contagious,,which was confirmed less than a week later,when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent,an actual greeting card,with that same quotation.,As a bonus, she hooked me upnwith a second one they make.,It says, "Just knowing I can call you,at four in the morning if I need to,makes me not really need to,",which I love, because together these are like,,"Hallmark: When you care enough,to send the very best twice,,phrased slightly differently." 
 I was not surprised at the TEDster,and New Yorker magazine overlap.,A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.,"It's 4 a.m.—maybe you'd sleepnbetter if you bought some crap." 
 I was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.,More than one person sent me this. 
 (Video) Didi Pickles: It'snfour o'clock in the morning.,Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding? 
 Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life. 
 (Laughter) 
 Rives: And then there was the lone TEDster,who was disgruntled I had overlooked,what he considers to be a classic. 
 (Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding.nRonnie Neary: Is there an accident? 
 Roy: No, it's not an accident. Younwanted to get out of the house anyway, right? 
 Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning. 
 Rives: So that's "Close Encounters,",and the main character is all worked up,because aliens, momentously,,have chosen to show themselves to earthlings,at four in the morning,,which does make that a very solid example.,Those were all really solid examples.,They did not get me any closer to understanding,why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.,But they followed the pattern. They played along.,Right? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour,when all these dramatic occurrences,allegedly occur.,Maybe this was some kind of cliche,that had never been taxonomized before.,Maybe I was on the trail,of a new meme or something. 
 Just when things were getting pretty interesting,,things got really interesting.,TED.com launched, later that year,,with a bunch of videos from past talks,,including mine,,and I started receiving "four in the morning" citations,from what seemed like everyntime zone on the planet.,Much of it was content I never would have found,on my own if I was looking for it,,and I was not.,I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.,I probably would have missed the booklet,,"Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning.",(Laughter),I do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,,although it looks delightful. (Laughter),Take note of those clock ends.,This is a college student's suggestion,for what a "four in the morning" gang sign,should look like.,People sent me magazine ads.,They took photographs in grocery stores.,I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.,A lot of good quality work, too:,"The Sandman," "Watchmen.",There's a very cute examplenhere from "Calvin and Hobbes.",In fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in,was from a cartoon from the Stone Age.,Take a look. 
 (Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early? 
 Fred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early. 
 Rives: And the flip side of the timeline,,this is from the 31st century.,A thousand years from now,,people are still doing this. 
 (Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m.,(Laughter),Rives: It shows the spectrum.,I received so many songs, TV shows, movies,,like from dismal to famous,,I could give you a four-hour playlist.,If I just stick to modern male movie stars,,I keep it to the length,of about a commercial.,Here's your sampler. 
 (Movie montage of "It's 4 a.m.") 
 (Laughter) 
 Rives: So somewhere along the line,,I realized I have a hobby,I didn't know I wanted,,and it is crowdsourced.,But I was also thinking what you might be thinking,,which is really, couldn't you do this,with any hour of the day? 
 First of all, you are not getting clips like that,about four in the afternoon.,Secondly, I did a little research.,You know, I was kind of interested.,If this is confirmation bias,,there is so much confirmation, I am biased.,Literature probably shows it best.,There are a couple three innthe mornings in Shakespeare.,There's a five in the morning.,There are seven four in the mornings,,and they're all very dire.,In "Measure for Measure," it'snthe call time for the executioner.,Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia,at four in the morning right before battle,in "War and Peace.",Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind of,a pivotal four in the morning,,as does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights.","Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning.,"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.,Someone sent in H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man.",Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man.","The Great Gatsby" spends the last,four in the morning of his life,waiting for a lover who never shows,,and the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,,"The Metamorphosis.",First paragraph, the main character wakes up,transformed into a giant cockroach,,but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,,something is up with this guy.,Why? His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning.,What kind of person would do that?,This kind of person would do that. 
 (Music) 
 (4 a.m. alarm clock montage),(Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour.nTime for the morning news.,But of course, there is no news yet.,Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds. 
 Rives: Exactly.,So that's Lucy from the Peanuts,,"Mommie Dearest", Rocky, first day of training,,Nelson Mandela, first day in office,,and Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroach,would give you one hell of a dinner party,and gives me yet another category,,people waking up, in my big old database. 
 Just imagine that your friends and your family,have heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears,,and they send them to you.,Even if you don't really, at a certain point,,you totally collect stuffed polar bears,,and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.,And when I got to that point, I embraced it.,I got my curator on. I started fact checking,,downloading, illegally screen-grabbing.,I started archiving.,My hobby had become a habit,,and my habit gave me possibly the world's,most eclectic Netflix queue.,At one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical,","Last Tango in Paris,","Diary of a Wimpy Kid,","Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy.",Why "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?,Because someone told me Inwould find this clip in there. 
 (Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born,in Flushing, Queens,on March, 12, 1953,,at four o'clock in the morning. 
 Rives: Of course he was. (Laughter) (Applause),Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense,,it also answers the question,,"What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir,have in common?",Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography,with the sentence, "I was bornnat four o'clock in the morning,",which I had because someonenelse had emailed it to me,,and when they did, I had another bump up,in my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy,and feminist Simone de Beauvoir,are not just different people.,They are different people thatnhave this thing connecting them,,and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge,or inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,,is there maybe a cooler way to do this? 
 So last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,,I put the entire collection online,as "Museum of Four in the Morning.",You can click on that red "refresh" button.,It will take you at random to one of,hundreds of snippets that are in the collection.,Here is a knockout poem,by Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness." 
 (Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you rise,in the middle of the night,to look up the date of a famous battle,in a book on war.,No wonder the moon in the window,seems to have drifted out of a love poem,that you used to know by heart. 
 Rives: So the first hour of this project,was satisfying.,A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.,Half a globe away, a teenager,made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me,,a stranger. 
 Less than a week later, though,,I received a little bit of grace.,I received a poignant tweet.,It was brief.,It just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape." 
 The name was a pseudonym,nactually, or a pseudo-pseudonym.,As soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic,,I knew immediately, my whole body knew,immediately who this was,,and I knew immediately,what mix tape she was talking about.,(Music) 
 L.D. was my college romance.,This is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.,She was a grad student in thenlibrary sciences department.,Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,,lets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.,She was already smoking hot,,she was super dorky,,and we had a December-May romance,,meaning we started dating in December,,and by May, she had graduated,and became my one that got away. 
 But her mix tape did not get away.,I have kept this mix tape in a box,with notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,,from my life, but for decades.,It's the kind of box where,,if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,,and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,,but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tape,is there are seven songs per side,,but no song titles.,Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress,classification system, including page numbers,,to leave me clues.,When I got this mix tape,,I put it in my cassette player,,I took it to the campus library, her library,,I found 14 books on the shelves.,I remember bringing them all,to my favorite corner table,,and I read poems paired to songs,like food to wine,,paired, I can tell you,,like saddle shoes,to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress. 
 I did this again last October.,I'm sitting there, I got new earbuds,,old Walkman, I realize this is just the kind,of extravagance I used to take for granted,even when I was extravagant.,And then I thought, "Good for him." 
 "PG" is Slavic literature.,"7000" series Polish literature.,Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems.,Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poem,paired with Paul Simon's "Peace Like a River."

 (Video) Paul Simon: ♪ Oh, four in the morning ♪,♪ I woke up from out of my dream ♪ 
 Rives: Thank you. Appreciate it. (Applause)I am a computer science and engineeringnprofessor here at Carnegie Mellon,,and my research focuses onnusable privacy and security,,and so my friends like to give me examples,of their frustrations with computing systems,,especially frustrations related to,unusable privacy and security. 
 So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.,A lot of people are frustrated with passwords,,and it's bad enough,when you have to have one really good password,that you can remember,but nobody else is going to be able to guess.,But what do you do when you have accounts,on a hundred different systems,and you're supposed to have a unique password,for each of these systems?,It's tough. 
 At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it,actually pretty easy for us,to remember our passwords.,The password requirement up through 2009,was just that you had to have a password,with at least one character.,Pretty easy. But then they changed things,,and at the end of 2009, they announced,that we were going to have a new policy,,and this new policy required,passwords that were at least eight characters long,,with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,,a digit, a symbol,,you couldn't use the samencharacter more than three times,,and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary. 
 Now, when they implemented this new policy,,a lot of people, my colleagues and friends,,came up to me and they said, "Wow,,now that's really unusable.,Why are they doing this to us,,and why didn't you stop them?" 
 And I said, "Well, you know what?,They didn't ask me." 
 But I got curious, and I decided to go talk,to the people in charge of our computer systems,and find out what led them to introduce,this new policy,,and they said that the university,had joined a consortium of universities,,and one of the requirements of membership,was that we had to have stronger passwords,that complied with some new requirements,,and these requirements were that our passwords,had to have a lot of entropy.,Now entropy is a complicated term,,but basically it measures the strength of passwords.,But the thing is, there isn't actually,a standard measure of entropy.,Now, the National Institutenof Standards and Technology,has a set of guidelines,which have some rules of thumb,for measuring entropy,,but they don't have anything too specific,,and the reason they only have rules of thumb,is it turns out they don't actually have any good data,on passwords.,In fact, their report states,,"Unfortunately, we do not have much data,on the passwords usersnchoose under particular rules.,NIST would like to obtain more data,on the passwords users actually choose,,but system administratorsnare understandably reluctant,to reveal password data to others." 
 So this is a problem, but our research group,looked at it as an opportunity.,We said, "Well, there's a neednfor good password data.,Maybe we can collect some good password data,and actually advance the state of the art here. 
 So the first thing we did is,,we got a bag of candy bars,and we walked around campus,and talked to students, faculty and staff,,and asked them for information,about their passwords.,Now we didn't say, "Give us your password.",No, we just asked them about their password.,How long is it? Does it have a digit?,Does it have a symbol?,And were you annoyed at having to create,a new one last week?,So we got results from 470 students,,faculty and staff,,and indeed we confirmed that the new policy,was very annoying,,but we also found that people said,they felt more secure with these new passwords.,We found that most people knew,they were not supposed tonwrite their password down,,and only 13 percent of them did,,but disturbingly, 80 percent of people,said they were reusing their password.,Now, this is actually more dangerous,than writing your password down,,because it makes you muchnmore susceptible to attackers.,So if you have to, write your passwords down,,but don't reuse them.,We also found some interesting things,about the symbols people use in passwords.,So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,,but as you can see, there's only a small number,that most people are using,,so we're not actually getting very much strength,from the symbols in our passwords. 
 So this was a really interesting study,,and now we had data from 470 people,,but in the scheme of things,,that's really not very much password data,,and so we looked around to see,where could we find additional password data?,So it turns out there are a lot of people,going around stealing passwords,,and they often go and post these passwords,on the Internet.,So we were able to get access,to some of these stolen password sets.,This is still not really ideal for research, though,,because it's not entirely clear,where all of these passwords came from,,or exactly what policies were in effect,when people created these passwords.,So we wanted to find some better source of data.,So we decided that one thing we could do,is we could do a study and have people,actually create passwords for our study.,So we used a service callednAmazon Mechanical Turk,,and this is a service where you can post,a small job online that takes a minute,,a few minutes, an hour,,and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,,to do a task for you,,and then you pay them through Amazon.com.,So we paid people about 50 cents,to create a password following our rules,and answering a survey,,and then we paid them again to come back,two days later and log in,using their password and answering another survey.,So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,,and we gave people a bunch of different policies,to create passwords with.,So some people had a pretty easy policy,,we call it Basic8,,and here the only rule was that your password,had to have at least eight characters.,Then some people had a much harder policy,,and this was very similar to the CMU policy,,that it had to have eight characters,including uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol,,and pass a dictionary check.,And one of the other policies we tried,,and there were a whole bunch more,,but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,,and the only requirement here,was that your password hadnto have at least 16 characters. 
 All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,,and so we had much more detailed information.,Again we see that there's only a small number,of symbols that people are actually using,in their passwords.,We also wanted to get an idea of how strong,the passwords were that people were creating,,but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure,of password strength.,So what we decided to do was to see,how long it would take to crack these passwords,using the best cracking tools,that the bad guys are using,,or that we could find information about,in the research literature. 
 So to give you an idea of how bad guys,go about cracking passwords,,they will steal a password file,that will have all of the passwords,in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,,and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess,as to what a password is,,run it through a hashing function,,and see whether it matches,the passwords they have onntheir stolen password list.,So a dumb attacker will try every password in order.,They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,,and this is going to take a really long time,before they get any passwords,that people are really likely to actually have.,A smart attacker, on the other hand,,does something much more clever.,They look at the passwords,that are known to be popular,from these stolen password sets,,and they guess those first.,So they're going to start by guessing "password,",and then they'll guess "I love you," and "monkey,",and "12345678,",because these are the passwords,that are most likely for people to have.,In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.,So what we found,by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected,through these tests to see how strong they were,,we found that the long passwords,were actually pretty strong,,and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.,However, when we looked at the survey data,,we saw that people were really frustrated,by the very complex passwords,,and the long passwords were a lot more usable,,and in some cases, they were actually,even stronger than the complex passwords.,So this suggests that,,instead of telling people that they need,to put all these symbols and numbers,and crazy things into their passwords,,we might be better off just telling people,to have long passwords.,Now here's the problem, though:,Some people had long passwords,that actually weren't very strong.,You can make long passwords,that are still the sort of thing,that an attacker could easily guess.,So we need to do more thannjust say long passwords.,There has to be some additional requirements,,and some of our ongoing research is looking at,what additional requirements we should add,to make for stronger passwords,that also are going to be easy for people,to remember and type. 
 Another approach to getting people to have,stronger passwords is to use a password meter.,Here are some examples.,You may have seen these on the Internet,when you were creating passwords.,We decided to do a study to find out,whether these password meters actually work.,Do they actually help people,have stronger passwords,,and if so, which ones are better?,So we tested password meters that were,different sizes, shapes, colors,,different words next to them,,and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.,As you type a better password,,the bunny dances faster and faster.,So this was pretty fun. 
 What we found,was that password meters do work.,(Laughter),Most of the password meters were actually effective,,and the dancing bunny was very effective too,,but the password meters that were the most effective,were the ones that made you work harder,before they gave you that thumbs up and said,you were doing a good job,,and in fact we found that most,of the password meters on the Internet today,are too soft.,They tell you you're doing a good job too early,,and if they would just wait a little bit,before giving you that positive feedback,,you probably would have better passwords. 
 Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps,,is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.,So this was an xkcd cartoon nfrom a couple of years ago,,and the cartoonist suggests,that we should all use pass phrases,,and if you look at the second row of this cartoon,,you can see the cartoonist is suggesting,that the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple",would be a very strong pass phrase,and something really easy to remember.,He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.,And so we decided to do a research study,to find out whether this was true or not.,In fact, everybody who I talk to,,who I mention I'm doing password research,,they point out this cartoon.,"Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd.,Correct horse battery staple.",So we did the research study to see,what would actually happen. 
 So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again,,and we had the computer pick the random words,in the pass phrase.,Now the reason we did this,is that humans are not very good,at picking random words.,If we asked a human to do it,,they would pick things that were not very random.,So we tried a few different conditions.,In one condition, the computer picked,from a dictionary of the very common words,in the English language,,and so you'd get pass phrases like,"try there three come.",And we looked at that, and we said,,"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable.",So then we tried picking words,that came from specific parts of speech,,so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun.,That comes up with somethingnthat's sort of sentence-like.,So you can get a pass phrase like,"plan builds sure power",or "end determines red drug.",And these seemed a little bit more memorable,,and maybe people would like those a little bit better.,We wanted to compare them with passwords,,and so we had the computernpick random passwords,,and these were nice and short, but as you can see,,they don't really look very memorable.,And then we decided to try something called,a pronounceable password.,So here the computer picks random syllables,and puts them together,so you have something sort of pronounceable,,like "tufritvi" and "vadasabi.",That one kind of rolls off your tongue.,So these were random passwords that were,generated by our computer. 
 So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,,pass phrases were not actually all that good.,People were not really better at remembering,the pass phrases than these random passwords,,and because the pass phrases are longer,,they took longer to type,and people made more errors while typing them in.,So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.,Sorry, all of you xkcd fans.,On the other hand, we did find,that pronounceable passwords,worked surprisingly well,,and so we actually are doing some more research,to see if we can make thatnapproach work even better.,So one of the problems,with some of the studies that we've done,is that because they're all done,using Mechanical Turk,,these are not people's real passwords.,They're the passwords that they created,or the computer created for them for our study.,And we wanted to know whether people,would actually behave the same way,with their real passwords. 
 So we talked to the informationnsecurity office at Carnegie Mellon,and asked them if we couldnhave everybody's real passwords.,Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant,to share them with us,,but we were actually able to work out,a system with them,where they put all of the real passwords,for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,,into a locked computer in a locked room,,not connected to the Internet,,and they ran code on it that we wrote,to analyze these passwords.,They audited our code.,They ran the code.,And so we never actually saw,anybody's password. 
 We got some interesting results,,and those of you Tepper students in the back,will be very interested in this.,So we found that the passwords created,by people affiliated with thenschool of computer science,were actually 1.8 times stronger,than those affiliated with the business school.,We have lots of other really interesting,demographic information as well.,The other interesting thing that we found,is that when we comparednthe Carnegie Mellon passwords,to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,,there was actually a lot of similarities,,and so this helped validate our research method,and show that actually, collecting passwords,using these Mechanical Turk studies,is actually a valid way to study passwords.,So that was good news. 
 Okay, I want to close by talking about,some insights I gained while on sabbatical,last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.,One of the things that I did,is I made a number of quilts,,and I made this quilt here.,It's called "Security Blanket.",(Laughter),And this quilt has the 1,000,most frequent passwords stolen,from the RockYou website.,And the size of the passwords is proportional,to how frequently they appeared,in the stolen dataset.,And what I did is I created this word cloud,,and I went through all 1,000 words,,and I categorized them into,loose thematic categories.,And it was, in some cases,,it was kind of difficult to figure out,what category they should be in,,and then I color-coded them. 
 So here are some examples of the difficulty.,So "justin.",Is that the name of the user,,their boyfriend, their son?,Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.,Or "princess.",Is that a nickname?,Are they Disney princess fans?,Or maybe that's the name of their cat.,"Iloveyou" appears many times,in many different languages.,There's a lot of love in these passwords.,If you look carefully, you'll see there's also,some profanity,,but it was really interesting to me to see,that there's a lot more love than hate,in these passwords.,And there are animals,,a lot of animals,,and "monkey" is the most common animal,and the 14th most popular password overall.,And this was really curious to me,,and I wondered, "Why are monkeys so popular?",And so in our last password study,,any time we detected somebody,creating a password with the word "monkey" in it,,we asked them why they hadna monkey in their password.,And what we found out --,we found 17 people so far, I think,,who have the word "monkey" --,We found out about a third of them said,they have a pet named "monkey",or a friend whose nickname is "monkey,",and about a third of them said,that they just like monkeys,and monkeys are really cute.,And that guy is really cute. 
 So it seems that at the end of the day,,when we make passwords,,we either make something that's really easy,to type, a common pattern,,or things that remind us of the word password,or the account that we've created the password for,,or whatever.,Or we think about things that make us happy,,and we create our password,based on things that make us happy.,And while this makes typing,and remembering your password more fun,,it also makes it a lot easier,to guess your password.,So I know a lot of these TED Talks,are inspirational,and they make you think about nice, happy things,,but when you're creating your password,,try to think about something else. 
 Thank you.

 ["Brought to you by TED staff and friends"] 
 (Music)Today I want to talk to younabout the mathematics of love.,Now, I think that we can all agree,that mathematiciansnare famously excellent at finding love. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's not just becausenof our dashing personalities,,superior conversational skillsnand excellent pencil cases.,It's also because we've actually donenan awful lot of work into the maths,of how to find the perfect partner. 
 Now, in my favorite papernon the subject, which is entitled,,"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Peter Backus tries to ratenhis chances of finding love.,Now, Peter's not a very greedy man.,Of all of the available women in the UK,,all Peter's looking fornis somebody who lives near him,,somebody in the right age range,,somebody with a university degree,,somebody he's likely to get on well with,,somebody who's likely to be attractive,,somebody who's likelynto find him attractive. 
 (Laughter) 
 And comes up with an estimatenof 26 women in the whole of the UK. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's not looking very good, is it Peter?,Now, just to put that into perspective,,that's about 400 times fewernthan the best estimates,of how many intelligentnextraterrestrial life forms there are.,And it also gives Peterna 1 in 285,000 chance,of bumping into any onenof these special ladies,on a given night out.,I'd like to thinknthat's why mathematicians,don't really botherngoing on nights out anymore. 
 The thing is that I personallyndon't subscribe,to such a pessimistic view.,Because I know,njust as well as all of you do,,that love doesn't really work like that.,Human emotion isn't neatly orderednand rational and easily predictable.,But I also know that that doesn't mean,that mathematics hasn't got somethingnthat it can offer us,,because, love, as with most of life,nis full of patterns,and mathematics is, ultimately,nall about the study of patterns.,Patterns from predicting the weathernto the fluctuations in the stock market,,to the movement of the planetsnor the growth of cities.,And if we're being honest,nnone of those things,are exactly neatly orderednand easily predictable, either.,Because I believe that mathematicsnis so powerful that it has the potential,to offer us a new way of lookingnat almost anything.,Even something as mysterious as love.,And so, to try to persuade you,of how totally amazing, excellentnand relevant mathematics is,,I want to give you my top threenmathematically verifiable tips for love. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so Top Tip #1:,How to win at online dating.,So my favorite online datingnwebsite is OkCupid,,not least because it was startednby a group of mathematicians.,Now, because they're mathematicians,,they have been collecting data,on everybody who uses their sitenfor almost a decade.,And they've been tryingnto search for patterns,in the way that we talk about ourselves,and the way that we interactnwith each other,on an online dating website.,And they've come up with somenseriously interesting findings.,But my particular favorite,is that it turns outnthat on an online dating website,,how attractive you arendoes not dictate how popular you are,,and actually, having peoplenthink that you're ugly,can work to your advantage. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let me show you how this works.,In a thankfully voluntarynsection of OkCupid,,you are allowed to ratenhow attractive you think people are,on a scale between one and five.,Now, if we compare this score,nthe average score,,to how many messagesna selection of people receive,,you can begin to get a sense,of how attractiveness links to popularitynon an online dating website. 
 This is the graph the OkCupid guysnhave come up with.,And the important thing to noticenis that it's not totally true,that the more attractive you are,nthe more messages you get.,But the question arises thennof what is it about people up here,who are so much more popularnthan people down here,,even though they have the samenscore of attractiveness?,And the reason why is that it's not justnstraightforward looks that are important.,So let me try to illustratentheir findings with an example.,So if you take someone likenPortia de Rossi, for example,,everybody agrees that Portia de Rossinis a very beautiful woman.,Nobody thinks that she's ugly,nbut she's not a supermodel, either.,If you compare Portia de Rossinto someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,,now, a lot of people,nmyself included, I should say,,think that Sarah Jessica Parkernis seriously fabulous,and possibly onenof the most beautiful creatures,to have ever have walkednon the face of the Earth.,But some other people,ni.e., most of the Internet ... 
 (Laughter) 
 seem to think that she looksna bit like a horse. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I think that if you ask peoplenhow attractive they thought,Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,,and you ask them to giventhem a score between one and five,I reckon that they'd average outnto have roughly the same score.,But the way that people would votenwould be very different.,So Portia's scores wouldnall be clustered around the four,because everybody agreesnthat she's very beautiful,,whereas Sarah Jessica Parkerncompletely divides opinion.,There'd be a huge spread in her scores.,And actually it's this spread that counts.,It's this spreadnthat makes you more popular,on an online Internet dating website.,So what that means then,is that if some peoplenthink that you're attractive,,you're actually better off,having some other peoplenthink that you're a massive minger.,That's much betternthan everybody just thinking,that you're the cute girl next door. 
 Now, I think this beginsnto make a bit more sense,when you think in terms of the peoplenwho are sending these messages.,So let's say that you thinknsomebody's attractive,,but you suspect that other peoplenwon't necessarily be that interested.,That means there'snless competition for you,and it's an extra incentivenfor you to get in touch.,Whereas compare thatnto if you think somebody is attractive,but you suspect that everybodynis going to think they're attractive.,Well, why would you bothernhumiliating yourself, let's be honest?,But here's where the reallyninteresting part comes.,Because when people choose the picturesnthat they use on an online dating website,,they often try to minimize the things,that they think some peoplenwill find unattractive.,The classic example is peoplenwho are, perhaps, a little bit overweight,deliberately choosingna very cropped photo, 
 (Laughter) 
 or bald men, for example,,deliberately choosing picturesnwhere they're wearing hats.,But actually this is the oppositenof what you should do,if you want to be successful.,You should really, instead,,play up to whatever it isnthat makes you different,,even if you think that some peoplenwill find it unattractive.,Because the people who fancy younare just going to fancy you anyway,,and the unimportant losers who don't,nwell, they only play up to your advantage. 
 OK, Top Tip #2:nHow to pick the perfect partner.,So let's imagine thennthat you're a roaring success,on the dating scene.,But the question arisesnof how do you then convert that success,into longer-term happiness,,and in particular, how do you decidenwhen is the right time to settle down?,Now generally,nit's not advisable to just cash in,and marry the first person who comes alongnand shows you any interest at all.,But, equally, you don't reallynwant to leave it too long,if you want to maximize your chancenof long-term happiness.,As my favorite author,nJane Austen, puts it,,"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty,can never hope to feelnor inspire affection again." 
 (Laughter) 
 Thanks a lot, Jane.,What do you know about love? 
 (Laughter) 
 So the question is then,,how do you know whennis the right time to settle down,,given all the peoplenthat you can date in your lifetime?,Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bitnof mathematics that we can use,to help us out here,ncalled optimal stopping theory.,So let's imagine, then,,that you start dating when you're 15,and ideally, you'd like to be marriednby the time that you're 35.,And there's a number of people,that you could potentiallyndate across your lifetime,,and they'll be at varyingnlevels of goodness.,Now the rules are that oncenyou cash in and get married,,you can't look ahead to seenwhat you could have had,,and equally, you can't go backnand change your mind.,In my experience at least,,I find that typically peoplendon't much like being recalled,years after being passed upnfor somebody else, or that's just me. 
 So the math says thennthat what you should do,in the first 37 percentnof your dating window,,you should just reject everybodynas serious marriage potential. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then, you should picknthe next person that comes along,that is better than everybodynthat you've seen before.,So here's the example.,Now if you do this, it can benmathematically proven, in fact,,that this is the best possible way,of maximizing your chancesnof finding the perfect partner.,Now unfortunately, I have to tell you thatnthis method does come with some risks.,For instance, imaginenif your perfect partner appeared,during your first 37 percent.,Now, unfortunately,nyou'd have to reject them. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, if you're following the maths,,I'm afraid no one else comes along,that's better than anyonenyou've seen before,,so you have to go onnrejecting everyone and die alone. 
 (Laughter) 
 Probably surrounded by cats ... 
 (Laughter) 
 nibbling at your remains. 
 OK, another risk is,nlet's imagine, instead,,that the first people that you datednin your first 37 percent,are just incredibly dull,nboring, terrible people.,That's OK, becausenyou're in your rejection phase,,so that's fine, you can reject them.,But then imaginenthe next person to come along,is just marginally less boring,ndull and terrible ... 
 (Laughter) 
 than everybody that you've seen before.,Now, if you are following the maths,nI'm afraid you have to marry them ... 
 (Laughter) 
 and end up in a relationshipnwhich is, frankly, suboptimal.,Sorry about that.,But I do think that there's an opportunitynhere for Hallmark to cash in on,and really cater for this market.,A Valentine's Day card like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 "My darling husband,nyou are marginally less terrible,than the first 37 percentnof people I dated." 
 (Laughter) 
 It's actually more romanticnthan I normally manage. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so this method doesn't give youna 100 percent success rate,,but there's no other possiblenstrategy that can do any better.,And actually, in the wild,nthere are certain types of fish,which follow and employnthis exact strategy.,So they reject every possiblensuitor that turns up,in the first 37 percentnof the mating season,,and then they pick the next fishnthat comes along after that window,that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier,than all of the fishnthat they've seen before.,I also think that subconsciously,nhumans, we do sort of do this anyway.,We give ourselves a little bit of timento play the field,,get a feel for the marketplacenor whatever when we're young.,And then we only start looking seriouslynat potential marriage candidates,once we hit our mid-to-late 20s.,I think this is conclusive proof,nif ever it were needed,,that everybody's brains are prewirednto be just a little bit mathematical. 
 OK, so that was Top Tip #2.,Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.,OK, so let's imagine thennthat you picked your perfect partner,and you're settling intona lifelong relationship with them.,Now, I like to think that everybodynwould ideally like to avoid divorce,,apart from, I don't know,nPiers Morgan's wife, maybe? 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's a sad fact of modern life,that one in two marriagesnin the States ends in divorce,,with the rest of the worldnnot being far behind.,Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps,for thinking that the argumentsnthat precede a marital breakup,are not an ideal candidatenfor mathematical investigation.,For one thing, it's very hard to know,what you should be measuringnor what you should be quantifying.,But this didn't stop a psychologist,nJohn Gottman, who did exactly that.,Gottman observed hundreds of couplesnhaving a conversation,and recorded, well,neverything you can think of.,So he recorded what was saidnin the conversation,,he recorded their skin conductivity,,he recorded their facial expressions,,their heart rates, their blood pressure,,basically everything apart from whethernor not the wife was actually always right,,which incidentally she totally is.,But what Gottman and his team found,was that one of the mostnimportant predictors,for whether or not a couplenis going to get divorced,was how positive or negative each partnernwas being in the conversation. 
 Now, couples that were very low-risk,scored a lot more positive pointsnon Gottman's scale than negative.,Whereas bad relationships,,by which I mean,nprobably going to get divorced,,they found themselves gettingninto a spiral of negativity.,Now just by using these very simple ideas,,Gottman and his group were able to predict,whether a given couplenwas going to get divorced,with a 90 percent accuracy.,But it wasn't until he teamed upnwith a mathematician, James Murray,,that they really started to understand,what causes these negativity spiralsnand how they occur.,And the results that they found,,I think, are just incrediblynimpressively simple and interesting.,So these equations predict how the wifenor husband is going to respond,in their next turn of the conversation,,how positive or negativenthey're going to be.,And these equations depend on,the mood of the personnwhen they're on their own,,the mood of the person whennthey're with their partner,,but most importantly, they depend on,how much the husband and wifeninfluence one another. 
 Now, I think it's importantnto point out at this stage,,that these exact equationsnhave also been shown,to be perfectly able at describing,what happens between two countriesnin an arms race. 
 (Laughter) 
 So that an arguing couplenspiraling into negativity,and teetering on the brink of divorce,is actually mathematically equivalentnto the beginning of a nuclear war. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the really important termnin this equation,is the influence that peoplenhave on one another,,and in particular, something calledn"the negativity threshold.",Now, the negativity threshold,,you can think of asnhow annoying the husband can be,before the wife starts to getnreally pissed off, and vice versa.,Now, I always thought that good marriagesnwere about compromise and understanding,and allowing the personnto have the space to be themselves.,So I would have thought that perhapsnthe most successful relationships,were ones where there wasna really high negativity threshold.,Where couples let things go,and only brought things upnif they really were a big deal.,But actually, the mathematicsnand subsequent findings by the team,have shown the exact opposite is true.,The best couples,nor the most successful couples,,are the ones with a really lownnegativity threshold.,These are the couplesnthat don't let anything go unnoticed,and allow each othernsome room to complain.,These are the couples that are continuallyntrying to repair their own relationship,,that have a much more positivenoutlook on their marriage.,Couples that don't let things go,and couples that don't let trivial thingsnend up being a really big deal. 
 Now of course, it takes a bit morenthan just a low negativity threshold,and not compromisingnto have a successful relationship.,But I think that it's quite interesting,to know that there is reallynmathematical evidence,to say that you should nevernlet the sun go down on your anger. 
 So those are my top three tips,of how maths can help younwith love and relationships.,But I hope, that aside fromntheir use as tips,,they also give you a little bit of insightninto the power of mathematics.,Because for me, equationsnand symbols aren't just a thing.,They're a voice that speaks outnabout the incredible richness of nature,and the startling simplicity,in the patterns that twist and turnnand warp and evolve all around us,,from how the world works to how we behave.,So I hope that perhaps,nfor just a couple of you,,a little bit of insightninto the mathematics of love,can persuade you to havena little bit more love for mathematics. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am a Hazara,,and the homelandnof my people is Afghanistan.,Like hundreds of thousandsnof other Hazara kids,,I was born in exile.,The ongoing persecutionnand operation against the Hazaras,forced my parents to leave Afghanistan. 
 This persecution has had a long historyngoing back to the late 1800s,,and the rule of King Abdur Rahman.,He killed 63 percent of nthe Hazara population.,He built minarets with their heads.,Many Hazaras were sold into slavery,,and many others fled the countrynfor neighboring Iran and Pakistan.,My parents also fled to Pakistan,,and settled in Quetta, where I was born. 
 After the September 11nattack on the Twin Towers,,I got a chance to go to Afghanistan,for the first time,nwith foreign journalists.,I was only 18, and I got a jobnworking as an interpreter.,After four years,,I felt it was safe enoughnto move to Afghanistan permanently,,and I was working therenas a documentary photographer,,and I worked on many stories. 
 One of the most importantnstories that I did,was the dancing boys of Afghanistan.,It is a tragic story aboutnan appalling tradition.,It involves young kidsndancing for warlords,and powerful men in the society.,These boys are often abductednor bought from their poor parents,,and they are put to work as sex slaves.,This is Shukur.,He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.,He was taken to another province,,where he was forced to work as a sex slavenfor the warlord and his friends. 
 When this story was publishednin the Washington Post,,I started receiving death threats,,and I was forced to leave Afghanistan,,as my parents were.,Along with my family,nI returned back to Quetta.,The situation in Quetta had changedndramatically since I left in 2005.,Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,,it had now turned into the mostndangerous city in Pakistan.,Hazaras are confined into two small areas,,and they are marginalized socially,neducationally, and financially.,This is Nadir.,I had known him since my childhood.,He was injured when his vannwas ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.,He later died of his injuries.,Around 1,600 Hazara members,had been killed in various attacks,,and around 3,000 of them were injured,,and many of them permanently disabled.,The attacks on the Hazara communitynwould only get worse,,so it was not surprisingnthat many wanted to flee. 
 After Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,,Australia is home to the fourth largestnpopulation of Hazaras in the world.,When it came time to leave Pakistan,,Australia seemed the obvious choice.,Financially, only one of us could leave,,and it was decided that I would go,,in the hope that if I arrivednat my destination safely,,I could work to get the restnof my family to join me later. 
 We all knew about the risks,,and how terrifying the journey is,,and I met many peoplenwho lost loved ones at sea.,It was a desperate decision to take,nto leave everything behind,,and no one makes this decision easily.,If I had been ablento simply fly to Australia,,it would have taken menless than 24 hours.,But getting a visa was impossible.,My journey was much longer,,much more complicated,,and certainly more dangerous,,traveling to Thailand by air,,and then by road and boatnto Malaysia and into Indonesia,,paying people and smugglers all the way,and spending a lot of time hiding,and a lot of time in fear of being caught. 
 In Indonesia, I joined a groupnof seven asylum seekers.,We all shared a bedroom,in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.,After spending a week in Bogor,,three of my roommatesnleft for the perilous journey,,and we got the news two days later,that a distressed boat sanknin the sea en route to Christmas Island.,We found out that our three roommates --nNawroz, Jaffar and Shabbir --,were also among those.,Only Jaffar was rescued.,Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again.,It made me think,,am I doing the right thing?,I concluded I really hadnno other choice but to go on. 
 A few weeks later, we got the callnfrom the people smuggler,to alert us that the boat is ready for usnto commence our sea journey.,Taken in the night towards the main vessel,on a motorboat,,we boarded an old fishing boatnthat was already overloaded.,There were 93 of us,,and we were all below deck.,No one was allowed up on the top.,We all paid 6,000 dollars each,for this part of the trip.,The first night and day went smoothly,,but by the second night, nthe weather turned. 
 Waves tossed the boat around,nand the timbers groaned.,People below deck were crying,npraying, recalling their loved ones.,They were screaming.,It was a terrible moment.,It was like a scene from doomsday,,or maybe like one of those scenesnfrom those Hollywood movies,that shows that everythingnis breaking apart,and the world is just ending.,It was happening to us for real.,We didn't have any hope.,Our boat was floatingnlike a matchbox on the water,without any control.,The waves were much higher than our boat,,and the water poured in fasternthan the motor pumps could take it out.,We all lost hope.,We thought, this is the end.,We were watching our deaths,,and I was documenting it. 
 The captain told us,that we are not going to make it,,we have to turn back the boat.,We went on the deck,and turned our torches on and off,to attract the attentionnof any passing boat.,We kept trying to attract their attentionnby waving our life jackets and whistling. 
 Eventually, we made it to a small island.,Our boat crashing onto the rocks,,I slipped into the water,and destroyed my camera,nwhatever I had documented.,But luckily, the memory card survived. 
 It was a thick forest.,We all split up into many groupsnas we argued over what to do next.,We were all scared and confused.,Then, after spendingnthe night on the beach,,we found a jetty and coconuts.,We hailed a boat from a nearby resort,,and then were quickly handed overnto Indonesian water police. 
 At Serang Detention Center,,an immigration officer camenand furtively strip-searched us.,He took our mobile, my $300 cash,,our shoes that we should notnbe able to escape,,but we kept watching the guards,nchecking their movements,,and around 4 a.m.nwhen they sat around a fire,,we removed two glass layersnfrom an outside facing window,and slipped through.,We climbed a tree next to an outer wallnthat was topped with the shards of glass.,We put the pillow on that,and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets,and climbed the wall,,and we ran away with bare feet. 
 I was free,,with an uncertain future,,no money.,The only thing I had was the memory cardnwith the pictures and footage.,When my documentary was airednon SBS Dateline,,many of my friends came to knownabout my situation,,and they tried to help me.,They did not allow me to takenany other boat to risk my life.,I also decided to stay in Indonesianand process my case through UNHCR,,but I was really afraidnthat I would end up in Indonesia,for many years doing nothingnand unable to work,,like every other asylum seeker. 
 But it had happened to bena little bit different with me.,I was lucky.,My contacts worked to expeditenmy case through UNHCR,,and I got resettlednin Australia in May 2013. 
 Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me.,It is really difficult to live a lifenwith an uncertain fate, in limbo. 
 The issue of asylum seekers in Australia,has been so extremely politicized,that it has lost its human face.,The asylum seekers have been demonizednand then presented to the people.,I hope my story and the storynof other Hazaras,could shed some light to show the people,how these people are sufferingnin their countries of origin,,and how they suffer,,why they risk their lives to seek asylum. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I didn't know when I agreed to do this,whether I was expected to talk or to sing.,But when I was told that the topic was language,,I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment. 
 I have a problem.,It's not the worst thing in the world.,I'm fine.,I'm not on fire.,I know that other people in the world,have far worse things to deal with,,but for me, language and music are,inextricably linked through this one thing. 
 And the thing is that I have a stutter.,It might seem curious given that I spend,a lot of my life on the stage.,One would assume that I'm comfortable,in the public sphere and comfortable here,,speaking to you guys.,But the truth is that I've spentnmy life up until this point,and including this point, living in mortal dread,of public speaking.,Public singing, whole different thing. (Laughter),But we'll get to that in a moment.,I've never really talked about it before so explicitly.,I think that that's because I've always lived in hope,that when I was a grown-up,,I wouldn't have one.,I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown,,I'll have learned to speak French,,and when I'm grown, I'll learnnhow to manage my money,,and when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter,,and then I'll be able to public speaknand maybe be the prime minister,and anything's possible and, you know.,(Laughter),So I can talk about it now,because I've reached this point, where —,I mean, I'm 28.,I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now.,(Laughter),And I'm an adult woman,who spends her life as a performer,,with a speech impediment.,So, I might as well come clean about it. 
 There are some interestingnangles to having a stutter.,For me, the worst thing that can happen,is meeting another stutterer.,(Laughter),This happened to me in Hamburg, when,this guy, we met and he said,,"Hello, m-m-m-my name is Joe,",and I said, "Oh, hello, m-m-m-my name is Meg.",Imagine my horror when I realized,he thought I was making fun of him.,(Laughter) 
 People think I'm drunk all the time.,(Laughter) 
 People think that I've forgotten their name,when I hesitate before saying it.,And it is a very weird thing, because,proper nouns are the worst.,If I'm going to use the wordn"Wednesday" in a sentence,,and I'm coming up to the word,,and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something,,I can change the word to "tomorrow,",or "the day after Tuesday,",or something else.,It's clunky, but you can get away with it,,because over time I've developed this,loophole method of using speech,where right at the last minute you,change the thing and you trick your brain.,But with people's names, you can't change them.,(Laughter),When I was singing a lot of jazz,,I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve.,As you can probably gather,,S's and T's, together or independently,,are my kryptonite.,But I would have to introduce the band,over this rolling vamp,,and when I got around to Steve,,I'd often find myself stuck on the "St.",And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable nand it totally kills the vibe.,So after a few instances of this,,Steve happily became "Seve,",and we got through it that way. (Laughter) 
 I've had a lot of therapy,,and a common form of treatment is to use,this technique that's called smooth speech,,which is where you almostnsing everything that you say.,You kind of join everything together in this,very singsong, kindergarten teacher way,,and it makes you sound very serene,nlike you've had lots of Valium,,and everything is calm. (Laughter),That's not actually me.,And I do use that. I do.,I use it when I have to be on panel shows,,or when I have to do radio interviews,,when the economy of airtime is paramount.,(Laughter),I get through it that way for my job.,But as an artist who feels that their work,is based solely on a platform of honesty,and being real,,that feels often like cheating. 
 Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you,what singing means to me.,It's more than making nice sounds,,and it's more than making nice songs.,It's more than feeling known, or understood.,It's more than making you feel the things that I feel.,It's not about mythology,,or mythologizing myself to you.,Somehow, through some miraculous,synaptic function of the human brain,,it's impossible to stutter when you sing.,And when I was younger,nthat was a method of treatment,that worked very well for me,,singing, so I did it a lot.,And that's why I'm here today. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Singing for me is sweet relief.,It is the only time when I feel fluent.,It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth,is comprehensively exactly what I intended.,(Laughter),So I know that this is a TED Talk,,but now i'm going to TED sing.,This is a song that I wrote last year. 
 Thank you very much. Thank you.

 Thank you very much. (Applause)I grew up in a very small country town,in Victoria.,I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.,I went to school, I hung out with my friends,,I fought with my younger sisters.,It was all very normal.,And when I was 15, a member of my local community,approached my parents,and wanted to nominate me,for a community achievement award.,And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,,but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.,She hasn't actually achieved anything." (Laughter) 
 And they were right, you know.,I went to school, I got good marks,,I had a very low-key after school job,in my mum's hairdressing salon,,and I spent a lot of time watching,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek.",Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.,But they were right, you know.,I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary,at all.,I wasn't doing anything that couldnbe considered an achievement,if you took disability out of the equation.,Years later, I was on my second teaching round,in a Melbourne high school,,and I was about 20 minutes intona year 11 legal studies class,when this boy put up his hand and said,,"Hey miss, when are you goingnto start doing your speech?",And I said, "What speech?",You know, I'd been talking them,about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.,And he said, "You know, like,,your motivational speaking.,You know, when people innwheelchairs come to school,,they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?",(Laughter),"It's usually in the big hall." 
 And that's when it dawned on me:,This kid had only ever experienced disabled people,as objects of inspiration.,We are not, to this kid --,and it's not his fault, I mean,,that's true for many of us.,For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers,or our doctors or our manicurists.,We're not real people. We are there to inspire.,And in fact, I am sitting on this stage,looking like I do in this wheelchair,,and you are probably kind of expecting me,to inspire you. Right? (Laughter),Yeah. 
 Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid,I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.,I am not here to inspire you.,I am here to tell you that we have been lied to,about disability.,Yeah, we've been sold the lie,that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.,It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability,makes you exceptional.,It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't,make you exceptional. 
 And in the past few years, we've been able,to propagate this lie even further,via social media.,You may have seen images like this one:,"The only disability in life is a bad attitude.",Or this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.,Or this one: "Before you quit, try!",These are just a couple of examples,,but there are a lot of these images out there.,You know, you might have seen the one,,the little girl with no hands,drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.,You might have seen a child running,on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.,And these images,,there are lots of them out there,,they are what we call inspiration porn.,(Laughter),And I use the term porn deliberately,,because they objectify one group of people,for the benefit of another group of people.,So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people,for the benefit of nondisabled people.,The purpose of these images,is to inspire you, to motivate you,,so that we can look at them,and think, "Well, however bad my life is,,it could be worse.,I could be that person." 
 But what if you are that person?,I've lost count of the number of times that I've,been approached by strangers,wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave,or inspirational,,and this was long before my work,had any kind of public profile.,They were just kind of congratulating me,for managing to get up in the morning,and remember my own name. (Laughter),And it is objectifying.,These images, those images,objectify disabled people,for the benefit of nondisabled people.,They are there so that you can look at them,and think that things aren't so bad for you,,to put your worries into perspective. 
 And life as a disabled person,is actually somewhat difficult.,We do overcome some things.,But the things that we're overcoming,are not the things that you think they are.,They are not things to do with our bodies.,I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,,because I subscribe to what's callednthe social model of disability,,which tells us that we are more disabled,by the society that we live in,than by our bodies and our diagnoses. 
 So I have lived in this body a long time.,I'm quite fond of it.,It does the things that I need it to do,,and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity,just as you have,,and that's the thing about thosenkids in those pictures as well.,They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.,They are just using their bodies,to the best of their capacity.,So is it really fair to objectify them,in the way that we do,,to share those images?,People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,",they mean it as a compliment.,And I know why it happens.,It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold,this lie that disability makes you exceptional.,And it honestly doesn't. 
 And I know what you're thinking.,You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,,and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,,aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?",And the thing is, I am.,I learn from other disabled people all the time.,I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.,I am learning that it's a genius idea,to use a pair of barbecue tongs,to pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter),I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge,your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.,Genius.,We are learning from eachnothers' strength and endurance,,not against our bodies and our diagnoses,,but against a world that exceptionalizes,and objectifies us. 
 I really think that this lie that we've been sold,about disability is the greatest injustice.,It makes life hard for us.,And that quote, "The only disability in life,is a bad attitude,",the reason that that's bullshit,is because it's just not true,,because of the social model of disability.,No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs,has ever made it turn into a ramp.,Never. (Laughter) (Applause),Smiling at a television screen,isn't going to make closed captions appear,for people who are deaf.,No amount of standingnin the middle of a bookshop,and radiating a positive attitude,is going to turn all those books into braille.,It's just not going to happen. 
 I really want to live in a world,where disability is not the exception, but the norm.,I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl,sitting in her bedroom,watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer",isn't referred to as achieving anything,because she's doing it sitting down.,I want to live in a world,where we don't have such low expectations,of disabled people,that we are congratulated for getting out of bed,and remembering our own names in the morning.,I want to live in a world wherenwe value genuine achievement,for disabled people,,and I want to live in a world,where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school,is not one bit surprised,that his new teacher is a wheelchair user. 
 Disability doesn't make you exceptional,,but questioning what younthink you know about it does. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to talk to you about one thing,and just one thing only,,and this has to do with when people ask me,,what do you do?,To which I usually respond,,I do computer music. 
 Now, a number of people,just stop talking to me right then and there,,and the rest who are left usually have,this blank look in their eye,,as if to say, what does that mean?,And I feel like I'm actually depriving them,of information by telling them this,,at which point I usually panic,and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind,,which is, I have no idea what I'm doing.,Which is true.,That's usually followed by a second thought,,which is, whatever it is that I'm doing,,I love it.,And today, I want to, well,,share with you something I love,,and also why. 
 And I think we'll begin with just this question:,What is computer music?,And I'm going to try to do mynbest to provide a definition,,maybe by telling you a story,that goes through some of the stuff,I've been working on. 
 And the first thing, I think, in our story,is going to be something called ChucK.,Now, ChucK is a programming language for music,,and it's open-source, it's freely available,,and I like to think that it crashes equally well,on all modern operating systems.,And instead of telling you more about it,,I'm just going to give you a demo.,By the way, I'm just going to nerd out,for just a few minutes here,,so I would say, don't freak out.,In fact, I would invite all of you to join me,in just geeking out.,If you've never written a linenof code before in your life,,do not worry.,I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this. 
 First thing I'm going to do is to make,a sine wave oscillator,,and we're going to called the sine wave generator,"Ge.",And then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.,Now this is kind of the abstraction,for the sound output on my computer. Okay?,So I've connected myself into the speaker.,Next, I'm going to say my frequency,is 440 hertz,,and I'm going to let time advance,by two seconds through this operation.,All right, so if I were to play this --,(Tone) —,you would hear a sine wavenat 440 hertz for two seconds.,Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,,and then just change some of these numbers,,220.5, 440 I shall leave it as that,,and .5 and 880.,By doubling the frequency,,we're actually going up in successive octaves,,and then we have this sequence --,(Tones) — of tones.,Okay, great, now I can imagine creating,all kinds of really horrible,single sine wave pieces of music with this,,but I'm going to do somethingnthat computers are really good at,,which is repetition.,I'm going to put this all in a while loop,,and you actually don't need to indent,,but this is purely for aesthetic reasons.,It's good practice.,And when we do this —,(Tones) —,that's going to go on for a while.,In fact, it's probably not going to stop,until this computer disintegrates.,And I can't really empirically prove that to you,,but I hope you'll believe me when I say that.,Next, I'm going to replace this 220,by math.random2f.,I'm going to generate a random number,between 30 and 1,000 and send that,to the frequency of me.,And I'm going to do this every half a second.,(Tones),Let's do this every 200 milliseconds.,(Tones),One hundred.,(Tones),All right.,At this point, we've reached something,that I would like to think of as,the canonical computer music.,This is, to me, the sound that mainframes,are supposed to be making,when they're thinking really hard.,It's this sound, it's like,,the square root of five million. 
 So is this computer music?,Yeah, I guess by definition,,it's kind of computer music.,It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to,cruising down the highway,,but it's a foundation of computer-generated music,,and using ChucK,,we've actually been building instruments,in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,,based right here at Stanford Center fornComputer Research in Music and Acoustics. 
 Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops,,humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.,Now the reason we have these,is so that for the instruments that we create,out of the laptop, we want the sound to come,out of somewhere near the instrument,and the performer,,kind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument.,Like, if I were to play a violin here,,the sound would naturally not come out of,the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.,So these speakers are meant to emulate that.,In fact, I'm going to show you,how we actually built them.,The first step is to go to IKEA,and buy a salad bowl.,This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.,That's the actual name,,and I actually use one of these,to make salad at home as well, I kid you not.,And the first step is you turn it upside down,,and then you drill holes in them,,six holes per hemi,,and then make a base plate,,put car speaker drivers in them,along with amplifiers in the enclosure,,and you put that all together and you have,these hemispherical speaker arrays.,Add people, add laptops,,you have a laptop orchestra. 
 And what might a laptop orchestra sound like?,Well, let me give you a demonstration,of about 200 instruments we've created so far,for the Laptop Orchestra.,And what I'm going to do isnactually come over to this thing.,This thing I have in front of me,actually used to be a commodity gaming controller,called a Gametrak.,This thing actually has a glovenyou can put on your hands.,It's tethered to the base,,and this will track the position of your hands,in real time.,It was originally designed as a golfing controller,to detect the motion of your swing.,That turned out to be a rather large,commercial non-success,,at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars,,at which point computer music researchers,said, "This is awesome!,We can prototype instruments out of this." 
 So let me show you one instrument we've created,,one of many, and this instrument,is called "Twilight,",and it's meant to go with this metaphor,of pulling a sound out of the ground.,So let me see if this will work. 
 (Music) 
 And put it back.,And then if you go to the left,,right,,it sounds like an elephant in pain. 
 This is a slightly metallic sound.,Turn it just a bit. 
 (Music),It's like a hovering car. 
 Okay. 
 This third one is a ratchet-like interaction, so,let me turn it up. 
 (Music) 
 So it's a slightly different interaction. 
 The fourth one is a drone. 
 (Music),And finally, let's see,,this is a totally different interaction,,and I think you have to imagine that there's,this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage,,and I'm going to bang it.,(Drum),(Laughter),So there we go, so that's one of many instruments,in the Laptop Orchestra. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 And when you put that together,,you get something that sounds like this. 
 (Music) 
 Okay, and so, I think from the experience,of building a lot of instrumentsnfor the Laptop Orchestra,,and I think from the curiosity of wondering,,what if we took these,hopefully expressive instruments,and we brought it to a lot of people,,plus then a healthy bout of insanity —,put those three things together —,led to me actually co-founding a startup company,in 2008 called Smule. 
 Now Smule's mission is to create,expressive, mobile music things,,and one of the first musical instruments,we created is called Ocarina.,And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick.,So Ocarina —,(Music) —,is based on this ancient flute-like instrument,called the ocarina,,and this one is the four-holenEnglish pendant configuration,,and you're literally blowing into the microphone,to make the sound.,And there's actually a little ChucK script,running in here that's detecting,the strength of your blowing,and also synthesizing the sound.,(Music),And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer,,so you can get —,(Music),All right. So let me play a little ditty for you,,a little Bach.,And here, you'll hear a littlenaccompaniment with the melody.,The accompaniment actually follows the melody,,not the other way around. 
 (Music) 
 And this was designed,to let you take your time,and figure out where your expressive space is,,and you can just hang out here,for a while, for a reallyndramatic effect, if you want,,and whenever you're ready — 
 (Music) 
 And on these longer notes,,I'm going to use more vibrato,towards the end of the notes,to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality. 
 (Music) 
 Huh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is,,is this a toy or it an instrument? Maybe it's both,,but for me, I think the more important question is,,is it expressive?,And at the same time, I think,creating these types of instruments,asks a question about the role of technology,,and its place for how we make music.,Apparently, for example,,not that long ago, like only a hundred years ago —,that's not that long in the course of human history —,families back then,used to make music together,as a common form of entertainment.,I don't think that's really happening,that much anymore.,You know, this is before radio, before recording.,In the last hundred years, with all this technology,,we now have more access to music,as listeners and consumers,,but somehow, I think we're making less music,than ever before.,I'm not sure why that would be.,Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play.,And while listening to music is wonderful,,there's a special joy to making music,that's all its own.,And I think that's one part,of the goal of why I do what I do,is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right? 
 Now, if that's one goal, the other goal,is to look to the future and think about,what kind of new musical things can we make,that we don't perhaps yet have names for,that's enabled by technology, but ultimately,might change the way that humans make music.,And I'll just give you one example here,,and this is Ocarina's other feature.,This is a globe,,and here you're actually listening,to other users of Ocarina,blow into their iPhones to play something.,This is "G.I.R." from Texas,,"R.I.K." I don't know why it's thesenthree-letter names today, Los Angeles.,They're all playing pretty,,somewhat minimal music here. 
 (Music) 
 And the idea with this is that, well,,technology should not be foregrounded here,,and — (Laughter) —,we've actually opened this up.,The first thought is that, hey, you know,there's somebody somewhere out there,playing some music,,and this is a small but I think important,human connection to make,that perhaps the technology affords. 
 As a final example,,and perhaps my favorite example,,is that in the wake of the 2011 earthquake,and tsunami disaster in Japan,,a woman reached out in one of our singing apps,to try to get people to join in to sing with her,on a version of "Lean on Me.",Now, in these apps, there's this thing that allows,any user to add their voice,to an existing performance by any other user,or group of users,,so in some sense, she's created this kind of,global ad hoc corral of strangers,,and within weeks, thousands of people,joined in on this,,and you can kind of see peoplencoming from all around the world,and all these lines converging on the origin,where the first rendition of the song was sung,,and that's in Tokyo.,And this is what it sounds like nwhen there's 1,000 people.,This is 1,000 voices. 
 (Recording) ♪ Sometimes in our lives ♪ 
 ♪ We all have pain, we all have sorrow ♪ 
 ♪ But if we are wise ♪ 
 ♪ We know that there's always tomorrow ♪ 
 ♪ Lean on me ♪ 
 ♪ When you're not strong ♪

 ♪ I'll help you carry on ♪

 ♪ Somebody to lean on ♪ 
 ♪ Just lean on — ♪ 
 Is this computer music? 
 (Applause) 
 Was that computer music?,Yeah, I guess so; it's something that you really,couldn't have done without computers.,But at the same time, it's also just human,,and I think what I've essentially answered so far,is maybe why I do the stuff that I do,,and let's just finally return to the first question:,What is computer music?,And I think that the catch here is that,,at least to me, computer music,isn't really about computers.,It is about people.,It's about how we can use technology,to change the way we think,and do and make music,,and maybe even add to how we can,connect with each other through music. 
 And with that, I want to say,,this is computer music, and thank you for listening. 
 (Applause)People say things about religion all the time.,(Laughter),The late, great Christopher Hitchens,wrote a book called "God Is Not Great",whose subtitle was, "Religion Poisons Everything.",(Laughter),But last month, in Time magazine,,Rabbi David Wolpe, who I gathernis referred to as America's rabbi,,said, to balance that againstnthat negative characterization,,that no important form of social change,can be brought about except through organized religion. 
 Now, remarks of this sort on the negative,and the positive side are very old.,I have one in my pocket here,from the first century BCE by Lucretius,,the author of "On the Nature of Things," who said,,"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum" --,I should have been able to learn that by heart —,which is, that's how much religion,is able to persuade people to do evil,,and he was talking about the fact,of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter,Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice,in order to preserve the prospects of his army.,So there have been these long debates,over the centuries, in that case, actually,,we can say over the millennia, about religion.,People have talked about it a lot,,and they've said good and bad,and indifferent things about it. 
 What I want to persuade you of today,is of a very simple claim,,which is that these debates are,in a certain sense preposterous,,because there is no such thing as religion,about which to make these claims.,There isn't a thing called religion,,and so it can't be good or bad.,It can't even be indifferent.,And if you think about claims,about the nonexistence of things,,one obvious way to try and establish,the nonexistence of a purported thing,would be to offer a definition of that thing,and then to see whether anything satisfied it.,I'm going to start out on that little route,to begin with. 
 So if you look in the dictionaries,and if you think about it,,one very natural definition of religion,is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.,As I say, this is in many dictionaries,,but you'll also find it actually,in the work of Sir Edward Tylor,,who was the first professornof anthropology at Oxford,,one of the first modern anthropologists.,In his book on primitive culture,,he says the heart of religionnis what he called animism,,that is, the belief in spiritual agency,,belief in spirits.,The first problem for that definition,is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called "Tuff.",There's a guy talking to a rabbi.,The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.,The guy says, "You're a rabbi,nhow can you not believe in God?",And the reply is, "It's what'snso great about being Jewish.,You don't have to believe in a God per se,,just in being Jewish." (Laughter),So if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi,,and if you have to believe innGod in order to be religious,,then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion,that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi,without believing in God,,Judaism isn't a religion.,That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought. 
 Here's another argument against this view.,A friend of mine, an Indian friend of mine,,went to his grandfather when he was very young,,a child, and said to him,,"I want to talk to you about religion,",and his grandfather said, "You're too young.,Come back when you're a teenager.",So he came back when he was a teenager,,and he said to his grandfather,,"It may be a bit late now,because I've discovered thatnI don't believe in the gods.",And his grandfather, who was a wise man, said,,"Oh, so you belong to the atheist branch,of the Hindu tradition." (Laughter) 
 And finally, there's this guy,,who famously doesn't believe in God.,His name is the Dalai Lama.,He often jokes that he's onenof the world's leading atheists.,But it's true, because the Dalai Lama's religion,does not involve belief in God. 
 Now you might think this just shows,that I've given you the wrong definition,and that I should come up with some other definition,and test it against these cases,and try and find something that captures,atheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism,,and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity,,but I actually think that that's a bad idea,,and the reason I think it's a bad idea,is that I don't think that's how,our concept of religion works.,I think the way our concept of religion works,is that we actually have, we have a list,of paradigm religions,and their sub-parts, right,,and if something new comes along,that purports to be a religion,,what we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?",Right?,And I think that's not onlynhow we think about religion,,and that's, as it were,,so from our point of view,,anything on that list had better be a religion,,which is why I don't think an account of religion,that excludes Buddhism and Judaism,has a chance of being a good starter,,because they're on our list.,But why do we have such a list?,What's going on? How did it come about,that we have this list? 
 I think the answer is a pretty simple one,and therefore crude and contentious.,I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it,,but here's my story,,and true or not, it's a story that I think,gives you a good sense of how,the list might have come about,,and therefore helps you to think about,what use the list might be.,I think the answer is, European travelers,,starting roughly about the time of Columbus,,started going around the world.,They came from a Christian culture,,and when they arrived in a new place,,they noticed that some peoplendidn't have Christianity,,and so they asked themselvesnthe following question:,what have they got instead of Christianity?,And that list was essentially constructed.,It consists of the things that other people had,instead of Christianity. 
 Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way,,which is that Christianity is extremely,,even on that list, it's an extremely specific tradition.,It has all kinds of things in it,that are very, very particular,that are the results of the specifics,of Christian history,,and one thing that's at the heart of it,,one thing that's at the heart ofnmost understandings of Christianity,,which is the result of thenspecific history of Christianity,,is that it's an extremely creedal religion.,It's a religion in which people are really concerned,about whether you believe the right things.,The history of Christianity, theninternal history of Christianity,,is largely the history of people killing each other,because they believed the wrong thing,,and it's also involved in,struggles with other religions,,obviously starting in the Middle Ages,,a struggle with Islam,,in which, again, it was the infidelity,,the fact that they didn't believe the right things,,that seemed so offensive to the Christian world.,Now that's a very specific and particular history,that Christianity has,,and not everywhere is everything,that has ever been put on this sort of list like it.,Here's another problem, I think.,A very specific thing happened.,It was actually adverted to earlier,,but a very specific thing happened,in the history of the kind of Christianity,that we see around us,mostly in the United States today,,and it happened in the late 19th century,,and that specific thing that happened,in the late 19th century,was a kind of deal that was cut,between science,,this new way of organizing intellectual authority,,and religion.,If you think about the 18th century, say,,if you think about intellectual life,before the late 19th century,,anything you did, anything you thought about,,whether it was the physical world,,the human world,,the natural world apart from the human world,,or morality, anything you did,would have been framed against the background,of a set of assumptions that were religious,,Christian assumptions.,You couldn't give an account,of the natural world,that didn't say something about its relationship,,for example, to the creation story,in the Abrahamic tradition,,the creation story in the first book of the Torah.,So everything was framed in that way. 
 But this changes in the late 19th century,,and for the first time, it's possible for people,to develop serious intellectual careers,as natural historians like Darwin.,Darwin worried about the relationship between,what he said and the truths of religion,,but he could proceed, he could write books,about his subject,without having to say what the relationship was,to the religious claims,,and similarly, geologistsnincreasingly could talk about it.,In the early 19th century, if you were a geologist,and made a claim about the age of the Earth,,you had to explain whether that was consistent,or how it was or wasn't consistent,with the age of the Earth implied,by the account in Genesis.,By the end of the 19th century,,you can just write a geology textbook,in which you make argumentsnabout how old the Earth is.,So there's a big change, and that division,,that intellectual division ofnlabor occurs as I say, I think,,and it sort of solidifies so that by the end,of the 19th century in Europe,,there's a real intellectual division of labor,,and you can do all sorts of serious things,,including, increasingly, even philosophy,,without being constrained by the thought,,"Well, what I have to say has to be consistent,with the deep truths that are given to me,by our religious tradition." 
 So imagine someone who's coming out,of that world, that late-19th-century world,,coming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana,,the society that I grew up in, Asante,,coming into that world,at the turn of the 20th century,with this question that made the list:,what have they got instead of Christianity? 
 Well, here's one thing he would have noticed,,and by the way, there was a nperson who actually did this.,His name was Captain Rattray,,he was sent as the Britishngovernment anthropologist,,and he wrote a book about Asante religion. 
 This is a soul disc.,There are many of them in the British Museum.,I could give you an interesting, different history,of how it comes about that many of the things,from my society ended up in the British Museum,,but we don't have time for that.,So this object is a soul disc.,What is a soul disc?,It was worn around the necks,of the soul-washers of the Asante king.,What was their job? To wash the king's soul.,It would take a long while,to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing,that could be washed,,but Rattray knew that this was religion,because souls were in play. 
 And similarly,,there were many other things, many other practices.,For example, every time anybodynhad a drink, more or less,,they poured a little bit on the ground,in what's called the libation,,and they gave some to the ancestors.,My father did this. Every timenhe opened a bottle of whiskey,,which I'm glad to say was very often,,he would take the top off andnpour off just a little on the ground,,and he would talk to,,he would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line,,or Yao Antony, my great uncle,,he would talk to them,,offer them a little bit of this. 
 And finally, there were thesenhuge public ceremonials.,This is an early-19th-century drawing,by another British military officer,of such a ceremonial,,where the king was involved,,and the king's job,,one of the large parts of his job,,apart from organizing warfare and things like that,,was to look after the tombs of his ancestors,,and when a king died,,the stool that he sat on was blackened,and put in the royal ancestral temple,,and every 40 days,,the King of Asante has to go and do cult,for his ancestors.,That's a large part of his job,,and people think that if he doesn't do it,,things will fall apart.,So he's a religious figure,,as Rattray would have said,,as well as a political figure. 
 So all this would count as religion for Rattray,,but my point is that when you look,into the lives of those people,,you also find that every time they do anything,,they're conscious of the ancestors.,Every morning at breakfast,,you can go outside the front of the house,and make an offering to the god tree, the nyame dua,outside your house,,and again, you'll talk to the gods,and the high gods and the low gods,and the ancestors and so on.,This is not a world,in which the separation between religion and science,has occurred.,Religion has not being separated,from any other areas of life,,and in particular,,what's crucial to understand about this world,is that it's a world in which the job,that science does for us,is done by what Rattray is going to call religion,,because if they want an explanation of something,,if they want to know why the crop just failed,,if they want to know why it's raining,or not raining, if they need rain,,if they want to know why,their grandfather has died,,they are going to appeal to the very same entities,,the very same language,,talk to the very same gods about that.,This great separation, in other words,,between religion and science hasn't happened. 
 Now, this would be a mere historical curiosity,,except that in large parts of the world,,this is still the truth.,I had the privilege of going to a wedding,the other day in northern Namibia,,20 miles or so south of the Angolan border,in a village of 200 people.,These were modern people.,We had with us Oona Chaplin,,who some of you may have heard of,,and one of the people fromnthis village came up to her,,and said, "I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'",So these were not people whonwere isolated from our world,,but nevertheless, for them,,the gods and the spirits are still very much there,,and when we were on the bus going back and forth,to the various parts of the [ceremony],,they prayed not just in a generic way,but for the safety of the journey,,and they meant it,,and when they said to me that my mother,,the bridegroom's [grandmother],,was with us, they didn't mean it figuratively.,They meant, even though she was a dead person,,they meant that she was still around.,So in large parts of the world today,,that separation between science and religion,hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today,,and as I say, these are not --,This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank.,These are fellow citizens of the world with you,,but they come from a place in which religion,is occupying a very different role. 
 So what I want you to think aboutnnext time somebody wants,to make some vast generalization about religion,is that maybe there isn't such a thing,as a religion, such a thing as religion,,and that therefore what they say,cannot possibly be true. 
 (Applause)Think of a hard choicenyou'll face in the near future.,It might be between two careers --,artist and accountant --,or places to live --nthe city or the country --,or even between two people to marry --,you could marry Bettynor you could marry Lolita.,Or it might be a choicenabout whether to have children,,to have an ailing parent move in with you,,to raise your child in a religionnthat your partner lives by,but leaves you cold.,Or whether to donatenyour life savings to charity. 
 Chances are, the hard choicenyou thought of was something big,,something momentous,nsomething that matters to you.,Hard choices seem to be occasions,for agonizing, hand-wringing,nthe gnashing of teeth.,But I think we'venmisunderstood hard choices,and the role they play in our lives.,Understanding hard choices,uncovers a hidden powerneach of us possesses. 
 What makes a choice hardnis the way the alternatives relate.,In any easy choice,,one alternative is better than the other.,In a hard choice,,one alternative is better in some ways,,the other alternativenis better in other ways,,and neither is betternthan the other overall.,You agonize over whether to staynin your current job in the city,or uproot your lifenfor more challenging work in the country,,because staying is better in some ways,,moving is better in others,,and neither is betternthan the other overall. 
 We shouldn't thinknthat all hard choices are big.,Let's say you're decidingnwhat to have for breakfast.,You could have high fiber bran cereal,or a chocolate donut.,Suppose what matters in the choicenis tastiness and healthfulness.,The cereal is better for you,,the donut tastes way better,,but neither is betternthan the other overall,,a hard choice.,Realizing that small choicesncan also be hard,,may make big hard choicesnseem less intractable.,After all, we manage to figure outnwhat to have for breakfast,,so maybe we can figure outnwhether to stay in the city,or uproot for the new job in the country. 
 We also shouldn't thinknthat hard choices are hard,because we are stupid.,When I graduated from college,,I couldn't decide between two careers,nphilosophy and law.,I really loved philosophy.,There are amazing thingsnyou can learn as a philosopher,,and all from the comfort of an armchair.,But I came from a modest immigrant family,where my idea of luxury,was having a pork tonguenand jelly sandwich,in my school lunchbox,,so the thought of spending my whole life,sitting around in armchairsnjust thinking ...,Well, that struck me as the heightnof extravagance and frivolity.,So I got out my yellow pad,,I drew a line down the middle,,and I tried my bestnto think of the reasons,for and against each alternative.,I remember thinking to myself,,if only I knew what my lifenin each career would be like.,If only God or Netflix would send me a DVDnof my two possible future careers,,I'd be set.,I'd compare them side by side,,I'd see that one was better,,and the choice would be easy. 
 But I got no DVD,,and because I couldn'tnfigure out which was better,,I did what many of us do in hard choices:,I took the safest option.,Fear of being an unemployed philosophernled me to become a lawyer,,and as I discovered,nlawyering didn't quite fit.,It wasn't who I was.,So now I'm a philosopher,,and I study hard choices,,and I can tell you,nthat fear of the unknown,,while a common motivational defaultnin dealing with hard choices,,rests on a misconception of them.,It's a mistake to thinknthat in hard choices,,one alternativenreally is better than the other,,but we're too stupid to know which,,and since we don't know which,,we might as well takenthe least risky option.,Even taking two alternatives side by side,with full information,na choice can still be hard.,Hard choices are hardnnot because of us or our ignorance;,they're hard because therenis no best option. 
 Now, if there's no best option,,if the scales don't tip in favornof one alternative over another,,then surely the alternativesnmust be equally good.,So maybe the right thingnto say in hard choices,is that they'renbetween equally good options.,But that can't be right.,If alternatives are equally good,nyou should just flip a coin between them,,and it seems a mistake to think,,here's how you shouldndecide between careers,,places to live, people to marry:,Flip a coin. 
 There's another reason for thinking,that hard choices aren't choicesnbetween equally good options.,Suppose you have a choicenbetween two jobs:,you could be an investment banker,or a graphic artist.,There are a variety of thingsnthat matter in such a choice,,like the excitement of the work,,achieving financial security,,having time to raise a family, and so on.,Maybe the artist's careernputs you on the cutting edge,of new forms of pictorial expression.,Maybe the banking careernputs you on the cutting edge,of new forms of financial manipulation. 
 (Laughter) 
 Imagine the two jobs however you like,,so that neither is better than the other. 
 Now suppose we improve one of them, a bit.,Suppose the bank, wooing you,,adds 500 dollars a month to your salary.,Does the extra money,now make the banking jobnbetter than the artist one?,Not necessarily.,A higher salary makes the banking jobnbetter than it was before,,but it might not be enough,to make being a bankernbetter than being an artist.,But if an improvement in one of the jobsndoesn't make it better than the other,,then the two original jobsncould not have been equally good.,If you start with two thingsnthat are equally good,,and you improve one of them,,it now must be better than the other.,That's not the casenwith options in hard choices. 
 So now we've got a puzzle.,We've got two jobs.,Neither is better than the other,nnor are they equally good.,So how are we supposed to choose?,Something seems to have gone wrong here.,Maybe the choice itself is problematic,nand comparison is impossible.,But that can't be right.,It's not like we're trying to choosenbetween two things that can't be compared.,We're weighing the meritsnof two jobs, after all,,not the merits of the number ninenand a plate of fried eggs.,A comparison of the overallnmerits of two jobs,is something we can make,,and one we often do make. 
 I think the puzzle arises,because of an unreflective assumptionnwe make about value.,We unwittingly assume that valuesnlike justice, beauty, kindness,,are akin to scientific quantities,nlike length, mass and weight.,Take any comparative questionnnot involving value,,such as which of two suitcases is heavier.,There are only three possibilities.,The weight of one is greater, lessernor equal to the weight of the other.,Properties like weight can benrepresented by real numbers --,one, two, three and so on --,and there are onlynthree possible comparisons,between any two real numbers.,One number is greater, lesser,nor equal to the other.,Not so with values.,As post-Enlightenment creatures,,we tend to assume,that scientific thinking holds the keynto everything of importance in our world,,but the world of valuenis different from the world of science.,The stuff of the one worldncan be quantified by real numbers.,The stuff of the other world can't.,We shouldn't assume that the world of is,nof lengths and weights,,has the same structurenas the world of ought,,of what we should do. 
 So if what matters to us --,a child's delight, the lovenyou have for your partner —,can't be represented by real numbers,,then there's no reason to believe,that in choice, there are onlynthree possibilities --,that one alternative is better,nworse or equal to the other.,We need to introducena new, fourth relation,beyond being better, worse or equal,,that describes what's going onnin hard choices.,I like to say thatnthe alternatives are "on a par.",When alternatives are on a par,,it may matter very much which you choose,,but one alternativenisn't better than the other.,Rather, the alternatives arenin the same neighborhood of value,,in the same league of value,,while at the same timenbeing very different in kind of value.,That's why the choice is hard. 
 Understanding hard choices in this way,uncovers somethingnabout ourselves we didn't know.,Each of us has the powernto create reasons.,Imagine a worldnin which every choice you face,is an easy choice,,that is, there's alwaysna best alternative.,If there's a best alternative,nthen that's the one you should choose,,because part of being rational,is doing the better thingnrather than the worse thing,,choosing what you havenmost reason to choose.,In such a world,,we'd have most reason,to wear black socks instead of pink socks,,to eat cereal instead of donuts,,to live in the citynrather than the country,,to marry Betty instead of Lolita.,A world full of only easy choicesnwould enslave us to reasons. 
 When you think about it, 
 (Laughter) 
 it's nuts to believenthat the reasons given to you,dictated that you hadnmost reason to pursue,the exact hobbies you do,,to live in the exact house you do,,to work at the exact job you do.,Instead, you faced alternativesnthat were on a par --,hard choices --,and you made reasons for yourself,to choose that hobby,nthat house and that job.,When alternatives are on a par,,the reasons given to us,,the ones that determinenwhether we're making a mistake,,are silent as to what to do.,It's here, in the space of hard choices,,that we get to exercisenour normative power --,the power to create reasons for yourself,,to make yourself into the kind of person,for whom country livingnis preferable to the urban life. 
 When we choose between optionsnthat are on a par,,we can do somethingnreally rather remarkable.,We can put our very selvesnbehind an option.,Here's where I stand.,Here's who I am, I am for banking.,I am for chocolate donuts. 
 (Laughter) 
 This response in hard choicesnis a rational response,,but it's not dictatednby reasons given to us.,Rather, it's supportednby reasons created by us.,When we create reasons for ourselves,to become this kindnof person rather than that,,we wholeheartedly becomenthe people that we are.,You might say that we becomenthe authors of our own lives. 
 So when we face hard choices,nwe shouldn't beat our head against a wall,trying to figure outnwhich alternative is better.,There is no best alternative.,Instead of looking for reasons out there,,we should be looking for reasons in here:,Who am I to be?,You might decide to bena pink sock-wearing,,cereal-loving, country-living banker,,and I might decide to bena black sock-wearing,,urban, donut-loving artist.,What we do in hard choicesnis very much up to each of us. 
 Now, people who don't exercisentheir normative powers in hard choices,are drifters.,We all know people like that.,I drifted into being a lawyer.,I didn't put my agency behind lawyering.,I wasn't for lawyering.,Drifters allow the worldnto write the story of their lives.,They let mechanismsnof reward and punishment --,pats on the head, fear,nthe easiness of an option --,to determine what they do.,So the lesson of hard choices:,reflect on what you cannput your agency behind,,on what you can be for,,and through hard choices,,become that person. 
 Far from being sources of agony and dread,,hard choices are precious opportunities,for us to celebrate what is specialnabout the human condition,,that the reasons that governnour choices as correct or incorrect,sometimes run out,,and it is here, in the spacenof hard choices,,that we have the powernto create reasons for ourselves,to become the distinctivenpeople that we are.,And that's why hardnchoices are not a curse,but a godsend. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Every day we face issues like climate change,or the safety of vaccines,where we have to answer questions whose answers,rely heavily on scientific information.,Scientists tell us that the world is warming.,Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe.,But how do we know if they are right?,Why should be believe the science?,The fact is, many of us actuallyndon't believe the science.,Public opinion polls consistently show,that significant proportions of the American people,don't believe the climate isnwarming due to human activities,,don't think that there isnevolution by natural selection,,and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines. 
 So why should we believe the science?,Well, scientists don't like talking about nscience as a matter of belief.,In fact, they would contrast science with faith,,and they would say belief is the domain of faith.,And faith is a separate thingnapart and distinct from science.,Indeed they would say religion is based on faith,or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager.,Blaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician,who tried to bring scientificnreasoning to the question of,whether or not he should believe in God,,and his wager went like this:,Well, if God doesn't exist,but I decide to believe in him,nothing much is really lost.,Maybe a few hours on Sunday.,(Laughter),But if he does exist and I don't believe in him,,then I'm in deep trouble.,And so Pascal said, we'd better believe in God.,Or as one of my college professors said,,"He clutched for the handrail of faith.",He made that leap of faith,leaving science and rationalism behind. 
 Now the fact is though, for most of us,,most scientific claims are a leap of faith.,We can't really judge scientificnclaims for ourselves in most cases.,And indeed this is actuallyntrue for most scientists as well,outside of their own specialties.,So if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you,whether a vaccine is safe.,Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory.,A physicist cannot tell you,,despite the claims of some of them,,whether or not tobacco causes cancer.,So, if even scientists themselves,have to make a leap of faith,outside their own fields,,then why do they accept thenclaims of other scientists?,Why do they believe each other's claims?,And should we believe those claims? 
 So what I'd like to argue is yes, we should,,but not for the reason that most of us think.,Most of us were taught in schoolnthat the reason we should,believe in science is because of the scientific method.,We were taught that scientists follow a method,and that this method guarantees,the truth of their claims.,The method that most of us were taught in school,,we can call it the textbook method,,is the hypothetical deductive method.,According to the standardnmodel, the textbook model,,scientists develop hypotheses, they deduce,the consequences of those hypotheses,,and then they go out into the world and they say,,"Okay, well are those consequences true?",Can we observe them takingnplace in the natural world?,And if they are true, then the scientists say,,"Great, we know the hypothesis is correct." 
 So there are many famous examples in the history,of science of scientists doing exactly this.,One of the most famous examples,comes from the work of Albert Einstein.,When Einstein developed thentheory of general relativity,,one of the consequences of his theory,was that space-time wasn't just an empty void,but that it actually had a fabric.,And that that fabric was bent,in the presence of massive objects like the sun.,So if this theory were true then it meant that light,as it passed the sun,should actually be bent around it.,That was a pretty startling prediction,and it took a few years before scientists,were able to test it,but they did test it in 1919,,and lo and behold it turned out to be true.,Starlight actually does bendnas it travels around the sun.,This was a huge confirmation of the theory.,It was considered proof of the truth,of this radical new idea,,and it was written up in many newspapers,around the globe. 
 Now, sometimes this theory or this model,is referred to as the deductive-nomological model,,mainly because academics like nto make things complicated.,But also because in the ideal case, it's about laws.,So nomological means having to do with laws.,And in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea:,ideally, it is a law of nature.,Why does it matter that it is a law of nature?,Because if it is a law, it can't be broken.,If it's a law then it will always be true,in all times and all places,no matter what the circumstances are.,And all of you know of at leastnone example of a famous law:,Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2,,which tells us what the relationship is,between energy and mass.,And that relationship is true no matter what. 
 Now, it turns out, though, that there nare several problems with this model.,The main problem is that it's wrong.,It's just not true. (Laughter),And I'm going to talk aboutnthree reasons why it's wrong.,So the first reason is a logical reason.,It's the problem of the fallacynof affirming the consequent.,So that's another fancy, academic way of saying,that false theories can make true predictions.,So just because the prediction comes true,doesn't actually logicallynprove that the theory is correct.,And I have a good example of that too, nagain from the history of science.,This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe,with the Earth at the center of the universe,and the sun and the planets going around it.,The Ptolemaic model was believed,by many very smart people for many centuries.,Well, why?,Well the answer is because it made nlots of predictions that came true.,The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers,to make accurate predictionsnof the motions of the planet,,in fact more accurate predictions at first,than the Copernican theorynwhich we now would say is true.,So that's one problem with the textbook model.,A second problem is a practical problem,,and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses.,Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions,that scientists are making,that they may or may not evennbe aware that they're making.,So an important example of this,comes from the Copernican model,,which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system.,So when Nicolaus Copernicus said,,actually the Earth is not the center of the universe,,the sun is the center of the solar system,,the Earth moves around the sun.,Scientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true,we ought to be able to detect the motion,of the Earth around the sun.,And so this slide here illustrates a concept,known as stellar parallax.,And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving,and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius --,well I know I'm in Manhattannso you guys can't see the stars,,but imagine you're out in the country, nimagine you chose that rural life —,and we look at a star in December, we see that star,against the backdrop of distant stars.,If we now make the same observation six months later,when the Earth has moved to this position in June,,we look at that same star and we nsee it against a different backdrop.,That difference, that angularndifference, is the stellar parallax.,So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes.,Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax,and they found nothing, nothing at all.,And many people argued that this proved nthat the Copernican model was false. 
 So what happened?,Well, in hindsight we can say nthat astronomers were making,two auxiliary hypotheses, both of which,we would now say were incorrect.,The first was an assumption nabout the size of the Earth's orbit.,Astronomers were assuming nthat the Earth's orbit was large,relative to the distance to the stars.,Today we would draw the picture more like this,,this comes from NASA,,and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small.,In fact, it's actually muchnsmaller even than shown here.,The stellar parallax therefore,,is very small and actually very hard to detect. 
 And that leads to the second reason,why the prediction didn't work,,because scientists were also assuming,that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough,to detect the parallax.,And that turned out not to be true.,It wasn't until the 19th century,that scientists were able to detect,the stellar parallax. 
 So, there's a third problem as well.,The third problem is simply a factual problem,,that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model.,A lot of science isn't deductive at all,,it's actually inductive.,And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily,start with theories and hypotheses,,often they just start with observations,of stuff going on in the world.,And the most famous examplenof that is one of the most,famous scientists who ever lived, Charles Darwin.,When Darwin went out as a young nman on the voyage of the Beagle,,he didn't have a hypothesis, he didn't have a theory.,He just knew that he wantednto have a career as a scientist,and he started to collect data.,Mainly he knew that he hated medicine,because the sight of blood made him sick so,he had to have an alternative career path.,So he started collecting data.,And he collected many things, nincluding his famous finches.,When he collected these finches,nhe threw them in a bag,and he had no idea what they meant.,Many years later back in London,,Darwin looked at his data again and began,to develop an explanation,,and that explanation was thentheory of natural selection. 
 Besides inductive science,,scientists also often participate in modeling.,One of the things scientists want to do in life,is to explain the causes of things.,And how do we do that?,Well, one way you can do it is to build a model,that tests an idea. 
 So this is a picture of Henry Cadell,,who was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century.,You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing,a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots.,(Laughter),And Cadell wanted to answer the question,,how are mountains formed?,And one of the things he had observed,is that if you look at mountainsnlike the Appalachians,,you often find that the rocks in them,are folded,,and they're folded in a particular way,,which suggested to him,that they were actually beingncompressed from the side.,And this idea would later play a major role,in discussions of continental drift.,So he built this model, this crazy contraption,with levers and wood, and here's his wheelbarrow,,buckets, a big sledgehammer.,I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots.,Maybe it's going to rain.,And he created this physical model in order,to demonstrate that you could, in fact, create,patterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud,,that looked a lot like mountains,if you compressed them from the side.,So it was an argument aboutnthe cause of mountains. 
 Nowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside,,so they don't build physical models so much,as to make computer simulations.,But a computer simulation is a kind of a model.,It's a model that's made with mathematics,,and like the physical models of the 19th century,,it's very important for thinking about causes.,So one of the big questionsnto do with climate change,,we have tremendous amounts of evidence,that the Earth is warming up.,This slide here, the black line shows,the measurements that scientists have taken,for the last 150 years,showing that the Earth's temperature,has steadily increased,,and you can see in particularnthat in the last 50 years,there's been this dramatic increase,of nearly one degree centigrade,,or almost two degrees Fahrenheit. 
 So what, though, is driving that change?,How can we know what's causing,the observed warming?,Well, scientists can model it,using a computer simulation.,So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation,that has looked at all the different factors,that we know can influence the Earth's climate,,so sulfate particles from air pollution,,volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions,,changes in solar radiation,,and, of course, greenhouse gases.,And they asked the question,,what set of variables put into a model,will reproduce what we actually see in real life?,So here is the real life in black.,Here's the model in this light gray,,and the answer is,a model that includes, it's the answer E on that SAT,,all of the above.,The only way you can reproduce,the observed temperature measurements,is with all of these things put together,,including greenhouse gases,,and in particular you can see that the increase,in greenhouse gases tracks,this very dramatic increase in temperature,over the last 50 years.,And so this is why climate scientists say,it's not just that we know thatnclimate change is happening,,we know that greenhouse gases are a major part,of the reason why. 
 So now because there all these different things,that scientists do,,the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said,,"The only principle in science,that doesn't inhibit progress is: anything goes.",Now this quotation has oftennbeen taken out of context,,because Feyerabend was not actually saying,that in science anything goes.,What he was saying was,,actually the full quotation is,,"If you press me to say,what is the method of science,,I would have to say: anything goes.",What he was trying to say,is that scientists do a lot of different things.,Scientists are creative. 
 But then this pushes the question back:,If scientists don't use a single method,,then how do they decide,what's right and what's wrong?,And who judges?,And the answer is, scientists judge,,and they judge by judging evidence.,Scientists collect evidence in many different ways,,but however they collect it,,they have to subject it to scrutiny.,And this led the sociologist Robert Merton,to focus on this question of how scientists,scrutinize data and evidence,,and he said they do it in a way he called,"organized skepticism.",And by that he meant it's organized,because they do it collectively,,they do it as a group,,and skepticism, because they do it from a position,of distrust.,That is to say, the burden of proof,is on the person with a novel claim.,And in this sense, sciencenis intrinsically conservative.,It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community,to say, "Yes, we know something, this is true.",So despite the popularity of the concept,of paradigm shifts,,what we find is that actually,,really major changes in scientific thinking,are relatively rare in the history of science. 
 So finally that brings us to one more idea:,If scientists judge evidence collectively,,this has led historians to focus on the question,of consensus,,and to say that at the end of the day,,what science is,,what scientific knowledge is,,is the consensus of the scientific experts,who through this process of organized scrutiny,,collective scrutiny,,have judged the evidence,and come to a conclusion about it,,either yea or nay. 
 So we can think of scientific knowledge,as a consensus of experts.,We can also think of science as being,a kind of a jury,,except it's a very special kind of jury.,It's not a jury of your peers,,it's a jury of geeks.,It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s,,and unlike a conventional jury,,which has only two choices,,guilty or not guilty,,the scientific jury actually has a number of choices.,Scientists can say yes, something's true.,Scientists can say no, it's false.,Or, they can say, well it might be true,but we need to work morenand collect more evidence.,Or, they can say it might be true,,but we don't know how to answer the question,and we're going to put it aside,and maybe we'll come back to it later.,That's what scientists call "intractable." 
 But this leads us to one final problem:,If science is what scientists say it is,,then isn't that just an appeal to authority?,And weren't we all taught in school,that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy?,Well, here's the paradox of modern science,,the paradox of the conclusion I think historians,and philosophers and sociologists have come to,,that actually science is the appeal to authority,,but it's not the authority of the individual,,no matter how smart that individual is,,like Plato or Socrates or Einstein.,It's the authority of the collective community.,You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd,,but a very special kind of crowd.,Science does appeal to authority,,but it's not based on any individual,,no matter how smart that individual may be.,It's based on the collective wisdom,,the collective knowledge, the collective work,,of all of the scientists who have worked,on a particular problem.,Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust,,this "show me" culture,,illustrated by this nice woman here,showing her colleagues her evidence.,Of course, these people don'tnreally look like scientists,,because they're much too happy.,(Laughter) 
 Okay, so that brings me to my final point.,Most of us get up in the morning.,Most of us trust our cars.,Well, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan,,this is a bad analogy,,but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan,get up in the morning and get in their cars,and turn on that ignition, and their cars work,,and they work incredibly well.,The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down. 
 So why is that? Why do cars work so well?,It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford,or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk.,It's because the modern automobile,is the product of more than 100 years of work,by hundreds and thousands,and tens of thousands of people.,The modern automobile is the product,of the collected work and wisdom and experience,of every man and woman who has ever worked,on a car,,and the reliability of the technology is the result,of that accumulated effort.,We benefit not just from the genius of Benz,and Ford and Musk,but from the collective intelligence and hard work,of all of the people who have worked,on the modern car.,And the same is true of science,,only science is even older.,Our basis for trust in science is actually the same,as our basis in trust in technology,,and the same as our basis for trust in anything,,namely, experience. 
 But it shouldn't be blind trust,any more than we would have blind trust in anything.,Our trust in science, like science itself,,should be based on evidence,,and that means that scientists,have to become better communicators.,They have to explain to us not just what they know,but how they know it,,and it means that we havento become better listeners. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.,I soared through the galaxy,driving a huge starship,with a crew made up of people,from all over this world,,many different races, many different cultures,,many different heritages,,all working together,,and our mission was to explore strange new worlds,,to seek out new life and new civilizations,,to boldly go where no one has gone before. 
 Well —,(Applause) —,I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan,who went to America,,boldly going to a strange new world,,seeking new opportunities.,My mother was born in Sacramento, California.,My father was a San Franciscan.,They met and married in Los Angeles,,and I was born there. 
 I was four years old,when Pearl Harbor was bombed,on December 7, 1941 by Japan,,and overnight, the world was plunged,into a world war.,America suddenly was swept up,by hysteria.,Japanese-Americans,,American citizens of Japanese ancestry,,were looked on,with suspicion and fear,and with outright hatred,simply because we happened to look like,the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.,And the hysteria grew and grew,until in February 1942,,the president of the United States,,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,,ordered all Japanese-Americans,on the West Coast of America,to be summarily rounded up,with no charges, with no trial,,with no due process.,Due process, this is a core pillar,of our justice system.,That all disappeared.,We were to be rounded up,and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps,in some of the most desolate places in America:,the blistering hot desert of Arizona,,the sultry swamps of Arkansas,,the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,,and two of the most desolate places in California. 
 On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,,and just a few weeks after my birthday,,my parents got my younger brother,,my baby sister and me,up very early one morning,,and they dressed us hurriedly.,My brother and I were in the living room,looking out the front window,,and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.,They carried bayonets on their rifles.,They stomped up the front porch,and banged on the door.,My father answered it,,and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.,My father gave my brother and me,small luggages to carry,,and we walked out and stood on the driveway,waiting for our mother to come out,,and when my mother finally came out,,she had our baby sister in one arm,,a huge duffel bag in the other,,and tears were streaming down both her cheeks.,I will never be able to forget that scene.,It is burned into my memory. 
 We were taken from our home,and loaded on to train cars,with other Japanese-American families.,There were guards stationed,at both ends of each car,,as if we were criminals.,We were taken two thirds ofnthe way across the country,,rocking on that train for four days and three nights,,to the swamps of Arkansas.,I still remember the barbed wire fence,that confined me.,I remember the tall sentry tower,with the machine guns pointed at us.,I remember the searchlight that followed me,when I made the night runs,from my barrack to the latrine.,But to five-year-old me,,I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way,for me to pee.,I was a child,,too young to understand the circumstances,of my being there. 
 Children are amazingly adaptable.,What would be grotesquely abnormal,became my normality,in the prisoner of war camps.,It became routine for me to line up three times a day,to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall.,It became normal for me to go with my father,to bathe in a mass shower.,Being in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,,became my normality. 
 When the war ended,,we were released,,and given a one-way ticket,to anywhere in the United States.,My parents decided to go back home,to Los Angeles,,but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.,We were penniless.,Everything had been taken from us,,and the hostility was intense.,Our first home was on Skid Row,in the lowest part of our city,,living with derelicts, drunkards,and crazy people,,the stench of urine all over,,on the street, in the alley,,in the hallway.,It was a horrible experience,,and for us kids, it was terrorizing.,I remember once,a drunkard came staggering down,,fell down right in front of us,,and threw up.,My baby sister said, "Mama, let's go back home,",because behind barbed wires,was for us,home. 
 My parents worked hard,to get back on their feet.,We had lost everything.,They were at the middle of their lives,and starting all over.,They worked their fingers to the bone,,and ultimately they were able,to get the capital together to buy,a three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.,And I was a teenager,,and I became very curious,about my childhood imprisonment.,I had read civics books that told me about,the ideals of American democracy.,All men are created equal,,we have an inalienable right,to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,,and I couldn't quite make that fit,with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.,I read history books,,and I couldn't find anything about it.,And so I engaged my father after dinner,in long, sometimes heated conversations.,We had many, many conversations like that,,and what I got from them,was my father's wisdom.,He was the one that suffered the most,under those conditions of imprisonment,,and yet he understood American democracy.,He told me that our democracy,is a people's democracy,,and it can be as great as the people can be,,but it is also as fallible as people are.,He told me that American democracy,is vitally dependent on good people,who cherish the ideals of our system,and actively engage in the process,of making our democracy work.,And he took me to a campaign headquarters —,the governor of Illinois wasnrunning for the presidency —,and introduced me to American electoral politics.,And he also told me about,young Japanese-Americans,during the Second World War. 
 When Pearl Harbor was bombed,,young Japanese-Americans,nlike all young Americans,,rushed to their draft board,to volunteer to fight for our country.,That act of patriotism,was answered with a slap in the face.,We were denied service,,and categorized as enemy non-alien.,It was outrageous to be called an enemy,when you're volunteering to fight for your country,,but that was compounded with the word "non-alien,",which is a word that means,"citizen" in the negative.,They even took the word "citizen" away from us,,and imprisoned them for a whole year. 
 And then the government realized,that there's a wartime manpower shortage,,and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up,,they opened up the military for service,by young Japanese-Americans.,It was totally irrational,,but the amazing thing,,the astounding thing,,is that thousands of young,Japanese-American men and women,again went from behind those barbed-wire fences,,put on the same uniform as that of our guards,,leaving their families in imprisonment,,to fight for this country. 
 They said that they were going to fight,not only to get their families out,from behind those barbed-wire fences,,but because they cherished the very ideal,of what our government stands for,,should stand for,,and that was being abrogated,by what was being done. 
 All men are created equal.,And they went to fight for this country.,They were put into a segregated,all Japanese-American unit,and sent to the battlefields of Europe,,and they threw themselves into it.,They fought with amazing,,incredible courage and valor.,They were sent out on the most dangerous missions,and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate,of any unit proportionally. 
 There is one battle that illustrates that.,It was a battle for the Gothic Line.,The Germans were embedded,in this mountain hillside,,rocky hillside,,in impregnable caves,,and three allied battalions,had been pounding away at it,for six months,,and they were stalemated.,The 442nd was called in,to add to the fight,,but the men of the 442nd,came up with a unique,but dangerous idea:,The backside of the mountain,was a sheer rock cliff.,The Germans thought an attack from the backside,would be impossible.,The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.,On a dark, moonless night,,they began scaling that rock wall,,a drop of more than 1,000 feet,,in full combat gear.,They climbed all night long,on that sheer cliff.,In the darkness,,some lost their handhold,or their footing,and they fell to their deaths,in the ravine below.,They all fell silently.,Not a single one cried out,,so as not to give their position away.,The men climbed for eight hours straight,,and those who made it to the top,stayed there until the first break of light,,and as soon as light broke,,they attacked.,The Germans were surprised,,and they took the hill,and broke the Gothic Line.,A six-month stalemate,was broken by the 442nd,in 32 minutes. 
 It was an amazing act,,and when the war ended,,the 442nd returned to the United States,as the most decorated unit,of the entire Second World War.,They were greeted back on the White House Lawn,by President Truman, who said to them,,"You fought not only the enemy,but prejudice, and you won." 
 They are my heroes.,They clung to their belief,in the shining ideals of this country,,and they proved that being an American,is not just for some people,,that race is not how we define being an American.,They expanded what it means to be an American,,including Japanese-Americans,that were feared and suspected and hated.,They were change agents,,and they left for me,a legacy.,They are my heroes,and my father is my hero,,who understood democracy,and guided me through it.,They gave me a legacy,,and with that legacy comes a responsibility,,and I am dedicated,to making my country,an even better America,,to making our government,an even truer democracy,,and because of the heroes that I have,and the struggles that we've gone through,,I can stand before you,as a gay Japanese-American,,but even more than that,,I am a proud American. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)This year, Germany is celebrating,the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution,in East Germany.,In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,,the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,,the German Democratic Republic, the GDR,,in the East was unified,with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West,to found today's Germany.,Among many other things, Germany inherited,the archives of the East German secret police,,known as the Stasi.,Only two years after its dissolution,,its documents were opened to the public,,and historians such as me started,to study these documents,to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state,functioned. 
 Perhaps you have watched the movie,"The Lives of Others.",This movie made the Stasi known worldwide,,and as we live in an age where words,such as "surveillance" or "wiretapping",are on the front pages of newspapers,,I would like to speak about how the Stasi,really worked. 
 At the beginning, let's have a short look,at the history of the Stasi,,because it's really important for understanding,its self-conception.,Its origins are located in Russia.,In 1917, the Russian Communists founded,the Emergency Commission for Combating,Counter-Revolution and Sabotage,,shortly Cheka.,It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.,The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists,to establish their regime by terrorizing the population,and executing their enemies.,It evolved later into the well-known KGB.,The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.,They called themselves Chekists,,and even the emblem was very similar,,as you can see here.,In fact, the secret police of Russia,was the creator and instructor of the Stasi.,When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,,it immediately expanded there,,and soon it started to train the German Communists,to build up their own secret police.,By the way, in this hall where we are now,,the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946. 
 Five years later, the Stasi was established,,and step by step, the dirty job of oppression,was handed over to it.,For instance, the central jail,for political prisoners,,which was established by the Russians,,was taken over by the Stasi,and used until the end of Communism.,You see it here.,At the beginning, every important step,took place under the attendance of the Russians.,But the Germans are known to be very effective,,so the Stasi grew very quickly,,and already in 1953, it had more employees,than the Gestapo had,,the secret police of Nazi Germany.,The number doubled in each decade.,In 1989, more than 90,000 employees,worked for the Stasi.,This meant that one employee,was responsible for 180 inhabitants,,which was really unique in the world. 
 At the top of this tremendous apparatus,,there was one man, Erich Mielke.,He ruled the Ministry of State Security,for more than 30 years.,He was a scrupulous functionary —,in his past, he killed two policemen,not far away from here —,who in fact personalized the Stasi. 
 But what was so exceptional about the Stasi?,Foremost, it was its enormous power,,because it united different functions,in one organization.,First of all, the Stasi,was an intelligence service.,It used all the imaginable instruments,for getting information secretly,,such as informers, or tapping phones,,as you can see it on the picture here.,And it was not only active in East Germany,,but all over the world.,Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police.,It could stop people on the street,and arrest them in its own prisons.,Thirdly, the Stasi worked,as a kind of public prosecutor.,It had the right to open preliminary investigations,and to interrogate people officially.,Last but not least,,the Stasi had its own armed forces.,More than 11,000 soldiers were serving,in its so-called Guards Regiment.,It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.,Due to this concentration of power,,the Stasi was called a state in the state. 
 But let's look in more and more detail,at the tools of the Stasi.,Please keep in mind that at that time,the web and smartphones were not yet invented.,Of course, the Stasi used all kinds,of technical instruments to survey people.,Telephones were wiretapped,,including the phone of thenGerman chancellor in the West,,and often also the apartments.,Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened,by these machines.,The Stasi also shadowedntens of thousands of people,using specially trained agents and secret cameras,to document every step one took.,In this picture, you can see me,as a young man just in front of this building,where we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.,The Stasi even collected the smell of people.,It stored samples of it in closed jars,which were found after the peaceful revolution.,For all these tasks, highly specialized departments,were responsible.,The one which was tapping phone calls,was completely separated,from the one which controlled the letters,,for good reasons,,because if one agent quit the Stasi,,his knowledge was very small.,Contrast that with Snowden, for example.,But the vertical specialization was also important,to prevent all kinds of empathy,with the object of observation.,The agent who shadowed me,didn't know who I was,or why I was surveyed.,In fact, I smuggled forbidden books,from West to East Germany. 
 But what was even more typical for the Stasi,was the use of human intelligence,,people who reported secretly to the Stasi.,For the Minister of State Security,,these so-called unofficial employees,were the most important tools.,From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people,collaborated constantly with the Stasi,,more than one percent of the population.,And in a way, the minister was right,,because technical instruments,can only register what people are doing,,but agents and spies can also report,what people are planning to do,and what they are thinking.,Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.,The system of how to get them,and how to educate them, as it was called,,was very sophisticated.,The Stasi had its own university,,not far away from here,,where the methods were explored,and taught to the officers.,This guideline gave a detailed description,of every step you have to take,if you want to convince human beings,to betray their fellow citizens.,Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured,to becoming one,,but that's mostly not true,,because a forced informant is a bad informant.,Only someone who wants to givenyou the information you need,is an effective whistleblower.,The main reasons why peoplencooperated with the Stasi,were political conviction and material benefits.,The officers also tried to create a personal bond,between themselves and the informant,,and to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows,that it's not so difficult to win someone,in order to betray others.,Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany,collaborated with the Stasi,,as for instance Ibrahim Böhme.,In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution,and he nearly became the first freelynelected Prime Minister of the GDR,until it came out that he was an informant. 
 The net of spies was really broad.,In nearly every institution,,even in the churches or in West Germany,,there were many of them.,I remember telling a leading Stasi officer,,"If you had sent an informant to me,,I would surely have recognized him.",His answer was,,"We didn't send anyone.,We took those who were around you.",And in fact, two of my best friends,reported about me to the Stasi.,Not only in my case, informers were very close.,For example, Vera Lengsfeld,nanother leading dissident,,in her case it was her husband who spied on her.,A famous writer was betrayed by his brother.,This reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell,,where the only apparently trustable person,was an informer. 
 But why did the Stasi collect all this information,in its archives?,The main purpose was to control the society.,In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister,gave the order to find out who is who,,which meant who thinks what.,He didn't want to wait until somebody,tried to act against the regime.,He wanted to know in advance,what people were thinking and planning.,The East Germans knew, of course,,that they were surrounded by informers,,in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust,and a state of widespread fear,,the most important tools to oppress people,in any dictatorship. 
 That's why not many East Germans tried,to fight against the Communist regime.,If yes, the Stasi often used a method,which was really diabolic.,It was called Zersetzung,,and it's described in another guideline.,The word is difficult to translate because it means,originally "biodegradation.",But actually, it's a quite accurate description.,The goal was to destroy secretly,the self-confidence of people,,for example by damaging their reputation,,by organizing failures in their work,,and by destroying their personal relationships.,Considering this, East Germanynwas a very modern dictatorship.,The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.,It preferred to paralyze them,,and it could do so because,it had access to so much personal information,and to so many institutions.,Detaining someone was used only,as a last resort.,For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,,one in every district.,Here, the Stasi also developed,quite modern methods of detention.,Normally, the interrogation officer,didn't torture the prisoner.,Instead, he used a sophisticated system,of psychological pressure,in which strict isolation was central.,Nearly no prisoner resisted,without giving a testimony.,If you have the occasion,,do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin,and attend a guided tournwith a former political prisoner,who will explain to you how this worked. 
 One more question needs to be answered:,If the Stasi were so well organized,,why did the Communist regime collapse?,First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany,was uncertain what to do against,the growing protest of people.,It was especially confused,because in the mother country of socialism,,the Soviet Union,,a more liberal policy took place.,In addition, the regime was dependent,on the loans from the West.,Therefore, no order to crash down the uprising,was given to the Stasi.,Secondly, in the Communist ideology,,there's no place for criticism.,Instead, the leadership stuck to the belief,that socialism is a perfect system,,and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.,The consequence was,that despite all the information,,the regime couldn't analyze its real problems,,and therefore it couldn't solve them.,In the end, the Stasi died,because of the structures,that it was charged with protecting. 
 The ending of the Stasi,was something tragic,,because these officers,were kept busy during the peaceful revolution,with only one thing:,to destroy the documents,they had produced during decades.,Fortunately,,they had been stopped by human rights activists.,That's why today we can use the files,to get a better understanding,of how a surveillance state functions. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.,So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions,because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.,"Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA.,And you just told us about my neighbor,,the spies and the informant from East Germany.,So there is a direct link between these two stories,or there isn't?,What's your reaction as anhistorian when you see this? 
 Hubertus Knabe: I think there are,several aspects to mention.,At first, I think there's a difference,of why you are collecting this data.,Are you doing that for protecting your people,against terrorist attacks,,or are you doing that for oppressing your people?,So that makes a fundamental difference.,But on the other hand,,also in a democracy, theseninstruments can be abused,,and that is something where we really have,to be aware to stop that,,and that also the intelligence services,are respecting the rules we have.,The third point, probably,,we really can be happy that we live in a democracy,,because you can be sure that Russia and China,are doing the same,,but nobody speaks about that,because nobody could do that. 
 (Applause) 
 BG: When the story came out first,,last July, last year,,you filed a criminal complaint,with a German tribunal. Why?,HK: Yeah, I did so because ofnthe second point I mentioned,,that I think especially in a democracy,,the rules are for everybody.,They are made for everybody, so it's not allowed,that any institution doesn't respect the rules.,In the criminal code of Germany, it's written,that it's not allowed to tap somebody,without the permission of the judge.,Fortunately, it's written innthe criminal code of Germany,,so if it's not respected, then I think,an investigation is necessary,,and it took a very long time that,the public prosecutor of Germany started this,,and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,,and not in the case of all thenother people living in Germany. 
 BG: That doesn't surprise me because —,(Applause) —,because of the story you told.,Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,,and I expected the Germans to react,much more strongly, immediately.,And instead, the reaction really came only,when Chancellor Merkel was revealed,as being wiretapped. Why so? 
 HK: I take it as a good sign,,because people feel secure in this democracy.,They aren't afraid that they will be arrested,,and if you leave this hall after the conference,,nobody has to be afraid that the secret police,is standing out and is arresting you.,So that's a good sign, I think.,People are not really scared, as they could be.,But of course, I think, the institutions,are responsible to stop illegal actions,in Germany or wherever they happen. 
 BG: A personal question,nand this is the last one.,There has been a debate in Germany about,granting asylum to Edward Snowden.,Would you be in favor or against? 
 HK: Oh, that's a difficult question,,but if you ask me,,and if I answer honestly,,I would give him the asylum,,because I think it was really brave what he did,,and he destroyed his whole life,and his family and everything.,So I think, for these people,nwe should do something,,and especially if you see the German history,,where so many people had to escape,and they asked for asylum in other countries,and they didn't get it,,so it would be a good sign to give him asylum. 
 (Applause) 
 BG: Hubertus, thank you very much.Hi everybody. So my name is Mac.,My job is that I lie to children,,but they're honest lies. 
 I write children's books,,and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,,"We all know that Art is not truth.,Art is a lie that makes us realize truth,or at least the truth that is ngiven us to understand.,The artist must know the manner whereby,to convince others of the ntruthfulness of his lies." 
 I first heard this when I was a kid,,and I loved it,,but I had no idea what it meant.,(Laughter) 
 So I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here,to talk to you today about, though,,truth and lies, fiction and reality.,So how could I untangle,this knotted bunch of sentences?,And I said, I've got PowerPoint.nLet's do a Venn diagram.,["Truth. Lies."]n(Laughter),So there it is, right there, boom.,We've got truth and lies,and then there's this little space,,the edge, in the middle.,That liminal space, that's art.,All right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause) 
 But that's actually not very helpful either.,The thing that made me understand,that quote and really kind of what art,,at least the art of fiction, was,,was working with kids.,I used to be a summer camp counselor.,I would do it on my summers off from college,,and I loved it.,It was a sports summer camp,for four- to six-year-olds.,I was in charge of the four-year-olds,,which is good, because,four-year-olds can't play nsports, and neither can I.,(Laughter),I play sports at a four-year-old level,,so what would happen is the kids would,dribble around some cones, and then got hot,,and then they would go sit underneath the tree,where I was already sitting — (Laughter) —,and I would just make up stories and tell them to them,and I would tell them stories about my life.,I would tell them about how, on the weekends,,I would go home and I wouldnspy for the Queen of England.,And soon, other kids,who weren't even in my group of kids,,they would come up to me, and they would say,,"You're Mac Barnett, right?,You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England.",And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers,to come up and ask me that question.,In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,,but, you know, four-year-olds —,you take what you can get in Berkeley, California. 
 And I realized that the stories that I was telling,were real in this way that was familiar to me,and really exciting.,I think the pinnacle of this for nme — I'll never forget this —,there was this little girl nnamed Riley. She was tiny,,and she used to always take nout her lunch every day,and she would throw out her fruit.,She would just take her fruit,,her mom packed her a melon every day,,and she would just throw it in the ivy,and then she would eat fruit snacks,and pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley,,you can't do that, you nhave to eat the fruit.",And she was like, "Why?",And I was like, "Well, whennyou throw the fruit in the ivy,,pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,",which is why I think I ended up,telling stories to children and notnbeing a nutritionist for children.,And so Riley was like, "That will never happen.,That's not going to happen.",And so, on the last day of camp,,I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe,from the grocery store,and I hid it in the ivy,,and then at lunchtime, I was like,,"Riley, why don't you go overnthere and see what you've done.",And — (Laughter) —,she went trudging through nthe ivy, and then her eyes,just got so wide, and she pointed out this melon,that was bigger than her head,,and then all the kids ran over nthere and rushed around her,,and one of the kids was like, "Hey,,why is there a sticker on this?",(Laughter),And I was like, "That is also why I say,do not throw your stickers in the ivy.,Put them in the trash can. Itnruins nature when you do this.",And Riley carried that melon around with her all day,,and she was so proud. 
 And Riley knew she didn't ngrow a melon in seven days,,but she also knew that she did,,and it's a weird place,,but it's not just a place that kids can get to.,It's anything. Art can get us to that place.,She was right in that place in the middle,,that place which you could call art or fiction.,I'm going to call it wonder.,It's what Coleridge called thenwilling suspension of disbelief,or poetic faith,,for those moments where anstory, no matter how strange,,has some semblance of the truth,,and then you're able to believe it.,It's not just kids who can get there.,Adults can too, and we get there when we read.,It's why in two days, people will be,descending on Dublin to take the walking tour,of Bloomsday and see everythingnthat happened in "Ulysses,",even though none of that happened.,Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street,to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,,even though 221B is just a number that was painted,on a building that never nactually had that address.,We know these characters aren't real,,but we have real feelings about them,,and we're able to do that.,We know these characters aren't real,,and yet we also know that they are. 
 Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,,and that's why I love writing for kids.,I think kids are the best audience,for serious literary fiction.,When I was a kid,,I was obsessed with secret door novels,,things like "Narnia,",where you would open a wardrobenand go through to a magical land.,And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist,and I would look for them and try to go through them.,I wanted to live and cross over into nthat fictional world, which is —,I would always just open people's closet doors. n(Laughter),I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet,,and there was not a secret magical land there.,There was some other weird stuff thatnI think my mom should know about.,(Laughter),And I was happy to tell her all about it. 
 After college, my first job was working,behind one of these secret doors.,This is a place called 826 Valencia.,It's at 826 Valencia Street,in the Mission in San Francisco,,and when I worked there, therenwas a publishing company,headquartered there called McSweeney's,,a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,,but then the front of it,was a strange shop.,You see, this place was zoned retail,,and in San Francisco, they werennot going to give us a variance,,and so the writer who foundednit, a writer named Dave Eggers,,to come into compliance nwith code, he said, "Fine,,I'm just going to build a pirate supply store.",And that's what he did. (Laughter),And it's beautiful. It's all wood.,There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus,so you don't get scurvy.,They have eyepatches in lots of colors,,because when it's springtime, pirates want to go wild.,You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel.,Or eyes, also in lots of colors,,just glass eyes, depending on how you want,to deal with that situation.,And the store, strangely,,people came to them and bought things,,and they ended up paying the rent,for our tutoring center, which was behind it,,but to me, more important was the fact,that I think the quality of work you do,,kids would come and get instruction in writing,,and when you have to walk this weird, liminal,nfictional space like this to go do your writing,,it's going to affect the kind of work that you make.,It's a secret door that you can walk through. 
 So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,,and it was my job to build the store down there.,So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.,That's our motto: "Whenevernyou are, we're already then.",(Laughter),And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.,Our friendly staff is ready to help you.,They're from all eras,,including just the 1980s, that guy on the end,,he's from the very recent past.,There's our Employees of the Month,,including Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.,Some great people have come up through our ranks.,This is our kind of pharmacy section.,We have some patent medicines,,Canopic jars for your organs,,communist soap that says,,"This is your soap for the year."n(Laughter),Our slushy machine broke,on the opening night and nwe didn't know what to do.,Our architect was covered in red syrup.,It looked like he had just murdered somebody,,which it was not out of the question,for this particular architect,,and we didn't know what to do.,It was going to be the highlight of our store.,So we just put that sign on it that said,,"Out of order. Come back yesterday."n(Laughter),And that ended up being a better joke than slushies,,so we just left it there forever.,Mammoth Chunks. These thingsnweigh, like, seven pounds each.,Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad,and potpourri — things that barbarians hate.,Dead languages.,(Laughter),Leeches, nature's tiny doctors.,And Viking Odorant, whichncomes in lots of great scents:,toenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.,Because we believe that Axe Body Spray,is something that you shouldnonly find on the battlefield,,not under your arms.n(Laughter),And these are robot emotion chips,,so robots can feel love or fear.,Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude,,which we did not expect.,(Laughter),We did not think that was going to happen.,But there's a nonprofit behind it,,and kids go through a doornthat says "Employees Only",and they end up in this space,where they do homework and write stories,and make films and this is a book release party,where kids will read.,There's a quarterly that's published,with just writing that's done by the kids,who come every day after school,,and we have release parties,and they eat cake and read for their parents,and drink milk out of champagne glasses.,And it's a very special space,,because it's this weird space in the front.,The joke isn't a joke.,You can't find the seams on the fiction,,and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction,that's colonized the real world.,I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions. 
 There's a term called metafiction,,and that's just stories about stories,,and meta's having a moment now.,Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s,with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,,but it's been around.,It's almost as old as storytelling itself.,And one metafictive technique,is breaking the fourth wall. Right?,It's when an actor will turn to the audience,and say, "I am an actor,,these are just rafters.",And even that supposedly honest moment,,I would argue, is in service of the lie,,but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality,of the fiction.,For me, I kind of prefer the opposite.,If I'm going to break down the fourth wall,,I want fiction to escape,and come into the real world.,I want a book to be a secret door that opens,and lets the stories out into reality. 
 And so I try to do this in my books.,And here's just one example.,This is the first book that I ever made.,It's called "Billy Twittersnand his Blue Whale Problem.",And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet,but it's a punishment,and it ruins his life.,So it's delivered overnight by FedUp.,(Laughter),And he has to take it to school with him.,He lives in San Francisco —,very tough city to own a blue whale in.,A lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.,This market's crazy, everybody.,But underneath the jacket is this case,,and that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,,and there's an ad,that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial,for a blue whale.,And you can just send in anself-addressed stamped envelope,and we'll send you a whale.,And kids do write in. 
 So here's a letter. It says, "Dear people,,I bet you 10 bucks you won't send me a blue whale.,Eliot Gannon (age 6).",(Laughter) (Applause) 
 So what Eliot and the other kids,who send these in get back,is a letter in very small printnfrom a Norwegian law firm —,(Laughter) —,that says that due to a change in customs laws,,their whale has been held up in Sognefjord,,which is a very lovely fjord,,and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord,and Norwegian food for na little while. It digresses.,(Laughter),But it finishes off by saying that,your whale would love to hear from you.,He's got a phone number,,and you can call and leave him a message.,And when you call and leave him a message,,you just, on the outgoing message,,it's just whale sounds and then a beep,,which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.,And they get a picture of their whale too.,So this is Randolph,,and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico,who was one of the first kids to ever call in,,and I'll play you some of Nico's message.,This is the first message I ever got from Nico. 
 (Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.,I am your owner, Randolph. Hello.,So this is the first time I can ever talk to you,,and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye. 
 Mac Barnett: So Nico called back, like, an hour later.,(Laughter),And here's another one of Nico's messages. 
 (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico.,I haven't talked to you for a long time,,but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday,,yeah, Saturday or Sunday,,so now I'm calling you again,to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now,,and I'm going to probably call you again,tomorrow or today,,so I'll talk to you later. Bye. 
 MB: So he did, he called back that day again.,He's left over 25 messages for Randolph,over four years.,You find out all about him,and the grandma that he loves,and the grandma that nhe likes a little bit less —,(Laughter) —,and the crossword puzzles that he does,,and this is — I'll play you one nmore message from Nico.,This is the Christmas message from Nico. 
 [Beep] (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph,,sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time.,It's just that I've been so busy,because school started,,as you might not know, probably,,since you're a whale, you don't know,,and I'm calling you to just say,,to wish you a merry Christmas.,So have a nice Christmas,,and bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.,MB: I actually got Nico,,I hadn't heard from in 18 months,,and he just left a message two days ago.,His voice is completely different,,but he put his babysitter on the phone,,and she was very nice to Randolph as well. 
 But Nico's the best reader I could hope for.,I would want anyone I was writing for,to be in that place emotionally,with the things that I create.,I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers,,and they deserve the best stories we can give them. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you,three multiple choice questions.,Use this device. Use this device to answer.,The first question is, how did the number,of deaths per year,from natural disaster,,how did that change during the last century?,Did it more than double,,did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,,or did it decrease to less than half?,Please answer A, B or C.,I see lots of answers. This is muchnfaster than I do it at universities.,They are so slow. They keepnthinking, thinking, thinking.,Oh, very, very good. 
 And we go to the next question.,So how long did women 30 years old,in the world go to school:,seven years, five years or three years?,A, B or C? Please answer. 
 And we go to the next question.,In the last 20 years, how did the percentage,of people in the world,who live in extreme poverty change?,Extreme poverty — not having nenough food for the day.,Did it almost double,,did it remain more or less the same,,or did it halve?,A, B or C? 
 Now, answers.,You see,,deaths from natural disasters in the world,,you can see it from this graph here,,from 1900 to 2000.,In 1900, there was about half a million people,who died every year from natural disasters:,floods, earthquakes, volcanic neruption, whatever, droughts.,And then, how did that change? 
 Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.,This is how they answered.,The Swedish public answered like this:,Fifty percent thought it had doubled,,38 percent said it's more or less the same,,12 said it had halved.,This is the best data from the disaster researchers,,and it goes up and down,,and it goes to the Second World War,,and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling,and it's down to much less than half.,The world has been much, much more capable,as the decades go by,to protect people from this, you know.,So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this. 
 So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.,(Laughter) (Applause),The chimps don't watch the evening news,,so the chimps,,they choose by random, so thenSwedes answer worse than random.,Now how did you do?,That's you.,You were beaten by the chimps.,(Laughter),But it was close.,You were three times better than the Swedes,,but that's not enough.,You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.,You must have higher ambitions in the world. 
 Let's look at the next answer here: women in school.,Here, you can see men went eight years.,How long did women go to school?,Well, we asked the Swedes like this,,and that gives you a hint, doesn't it?,The right answer is probably the one,the fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?,(Laughter),Let's see, let's see. Here we come.,Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.,This is the U.S. public.,And this is you. Here you come.,Ooh.,Well, congratulations, you'rentwice as good as the Swedes,,but you don't need me — 
 So how come? I think it's like this,,that everyone is aware that there are countries,and there are areas,where girls have great difficulties.,They are stopped when they go to school,,and it's disgusting.,But in the majority of the world,,where most people in the world live,,most countries, girls today go to school,as long as boys, more or less.,That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,,not at all.,They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,,but schooling is there in the world today.,Now, we miss the majority.,When you answer, you answernaccording to the worst places,,and there you are right, but you miss the majority. 
 What about poverty?,Well, it's very clear that poverty here,was almost halved,,and in U.S., when we asked the public,,only five percent got it right.,And you?,Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.,(Laughter) (Applause),That little, just a few of you!,There must be preconceived ideas, you know.,And many in the rich countries,,they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.,Of course they think so,,because they don't even know what has happened.,The first thing to think about the future,is to know about the present. 
 These questions were a few of the first ones,in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project,in Gapminder Foundation that we run,,and it was started, this project, last year,by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter),He's cofounder and director,,and he wanted, Ola told me,we have to be more systematic,when we fight devastating ignorance.,So already the pilots reveal this,,that so many in the public score worse than random,,so we have to think about preconceived ideas,,and one of the main preconceived ideas,is about world income distribution. 
 Look here. This is how it was in 1975.,It's the number of people on each income,,from one dollar a day —,(Applause),See, there was one hump here,,around one dollar a day,,and then there was one hump here,somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.,The world was two groups.,It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,,the poor ones and the rich ones,,and there were fewer in between. 
 But look how this has changed:,As I go forward, what has changed,,the world population has grown,,and the humps start to merge.,The lower humps merged with the upper hump,,and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world,with one hump only.,The percent in poverty has decreased.,Still it's appalling,that so many remain in extreme poverty.,We still have this group, almost a billion, over there,,but that can be ended now. 
 The challenge we have now,is to get away from that,nunderstand where the majority is,,and that is very clearly shown in this question.,We asked, what is the percentage of the world's,one-year-old children who have got those,basic vaccines against measles and other things,that we have had for many years:,20, 50 or 80 percent?,Now, this is what the U.S.npublic and the Swedish answered.,Look at the Swedish result:,you know what the right answer is.,(Laughter),Who the heck is a professor ofnglobal health in that country?,Well, it's me. It's me.,(Laughter),It's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.,(Applause) 
 However, Ola's approach,to really measure what we know made headlines,,and CNN published these results on their web,and they had the questions there, millions answered,,and I think there were about 2,000 comments,,and this was one of the comments.,"I bet no member of the medianpassed the test," he said. 
 So Ola told me, "Take these devices.,You are invited to media conferences.,Give it to them and measure what the media know.",And ladies and gentlemen,,for the first time, the informal results,from a conference with U.S. media.,And then, lately, from the European Union media.,(Laughter),You see, the problem is not that people,don't read and listen to the media.,The problem is that thenmedia doesn't know themselves. 
 What shall we do about this, Ola?,Do we have any ideas?,(Applause) 
 Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,,I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.,Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you,by showing why it was not your fault, actually.,Then, I will equip you with some tricks,for beating the chimps in the future.,That's basically what I will do. 
 But first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,,and it all starts in this place.,It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.,It's a neighborhood where I grew up,,and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.,Actually, it has exactly the same problem,which existed in all the neighborhoods,where you grew up as well.,It was not representative. Okay?,It gave me a very biased view,of how life is on this planet.,So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.,We have a personal bias. 
 We have all different experiences,from communities and people we meet,,and on top of this, we start school,,and we add the next problem.,Well, I like schools,,but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,,because they learned somethingnwhen they went to school,,and now they describe this world to the students,without any bad intentions,,and those books, of course, that are printed,are outdated in a world that changes.,And there is really no practice,to keep the teaching material up to date.,So that's what we are focusing on.,So we have these outdated facts,added on top of our personal bias. 
 What happens next is news, okay?,An excellent journalist knows how to pick,the story that will make headlines,,and people will read it because it's sensational.,Unusual events are more interesting, no?,And they are exaggerated,,and especially things we're afraid of.,A shark attack on a Swedish person,will get headlines for weeks in Sweden. 
 So these three skewed sources of information,were really hard to get away from.,They kind of bombard us,and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,,and on top of it we put the very thing,that makes us humans, our human intuition.,It was good in evolution.,It helped us generalize,and jump to conclusions very, very fast.,It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,,and we seek causality where there is none,,and we then get an illusion of confidence,where we believe that we are the best car drivers,,above the average.,Everybody answered that question,,"Yeah, I drive cars better." 
 Okay, this was good evolutionarily,,but now when it comes to the worldview,,it is the exact reason why it's upside down.,The trends that are increasing are instead falling,,and the other way around,,and in this case, the chimpsnuse our intuition against us,,and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.,It was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it? 
 So how do we solve such problems?,First, we need to measure it,,and then we need to cure it.,So by measuring it we can understand,what is the pattern of ignorance.,We started the pilot last year,,and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter,a lot of ignorance across the whole world,,and the idea is really to,scale it up to all domains,or dimensions of global development,,such as climate, endangered species, human rights,,gender equality, energy, finance.,All different sectors have facts,,and there are organizations trying to spread,awareness about these facts.,So I've started actually contacting some of them,,like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,,and asking them, what are your favorite facts,which you think the public doesn't know? 
 Okay, I gather those facts.,Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.,And then we poll the public,and see where they score worst.,So we get a shorter list,with the terrible results,,like some few examples from Hans,,and we have no problem finding these kinds,of terrible results.,Okay, this little shortlist, whatnare we going to do with it?,Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,,a global knowledge certificate,,which you can use, if you're a large organization,,a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,,to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.,Basically meaning, we don't hire people,who score like chimpanzees.,Of course you shouldn't.,So maybe 10 years from now,,if this project succeeds,,you will be sitting in an interview,having to fill out this crazy global knowledge. 
 So now we come to the practical tricks.,How are you going to succeed?,There is, of course, one way,,which is to sit down late nights,and learn all the facts by heart,by reading all these reports.,That will never happen, actually.,Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.,People don't have that time.,People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.,We need to turn our intuition into strength again.,We need to be able to generalize.,So now I'm going to show you some tricks,where the misconceptions are turned around,into rules of thumb. 
 Let's start with the first misconception.,This is very widespread.,Everything is getting worse.,You heard it. You thought it yourself.,The other way to think is, most things improve.,So you're sitting with a question in front of you,and you're unsure. You should guess "improve.",Okay? Don't go for the worse.,That will help you score better on our tests.,(Applause),That was the first one. 
 There are rich and poor,and the gap is increasing.,It's a terrible inequality.,Yeah, it's an unequal world,,but when you look at the data, it's one hump.,Okay? If you feel unsure,,go for "the most people are in the middle.",That's going to help you get the answer right. 
 Now, the next preconceived idea is,first countries and people need to be very, very rich,to get the social development,like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.,No, no, no. That's wrong.,Look: that huge hump in the middle,already have girls in school.,So if you are unsure, go for the,"the majority already have this,",like electricity and girls innschool, these kinds of things.,They're only rules of thumb,,so of course they don't apply to everything,,but this is how you can generalize. 
 Let's look at the last one.,If something, yes, this is a good one,,sharks are dangerous.,No — well, yes, but they are not so important,in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.,I actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.,So as soon as I see a questionnabout things I'm afraid of,,which might be earthquakes, other religions,,maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,,anything that makes me feel,,assume you're going to exaggerate the problem.,That's a rule of thumb.,Of course there are dangerous nthings that are also great.,Sharks kill very, very few.nThat's how you should think. 
 With these four rules of thumb,,you could probably answer better than the chimps,,because the chimps cannot do this.,They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.,And hopefully we can turn your world around,and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?,(Applause),That's a systematic approach. 
 Now the question, is this important?,Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,,extreme poverty and how to fight it,,and how to bring girls in school.,When we realize that actually it'snsucceeding, we can understand it.,But is it important for everyone else,who cares about the rich end of this scale?,I would say yes, extremely important,,for the same reason.,If you have a fact-based worldview of today,,you might have a chance to understand,what's coming next in the future. 
 We're going back to these two humps in 1975.,That's when I was born,,and I selected the West.,That's the current EU countries and North America.,Let's now see how the rest and the West compares,in terms of how rich you are.,These are the people who can afford,to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.,In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived,outside EU and North America.,But this has changed, okay?,So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.,Today it's 50/50.,The Western domination is over, as of today.,That's nice. So what's going to happen next?,Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?,I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF,nInternational Monetary Fund, website.,They have a forecast for the next nfive years of GDP per capita.,So I can use that to go five years into the future,,assuming the income inequality nof each country is the same.,I did that, but I went even further.,I used those five years for the next 20 years,with the same speed, just as an nexperiment what might actually happen.,Let's move into the future.,In 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.,In 2025, 63 percent.,2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is noutnumbered in the rich consumer market.,These are just projections of nGDP per capita into the future.,Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers,are going to live outside North America and Europe.,So yes, I think it's a good idea for na company to use this certificate,to make sure to make fact-nbased decisions in the future. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Hans and Ola Rosling!I'd like to introduce you to an organism:,a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.,It's a mold with an identityncrisis, because it's not a mold,,so let's get that straight to start with.,It is one of 700 known slime molds,belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.,It is a single-celled organism, a cell,,that joins together with other cells,to form a mass super-cell,to maximize its resources.,So within a slime mold you might find thousands,or millions of nuclei,,all sharing a cell wall,,all operating as one entity.,In its natural habitat,,you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,,eating rotting vegetation,,but you might equally find it,in research laboratories,,classrooms, and even artists' studios. 
 I first came across the slimenmold about five years ago.,A microbiologist friend of mine,gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it,and told me to go home and play with it.,The only instructions I was given,,that it likes it dark and damp,and its favorite food is porridge oats.,I'm an artist who's worked for many years,with biology, with scientific processes,,so living material is not uncommon for me.,I've worked with plants, bacteria,,cuttlefish, fruit flies.,So I was keen to get my new collaborator home,to see what it could do.,So I took it home and I watched.,I fed it a varied diet.,I observed as it networked.,It formed a connection between food sources.,I watched it leave a trail behind it,,indicating where it had been.,And I noticed that when it wasnfed up with one petri dish,,it would escape and find a better home. 
 I captured my observations,through time-lapse photography.,Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,,so it's not really ideal for live viewing,unless there's some form ofnreally extreme meditation,,but through the time lapse,,I could observe some really interesting behaviors.,For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,,the slime mold goes off to explore new territories,in different directions simultaneously.,When it meets itself,,it knows it's already there,,it recognizes it's there,,and instead retreats back,and grows in other directions.,I was quite impressed by this feat,,at how what was essentiallynjust a bag of cellular slime,could somehow map its territory,,know itself, and move with seeming intention. 
 I found countless scientific studies,,research papers, journal articles,,all citing incredible work with this one organism,,and I'm going to share a few of those with you.,For example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan,filled a maze with slime mold.,It joined together and formed a mass cell.,They introduced food at two points,,oats of course,,and it formed a connection,between the food.,It retracted from empty areas and dead ends.,There are four possible routes through this maze,,yet time and time again,,the slime mold established the shortest,and the most efficient route.,Quite clever.,The conclusion from their experiment,was that the slime mold hadna primitive form of intelligence.,Another study exposed cold air atnregular intervals to the slime mold.,It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.,It doesn't like it dry.,They did this at repeat intervals,,and each time, the slime mold,slowed down its growth in response.,However, at the next interval,,the researchers didn't put the cold air on,,yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation,of it happening.,It somehow knew that it was about the time,for the cold air that it didn't like.,The conclusion from their experiment,was that the slime mold was able to learn.,A third experiment:,the slime mold was invited,to explore a territory covered in oats.,It fans out in a branching pattern.,As it goes, each food node it finds,,it forms a network, a connection to,,and keeps foraging.,After 26 hours, it established,quite a firm network,between the different oats.,Now there's nothing remarkable in this,until you learn that the center oat that it started from,represents the city of Tokyo,,and the surrounding oats arensuburban railway stations.,The slime mold had replicated,the Tokyo transport network,— (Laughter) —,a complex system developed over time,by community dwellings, civilnengineering, urban planning.,What had taken us well over 100 years,took the slime mold just over a day.,The conclusion from their experiment,was that the slime mold can form efficient networks,and solve the traveling salesman problem. 
 It is a biological computer.,As such, it has been mathematically modeled,,algorithmically analyzed.,It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.,World over, teams of researchers,are decoding its biological principles,to understand its computational rules,and applying that learningnto the fields of electronics,,programming and robotics. 
 So the question is,,how does this thing work?,It doesn't have a central nervous system.,It doesn't have a brain,,yet it can perform behaviors,that we associate with brain function.,It can learn, it can remember,,it can solve problems, it can make decisions.,So where does that intelligence lie?,So this is a microscopy, a video I shot,,and it's about 100 times magnification,,sped up about 20 times,,and inside the slime mold,,there is a rhythmic pulsing flow,,a vein-like structure carrying,cellular material, nutrients and chemical information,through the cell,,streaming first in one directionnand then back in another.,And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation,within the cell that allows it to form,quite a complex understanding of its environment,,but without any large-scale control center.,This is where its intelligence lies. 
 So it's not just academic researchers,in universities that are interested in this organism.,A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,,the Slime Mould Collective.,It's an online, open, democratic network,for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts,to share knowledge and experimentation,across disciplinary divides,and across academic divides.,The Slime Mould Collectivenmembership is self-selecting.,People have found the collective,as the slime mold finds the oats.,And it comprises of scientists,and computer scientists and researchers,but also artists like me,,architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.,It's a very interesting, eclectic membership.,Just a few examples:,an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;,a collaborative team,who are combining biological and electronic design,with 3D printing technologies in a workshop;,another artist who is using the slime mold,as a way of engaging a community,to map their area.,Here, the slime mold is being used directly,as a biological tool, but metaphorically,as a symbol for ways of talking,about social cohesion, communication,and cooperation.,Other public engagement activities,,I run lots of slime mold workshops,,a creative way of engaging with the organism.,So people are invited to come and learn,about what amazing things it can do,,and they design their own petri dish experiment,,an environment for the slime mold to navigate,so they can test its properties.,Everybody takes home a new pet,and is invited to post their results,on the Slime Mould Collective.,And the collective has enabled me,to form collaborations,with a whole array of interesting people.,I've been working with filmmakers,on a feature-length slime mold documentary,,and I stress feature-length,,which is in the final stages of edit,and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.,(Laughter) 
 It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is,the world's first human slime mold experiment.,This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.,We invited people to becomenslime mold for half an hour.,So we essentially tied people together,so they were a giant cell,,and invited them to follow slime mold rules.,You have to communicate through oscillations,,no speaking.,You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,,no egos,,and the motivation for moving,and then exploring the environment,is in search of food.,So a chaotic shuffle ensuednas this bunch of strangers,tied together with yellow ropesnwearing "Being Slime Mold" t-shirts,wandered through the museum park.,When they met trees, they had to reshape,their connections and reform as a mass cell,through not speaking.,This is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.,This isn't hypothesis-driven.,We're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.,But what it did provide us was a way,of engaging a broad section of the public,with ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,,and provide a playful platform,for discussions about,the things that ensued.,One of the most exciting things,about this experiment,was the conversation that happened afterwards.,An entirely spontaneous symposiumnhappened in the park.,People talked about the human psychology,,of how difficult it was to let go,of their individual personalities and egos.,Other people talked about bacterial communication.,Each person brought in their own,individual interpretation,,and our conclusion from this experiment was that,the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative,,especially when given beer.,We didn't just give them oats.,We gave them beer as well. 
 But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold,,and the slime mold, for me,,is a fascinating subject matter.,It's biologically fascinating,,it's computationally interesting,,but it's also a symbol,,a way of engaging with ideas of community,,collective behavior, cooperation.,A lot of my work draws on the scientific research,,so this pays homage to the maze experiment,but in a different way.,And the slime mold is also my working material.,It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,,participatory events.,Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose,to work with me, exactly,,it is a collaboration of sorts.,I can predict certain behaviors,by understanding how it operates,,but I can't control it.,The slime mold has the final say,in the creative process.,And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.,These branching patterns that we see,we see across all forms, scales of nature,,from river deltas to lightning strikes,,from our own blood vessels to neural networks.,There's clearly significant rules at play,in this simple yet complex organism,,and no matter what our disciplinarynperspective or our mode of inquiry,,there's a great deal that we can learn,from observing and engaging,with this beautiful, brainless blob. 
 I give you Physarum polycephalum. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So this is Anna Hazare,,and Anna Hazare may well benthe most cutting-edge,digital activist in the world today.,And you wouldn't know it by looking at him.,Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian nanticorruption and social justice activist.,And in 2011, he was running a big campaign,to address everyday corruption in India,,a topic that Indian elites love to ignore.,So as part of this campaign,,he was using all of the traditional tactics,that a good Gandhian organizer would use.,So he was on a hunger strike,,and Hazare realized through his hunger,that actually maybe this time,,in the 21st century,,a hunger strike wouldn't be enough. 
 So he started playing around nwith mobile activism.,So the first thing he did nis he said to people,,"Okay, why don't you send me,a text message if you support,my campaign against corruption?",So he does this, he ngives people a short code,,and about 80,000 people do it.,Okay, that's pretty respectable.,But then he decides,,"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit.",He says, "Why don't you leavenme a missed call?",Now, for those of you who havenlived in the global South,,you'll know that missed calls,are a really critical partnof global mobile culture.,I see people nodding.,People leave missed calls all the time:,If you're running late for a meeting,and you just want to let themnknow that you're on the way,,you leave them a missed call.,If you're dating someone and nyou just want to say "I miss you",you leave them a missed call.,So a note for a dating tip here,,in some cultures,,if you want to please your lover,,you call them and hang up.n(Laughter),So why do people leave missed calls?,Well, the reason of course is that,they're trying to avoid charges,associated with making callsnand sending texts. 
 So when Hazare asked people nto leave him a missed call,,let's have a little guess how nmany people actually did this?,Thirty-five million.,So this is one of the largest coordinatednactions in human history.,It's remarkable.,And this reflects the extraordinary strength nof the emerging Indian middle class,and the power that theirnmobile phones bring.,But he used that,,Hazare ended up with this massive nCSV file of mobile phone numbers,,and he used that to deploy,real people power on the ground,to get hundreds of thousands ofnpeople out on the streets in Delhi,to make a national point of neveryday corruption in India.,It's a really striking story. 
 So this is me when I was 12 years old.,I hope you see the resemblance.,And I was also an activist,,and I have been an activist all my life.,I had this really funny childhood,where I traipsed around the world,meeting world leaders and nNoble prize winners,,talking about Third World debt,,as it was then called,,and demilitarization.,I was a very, very serious child.n(Laughter),And back then,,in the early '90s,,I had a very cutting-edgentech tool of my own:,the fax.,And the fax was the ntool of my activism.,And at that time, it was the best way,to get a message to a lot of people,all at once.,I'll give you one example of a faxncampaign that I ran.,It was the eve of the Gulf War,and I organized a global campaign nto flood the hotel,,the Intercontinental in Geneva,,where James Baker and Tariq Aziz,were meeting on the eve of the war,,and I thought if I could nflood them with faxes,,we'll stop the war. 
 Well, unsurprisingly,,that campaign was wholly unsuccessful.,There are lots of reasons for that,,but there's no doubt that none sputtering fax machine,in Geneva was a little bitnof a bandwidth constraint,in terms of the ability to nget a message to lots of people.,And so, I went on to ndiscover some better tools.,I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the nInternet to mobilize people,and now has almost n40 million members,,and I now run Purpose, which nis a home for these kinds of,technology-powered movements.,So what's the moral of this story?,Is the moral of this story,,you know what, the fax is kind ofneclipsed by the mobile phone?,This is another story of ntech-determinism?,Well, I would argue that there's nactually more to it than that.,I'd argue that in the last 20 years,,something more fundamental has changed,than just new tech.,I would argue that there hasnbeen a fundamental shift,in the balance of power,in the world. 
 You ask any activist how nto understand the world,,and they'll say,n"Look at where the power is,,who has it, how it's shifting.",And I think we all sense that nsomething big is happening. 
 So Henry Timms and I —,Henry's a fellow movement builder —,got talking one day and nwe started to think,,how can we make sense of this new world?,How can we describe it and give,it a framework that makes it more useful?,Because we realized that many,of the lessons that we werendiscovering in movements,actually applied all over the world,in many sectors of our society.,So I want to introduce you tonthis framework:,Old power, meet new power.,And I want to talk to you aboutnwhat new power is today.,New power is the deployment,of mass participation nand peer coordination —,these are the two key elements —,to create change and shift outcomes.,And we see new power all around us. 
 This is Beppe Grillo,he was a populist Italian blogger,who, with a minimal political apparatusnand only some online tools,,won more than 25 percent of the vote,in recent Italian elections.,This is Airbnb,,which in just a few years,has radically disrupted the hotel industry,without owning a singlensquare foot of real estate.,This is Kickstarter,,which we know has raised over a billion dollars,from more than five million people.,Now, we're familiar with all of these models.,But what's striking is the commonalities,,the structural features of nthese new models,and how they differ from old power. 
 Let's look a little bit at this.,Old power is held like a currency.,New power works like a current.,Old power is held by a few.,New power isn't held by a few,nit's made by many.,Old power is all about download,,and new power uploads.,And you see a whole set of ncharacteristics that you can trace,,whether it's in media or npolitics or education. 
 So we've talked a little bit nabout what new power is.,Let's, for a second, talk about nwhat new power isn't.,New power is not your Facebook page.,I assure you that having a nsocial media strategy,can enable you to do just as much download,as you used to do when you had the radio.,Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,,I assure you that his Facebook page,has not embraced the powernof participation.,New power is not inherently positive.,In fact, this isn't an normativenargument that we're making,,there are many good things nabout new power,,but it can produce bad outcomes.,More participation, more peer coordination,,sometimes distorts outcomes,and there are some things,,like things, for example, nin the medical profession,that we want new power nto get nowhere near.,And thirdly, new power is notnthe inevitable victor.,In fact, unsurprisingly,,as many of these new powernmodels get to scale,,what you see is this massive pushback,from the forces of old power.,Just look at this really ninteresting epic struggle,going on right now between nEdward Snowden and the NSA.,You'll note that only one of nthe two people on this slide,is currently in exile.,And so, it's not at all clear,that new power will be nthe inevitable victor. 
 That said, keep one thing in mind:,We're at the beginning of anvery steep curve.,So you think about some of nthese new power models, right?,These were just like someone's,garage idea a few years ago,,and now they're disrupting nentire industries.,And so, what's interestingnabout new power,,is the way it feedsnon itself.,Once you have an experience of new power,,you tend to expect and nwant more of it.,So let's say you've used anpeer-to-peer lending platform,like Lending Tree or Prosper,,then you've figured out thatnyou don't need the bank,,and who wants the bank, right?,And so, that experience tends nto embolden you,it tends to make you wantnmore participation,across more aspects of your life.,And what this gives rise to is,a set of values.,We talked about the models,that new power has engendered —,the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.,What about the values?,And this is an early sketch,at what new power values look like. 
 New power values prizentransparency above all else.,It's almost a religious nbelief in transparency,,a belief that if you shine na light on something,,it will be better.,And remember that in the 20th ncentury, this was not at all true.,People thought that gentlemennshould sit behind closed doors,and make comfortable agreements.,New power values of informal,nnetworked governance.,New power folks would never nhave invented the U.N. today,,for better or worse.,New power values participation,,and new power is all about do-it-yourself.,In fact, what's interesting nabout new power,is that it eschews some of nthe professionalization,and specialization that was,all the rage in the 20th century. 
 So what's interesting about these,new power values and thesennew power models,is what they mean for organizations.,So we've spent a bit of time thinking,,how can we plot organizations,on a two-by-two where, essentially,,we look at new power values,and new power models,and see where different people sit?,We started with a U.S. analysis,,and let me show you nsome interesting findings.,So the first is Apple.,In this framework, we actuallyndescribed Apple,as an old power company.,That's because the ideology,,the governing ideology of Apple,is the ideology of the perfectionist,product designer in Cupertino.,It's absolutely about that beautiful, nperfect thing descending upon us,in perfection.,And it does not value, as a ncompany, transparency.,In fact, it's very secretive.,Now, Apple is one of the mostnsuccesful companies in the world.,So this shows that you can,still pursue a successful nold power strategy.,But one can argue that there's nreal vulnerabilites in that model.,I think another interesting comparison,is that of the Obama campaign,versus the Obama presidency.,(Applause),Now, I like President Obama,,but he ran with new npower at his back, right?,And he said to people,,we are the ones we'venbeen waiting for.,And he used crowdfunding,to power a campaign.,But when he got into office,,he governed like more or less nall the other presidents did.,And this is a really interesting trend,,is when new power gets powerful,,what happens?,So this is a framework you nshould look at,and think about where yournown organization,sits on it.,And think about where itnshould be,in five or 10 years.,So what do you do if you're old power?,Well, if you're there nthinking, in old power,,this won't happen to us.,Then just look at the Wikipedianentry for Encyclopædia Britannica.,Let me tell you, it's a very sad read. 
 But if you are old power,,the most important thing you ncan do is to occupy yourself,before others occupy you,,before you are occupied.,Imagine that a groupnof your biggest skeptics,are camped in the heartnof your organization,asking the toughest questions,and they can see everythingninside of your organization.,And ask them, would they nlike what they see,and should our model change?,What about if you're new power?,Is new power kind of just nriding the wave to glory?,I would argue no.,I would argue that therenare some very real challenges,to new power in this nascent phase.,Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Streetnexample for a moment.,Occupy was this incredible example nof new power,,the purest example of new power.,And yet, it failed to consolidate.,So the energy that it created,was great for the meme phase,,but they were so committed to participation,,that they never got anything done.,And in fact that model,means that the challenge for new power is:,how do you use institutional power,without being institutionalized? 
 One the other end of the spectra is Uber.,Uber is an amazing,,highly scalable new power model.,That network is getting denser and denser,by the day.,But what's really interesting nabout Uber is,it hasn't really adopted new power values.,This is a real quote from nthe Uber CEO recently:,He says, "Once we get rid of the dude nin the car" — he means drivers —,"Uber will be cheaper.",Now, new power modelsnlive and die,by the strength of their networks.,By whether the drivers and the consumers,who use the service actually believe in it.,Because they're not an exercise nof top-down perfectionism,,they are about the network.,And so, the challenge,,and this is why it's innno way surprising,,is that Uber's drivers nare now unionizing.,It's extraordinary.,Uber's drivers are turning on Uber.,And the challenge for Uber —,this isn't an easy situation for them —,is that they are locked intona broader superstrcuture,that is really old power.,They've raised more than a billion ndollars in the capital markets.,Those markets expect a financial return,,and they way you get a financial return,is by squeezing and squeezing,your users and your drivers,for more and more value,and giving that value to your investors. 
 So the big question about the future nof new power, in my view, is:,Will that old power just emerge?,So will new power elites just become,old power and squeeze?,Or will that new powernbase bite back?,Will the next big Uber,be co-owned by Uber drivers?,And I think this going nto be a very interesting,structural question. 
 Finally, think about new power,being more than just an,entity that scales things,that make us have slightly nbetter consumer experiences.,My call to action for new power,is to not be an island.,We have major structuralnproblems in the world today,that could benefit enormously,from the kinds of mass participation,and peer coordination,that these new power players,know so well how to generate.,And we badly need them to nturn their energies and their power,to big, what economists might call,public goods problems,,that are often beyond markets,where investors can easily be found.,And I think if we can do that,,we might be able to fundamentally change,not only human beings' sense of ntheir own agency and power —,because I think that's the mostnwonderful thing about new power,,is that people feel more powerful —,but we might also be able to change,the way we relate to each other,and the way we relate to nauthority and institutions.,And to me, that's absolutely,worth trying for.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)America's favorite pie is? 
 Audience: Apple.nKenneth Cukier: Apple. Of course it is.,How do we know it?,Because of data.,You look at supermarket sales.,You look at supermarketnsales of 30-centimeter pies,that are frozen, and apple wins, no contest.,The majority of the sales are apple.,But then supermarkets started selling,smaller, 11-centimeter pies,,and suddenly, apple fell to fourth or fifth place.,Why? What happened?,Okay, think about it.,When you buy a 30-centimeter pie,,the whole family has to agree,,and apple is everyone's second favorite.,(Laughter),But when you buy an individual 11-centimeter pie,,you can buy the one that you want.,You can get your first choice.,You have more data.,You can see something,that you couldn't see,when you only had smaller amounts of it. 
 Now, the point here is that more data,doesn't just let us see more,,more of the same thing we were looking at.,More data allows us to see new.,It allows us to see better.,It allows us to see different.,In this case, it allows us to see,what America's favorite pie is:,not apple. 
 Now, you probably all have heard the term big data.,In fact, you're probably sick of hearing the term,big data.,It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term,,and that is very unfortunate,,because big data is an extremely important tool,by which society is going to advance.,In the past, we used to look at small data,and think about what it would mean,to try to understand the world,,and now we have a lot more of it,,more than we ever could before.,What we find is that when we have,a large body of data, we can fundamentally do things,that we couldn't do when wenonly had smaller amounts.,Big data is important, and big data is new,,and when you think about it,,the only way this planet is going to deal,with its global challenges —,to feed people, supply them with medical care,,supply them with energy, electricity,,and to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp,because of global warming —,is because of the effective use of data. 
 So what is new about big ndata? What is the big deal?,Well, to answer that question, let's think about,what information looked like,,physically looked like in the past.,In 1908, on the island of Crete,,archaeologists discovered a clay disc.,They dated it from 2000 B.C., so it's 4,000 years old.,Now, there's inscriptions on this disc,,but we actually don't know what it means.,It's a complete mystery, but the point is that,this is what information used to look like,4,000 years ago.,This is how society stored,and transmitted information. 
 Now, society hasn't advanced all that much.,We still store information on discs,,but now we can store a lot more information,,more than ever before.,Searching it is easier. Copying it easier.,Sharing it is easier. Processing it is easier.,And what we can do is we can reuse this information,for uses that we never even imagined,when we first collected the data.,In this respect, the data has gone,from a stock to a flow,,from something that is stationary and static,to something that is fluid and dynamic.,There is, if you will, a liquidity to information.,The disc that was discovered off of Crete,that's 4,000 years old, is heavy,,it doesn't store a lot of information,,and that information is unchangeable.,By contrast, all of the files,that Edward Snowden took,from the National SecuritynAgency in the United States,fits on a memory stick,the size of a fingernail,,and it can be shared at the speed of light.,More data. More. 
 Now, one reason why we havenso much data in the world today,is we are collecting things,that we've always collected information on,,but another reason why is we're taking things,that have always been informational,but have never been rendered into a data format,and we are putting it into data.,Think, for example, the question of location.,Take, for example, Martin Luther.,If we wanted to know in the 1500s,where Martin Luther was,,we would have to follow him at all times,,maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell,,and record it,,but now think about what it looks like today.,You know that somewhere,,probably in a telecommunications carrier's database,,there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry,that records your information,of where you've been at all times.,If you have a cell phone,,and that cell phone has GPS,nbut even if it doesn't have GPS,,it can record your information.,In this respect, location has been datafied. 
 Now think, for example, of the issue of posture,,the way that you are all sitting right now,,the way that you sit,,the way that you sit, the way that you sit.,It's all different, and it's a function of your leg length,and your back and the contours of your back,,and if I were to put sensors, nmaybe 100 sensors,into all of your chairs right now,,I could create an index that's fairly unique to you,,sort of like a fingerprint, but it's not your finger. 
 So what could we do with this?,Researchers in Tokyo are using it,as a potential anti-theft device in cars.,The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel,,tries to stream off, but the car recognizes,that a non-approved driver is behind the wheel,,and maybe the engine just stops, unless you,type in a password into the dashboard,to say, "Hey, I have authorization to drive." Great. 
 What if every single car in Europe,had this technology in it?,What could we do then?,Maybe, if we aggregated the data,,maybe we could identify telltale signs,that best predict that a car accident,is going to take place in the next five seconds.,And then what we will have datafied,is driver fatigue,,and the service would be when the car senses,that the person slumps into that position,,automatically knows, hey, set an internal alarm,that would vibrate the steering wheel, honk inside,to say, "Hey, wake up,,pay more attention to the road.",These are the sorts of things we can do,when we datafy more aspects of our lives. 
 So what is the value of big data?,Well, think about it.,You have more information.,You can do things that you couldn't do before.,One of the most impressive areas,where this concept is taking place,is in the area of machine learning.,Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence,,which itself is a branch of computer science.,The general idea is that instead of,instructing a computer what do do,,we are going to simply throw data at the problem,and tell the computer to figure it out for itself.,And it will help you understand it,by seeing its origins.,In the 1950s, a computer scientist,at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers,,so he wrote a computer program,so he could play against the computer.,He played. He won.,He played. He won.,He played. He won,,because the computer only knew,what a legal move was.,Arthur Samuel knew something else.,Arthur Samuel knew strategy.,So he wrote a small sub-program alongside it,operating in the background, and all it did,was score the probability,that a given board configuration would likely lead,to a winning board versus a losing board,after every move.,He plays the computer. He wins.,He plays the computer. He wins.,He plays the computer. He wins.,And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer,to play itself.,It plays itself. It collects more data.,It collects more data. It increasesnthe accuracy of its prediction.,And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer,and he plays it, and he loses,,and he plays it, and he loses,,and he plays it, and he loses,,and Arthur Samuel has created a machine,that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. 
 And this idea of machine learning,is going everywhere.,How do you think we have self-driving cars?,Are we any better off as a society,enshrining all the rules of the road into software?,No. Memory is cheaper. No.,Algorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No.,All of those things matter, but that's not why.,It's because we changed the nature of the problem.,We changed the nature of the problem from one,in which we tried to overtly and explicitly,explain to the computer how to drive,to one in which we say,,"Here's a lot of data around the vehicle.,You figure it out.,You figure it out that that is a traffic light,,that that traffic light is red and not green,,that that means that you need to stop,and not go forward." 
 Machine learning is at the basis,of many of the things that we do online:,search engines,,Amazon's personalization algorithm,,computer translation,,voice recognition systems.,Researchers recently have looked at,the question of biopsies,,cancerous biopsies,,and they've asked the computer to identify,by looking at the data and survival rates,to determine whether cells are actually,cancerous or not,,and sure enough, when you throw the data at it,,through a machine-learning algorithm,,the machine was able to identify,the 12 telltale signs that best predict,that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells,are indeed cancerous.,The problem: The medical literature,only knew nine of them.,Three of the traits were ones,that people didn't need to look for,,but that the machine spotted. 
 Now, there are dark sides to big data as well.,It will improve our lives, but there are problems,that we need to be conscious of,,and the first one is the idea,that we may be punished for predictions,,that the police may use big data for their purposes,,a little bit like "Minority Report.",Now, it's a term called predictive policing,,or algorithmic criminology,,and the idea is that if we take a lot of data,,for example where past crimes have been,,we know where to send the patrols.,That makes sense, but the problem, of course,,is that it's not simply going to stop on location data,,it's going to go down to the level of the individual.,Why don't we use data about the person's,high school transcript?,Maybe we should use the fact that,they're unemployed or not, their credit score,,their web-surfing behavior,,whether they're up late at night.,Their Fitbit, when it's ablento identify biochemistries,,will show that they have aggressive thoughts.,We may have algorithms that are likely to predict,what we are about to do,,and we may be held accountable,before we've actually acted.,Privacy was the central challenge,in a small data era.,In the big data age,,the challenge will be safeguarding free will,,moral choice, human volition,,human agency. 
 There is another problem:,Big data is going to steal our jobs.,Big data and algorithms are going to challenge,white collar, professional knowledge work,in the 21st century,in the same way that factory automation,and the assembly line,challenged blue collar labor in the 20th century.,Think about a lab technician,who is looking through a microscope,at a cancer biopsy,and determining whether it's cancerous or not.,The person went to university.,The person buys property.,He or she votes.,He or she is a stakeholder in society.,And that person's job,,as well as an entire fleet,of professionals like that person,,is going to find that their jobs are radically changed,or actually completely eliminated.,Now, we like to think,that technology creates jobs over a period of time,after a short, temporary period of dislocation,,and that is true for the frame of reference,with which we all live, the Industrial Revolution,,because that's precisely what happened.,But we forget something in that analysis:,There are some categories of jobs,that simply get eliminated and never come back.,The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good,if you were a horse.,So we're going to need to be careful,and take big data and adjust it for our needs,,our very human needs.,We have to be the master of this technology,,not its servant.,We are just at the outset of the big data era,,and honestly, we are not very good,at handling all the data that we can now collect.,It's not just a problem fornthe National Security Agency.,Businesses collect lots ofndata, and they misuse it too,,and we need to get better atnthis, and this will take time.,It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced,by primitive man and fire.,This is a tool, but this is a tool that,,unless we're careful, will burn us. 
 Big data is going to transform how we live,,how we work and how we think.,It is going to help us manage our careers,and lead lives of satisfaction and hope,and happiness and health,,but in the past, we've oftennlooked at information technology,and our eyes have only seen the T,,the technology, the hardware,,because that's what was physical.,We now need to recast our gaze at the I,,the information,,which is less apparent,,but in some ways a lot more important.,Humanity can finally learn from the information,that it can collect,,as part of our timeless quest,to understand the world and our place in it,,and that's why big data is a big deal. 
 (Applause)In Kenya, 1984 is known,as the year of the cup,,or the goro goro.,The goro goro is a cup used to measure,two kilograms of maize flower on the market,,and the maize flower is used to make ugali,,a polenta-like cake that is eatenntogether with vegetables.,Both the maize and the vegetables are grown,on most Kenyan farms,,which means that most families can feed themselves,from their own farm.,One goro goro can feed three meals,for an average family,,and in 1984, the whole harvest,could fit in one goro goro.,It was and still is one of the worst droughts,in living memory.,Now today, I insure farmers against droughts,like those in the year of the cup,,or to be more specific, I insure the rains. 
 I come from a family of missionaries,who built hospitals in Indonesia,,and my father built a psychiatric hospital,in Tanzania.,This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.,I don't think they thought I'd grow up,to sell insurance. (Laughter),So let me tell you how that happened. 
 In 2008, I was working,for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,,and my boss had just been promoted,to become the minister.,She launched an ambitious plan,to start a green revolution in her country,,and before we knew it, we were importing,tons of fertilizer and seed,and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer,and plant.,A couple of weeks later,,the International Monetary Fund visited us,,and asked my minister,,"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers,reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?",My minister answered proudly,and somewhat defiantly,,"I am going to pray for rain.",That ended the discussion.,On the way back to the ministry in the car,,she turned around to me and said,,"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.,Go find us some insurance." 
 It's been six years since,,and last year I was fortunate enough,to be part of a team that insured,over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda,against drought.,They owned an average of half an acre,and paid on average two Euros in premium.,It's microinsurance. 
 Now, traditional insurance doesn't work,with two to three Euros of premium,,because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.,A farmer here in Germany would be visited,for the start of the season, halfway through,,and at the end, and again if there was a loss,,to estimate the damages.,For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,,the maths of doing those visits,simply don't add up.,So instead, we rely on technology and data.,This satellite measures,whether there were clouds or not,,because think about it:,If there are clouds, then you might have some rain,,but if there are no clouds,,then it's actually impossible for it to rain.,These images show the onset of the rains,this season in Kenya.,You see that around March 6,,the clouds move in and then disappear,,and then around the March 11,,the clouds really move in.,That, and those clouds,,were the onset of the rains this year.,This satellite covers the whole of Africa,and goes back as far as 1984,,and that's important, because if you know,how many times a place has had a drought,in the last 30 years,,you can make a pretty good estimate,what the chances are of drought in the future,,and that means that you can put a price tag,on the risk of drought. 
 The data alone isn't enough.,We devise agronomic algorithms,which tell us how much rainfallna crop needs and when.,For example, for maize at planting,,you need to have two days of rain,for farmers to plant,,and then it needs to rain once every two weeks,for the crop to properly germinate.,After that, you need rain every three weeks,for the crop to form its leaves,,whereas at flowering, younneed it to rain more frequently,,about once every 10 daysnfor the crop to form its cob.,At the end of the season,,you actually don't want it to rain,,because rains then can damage the crop. 
 Devising such a cover is difficult,,but it turned out the real challenge,was selling insurance.,We set ourselves a modest target,of 500 farmers insured after our first season.,After a couple of months' intense marketing,,we had signed up the grand total,of 185 farmers.,I was disappointed and confounded.,Everybody kept telling me that farmers,wanted insurance,,but our prime customers simply weren't buying.,They were waiting to see what would happen,,didn't trust insurance companies,,or thought, "I've managed for so many years.,Why would I buy insurance now?" 
 Now many of you know microcredit,,the method of providing small loans to poor people,pioneered by Muhammad Yunus,,who won the Nobel Peace Prize,for his work with the Grameen Bank.,Turns out, selling microcredit,isn't the same as selling insurance.,For credit, a farmer needsnto earn the trust of a bank,,and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.,That's an attractive proposition.,For insurance, the farmer needs to trust,the insurance company, and needs,to advance the insurance company money.,It's a very different value proposition.,And so the uptick of insurance has been slow,,with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans,taking up insurance in 2012,,and half of that number is in one country,,South Africa. 
 We tried for some years,selling insurance directly to farmers,,with very high marketing cost,and very limited success.,Then we realized that there were many organizations,working with farmers:,seed companies, microfinance institutions,,mobile phone companies,,government agencies.,They were all providing loans to farmers,,and often, just before they'd finalize the loan,,the farmer would say,,"But what if it doesn't rain?,How do you expect me to repay my loan?",Many of these organizations,were taking on the risk themselves,,simply hoping that that year,,the worst wouldn't happen.,Most of the organizations, however,,were limiting their growth in agriculture.,They couldn't take on this kind of risk.,These organizations became our customers,,and when combining credit and insurance,,interesting things can happen.,Let me tell you one more story. 
 At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,,the rains started, and they started early,,and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,,because it usually means thatnthe season is going to be good.,So they took out loans and planted.,For the next three weeks,,there wasn't a single drop of rain,,and the crops that had germinated so well,shriveled and died.,We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution,that had provided those loans,to about 6,000 farmers in that area,,and we called them up and said,,"Look, we know about the drought.,We've got you.,We'll give you 200,000 Eurosnat the end of the season.",They said, "Wow, that's great,,but that'll be late.,Could you give us the money now?,Then these farmers can still replant,and can get a harvest this season.",So we convinced our insurance partners,,and later that April, these farmers replanted.,We took the idea of replanting to a seed company,and convinced them to price the cost of insurance,into every bag of seed,,and in every bag, we packed a card,that had a number on it,,and when the farmers would open the card,,they'd text in that number,,and that number would actually help us,to locate the farmer,and allocate them to a satellite pixel.,A satellite would then measure the rainfall,for the next three weeks,,and if it didn't rain,,we'd replace their seed. 
 One of the first —,(Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there! 
 One of the first beneficiariesnof this replanting guarantee,was Bosco Mwinyi.,We visited his farm later that August,,and I wish I could show you the smile on his face,when he showed us his harvest,,because it warmed my heart,and it made me realize why selling insurance,can be a good thing.,But you know, he insisted,that we get his whole harvest in the picture,,so we had to zoom out a lot.,Insurance secured his harvest that season,,and I believe that today,,we have all the tools to enable African farmers,to take control of their own destiny.,No more years of the cup.,Instead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,,the year of the insurance,,or the year of the great harvest. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've been thinking a lot about the world recently,and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.,Twenty or 30 years ago,,if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died,in a remote village in East Asia,,it would have been a tragedy for the chicken,and its closest relatives,,but I don't think there was much possibility,of us fearing a global pandemic,and the deaths of millions.,Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America,lent too much money to some people,who couldn't afford to pay it back,and the bank went bust,,that was bad for the lender,and bad for the borrower,,but we didn't imagine it would bring,the global economic system to its knees,for nearly a decade. 
 This is globalization.,This is the miracle that has enabled us,to transship our bodies and our minds,and our words and our pictures and our ideas,and our teaching and our learning around the planet,ever faster and ever cheaper.,It's brought a lot of bad stuff,,like the stuff that I just described,,but it's also brought a lot of good stuff.,A lot of us are not aware,of the extraordinary successes ofnthe Millennium Development Goals,,several of which have achieved their targets,long before the due date.,That proves that this species of humanity,is capable of achieving extraordinary progress,if it really acts together and it really tries hard.,But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,,I sort of feel that globalization,has taken us by surprise,,and we've been slow to respond to it.,If you look at the downside of globalization,,it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.,All of the grand challenges that we face today,,like climate change and human rights,and demographics and terrorism and pandemics,and narco-trafficking and human slavery,and species loss, I could go on,,we're not making an awful lot of progress,against an awful lot of those challenges. 
 So in a nutshell, that's the challenge,that we all face today,at this interesting point in history.,That's clearly what we've got to do next.,We've somehow got to get our act together,and we've got to figure out how to globalize,the solutions better,so that we don't simply become a species,which is the victim of the globalization of problems. 
 Why are we so slow at achieving these advances?,What's the reason for it?,Well, there are, of course, a number of reasons,,but perhaps the primary reason,is because we're still organized as a species,in the same way that we were organized,200 or 300 years ago.,There's one superpower left on the planet,and that is the seven billion people,,the seven billion of us who cause all these problems,,the same seven billion, by the way,,who will resolve them all.,But how are those seven billion organized?,They're still organized in 200 or so nation-states,,and the nations have governments,that make rules,and cause us to behave in certain ways.,And that's a pretty efficient system,,but the problem is that thenway that those laws are made,and the way those governments think,is absolutely wrong for thensolution of global problems,,because it all looks inwards.,The politicians that we elect,and the politicians we don't elect, on the whole,,have minds that microscope.,They don't have minds that telescope.,They look in. They pretend, they behave,,as if they believed that every country was an island,that existed quite happily, independently,of all the others,on its own little planet,in its own little solar system.,This is the problem:,countries competing against each other,,countries fighting against each other.,This week, as any week you care to look at,,you'll find people actually trying to killneach other from country to country,,but even when that's not going on,,there's competition between countries,,each one trying to shaft the next. 
 This is clearly not a good arrangement.,We clearly need to change it.,We clearly need to find ways,of encouraging countries to start working together,a little bit better.,And why won't they do that?,Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards? 
 Well, the first and most obvious reason,is because that's what we ask them to do.,That's what we tell them to do.,When we elect governments,or when we tolerate unelected governments,,we're effectively telling them that what we want,is for them to deliver us in our country,a certain number of things.,We want them to deliver prosperity,,growth, competitiveness, transparency, justice,and all of those things.,So unless we start asking our governments,to think outside a little bit,,to consider the global problems that will finish us all,if we don't start considering them,,then we can hardly blame them,if what they carry on doing is looking inwards,,if they still have minds that microscope,rather than minds that telescope.,That's the first reason whynthings tend not to change. 
 The second reason is that these governments,,just like all the rest of us,,are cultural psychopaths.,I don't mean to be rude,,but you know what a psychopath is.,A psychopath is a person who,,unfortunately for him or her,,lacks the ability to really empathize,with other human beings.,When they look around,,they don't see other human beings,with deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives,and aims and ambitions.,What they see is cardboard cutouts,,and it's very sad and it's very lonely,,and it's very rare, fortunately. 
 But actually, aren't most of us,not really so very good at empathy?,Oh sure, we're very good at empathy,when it's a question of dealing with people,who kind of look like us,and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray,and wear like us,,but when it comes to people who don't do that,,who don't quite dress like us,and don't quite pray like us,and don't quite talk like us,,do we not also have a tendency to see them,ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?,And this is a question we need to ask ourselves.,I think constantly we have to monitor it.,Are we and our politicians to a degree,cultural psychopaths? 
 The third reason is hardly worth mentioning,because it's so silly,,but there's a belief amongst governments,that the domestic agenda,and the international agenda,are incompatible and always will be.,This is just nonsense.,In my day job, I'm a policy adviser.,I've spent the last 15 years or so,advising governments around the world,,and in all of that time I have never once seen,a single domestic policy issue,that could not be more imaginatively,,effectively and rapidly resolved,than by treating it as an international problem,,looking at the international context,,comparing what others have done,,bringing in others, working externally,instead of working internally. 
 And so you may say, well, given all of that,,why then doesn't it work?,Why can we not make our politicians change?,Why can't we demand them?,Well I, like a lot of us, spendna lot of time complaining,about how hard it is to make people change,,and I don't think we should fuss about it.,I think we should just accept,that we are an inherently conservative species.,We don't like to change.,It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.,We probably wouldn't still be here today,if we weren't so resistant to change.,It's very simple: Many thousands of years ago,,we discovered that if we carried on,doing the same things, we wouldn't die,,because the things that we've done before,by definition didn't kill us,,and therefore as long as we carry on doing them,,we'll be okay,,and it's very sensible not to do anything new,,because it might kill you.,But of course, there are exceptions to that.,Otherwise, we'd never get anywhere.,And one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,,is when you can show to people,that there might be some self-interest,in them making that leap of faith,and changing a little bit. 
 So I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years,trying to find out what could be that self-interest,that would encourage not just politicians,but also businesses and general populations,,all of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,,to think in a bigger picture,,not always to look inwards,nsometimes to look outwards.,And this is where I discovered,something quite important.,In 2005, I launched a study,called the Nation Brands Index.,What it is, it's a very large-scale study that polls,a very large sample of the world's population,,a sample that represents about 70 percent,of the planet's population,,and I started asking them a series of questions,about how they perceive other countries.,And the Nation Brands Index over the years,has grown to be a very, very large database.,It's about 200 billion data points,tracking what ordinary peoplenthink about other countries,and why.,Why did I do this? Well, becausenthe governments that I advise,are very, very keen on knowing,how they are regarded.,They've known, partly because,I've encouraged them to realize it,,that countries depend,enormously on their reputations,in order to survive and prosper in the world.,If a country has a great, positive image,,like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,,everything is easy and everything is cheap.,You get more tourists. You get more investors.,You sell your products more expensively.,If, on the other hand, you have a country,with a very weak or a very negative image,,everything is difficult and everything is expensive.,So governments care desperately,about the image of their country,,because it makes a direct difference,to how much money they can make,,and that's what they've promised their populations,they're going to deliver. 
 So a couple of years ago, I thought I would take,some time out and speak to that gigantic database,and ask it,,why do some people prefer one country,more than another?,And the answer that the database gave me,completely staggered me.,It was 6.8.,I haven't got time to explain in detail.,Basically what it told me was —,(Laughter) (Applause) —,the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.,We don't admire countriesnprimarily because they're rich,,because they're powerful,nbecause they're successful,,because they're modern, becausenthey're technologically advanced.,We primarily admire countries that are good.,What do we mean by good?,We mean countries that seem to contribute,something to the world in which we live,,countries that actually make the world safer,or better or richer or fairer.,Those are the countries we like.,This is a discovery of significant importance —,you see where I'm going —,because it squares the circle.,I can now say, and often do, to any government,,in order to do well, you need to do good.,If you want to sell more products,,if you want to get more investment,,if you want to become more competitive,,then you need to start behaving,,because that's why people will respect you,and do business with you,,and therefore, the more you collaborate,,the more competitive you become. 
 This is quite an important discovery,,and as soon as I discovered this,,I felt another index coming on.,I swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler,and more and more childish.,This one is called the Good Country Index,,and it does exactly what it says on the tin.,It measures, or at least it tries to measure,,exactly how much each country on Earth contributes,not to its own population but to the rest of humanity.,Bizarrely, nobody had ever thought,of measuring this before.,So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent,the best part of the last two years,,with the help of a large numbernof very serious and clever people,,cramming together all the reliable data in the world,we could find about what countries give,to the world. 
 And you're waiting for me tontell you which one comes top.,And I'm going to tell you,,but first of all I want to tell you,precisely what I mean,when I say a good country.,I do not mean morally good.,When I say that Country X,is the goodest country on Earth,,and I mean goodest, I don't mean best.,Best is something different.,When you're talking about a good country,,you can be good, gooder and goodest.,It's not the same thing as good, better and best.,This is a country which simply gives more,to humanity than any other country.,I don't talk about how they behave at home,because that's measured elsewhere.,And the winner is,Ireland.,(Applause),According to the data here,,no country on Earth, per head of population,,per dollar of GDP, contributes more,to the world that we live in than Ireland.,What does this mean?,This means that as we go to sleep at night,,all of us in the last 15 secondsnbefore we drift off to sleep,,our final thought should be,,godammit, I'm glad that Ireland exists.,(Laughter),And that — (Applause) —,In the depths of a very severe economic recession,,I think that there's a really important lesson there,,that if you can remembernyour international obligations,whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,,that's really something.,Finland ranks pretty much the same.,The only reason why it's below Ireland,is because its lowest score isnlower than Ireland's lowest score. 
 Now the other thing you'llnnotice about the top 10 there,is, of course, they're all, apart from New Zealand,,Western European nations.,They're also all rich.,This depressed me,,because one of the things that I did not want,to discover with this index,is that it's purely the province of rich countries,to help poor countries.,This is not what it's all about.,And indeed, if you look further down the list,,I don't have the slide here, you will see,something that made me very happy indeed,,that Kenya is in the top 30,,and that demonstrates onenvery, very important thing.,This is not about money.,This is about attitude.,This is about culture.,This is about a government and a people that care,about the rest of the world,and have the imagination and the courage,to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly. 
 I'm going to whip through the other slides,just so you can see somenof the lower-lying countries.,There's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,,Mexico comes 66th,,and then we have some ofnthe big developing countries,,like Russia at 95th, China at 107th.,Countries like China and Russia and India,,which is down in the same part of the index,,well, in some ways, it's not surprising.,They've spent a great deal of time,over the last decades building their own economy,,building their own society and their own polity,,but it is to be hoped,that the second phase of their growth,will be somewhat more outward-looking,than the first phase has been so far. 
 And then you can break down each country,in terms of the actual datasets that build into it.,I'll allow you to do that.,From midnight tonight it's goingnto be on goodcountry.org,,and you can look at the country.,You can look right down to thenlevel of the individual datasets. 
 Now that's the Good Country Index.,What's it there for?,Well, it's there really because I want to try,to introduce this word,,or reintroduce this word, into the discourse.,I've had enough hearing about competitive countries.,I've had enough hearing about,prosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.,I've even had enough hearing about happy countries,because in the end that's still selfish.,That's still about us,,and if we carry on thinking about us,,we are in deep, deep trouble.,I think we all know what it is,that we want to hear about.,We want to hear about good countries,,and so I want to ask you all a favor.,I'm not asking a lot.,It's something that you might find easy to do,and you might even find enjoyable,and even helpful to do,,and that's simply to start using the word "good",in this context.,When you think about your own country,,when you think about other people's countries,,when you think about companies,,when you talk about the world that we live in today,,start using that word,in the way that I've talked about this evening.,Not good, the opposite of bad,,because that's an argument that never finishes.,Good, the opposite of selfish,,good being a country that thinks about all of us.,That's what I would like you to do,,and I'd like you to use it as a stick,with which to beat your politicians.,When you elect them, when you reelect them,,when you vote for them, when you listen,to what they're offering you,,use that word, "good,",and ask yourself,,"Is that what a good country would do?",And if the answer is no, be very suspicious.,Ask yourself, is that the behavior,of my country?,Do I want to come from a country,where the government, in my name,,is doing things like that?,Or do I, on the other hand,,prefer the idea of walking around the world,with my head held high thinking, "Yeah,,I'm proud to come from a good country"?,And everybody will welcome you.,And everybody in the last 15 seconds,before they drift off to sleep at night will say,,"Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists." 
 Ultimately, that, I think,,is what will make the change.,That word, "good,",and the number 6.8,and the discovery that's behind it,have changed my life.,I think they can change your life,,and I think we can use it to change,the way that our politiciansnand our companies behave,,and in doing so, we can change the world.,I've started thinking very differently about,my own country since I've beennthinking about these things.,I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country,,and then I started thinking Inwanted to live in a happy country,,but I began to realize, it's not enough.,I don't want to live in a rich country.,I don't want to live in a fast-growing,or competitive country.,I want to live in a good country,,and I so, so hope that you do too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It's very nice to be here tonight. 
 So I've been working on the history of income,and wealth distribution for the past 15 years,,and one of the interesting lessons,coming from this historical evidence,is indeed that, in the long run,,there is a tendency for nthe rate of return of capital,to exceed the economy's growth rate,,and this tends to lead to nhigh concentration of wealth.,Not infinite concentration of wealth,,but the higher the gap between r and g,,the higher the level of inequality of wealth,towards which society tends to converge. 
 So this is a key force thatnI'm going to talk about today,,but let me say right away,that this is not the only important force,in the dynamics of income nand wealth distribution,,and there are many other forces that play,an important role in the long-run dynamics,of income and wealth distribution.,Also there is a lot of data,that still needs to be collected.,We know a little bit more today,than we used to know, nbut we still know too little,,and certainly there are nmany different processes —,economic, social, political —,that need to be studied more.,And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,,but that doesn't mean that other important forces,do not exist. 
 So most of the data I'm going to present,comes from this database,that's available online:,the World Top Incomes Database.,So this is the largest existing,historical database on inequality,,and this comes from the effort,of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.,So let me show you a couple of facts,coming from this database,,and then we'll return to r bigger than g.,So fact number one is that there has been,a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality,between the United States and Europe,over the past century.,So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually,much higher in Europe than in the United States,,whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.,So let me be very clear:,The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.,It has more to do with changing supply and demand,for skill, the race between education and technology,,globalization, probably more unequal access,to skills in the U.S.,,where you have very good, very top universities,but where the bottom part of the educational system,is not as good,,so very unequal access to skills,,and also an unprecedented rise,of top managerial compensation of the United States,,which is difficult to account fornjust on the basis of education.,So there is more going on here,,but I'm not going to talk too much about this today,,because I want to focus on wealth inequality. 
 So let me just show you a very simple indicator,about the income inequality part.,So this is the share of total income,going to the top 10 percent.,So you can see that one century ago,,it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe,and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,,so there was more inequality in Europe.,Then there was a sharp decline,during the first half of the 20th century,,and in the recent decade, you can see that,the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,,and this is the first fact I just talked about.,Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,,and here the central fact is that wealth inequality,is always a lot higher than income inequality,,and also that wealth inequality,,although it has also increased in recent decades,,is still less extreme today,than what it was a century ago,,although the total quantity of wealth,relative to income has now recovered,from the very large shocks,caused by World War I, the Great Depression,,World War II. 
 So let me show you two graphs,illustrating fact number two and fact number three.,So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,,this is the share of total wealth,going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,,so you can see the same kind of reversal,between the U.S. and Europe that we had before,for income inequality.,So wealth concentration was higher,in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,,and now it is the opposite.,But you can also show two things:,First, the general level of wealth inequality,is always higher than income inequality.,So remember, for income inequality,,the share going to the top 10 percent,was between 30 and 50 percent of total income,,whereas for wealth, the share is always,between 60 and 90 percent.,Okay, so that's fact number one,,and that's very important for what follows.,Wealth concentration is always,a lot higher than income concentration. 
 Fact number two is that the rise,in wealth inequality in recent decades,is still not enough to get us back to 1910.,So the big difference today,,wealth inequality is still very large,,with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,,but the good news is that it's actually,better than one century ago,,where you had 90 percent innEurope going to the top 10.,So today what you have,is what I call the middle 40 percent,,the people who are not in the top 10,and who are not in the bottom 50,,and what you can view as the wealth middle class,that owns 20 to 30 percent,of total wealth, national wealth,,whereas they used to be poor, a century ago,,when there was basically no wealth middle class.,So this is an important change,,and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality,has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,,although the total quantity of wealth has recovered.,Okay? So this is the total value,of wealth relative to income,,and you can see that in particular in Europe,,we are almost back to the pre-World War I level.,So there are really two,different parts of the story here.,One has to do with,the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,,and there is nothing bad per se, of course,,in accumulating a lot of wealth,,and in particular if it is more diffuse,and less concentrated.,So what we really want to focus on,is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,,and what's going to happen in the future.,How can we account for the fact that,until World War I, wealth inequality was so high,and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,,and how can we think about the future? 
 So let me come to some of the explanations,and speculations about the future.,Let me first say that,probably the best model to explain,why wealth is so much,more concentrated than income,is a dynamic, dynastic model,where individuals have a long horizon,and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.,If people were accumulating wealth,only for life cycle reasons,,you know, to be able to consume,when they are old,,then the level of wealth inequality,should be more or less in line,with the level of income inequality.,But it will be very difficult to explain,why you have so much more wealth inequality,than income inequality,with a pure life cycle model,,so you need a story,where people also care,about wealth accumulation for other reasons.,So typically, they want to transmit,wealth to the next generation, to their children,,or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth,because of the prestige, thenpower that goes with wealth.,So there must be other reasons,for accumulating wealth than just life cycle,to explain what we see in the data.,Now, in a large class of dynamic models,of wealth accumulation,with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,,you will have all sorts of random,,multiplicative shocks.,So for instance, some families,have a very large number of children,,so the wealth will be divided.,Some families have fewer children.,You also have shocks to rates of return.,Some families make huge capital gains.,Some made bad investments.,So you will always have some mobility,in the wealth process.,Some people will move up,nsome people will move down.,The important point is that,,in any such model,,for a given variance of such shocks,,the equilibrium level of wealth inequality,will be a steeply rising function of r minus g.,And intuitively, the reason why the difference,between the rate of return to wealth,and the growth rate is important,is that initial wealth inequalities,will be amplified at a faster pace,with a bigger r minus g.,So take a simple example,,with r equals five percent and g equals one percent,,wealth holders only need to reinvest,one fifth of their capital income to ensure,that their wealth rises as fast,as the size of the economy.,So this makes it easier,to build and perpetuate large fortunes,because you can consume four fifths,,assuming zero tax,,and you can just reinvest one fifth.,So of course some familiesnwill consume more than that,,some will consume less, so there will be,some mobility in the distribution,,but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,,so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained. 
 Now, you should not be surprised,by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,,because, in fact, this is what happened,during most of the history of mankind.,And this was in a way very obvious to everybody,for a simple reason, which is that growth,was close to zero percent,during most of the history of mankind.,Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,,but very slow growth of population,and output per capita,,whereas the rate of return on capital,of course was not zero percent.,It was, for land assets, which was,the traditional form,of assets in preindustrial societies,,it was typically five percent.,Any reader of Jane Austen would know that.,If you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,,you should have a capital value,of 20,000 pounds so that,five percent of 20,000 is 1,000.,And in a way, this was,the very foundation of society,,because r bigger than g,was what allowed holders of wealth and assets,to live off their capital income,and to do something else in life,than just to care about their own survival. 
 Now, one important conclusion,of my historical research is that,modern industrial growth did not change,this basic fact as much as one might have expected.,Of course, the growth rate,following the Industrial Revolution,rose, typically from zero to one to two percent,,but at the same time, the rate of return,to capital also rose,so that the gap between the two,did not really change.,So during the 20th century,,you had a very unique combination of events.,First, a very low rate of return,due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,,destruction of wealth, inflation,,bankruptcy during the Great Depression,,and all of this reduced,the private rate of return to wealth,to unusually low levels,between 1914 and 1945.,And then, in the postwar period,,you had unusually high growth rate,,partly due to the reconstruction.,You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,,you had five percent growth rate,between 1950 and 1980,largely due to reconstruction,,and also due to very large demographic growth,,the Baby Boom Cohort effect.,Now, apparently that's not going to last for very long,,or at least the population growth,is supposed to decline in the future,,and the best projections we have is that,the long-run growth is going to be closer,to one to two percent,rather than four to five percent.,So if you look at this,,these are the best estimates we have,of world GDP growth,and rate of return on capital,,average rates of return on capital,,so you can see that during most,of the history of mankind,,the growth rate was very small,,much lower than the rate of return,,and then during the 20th century,,it is really the population growth,,very high in the postwar period,,and the reconstruction process,that brought growth,to a smaller gap with the rate of return.,Here I use the United Nations population projections,,so of course they are uncertain.,It could be that we all start,having a lot of children in the future,,and the growth rates are going to be higher,,but from now on,,these are the best projections we have,,and this will make global growth,decline and the gap between,the rate of return go up. 
 Now, the other unusual event,during the 20th century,was, as I said,,destruction, taxation of capital,,so this is the pre-tax rate of return.,This is the after-tax rate of return,,and after destruction,,and this is what brought,the average rate of return,after tax, after destruction,,below the growth rate during a long time period.,But without the destruction,,without the taxation, this nwould not have happened.,So let me say that the balance between,returns on capital and growth,depends on many different factors,that are very difficult to predict:,technology and the development,of capital-intensive techniques.,So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors,in the economy are the real estate sector, housing,,the energy sector, but it could be in the future,that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors,and that this would be a bigger share,of the total capital stock that it is today.,Well, we are very far from this,,and from now, what's going on,in the real estate sector, the energy sector,,is much more important for the total capital stock,and capital share. 
 The other important issue,is that there are scale effectsnin portfolio management,,together with financial complexity,,financial deregulation,,that make it easier to get higher rates of return,for a large portfolio,,and this seems to be particularly strong,for billionaires, large capital endowments.,Just to give you one example,,this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings,over the 1987-2013 period,,and you can see the very top wealth holders,have been going up at six, seven percent per year,in real terms above inflation,,whereas average income in the world,,average wealth in the world,,have increased at only two percent per year.,And you find the same,for large university endowments —,the bigger the initial endowments,,the bigger the rate of return. 
 Now, what could be done?,The first thing is that I think we need,more financial transparency.,We know too little about global wealth dynamics,,so we need international transmission,of bank information.,We need a global registry of financial assets,,more coordination on wealth taxation,,and even wealth tax with a small tax rate,will be a way to produce information,so that then we can adapt our policies,to whatever we observe.,And to some extent, the fight,against tax havens,and automatic transmission of information,is pushing us in this direction.,Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,,which it can be tempting to use.,Inflation:,it's much easier to print money,than to write a tax code, so that's very tempting,,but sometimes you don't knownwhat you do with the money.,This is a problem.,Expropriation is very tempting.,Just when you feel some people get too wealthy,,you just expropriate them.,But this is not a very efficient way,to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.,So war is an even less efficient way,,so I tend to prefer progressive taxation,,but of course, history — (Laughter) —,history will invent its own best ways,,and it will probably involve,a combination of all of these. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you. 
 Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,,because it's impressive how you'renin command of your data, of course,,but basically what you suggest is,growing wealth concentration is kind of,a natural tendency of capitalism,,and if we leave it to its own devices,,it may threaten the system itself,,so you're suggesting that we need to act,to implement policies that redistribute wealth,,including the ones we just saw:,progressive taxation, etc.,In the current political context,,how realistic are those?,How likely do you think that it is,that they will be implemented? 
 Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think,if you look back through time,,the history of income, wealth and taxation,is full of surprise.,So I am not terribly impressed,by those who know in advance,what will or will not happen.,I think one century ago,,many people would have said,that progressive income taxation would never happen,and then it happened.,And even five years ago,,many people would have said that bank secrecy,will be with us forever in Switzerland,,that Switzerland was too powerful,for the rest of the world,,and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions,against Swiss banks for a big change to happen,,and now we are moving toward,more financial transparency.,So I think it's not that difficult,to better coordinate politically.,We are going to have a treaty,with half of the world GDP around the table,with the U.S. and the European Union,,so if half of the world GDP is not enough,to make progress on financial transparency,and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,,what does it take?,So I think these are not technical difficulties.,I think we can make progress,if we have a more pragmaticnapproach to these questions,and we have the proper sanctions,on those who benefit from financial opacity. 
 BG: One of the arguments,against your point of view,is that economic inequality,is not only a feature of capitalismnbut is actually one of its engines.,So we take measures to lower inequality,,and at the same time we lower growth, potentially.,What do you answer to that? 
 TP: Yeah, I think inequality,is not a problem per se.,I think inequality up to a point,can actually be useful for innovation and growth.,The problem is, it's a question of degree.,When inequality gets too extreme,,then it becomes useless for growth,and it can even become bad,because it tends to lead to high perpetuation,of inequality over time,and low mobility.,And for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations,that we had in the 19th century,and pretty much until World War I,in every European country,was, I think, not useful for growth.,This was destroyed by a combination,of tragic events and policy changes,,and this did not prevent growth from happening.,And also, extreme inequality can be bad,for our democratic institutions,if it creates very unequal access to political voice,,and the influence of private money,in U.S. politics, I think,,is a matter of concern right now.,So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme,,pre-World War I inequality.,Having a decent share of the national wealth,for the middle class is not bad for growth.,It is actually useful,both for equity and efficiency reasons. 
 BG: I said at the beginning,that your book has been criticized.,Some of your data has been criticized.,Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized.,You have been accused of cherry-picking data,to make your case. What do you answer to that? 
 TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy,that this book is stimulating debate.,This is part of what it is intended for.,Look, the reason why I put all the data online,with all of the detailed computation,is so that we can have nan open and transparent,debate about this.,So I have responded point by point,to every concern.,Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,,I would actually conclude,that the rise in wealth inequality,,particularly in the United States,,has been actually highernthan what I report in my book.,There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman,showing, with new data,which I didn't have at the time of the book,,that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen,even more than what I report.,And there will be other data in the future.,Some of it will go in different directions.,Look, we put online almost every week,new, updated series on thenWorld Top Income Database,and we will keep doing so in the future,,in particular in emerging countries,,and I welcome all of those who want to contribute,to this data collection process.,In fact, I certainly agree,that there is not enough,transparency about wealth dynamics,,and a good way to have better data,would be to have a wealth tax,with a small tax rate to begin with,so that we can all agree,about this important evolution,and adapt our policies to whatever we observe.,So taxation is a source of knowledge,,and that's what we need the most right now. 
 BG: Thomas Piketty, merci beaucoup. 
 Thank you.nTP: Thank you. (Applause)Recently, I flew over a crowd,of thousands of people in Brazil,playing music by George Frideric Handel.,I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam,,again playing music by this same composer.,Let's take a look. 
 (Music: George Frideric Handel, "Allegro."nPerformed by Daria van den Bercken.) 
 (Video) Daria van den Bercken: Inlive there on the third floor.,(In Dutch) I live there on the corner.,I actually live there, around the corner.,and you'd be really welcome. 
 Man: (In Dutch) Does that sound like fun?nChild: (In Dutch) Yes! 
 [(In Dutch) "Handel house concert"] 
 (Applause) 
 Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real,magical experience for hundreds of reasons. 
 Now you may ask, why have I done these things?,They're not really typical for a musician's,day-to-day life.,Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music,and I wanted to share it with as many people,as possible. 
 It started a couple of years ago.,I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu,and browsing the Internet a little,,when I found out that Handel had written works,for the keyboard.,Well, I was surprised. I did not know this.,So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.,And what happened next was,that I entered this state of pure,,unprejudiced amazement.,It was an experience,of being totally in awe of the music,,and I had not felt that in a long time.,It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.,The first piece that I played through,started like this. 
 (Music) 
 Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?,And I turned the page and what came next,was this. 
 (Music) 
 Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?,So within a couple of minutes,,and the piece isn't even finished yet,,I experienced two very contrasting characters:,beautiful melancholy and sheer energy.,And I consider these two elements to be,vital human expressions.,And the purity of the music makes you hear it,very effectively. 
 I've given a lot of children's concerts,for children of seven and eight years old,,and whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven,,even Stockhausen,,or some jazzy music,,they are open to hear it,,really willing to listen,,and they are comfortable doing so.,And when classes come in,with children who are just a few years older,,11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble,in reaching them like that.,The complexity of the music does become an issue,,and actually the opinions of others —,parents, friends, media — they start to count.,But the young ones, they don't question,their own opinion.,They are in this constant state of wonder,,and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening,like these seven-year-old children,,even when growing up.,And that is why I have played,not only in the concert hall,but also on the street, online, in the air:,to feel that state of wonder,,to truly listen,,and to listen without prejudice.,And I would like to invite you,to do so now.,(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Chaconne in G Major."nPerformed by Daria van den Bercken.) 
 (Applause),Thank you.,(Applause)Talking about empowerment is odd,,because when we talk about empowerment,,what affects us most are the stories.,So I want to begin with an everyday story.,What is it really like to be a young woman in India? 
 Now, I've spent the last 27 years of my life,in India, lived in three small towns,,two major cities,,and I've had several experiences.,When I was seven,,a private tutor who used to come home,to teach me mathematics molested me.,He would put his hand up my skirt.,He put his hand up my skirt and told me,he knew how to make me feel good.,At 17, a boy from my high school,circulated an email,detailing all the sexually aggressive things,he could do to me,because I didn't pay attention to him.,At 19, I helped a friend,whose parents had forcefullynmarried her to an older man,escape an abusive marriage.,At 21, when my friend and I were walking,down the road one afternoon,,a man pulled down his pants,and masturbated in front of us.,We called people for help, and nobody came.,At 25, when I was walking home one evening,,two men on a motorcycle attacked me.,I spent two nights in the hospital,recovering from trauma and injuries. 
 So throughout my life, I've seen women —,family, friends, colleagues —,live through these experiences,,and they seldom talk about it.,So in simple words, life in India is not easy.,But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear.,I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path,of learning that this fear took me on. 
 So, what happened one night in December 2012,changed my life.,So a young girl, a 23-year-old student,,boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend.,There were six men on the bus, young men,who you might encounter every day in India,,and the chilling account of what followed,was played over and over again,in the Indian and international media.,This girl was raped repeatedly,,forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod,,beaten, bitten, and left to die.,Her friend was gagged, attacked,,and knocked unconscious.,She died on the 29th of December.,And at a time when most of us here,were preparing to welcome the new year,,India plunged into darkness.,For the first time in our history,,men and women in Indian cities,woke up to the horrific truth,about the true state of women in the country.,Now, like many other young women,,I was absolutely terrified.,I couldn't believe that something like this,could happen in a national capital.,I was angry and I was frustrated,,but most of all, I felt utterly, completely helpless.,But really, what do you do, right?,Some write blogs, some ignore it,,some join protests.,I did all of it. In fact, that was what everyone was doing,two years ago.,So the media was filled with stories about,all the horrific deeds,that Indian men are capable of.,They were compared to animals,,sexually repressed beasts.,In fact, so alien and unthinkable was this event,in an Indian mind,that the response from the Indian media,,public and politicians proved one point:,No one knew what to do.,And no one wanted to be responsible for it.,In fact, these were a few insensitive comments,which were made in the media,by prominent people,in response to sexual violencenagainst women in general.,So the first one is made by a member of parliament,,the second one is made by a spiritual leader,,and the third one was actuallynthe defendants' lawyer,when the girl was fighting for her life,and she passed away. 
 Now, as a woman watching this day after day,,I was tired.,So as a writer and gender activist,,I have written extensively on women,,but this time, I realized it was different,,because a part of me realized,I was a part of that young woman too,,and I decided I wanted to change this.,So I did something spontaneous, hasty.,I logged on to a citizen journalism platform,called iReport,,and I recorded a video talking about,what the scene was like in Bangalore.,I talked about how I felt,,I talked about the ground realities,,and I talked about the frustrations of living in India.,In a few hours, the blog was shared widely,,and comments and thoughts poured in,from across the world.,In that moment, a few things occurred to me.,One, technology was always at hand,for many young women like me.,Two, like me, most young women,hardly use it to express their views.,Three, I realized for the first time,that my voice mattered. 
 So in the months that followed,,I covered a trail of events in Bangalore,which had no space in the mainstream news.,In Cubbon Park, which is a big park in Bangalore,,I gathered with over 100 others,when groups of young men came forward,to wear skirts to prove that clothing,does not invite rape.,When I reported about these events,,I felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel,to release all the emotions I had inside me.,I attended the town hall march,when students held up signs saying,"Kill them, hang them.","You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters.",I went to a candlelight vigil,where citizens gathered together,to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,,and I recorded a lot of blogs,in response to how worrying the situation was,in India at that point.,["I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say"] 
 Now, the reactions confused me.,While supportive comments pourednin from across the world,,as did vicious ones.,So some called me a hypocrite.,Some called me a victim, a rape apologist.,Some even said I had a political motive.,But this one comment kind of describes,what we are discussing here today. 
 But I was soon to learn that this was not all.,As empowered as I felt,with the new liberty that this,citizen journalism channel gave me,,I found myself in an unfamiliar situation.,So sometime last August, I logged onto Facebook,and I was looking through my news feed,,and I noticed there was a link,that was being shared by my friends.,I clicked on the link; it led me back,to a report uploaded by an American girl,called Michaela Cross.,The report was titled,,"India: The story you never wanted to hear.",And in this report, she recounted her firsthand,account of facing sexual harassment in India.,She wrote, "There is no way to prepare for the eyes,,the eyes that every day stared,with such entitlement at my body,,with no change of expression,whether I met their gaze or not.,Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's,,I got stares so sharp,that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece.",She called India a traveler'snheaven and a woman's hell.,She said she was stalked, groped,,and masturbated at. 
 Now, late that evening, the report went viral.,It was on news channels across the world.,Everyone was discussing it.,It had over a million views,,a thousand comments and shares,,and I found myself witnessing,a very similar thing.,The media was caught in this vicious cycle,of opinion and outburst,and no outcome whatsoever.,So that night, as I sat wondering,how I should respond,,I found myself filled with doubt.,You see, as a writer, I approached this issue,as an observer,,as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,,and as an activist, I lookednat it as a defender of rights,,but as a citizen journalist,,I suddenly felt very vulnerable.,I mean, here she was, a young woman,who was using a channel to talk about,her experience just as I was,,and yet I felt unsettled.,You see, no one ever tells you,that true empowerment comes from giving yourself,the permission to think and act.,Empowerment is often made to sound as if,it's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.,When we talk about empowerment, we often,talk about giving people access to materials,,giving them access to tools.,But the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.,It's a feeling.,The first step to empowerment,is to give yourself the authority,,the key to independent will,,and for women everywhere,,no matter who we are or where we come from,,that is the most difficult step.,We fear the sound of our own voice,,for it means admission, but it is this that gives us,the power to change our environment.,Now in this situation where I was faced,with so many different kinds of realities,,I was unsure how to judge,,because I didn't know what it would mean for me.,I feared to judge because Indidn't know what it would be,if I didn't support the same view as this girl.,I didn't know what it would mean for me,if I was challenging someone else's truth.,But yet, it was simple.,I had to make a decision:,Should I speak up or should I stay quiet?,So after a lot of thought,,I recorded a video blog in response,,and I told Michaela, well,,there are different sides to India,,and I also tried to explain,that things would be okay,and I expressed my regret for what she had faced.,And a few days later, I was invited to talk,on air with her,,and for the first time, I reached out to this girl,who I had never met, who was so far away,,but yet I felt so close to. 
 Since this report came to light,,more young people than ever,were discussing sexual harassment on the campus,,and the university that Michaela belonged to,gave her the assistance she needed.,The university even took measures,to train its students to equip them,with the skills that they need,to confront challenges such as harassment,,and for the first the time, I felt I wasn't alone.,You see, if there's anything that I've learned,as an active citizen journalist,over the past few years,,it is our dire lack as a society to actively find,avenues where our voices can be heard.,We don't realize that when we are standing up,,we are not just standing up as individuals,,we are standing up for our communities,,our friends, our peers.,Most of us say that women are denied their rights,,but the truth is, oftentimes,,women deny themselves these rights.,In a recent survey in India,,95 percent of the women who work in I.T.,,aviation, hospitality and call centers,,said they didn't feel safe returning home alone,after work in the late hours or in the evening.,In Bangalore, where I come from,,this number is 85 percent.,In rural areas in India,,if anything is to go by the recent,gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha,and Aligarh are supposed to go by,,we need to act really soon. 
 Don't get me wrong,,the challenges that women will face,in telling their stories is real,,but we need to start pursuing,and trying to identify mediums,to participate in our system,and not just pursue the media blindly.,Today, more women than ever,are standing up and questioning,the government in India,,and this is a result of that courage.,There is a sixfold increase in women,reporting harassment,,and the government passed,the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013,to protect women against sexual assault. 
 As I end this talk,,I just want to say,that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets,,but let us speak up.,Let us fight the shame and talk about it.,It could be a platform, a community,,your loved one, whoever or whatever you choose,,but let us speak up.,The truth is, the end to this problem,begins with us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,,in a 1968 speech where he reflectsnupon the Civil Rights Movement,,states, "In the end,,we will remember not the words of our enemies,but the silence of our friends." 
 As a teacher, I've internalized this message.,Every day, all around us,,we see the consequences of silence,manifest themselves in the form of discrimination,,violence, genocide and war.,In the classroom, I challenge my students,to explore the silences in their own lives,through poetry.,We work together to fill those spaces,,to recognize them, to name them,,to understand that they don'tnhave to be sources of shame.,In an effort to create a culture within my classroom,where students feel safe sharing the intimacies,of their own silences,,I have four core principles posted on the board,that sits in the front of my class,,which every student signsnat the beginning of the year:,read critically, write consciously,,speak clearly, tell your truth. 
 And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point,,tell your truth.,And I realized that,if I was going to ask my students to speak up,,I was going to have to tell my truth,and be honest with them about the times,where I failed to do so. 
 So I tell them that growing up,,as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,,during Lent I was always taught,that the most meaningful thing one could do,was to give something up,,sacrifice something you typically indulge in,to prove to God you understand his sanctity.,I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,,French kisses, and everything in between.,But one year, I gave up speaking.,I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice,was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized,that I had given that up a long time ago.,I spent so much of my life,telling people the things they wanted to hear,instead of the things they needed to,,told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience,because I still had to figure out being my own,,so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything,,appeasing ignorance with my silence,,unaware that validation doesn't need words,to endorse its existence.,When Christian was beat up for being gay,,I put my hands in my pocket,and walked with my headndown as if I didn't even notice.,I couldn't use my locker for weeksnbecause the bolt on the lock,reminded me of the one I had put on my lips,when the homeless man on the corner,looked at me with eyes up merely searching,for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.,I was more concerned withntouching the screen on my Apple,than actually feeding him one.,When the woman at the fundraising gala,said "I'm so proud of you.,It must be so hard teachingnthose poor, unintelligent kids,",I bit my lip, because apparentlynwe needed her money,more than my students needed their dignity. 
 We spend so much time,listening to the things people are saying,that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.,Silence is the residue of fear.,It is feeling your flaws,gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.,It is the air retreating from your chest,because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.,Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.,It is what you hear when therenaren't enough body bags left.,It is the sound after the noose is already tied.,It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.,There is no time to pick your battles,when your battles have already picked you. 
 I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.,I will tell Christian that he is a lion,,a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.,I will ask that homeless man what his name is,and how his day was, because sometimes,all people want to be is human.,I will tell that woman that my students can talk about,transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,,and just because you watchednone episode of "The Wire",doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.,So this year,,instead of giving something up,,I will live every day as if there were a microphone,tucked under my tongue,,a stage on the underside of my inhibition.,Because who has to have a soapbox,when all you've ever needed is your voice? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When my first children's book was published,in 2001,,I returned to my old elementary school,to talk to the students about being an author,and an illustrator,,and when I was setting up my slide projector,in the cafetorium,,I looked across the room,,and there she was:,my old lunch lady.,She was still there at the school,and she was busily preparing lunches for the day.,So I approached her to say hello,,and I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?",And she looked at me, and I could tell,that she recognized me,,but she couldn't quite place me,nand she looked at me and she said,,"Stephen Krosoczka?",And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,,but Stephen is my uncle whonis 20 years older than I am,,and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.,And she started telling me about her grandkids,,and that blew my mind.,My lunch lady had grandkids,,and therefore kids,,and therefore left school at the end of the day?,I thought she lived in the cafeteria,with the serving spoons.,I had never thought about any of that before. 
 Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,,and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,,a series of comics about a lunch lady,who uses her fish stick nunchucks,to fight off evil cyborg substitutes,,a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,,and the end of every book,,they get the bad guy with their hairnet,,and they proclaim, "Justice is served!" 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 And it's been amazing, because the series,was so welcomed into the reading lives of children,,and they sent me the most amazing letters,and cards and artwork.,And I would notice as I would visit schools,,the lunch staff would be involved in the programming,in a very meaningful way.,And coast to coast,,all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing:,"Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness.",Because the lunch lady has not been treated,very kindly in popular culture over time.,But it meant the most to Jeannie.,When the books were first published,,I invited her to the book launch party,,and in front of everyone there,,everyone she had fed over the years,,I gave her a piece of artwork and some books.,And two years after this photo was taken,,she passed away,,and I attended her wake,,and nothing could have preparednme for what I saw there,,because next to her casket was this painting,,and her husband told me it meant so much to her,that I had acknowledged her hard work,,I had validated what she did. 
 And that inspired me to create a day,where we could recreate that feeling,in cafeterias across the country:,School Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids,can make creative projects for their lunch staff.,And I partnered with thenSchool Nutrition Association,,and did you know that a little over 30 million kids,participate in school lunch programs every day.,That equals up to a little over five billion lunches,made every school year. 
 And the stories of heroism go well beyond,just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets,on their lunch tray.,There is Ms. Brenda in California,,who keeps a close eye on everynstudent that comes through her line,and then reports back to the guidance counselor,if anything is amiss.,There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky,who realized that 67 percent of their students,relied on those meals every day,,and they were going without food over the summer,,so they retrofitted a school bus,to create a mobile feeding unit,,and they traveled around the neighborhoods,feedings 500 kids a day during the summer. 
 And kids made the most amazing projects.,I knew they would.,Kids made hamburger cards,that were made out of construction paper.,They took photos of their lunch lady's head,and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady,and fixed that to a milk carton,and presented them with flowers.,And they made their own comics,,starring the cartoon lunch lady,alongside their actual lunch ladies.,And they made thank you pizzas,,where every kid signed a different topping,of a construction paper pizza. 
 For me, I was so moved by the response,that came from the lunch ladies,,because one woman said to me, she said,,"Before this day, I felt like I was,at the end of the planet at this school.,I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here.",Another woman said to me,,"You know, what I got out of this,is that what I do is important." 
 And of course what she does is important.,What they all do is important.,They're feeding our children every single day,,and before a child can learn,,their belly needs to be full,,and these women and men,are working on the front lines to create,an educated society. 
 So I hope that,you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day,to say thank you to your lunch staff,,and I hope that you remember,how powerful a thank you can be.,A thank you can change a life.,It changes the life of the person who receives it,,and it changes the life of the person,who expresses it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I suspect that,every aid worker in Africa,comes to a time in her career,when she wants to take all nthe money for her project —,maybe it's a school or a training program —,pack it in a suitcase,,get on a plane flying over thenpoorest villages in the country,,and start throwing that money out the window.,Because to a veteran aid worker,,the idea of putting cold, hard cash,into the hands of the poorest people on Earth,doesn't sound crazy,,it sounds really satisfying. 
 I had that moment right about the 10-year mark,,and luckily, that's also when I learned,that this idea actually exists,,and it might be just what the aid system needs.,Economists call it an unconditional cash transfer,,and it's exactly that: It's cash given,with no strings attached.,Governments in developing countries,have been doing this for decades,,and it's only now, with more evidence,and new technology that it's possible,to make this a model for delivering aid.,It's a pretty simple idea, right? 
 Well, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff,for the poor?,Honestly, I believed that I could do more good,with money for the poor,than the poor could do for themselves.,I held two assumptions:,One, that poor people are poor in part,because they're uneducated and,don't make good choices;,two is that we then need people like me,to figure out what they need and get it to them.,It turns out, the evidence says otherwise.,In recent years, researchers have been studying,what happens when we give poor people cash.,Dozens of studies show across the board,that people use cash transfers,to improve their own lives.,Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food,and give birth to healthier babies.,Sri Lankan men invest in their businesses.,Researchers who studied our work in Kenya,found that people invested in a range of assets,,from livestock to equipment nto home improvements,,and they saw increases in income,from business and farming,one year after the cash was sent.,None of these studies found that people,spend more on drinking or smoking,or that people work less.,In fact, they work more. 
 Now, these are all material needs.,In Vietnam, elderly recipients used,their cash transfers to pay for coffins.,As someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong,,I find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs,deeply humbling.,I don't know if I would have chosen to give food,or equipment or coffins,,which begs the question:,How good are we at allocating resources,on behalf of the poor?,Are we worth the cost?,Again, we can look at empirical evidence,on what happens when we give people stuff,of our choosing.,One very telling study looked at a program in India,that gives livestock to the so-called ultra-poor,,and they found that 30 percent of recipients,had turned around and sold thenlivestock they had been given,for cash.,The real irony is,,for every 100 dollars worth of assets,this program gave someone,,they spent another 99 dollars to do it.,What if, instead, we use technology to put cash,,whether from aid agencies or from any one of us,directly into a poor person's hands.,Today, three in four Kenyans use mobile money,,which is basically a bank account that can run,on any cell phone.,A sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee,and with the click of a button,send money directly to a recipient's account,with no intermediaries.,Like the technologies that are disrupting industries,in our own lives,,payments technology in poor countries,could disrupt aid.,It's spreading so quickly that it's possible,to imagine reaching billions,of the world's poor this way. 
 That's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly.,We're the first organization,dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor.,We've sent cash to 35,000 npeople across rural Kenya,and Uganda,in one-time payments of 1,000 dollars,per family.,So far, we've looked for the poorest people,in the poorest villages, and in this part of the world,,they're the ones living in homes,made of mud and thatch,,not cement and iron.,So let's say that's your family.,We show up at your door with an Android phone.,We'll get your name, take your photo,and a photo of your hut,and grab the GPS coordinates.,That night, we send all the data to the cloud,,and each piece gets checked,by an independent team,using, for one example, satellite images.,Then, we'll come back,,we'll sell you a basic cell phone,if you don't have one already,,and a few weeks later,,we send money to it.,Something that five years ago,would have seemed impossible,we can now do efficiently,and free of corruption. 
 The more cash we give to the poor,,and the more evidence we have that it works,,the more we have to reconsider,everything else we give.,Today, the logic behind aid is too often,,well, we do at least some good.,When we're complacent,with that as our bar,,when we tell ourselves that giving aid,is better than no aid at all,,we tend to invest inefficiently,,in our own ideas that strike us as innovative,,on writing reports,,on plane tickets and SUVs.,What if the logic was,,will we do better than cash given directly?,Organizations would have to prove,that they're doing more good for the poor,than the poor can do for themselves.,Of course, giving cash won't create public goods,like eradicating disease or nbuilding strong institutions,,but it could set a higher bar,for how we help individual families,improve their lives. 
 I believe in aid.,I believe most aid is better than just,throwing money out of a plane.,I am also absolutely certain,that a lot of aid today,isn't better than giving directly to the poor.,I hope that one day, it will be. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've been a critical care EMT for the pastnseven years in Suffolk County, New York.,I've been a first responder in a number of incidents,ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy. 
 If you are like most people, death might be,one of your greatest fears.,Some of us will see it coming.,Some of us won't.,There is a little-known documented medical term,called impending doom.,It's almost a symptom.,As a medical provider, I'm trained to respond,to this symptom like any other,,so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me,and says, "I'm going to die today,",we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition. 
 Throughout my career, I have responded,to a number of incidents where the patient,had minutes left to live,and there was nothing I could do for them.,With this, I was faced with a dilemma:,Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death,,or do I lie to them to comfort them?,Early in my career, I faced this dilemma,by simply lying.,I was afraid.,I was afraid if I told them the truth,,that they would die in terror, in fear,,just grasping for those last moments of life. 
 That all changed with one incident.,Five years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident.,The rider had suffered critical, critical injuries.,As I assessed him, I realized that there was nothing,that could be done for him,,and like so many other cases,nhe looked me in the eye,and asked that question: "Am I going to die?",In that moment, I decided to do something different.,I decided to tell him the truth.,I decided to tell him that he was going to die,and that there was nothing I could do for him.,His reaction shocked me to this day.,He simply laid back and had a look,of acceptance on his face.,He was not met with that terror or fear,that I thought he would be.,He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes,,I saw inner peace and acceptance.,From that moment forward, I decided,it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies.,Having responded to many cases since then,where patients were in their last moments,and there was nothing I could do for them,,in almost every case,,they have all had the same reaction to the truth,,of inner peace and acceptance.,In fact, there are three patterns,I have observed in all these cases. 
 The first pattern always kind of shocked me.,Regardless of religious belief or cultural background,,there's a need for forgiveness.,Whether they call it sin,or they simply say they have a regret,,their guilt is universal.,I had once cared for an elderly gentleman,who was having a massive heart attack.,As I prepared myself and my equipment,for his imminent cardiac arrest,,I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise.,He already knew by my tonenof voice and body language.,As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest,,prepping for what was going to happen,,he looked me in the eye and said,,"I wish I had spent more time withnmy children and grandchildren,instead of being selfish with my time.",Faced with imminent death,,all he wanted was forgiveness. 
 The second pattern I observe,is the need for remembrance.,Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts,or their loved ones', they needed to feel,that they would be living on.,There's a need for immortality,within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones,,myself, my crew, or anyone around.,Countless times, I have had a npatient look me in the eyes,and say, "Will you remember me?" 
 The final pattern I observe,always touched me the deepest, to the soul.,The dying need to know that their life had meaning.,They need to know that they did not waste their life,on meaningless tasks. 
 This came to me very, very early in my career.,I had responded to a call.,There was a female in her late 50s,severely pinned within a vehicle.,She had been t-boned at a high rate of speed,,critical, critical condition.,As the fire department workednto remove her from the car,,I climbed in to begin to render care.,As we talked, she had said to me,,"There was so much morenI wanted to do with my life.",She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth.,As we talked further, it would turn out,that she was a mother of two adopted children,who were both on their way to medical school.,Because of her, two children,had a chance they never would have had otherwise,and would go on to save lives in the medical field,as medical doctors.,It would end up taking 45 minutes,to free her from the vehicle.,However, she perished prior to freeing her. 
 I believed what you saw in the movies:,when you're in those last moments,that it's strictly terror, fear.,I have come to realize,nregardless of the circumstance,,it's generally met with peace and acceptance,,that it's the littlest things, the littlest moments,,the littlest things you brought into the world,that give you peace in those final moments. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So recently,,some white guys and some black women,swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online.,They didn't change their content,,they kept tweeting the same as usual,,but suddenly, the white guys noticed,they were getting called the n-word all the time,and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse,,whereas the black women all of a sudden,noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them. 
 Now, if you're my five-year-old,,your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies,and occasionally fairies riding puppies.,That's a thing. Google it.,But the rest of us know that the Internet,can be a really ugly place.,I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates,that I think are healthy for our democracy.,I'm talking about nasty personal attacks.,Maybe it's happened to you, but it's at least,twice as likely to happen, and be worse,,if you're a woman, a person of color, or gay,,or more than one at the same time.,In fact, just as I was writing this talk,,I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks.,The bio says that I'm a,"man-hater and a bull dyke and the onlynthing I've ever accomplished with my career,is spreading my perverse sexuality.",Which, incidentally, is only a third correct.,I mean, lies! (Laughter) 
 But seriously, we all say we hate this crap.,The question is whether you're willing to make,a personal sacrifice to change it.,I don't mean giving up the Internet.,I mean changing the way you click,,because clicking is a public act.,It's no longer the case,that a few powerful elites control all the media,and the rest of us are just passive receivers.,Increasingly, we're all the media.,I used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up,,I put on a lot of makeup,,I go on television, I talk about the news.,That is a public act of making media.,And then I go home and I browse the web,and I'm reading Twitter,,and that's a private act of consuming media.,I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas.,Wrong.,Everything we blog, everything we Tweet,,and everything we click,is a public act of making media.,We are the new editors.,We decide what gets attention,based on what we give our attention to.,That's how the media works now.,There's all these hidden algorithms that decide,what you see more of and what we all see more of,based on what you click on,,and that in turn shapes our whole culture. 
 Over three out of five Americans think we have,a major incivility problem in our country right now,,but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five,Americans are clicking on the same insult-oriented,,rumor-mongering trash that feeds,the nastiest impulses in our society.,In an increasingly noisy media landscape,,the incentive is to make more noise to be heard,,and that tyranny of the loud,encourages the tyranny of the nasty. 
 It does not have to be that way.,It does not.,We can change the incentive.,For starters, there are two things we can all do.,First, don't just stand by the sidelinesnwhen you see someone getting hurt.,If someone is being abused online, do something.,Be a hero. This is your chance.,Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person.,Drown out the negative with the positive.,And second, we've got to stop clicking,on the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding,linkbait.,If you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian,all the time programming,,you've got to stop clicking on the stories,about Kim Kardashian's sideboob.,I know you do it. (Applause),You too, apparently.,I mean, really, same example:,if you don't like politicians calling each other names,,stop clicking on the stories,about what one guy in one party callednthe other guy in the other party.,Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it.,It makes it worse, the fire spreads.,Our whole culture gets burned. 
 If what gets the most clicks wins,,then we have to start shaping the world we want,with our clicks,,because clicking is a public act.,So click responsibly. Thank you. 
 (Applause)My dream is to build the world's first,underground park in New York City.,Now, why would someone wantnto build an underground park,,and why in New York City? 
 These three tough little buggers,are, on the left, my grandmother, age five,,and then her sister and brother,,ages 11 and nine.,This photo was taken just before they left,from Italy to immigrate to the United States,,just about a century ago.,And like many immigrants at the time,,they arrived on the Lower East Side,in New York City,and they encountered a crazy melting pot.,What was amazing about their generation,was that they were not only building new lives,in this new, unfamiliar area,,but they were also literally building the city.,I've always been fascinated by those decades,and by that history,,and I would often beg my grandmother,to tell me as many stories as possible,about the old New York.,But she would often just shrug it off,,tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,,and so I very rarely got,any of the history that I wanted to hear about. 
 The New York City that I encountered,felt pretty built up.,I always knew as a kid that I wanted,to make a difference, and to somehow,make the world more beautiful, more interesting,and more just.,I just didn't really know how.,At first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,,so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.,But it felt weird to me that I knew more about,local Kenyan politics than thenpolitics of my own hometown.,I took a job with the City of New York,,but very quickly felt frustrated,with the slowness of government bureaucracy.,I even took a job at Google,,where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid,and believed almost wholeheartedly,that technology could solve all social problems.,But I still didn't feel like I wasnmaking the world a better place. 
 It was in 2009 that my friend,and now business partner James Ramsey,alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site,,which is this.,This is the former trolley terminal,that was the depot for passengers,traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge,from Brooklyn to Manhattan,,and it was open between 1908 and 1948,,just around the time when my grandparents were,living right in the area.,And we learned also that the site,was entirely abandoned in 1948.,Fascinated by this discovery,,we begged the authorities to draw us into the space,,and we finally got a tour,,and this is what we saw.,Now, this photo doesn't really do it justice.,It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical,feeling that you have when you get in this space.,It's a football field of unused land,immediately below a very crowded area of the city,,and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones,on an archaeological dig,,and all the details are all still there.,It's really pretty remarkable. 
 Now, the site itself is located at the very heart,of the Lower East Side,,and today it still remains one of the most,crowded neighborhoods in the city.,New York City has two thirds the green space,per resident as other big cities,,and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.,So we immediately started thinking about how we,could take this site and turn it into something,that could be used for the public,,but also could potentially even be green.,Our plan, in a nutshell,,is to draw natural sunlight underground,using a simple system thatnharvests sunlight above the street,,directs it below the city sidewalks,,and would allow plants and trees to grow,with the light that's directed underneath.,With this approach, you could take a site,that looks like this today,and transform it into something,that looks like this. 
 In 2011, we first released some of these images,,and what was funny was,,a lot of people said to us, "Oh, it kind of looks,like the High Line underground.",And so what our nickname ended up becoming,,and what ended up sticking,,was the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.,What was also clear was that people really wanted,to know a lot more about how the technology,would look and feel,,and that there was really much more interest in this,than we had ever thought possible.,So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job,and focus entirely on this project.,Here is us with our team,putting together a technology demonstration,in a warehouse.,Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy,which we built to show the technology.,You can see the six solar collectors at the center there.,And here's the full exhibit all put together,in this warehouse.,You can see the solar canopy overhead,,the light streaming in,,and this entirely live green space below.,So in the course of just a few weeks,,tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,,and since that time, we've grown,our numbers of supporters both locally,and among design enthusiasts all over the world. 
 Here's a rendering of the neighborhood,just immediately above the Line's site,,and a rendering of how it will look,after major redevelopment that is coming,over the course of the next 10 years.,Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels,and how there's really a lack of green space.,So what we're proposing is really something that will,add one football field of green space,underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly,will introduce a really community-driven focus,in a rapidly gentrifying area.,And right now, we're focusing very closely,on how we engage with the City of New York,on really transforming the overall ecosystem,in an integrated way. 
 Here's our rendering of how we would actually,invite people into the space itself.,So here you see this iconic entrance,in which we would literally peel up the street,and reveal the historical layers of the city,,and invite people into this warm underground space.,In the middle of winter, when it'snabsolutely freezing outside,,the last place you'd want to go would be,an outdoor space or outdoor park.,The Lowline would really be a four-season space,and a respite for the city.,So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings,my own family's story full circle.,If my grandparents and my parents were really,focused on building the city up and out,,I think my generation is focused on reclaiming,the spaces that we already have,,rediscovering our shared history,,and reimagining how we can make our communities,more interesting, more beautiful and more just. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)How many times have you usednthe word "awesome" today?,Once? Twice? Seventeen times?,Do you remember what you were describing,when you used the word?,No, I didn't think so, becausenit's come down to this, people:,You're using the word incorrectly,,and tonight I hope to show you,how to put the "awe" back in "awesome." 
 Recently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe,,and the server came up to our table,,and asked us if we had dined there before,,and I said, "Yes, yes, we have.",And she said, "Awesome.",And I thought, "Really?,Awesome or just merely good,that we decided to visit your restaurant again?" 
 The other day, one of my coworkers asked me,if I could save that file as a PDF,,and I said, "Well, of course," and he said, "Awesome.",Seriously, can saving anything as a PDF,be awesome? 
 Sadly, the frequent overuse of the word "awesome",has now replaced words like "great" and "thank you.",So Webster's dictionary defines the word "awesome",as fear mingled with admiration or reverence,,a feeling produced by something majestic.,Now, with that in mind,,was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?,How about that parking space? Was that awesome?,Or that game the other day? Was that awesome?,The answer is no, no and no.,A sandwich can be delicious,,that parking space can be nearby,,and that game can be a blowout,,but not everything can be awesome.,(Laughter) 
 So when you use the word "awesome",to describe the most mundane of things,,you're taking away the very power of the word.,This author says, "Snowy days,or finding money in your pants is awesome.",(Laughter),Um, no, it is not,,and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.n(Laughter) 
 So in other words, if you haveneverything, you value nothing.,It's a lot like drinking from a firehose,like this jackass right here.,There's no dynamic, there's no highs or lows,,if everything is awesome. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, here are 10 things,that are truly awesome. 
 Imagine, if you will, having to schlep,everything on your back.,Wouldn't this be easier for me,if I could roll this home?,Yes, so I think I'll invent the wheel.,The wheel, ladies and gentlemen.,Is the wheel awesome? Say it with me.,Yes, the wheel is awesome! 
 The Great Pyramids were the tallest,man-made structure in the world,for 4,000 years.,Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks,just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone.,Were the Great Pyramids awesome?,Yes, the pyramids were awesome. 
 The Grand Canyon. Come on.,It's almost 80 million years old.,Is the Grand Canyon awesome?,Yes, the Grand Canyon is. 
 Louis Daguerre invented photography in 1829,,and earlier today,,when you whipped out your smartphone,and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich,,and you know who you are —,(Laughter) —,wasn't that easier than exposing the image,to copper plates coated with iodized silver?,I mean, come on. Is photography awesome?,Yes, photography is awesome. 
 D-Day, June 6, 1944,,the Allied invasion of Normandy,,the largest amphibious invasion in world history.,Was D-Day awesome? Yes, it was awesome. 
 Did you eat food today? Did you eat?,Then you can thank the honeybee, that's the one,,because if crops aren't pollinated, we can't grow food,,and then we're all going to die.,It's just like that.,But it's not like a flower can just get up,and have sex with another flower,,although that would be awesome.,(Laughter),Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me? 
 Landing on the moon! Come on!,Apollo 11. Are you kidding me?,Sixty-six years after the Wright Brothers,took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,,Neil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away.,That's like from here to the moon.,(Laughter),That's one small step for a man,,one giant leap for awesome!,You're damn right, it was. 
 Woodstock, 1969: Rolling Stone Magazine said,this changed the history of rock and roll.,Tickets were only 24 dollars back then.,You can't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now.,Jimi Hendrix's version of "The Star-Spangled Banner",was the most iconic.,Was Woodstock awesome? Yes, it was awesome. 
 Sharks! They're at the top of the food chain.,Sharks have multiple rows of teeth,that grow in their jaw,and they move forward like a conveyor belt.,Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime.,Does awesome inspire fear?,Oh, hell yeah, sharks are awesome! 
 The Internet was born in 1982,and it instantly took over global communication,,and later tonight, when all these PowerPoints,are uplifted to the Internet,so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk,and watch this crap,,the Internet is awesome. 
 And finally, finally some of you can't wait,to come up and tell me hownawesome my PowerPoint was.,I will save you the time.,It was not awesome, but it was true,,and I hope it was entertaining,,and out of all the audiences I've ever had,,y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night. 
 (Applause)Oliver was an extremely dashing,,handsome, charming and largely unstable male,that I completely lost my heart to. 
 (Laughter) 
 He was a Bernese mountain dog,,and my ex-husband and I adopted him,,and about six months in,,we realized that he was a mess.,He had such paralyzing separation anxiety,that we couldn't leave him alone.,Once, he jumped out of our third floor apartment.,He ate fabric. He ate things, recyclables.,He hunted flies that didn't exist.,He suffered from hallucinations.,He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder,and that's really just the tip of the iceberg. 
 But like with humans,,sometimes it's six months in,before you realize that,the person that you love has some issues.,(Laughter),And most of us do not take the person we're dating,back to the bar where we met them,or give them back to the friend that introduced us,,or sign them back up on Match.com.,(Laughter),We love them anyway,,and we stick to it,,and that is what I did with my dog.,And I was a — I'd studied biology.,I have a Ph.D. in history of science,from MIT,,and had you asked me 10 years ago,if a dog I loved, or just dogs generally,,had emotions, I would have said yes,,but I'm not sure that I would have told you,that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder,,a Prozac prescription and a therapist.,But then, I fell in love, and I realized that they can,,and actually trying to help my own dog,overcome his panic and his anxiety,,it just changed my life.,It cracked open my world.,And I spent the last seven years, actually,,looking into this topic ofnmental illness in other animals.,Can they be mentally ill like people,,and if so, what does it mean about us?,And what I discovered is that I do believe,they can suffer from mental illness,,and actually looking and tryingnto identify mental illness in them,often helps us be better friends to them,and also can help us better understand ourselves. 
 So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute.,Many of us think that we can't know,what another animal is thinking,,and that is true,,but any of you in relationships —,at least this is my case —,just because you ask someone that you're with,or your parent or your child how they feel,doesn't mean that they can tell you.,They may not have words to explain,what it is that they're feeling,,and they may not know.,It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon,that we feel that we have to talk to someone,to understand their emotional distress.,Before the early 20th century,,physicians often diagnosed emotional distress,in their patients just by observation.,It also turns out that thinking about,mental illness in other animals,isn't actually that much of a stretch.,Most mental disorders in the United States,are fear and anxiety disorders,,and when you think about it, fear and anxiety,are actually really extremelynhelpful animal emotions.,Usually we feel fear and anxietynin situations that are dangerous,,and once we feel them,,we then are motivated to move away,from whatever is dangerous.,The problem is when we begin to feel fearnand anxiety in situations that don't call for it.,Mood disorders, too, may actually just be,the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal,,and obsessive compulsive disorders also,are often manifestations ofna really healthy animal thing,which is keeping yourself clean and groomed.,This tips into the territory of mental illness,when you do things like,compulsively over-wash your hands or paws,,or you develop a ritual that's so extreme,that you can't sit down to a bowl of food,unless you engage in that ritual. 
 So for humans, we have then"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,",which is basically an atlas,of the currently agreed-upon mental disorders.,In other animals, we have YouTube.,(Laughter),This is just one search I did for "OCD dog",but I encourage all of you,to look at "OCD cat.",You will be shocked by what you see.,I'm going to show you just a couple examples.,This is an example of shadow-chasing.,I know, and it's funny and in some ways it's cute.,The issue, though, is that dogsncan develop compulsions like this,that they then engage in all day.,So they won't go for a walk,,they won't hang out with their friends,,they won't eat.,They'll develop fixations,like chasing their tails compulsively. 
 Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo.,He looks like he's on a stakeout,but he does this for many, many, many hours a day.,He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw,at the screen.,This is another example of what's considered,a stereotypic behavior.,This is a sun bear at thenOakland Zoo named Ting Ting.,And if you just sort of happened upon this scene,,you might think that Ting Ting,is just playing with a stick,,but Ting Ting does this all day,,and if you pay close attention,and if I showed you guysnthe full half-hour of this clip,,you'd see that he does the exact same thing,in the exact same order, and he spins the stick,in the exact same way every time.,Other super common behaviors that you may see,,particularly in captive animals,,are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies,,and actually, humans do this too,,and in us, we'll sway,,we'll move from side to side.,Many of us do this, and sometimes,it's an effort to soothe ourselves,,and I think in other animalsnthat is often the case too. 
 But it's not just stereotypic behaviors,that other animals engage in.,This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives,at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.,She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist,,and she's been treated for a mood disorder,among other things.,Many animals develop mood disorders.,Lots of creatures —,this horse is just one example —,develop self-destructive behaviors.,They'll gnaw on things,or do other things that may also soothe them,,even if they're self-destructive,,which could be considered similar,to the ways that some humans cut themselves. 
 Plucking.,Turns out, if you have fur or feathers or skin,,you can pluck yourself compulsively,,and some parrots actually have been studied,to better understand trichotillomania,nor compulsive plucking in humans,,something that affects,20 million Americans right now.,Lab rats pluck themselves too.,In them, it's called barbering.,Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan,are coming back with what'snconsidered canine PTSD,,and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life,when they come back from deployments.,They can be too scared tonapproach men with beards,or to hop into cars. 
 I want to be careful and be clear, though.,I do not think that canine PTSD,is the same as human PTSD.,But I also do not think that my PTSD,is like your PTSD,,or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours.,We are all different.,We also all have very different susceptibilities.,So two dogs, raised in the same household,,exposed to the very same things,,one may develop, say, andebilitating fear of motorcycles,,or a phobia of the beep of the microwave,,and another one is going to be just fine. 
 So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently:,Is this just an instance of humans,driving other animals crazy?,Or, is animal mental illness justna result of mistreatment or abuse?,And it turns out we're actually,so much more complicated than that. 
 So one great thing that has happened to me,is recently I published a book on this,,and every day now that I open my email,or when I go to a reading,or even when I go to a cocktail party,,people tell me their stories,of the animals that they have met.,And recently, I did a reading in California,,and a woman raised her handnafter the talk and she said,,"Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD." 
 And I said, "Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it." 
 So, Ping is her cat. She was a rescue,,and she used to live with an elderly man,,and one day the man was vacuuming,and he suffered a heart attack, and he died.,A week later, Ping was discovered in the apartment,alongside the body of her owner,,and the vacuum had been running the entire time.,For many months, up to I thinkntwo years after that incident,,she was so scared she couldn't be innthe house when anyone was cleaning.,She was quite literally a scaredy cat.,She would hide in the closet.,She was un-self-confident and shaky,,but with the loving support of her family,,a lot of a time, and their patience,,now, three years later,,she's actually a happy, confident cat. 
 Another story of trauma andnrecovery that I came across,was actually a few years ago.,I was in Thailand to do some research.,I met a monkey named Boonlua,,and when Boonlua was a baby,,he was attacked by a pack of dogs,,and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm,,and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery,,where the monks took him in.,They called in a veterinarian,nwho treated his wounds.,Eventually, Boonlua wound up,at an elephant facility,,and the keepers really decidednto take him under their wing,,and they figured out what he liked,,which, it turned out, was mint Mentos,and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs.,But they worried, because henwas social, that he was lonely,,and they didn't want to putnhim in with another monkey,,because they thought with just one arm,,he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play.,And so they gave him a rabbit,,and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey.,He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit.,They groomed each other,nthey become close friends,,and then the rabbit had bunnies,,and Boonlua was even happier than he was before,,and it had in a way given him,a reason to wake up in the morning,,and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up,that he decided not to sleep.,He became extremely protective of these bunnies,,and he stopped sleeping,,and he would sort of nod off,while trying to take care of them.,In fact, he was so protective and so affectionate,with these babies that the sanctuary,eventually had to take them away from him,because he was so protective, he was worried,that their mother might hurt them.,So after they were taken away, the sanctuary staff,worried that he would fall into a depression,,and so to avoid that,,they gave him another rabbit friend.,(Laughter),My official opinion is thatnhe does not look depressed.,(Laughter) 
 So one thing that I would really like people to feel,is that you really should feel empowered,to make some assumptions,about the creatures that you know well.,So when it comes to your dog,or your cat or maybe your one-armed monkey,that you happen to know,,if you think that they are traumatized or depressed,,you're probably right.,This is extremely anthropomorphic,,or the assignation of human characteristics,onto non-human animals or things.,I don't think, though, that that's a problem.,I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize.,It's not as if you can take yournhuman brain out of your head,and put it in a jar and then use it,to think about another animal thinking.,We will always be one animal wondering,about the emotional experience of another animal. 
 So then the choice becomes, howndo you anthropomorphize well?,Or do you anthropomorphize poorly?,And anthropomorphizing poorly,is all too common.,(Laughter),It may include dressing your corgisnup and throwing them a wedding,,or getting too close to exotic wildlife because,you believe that you had a spiritual connection.,There's all manner of things.,Anthropomorphizing well, however, I believe is based,on accepting our animalnsimilarities with other species,and using them to make assumptions,that are informed about other nanimals' minds and experiences,,and there's actually an entire industry,that is in some ways basednon anthropomorphizing well,,and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry. 
 One in five Americans is currentlyntaking a psychopharmaceutical drug,,from the antidepressantsnand antianxiety medications,to the antipsychotics.,It turns out that we owe this,entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal,to other animals.,These drugs were tested in non-human animals first,,and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects.,The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine,first relaxed rats before it relaxed people.,The antianxiety medication Librium,was given to cats selected forntheir meanness in the 1950s,and made them into peaceable felines.,And even antidepressantsnwere first tested in rabbits. 
 Today, however, we are not just giving these drugs,to other animals as test subjects,,but they're giving them these drugs as patients,,both in ethical and much less ethical ways.,SeaWorld gives mother orcasnantianxiety medications,when their calves are taken away.,Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics,and antianxiety medications.,But dogs like my own Oliver,are given antidepressants andnsome antianxiety medications,to keep them from jumping out of buildings,or jumping into traffic.,Just recently, actually, a study came out in "Science",that showed that even crawdads,responded to antianxiety medication.,It made them braver, less skittish,,and more likely to explore their environment. 
 It's hard to know how manynanimals are on these drugs,,but I can tell you that thenanimal pharmaceutical industry,is immense and growing,,from seven billion dollars in 2011,to a projected 9.25 billion by the year 2015. 
 Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely.,Others, like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee,at the zoo there was on them,until he started to save his Paxil prescription,and then distribute it among the other bonobos.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 More than psychopharmaceuticals, though,,there are many, many, many other,therapeutic interventions that help other creatures.,And here is a place where I think actually,that veterinary medicine can teach something,to human medicine,,which is, if you take your dog, who is, say,,compulsively chasing his tail,,into the veterinary behaviorist,,their first action isn't to reachnfor the prescription pad;,it's to ask you about your dog's life.,They want to know how often your dog gets outside.,They want to know how muchnexercise your dog is getting.,They want to know how much social time,with other dogs and other humans.,They want to talk to younabout what sorts of therapies,,largely behavior therapies,,you've tried with that animal.,Those are the things thatnoften tend to help the most,,especially when combined withnpsychopharmaceuticals. 
 The thing, though, I believe, that helps the most,,particularly with social animals,,is time with other social animals.,In many ways, I feel like I became a service animal,to my own dog,,and I have seen parrots do it for people,and people do it for parrots,and dogs do it for elephants,and elephants do it for other elephants.,I don't know about you;,I get a lot of Internet forwards,of unlikely animal friendships.,I also think it's a huge part of Facebook,,the monkey that adopts the cat,or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn,,or the cow that makes friends with the pig,,and had you asked me eight,nnine years ago, about these,,I would have told you that theynwere hopelessly sentimental,and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way,and maybe even staged, and what I can tell you now,is that there is actually something to this.,This is legit. In fact, some interesting studies,have pointed to oxytocin levels,,which are a kind of bonding hormone,that we release when we're having sex or nursing,or around someone that we care for extremely,,oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs,who care about each other,or who enjoy each other's company,,and beyond that, other studies show that oxytocin,raised even in other pairs of animals,,so, say, in goats and dogs who werenfriends and played with each other,,their levels spiked afterwards. 
 I have a friend who really showed me that,mental health is in fact a two-way street.,His name is Lonnie Hodge,nand he's a veteran of Vietnam.,When he returned, he started working,with survivors of genocide and a lot of people,who had gone through war trauma.,And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights,,because in Vietnam, he had been,rappelling backwards out of helicopters,over the skids,,and he was givena service dognnamed Gander, a labradoodle,,to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights.,This is them actually on the first day that they met,,which is amazing, and since then,,they've spent a lot of time together,visiting with other veteransnsuffering from similar issues.,But what's so interesting to me aboutnLonnie and Gander's relationship,is about a few months in,,Gander actually developed a fear of heights,,probably because he wasnwatching Lonnie so closely.,What's pretty great about this, though,nis that he's still a fantastic service dog,,because now, when they're both at a great height,,Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well-being,that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself. 
 Since I've spent so much time with these stories,,digging into archives,,I literally spent years doing this research,,and it's changed me.,I no longer look at animals at the species level.,I look at them as individuals,,and I think about them as creatures,with their own individual weather systems,guiding their behavior and informing,how they respond to the world.,And I really believe that this has made me,a more curious and a more empathetic person,,both to the animals that share my bed,and occasionally wind up on my plate,,but also to the people that I know,who are suffering from anxiety,and from phobias and all manner of other things,,and I really do believe that,even though you can't know exactly,what's going on in the mind of a pig,or your pug or your partner,,that that shouldn't stop younfrom empathizing with them.,The best thing that we could do for our loved ones,is, perhaps, to anthropomorphize them. 
 Charles Darwin's father once told him,that everybody could lose their mind at some point.,Thankfully, we can often find them again,,but only with each other's help. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I came here to show you,the Fotokite.,It's a tethered, flying camera.,But before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about,where it came from, what motivated it. 
 So I was born in Russia,,and three years ago, in 2011,,there were the Russian federal elections.,There were massive irregularities reported,,and people came out to protest,,which was very unlikely for Russia.,And no one really knew,how significant these protests were,,because, for whatever reason,,the world media largely ignored it.,Now, there was a group of photographers,who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby —,usually photographing things like the Sphinx,,the Pyramids — who happened to be,right around the corner, and they flew a camera,and they took some snapshots,,some panoramas of this demonstration.,Just completely independent entity,,completely random occurrence,,and the image, when I saw it, it really struck me.,Here's one of the panoramas.,So in a single image,,you can really see the scale of this event —,just the number of people,,the colors, the banners.,You just can't consider this insignificant.,All in a single image, which was really cool to me. 
 And I think, in the future,,journalism and many other professions,,there are flying cameras alreadynquite commonly out there,,but I think, you wait a few months, a few years,,and for many professions, it's really going to be,a requirement. 
 And it make sense. It's nsuch a unique perspective.,Nothing really communicates nthis scale, for example,,in context, in a way that this does.,But there are a few hurdles, nand they are quite basic,and quite fundamental. 
 One is piloting.,So for this image, they flew a camera,,a five kilogram device with an SLR under it.,It's quite heavy, lots of nspinning, sharp things.,It's a bit uncomfortable to fly,,probably also for the operator.,In fact, you can see that on the nback of the pilot's shirt, it says,,"No questions until landing",in Russian and in English,,because people are curious, and they'll go tap you,,and then you lose your focus and things happen.,And these guys are great. They're professionals;,they're really careful in what they do.,So in the protests, maybe you noticed,,they flew over the river so it was quite safe.,But this doesn't necessarily apply to,all people and all conditions,,so we really have to make piloting easier. 
 The other problem is regulations,,or rather, the lack of good regulation.,For many good reasons, it's just difficult,to come up with common sense laws,to regulate flying cameras.,So we already have cameras.,Everyone here, I'm sure, has ansmartphone with a camera, right?,There are more and more of them.,You hear about people withnGoogle Glass being attacked.,You hear about, actually, a drone pilot,,a hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago,because he was flying near a beach.,Here's some personal input I didn't expect.,Just yesterday, I was attacked by a guy,who claimed that I was filming him.,I was checking my email right here —,easy way to get input for your talk.,But I think there are better solutions.,I think we have to defuse the situation.,We have to come up with responsible solutions,that address the privacy issues,and the safety, accountability issues,but still give us that perspective. 
 And this is one potential solution.,So this is the Fotokite.,Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter,,but what's kind of special nabout it is there's a leash.,It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.,And the neat thing about it is,,to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.,You just turn it on,and you point in the direction that you want to fly.,You give it a little twist.,That's kind of the way you communicate.,And there it goes. 
 (Applause) 
 So the interaction is super simple.,It's like a personal flying pet.,It just always maintains a certain angle to you,,and if I move around with it,,it'll actually follow me naturally.,And of course, we can build on top of this.,So this leash has some additional electronics.,You can turn it on.,And now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower,,if you have such a dog. So, I can press a button,and manipulate it rather easily.,So I just shifted its position. 
 And it's really safe.,I don't know about you guys in the front row —,(Laughter) — but at least in principle,,you have to agree that you feel safer,because there is a physical connection.,Live demos are hard, right?,Things go wrong all the time.,But no matter what,,this thing will actually prevent this thing,from going into you.,What's more, it tells you immediately that,I am the one responsible for this device.,You don't have to look for someone controlling it. 
 Now, I can tell you that it's easy a lot,,but I think a really good way to prove that,is to grab a second one,and launch it.,And if I can do this on stage live,,then I can show each and every one of you,in five minutes how to noperate one of these devices. 
 So now we have two eyes in the sky. (Applause),And now the trick is getting them back.,(Laughter) 
 So my question now to you is,,well, it's a nice solution,,it's very accessible, it's safe.,What would you use it for?,What would you use such a camera for in your life? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You probably don't know me,,but I am one of those .01 percenters,that you hear about and read about,,and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.,And tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly,to other plutocrats, to my people,,because it feels like it's time for us all,to have a chat.,Like most plutocrats, I too am a proud,and unapologetic capitalist.,I have founded, cofounded or funded,over 30 companies across a range of industries.,I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.,I cofounded a company called aQuantive,that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.,My friends and I, we own a bank.,I tell you this — (Laughter) —,unbelievable, right? 
 I tell you this to show,that my life is like most plutocrats.,I have a broad perspective on capitalism,and business,,and I have been rewarded obscenely for that,with a life that most of you all,can't even imagine:,multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,,etc., etc., etc.,But let's be honest: I am not thensmartest person you've ever met.,I am certainly not the hardest working.,I was a mediocre student.,I'm not technical at all.,I can't write a word of code.,Truly, my success is the consequence,of spectacular luck,,of birth, of circumstance and of timing.,But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.,One, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,,and the other is I have a good sense,,a good intuition about what will happen in the future,,and I think that that intuition about the future,is the essence of good entrepreneurship. 
 So what do I see in our future today,,you ask?,I see pitchforks,,as in angry mobs with pitchforks,,because while people like us plutocrats,are living beyond the dreams of avarice,,the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens,are falling farther and farther behind.,In 1980, the top one percent of Americans,shared about eight percent of national [income],,while the bottom 50 percent of Americans,shared 18 percent.,Thirty years later, today, the top one percent,shares over 20 percent of national [income],,while the bottom 50 percent of Americans,share 12 or 13.,If the trend continues,,the top one percent will share,over 30 percent of national [income],in another 30 years,,while the bottom 50 percent of Americans,will share just six. 
 You see, the problem isn't that we have,some inequality.,Some inequality is necessary,for a high-functioning capitalist democracy.,The problem is that inequality,is at historic highs today,and it's getting worse every day.,And if wealth, power, and income,continue to concentrate,at the very tippy top,,our society will change,from a capitalist democracy,to a neo-feudalist rentier society,like 18th-century France.,That was France,before the revolution,and the mobs with the pitchforks. 
 So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats,and zillionaires,and for anyone who lives,in a gated bubble world:,Wake up.,Wake up. It cannot last.,Because if we do not do something,to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,,the pitchforks will come for us,,for no free and open society can long sustain,this kind of rising economic inequality.,It has never happened. There are no examples.,You show me a highly unequal society,,and I will show you a police state,or an uprising.,The pitchforks will come for us,if we do not address this.,It's not a matter of if, it's when.,And it will be terrible when they come,for everyone,,but particularly for people like us plutocrats. 
 I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.,I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument,that economic inequality is wrong.,What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality,is stupid and ultimately self-defeating.,Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks,from pitchforks,,but it's also terrible for business too.,So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.,When Ford famously introduced the $5 day,,which was twice the prevailing wage at the time,,he didn't just increase the productivity,of his factories,,he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor,into a thriving middle class who could now afford,to buy the products that they made.,Ford intuited what we now know is true,,that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem,and characterized by the same kinds,of feedback loops you find,in a natural ecosystem,,a feedback loop between customers and businesses.,Raising wages increases demand,,which increases hiring,,which in turn increases wages,and demand and profits,,and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity,is precisely what is missing,from today's economic recovery. 
 And this is why we need to put behind us,the trickle-down policies that so dominate,both political parties,and embrace something I call middle-out economics.,Middle-out economics rejects,the neoclassical economic idea,that economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,,that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,,and instead embraces the 21st-century idea,that economies are complex, adaptive,,ecosystemic,,that they tend away fromnequilibrium and toward inequality,,that they're not efficient at all,but are effective if well managed.,This 21st-century perspective,allows you to clearly see that capitalism,does not work by [efficiently] allocating,existing resources.,It works by [efficiently] creating new solutions,to human problems.,The genius of capitalism,is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.,It rewards people for solvingnother people's problems.,The difference between a poor society,and a rich society, obviously,,is the degree to which that society,has generated solutions in the form,of products for its citizens.,The sum of the solutions,that we have in our society,really is our prosperity, and this explains,why companies like Google and Amazon,and Microsoft and Apple,and the entrepreneurs who created those companies,have contributed so much,to our nation's prosperity. 
 This 21st-century perspective,also makes clear,that what we think of as economic growth,is best understood as,the rate at which we solve problems.,But that rate is totally dependent upon,how many problem solvers —,diverse, able problem solvers — we have,,and thus how many of our fellow citizens,actively participate,,both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,,and as customers who consume them.,But this maximizing participation thing,doesn't happen by accident.,It doesn't happen by itself.,It requires effort and investment,,which is why all,highly prosperous capitalist democracies,are characterized by massive investments,in the middle class and the infrastructure,that they depend on. 
 We plutocrats need to get this,trickle-down economics thing behind us,,this idea that the better we do,,the better everyone else will do.,It's not true. How could it be?,I earn 1,000 times the median wage,,but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,,do I?,I actually bought two pairs of these pants,,what my partner Mike calls,my manager pants.,I could have bought 2,000 pairs,,but what would I do with them? (Laughter),How many haircuts can I get?,How often can I go out to dinner?,No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,,we can never drive a great national economy.,Only a thriving middle class can do that.,There's nothing to be done,,my plutocrat friends might say.,Henry Ford was in a different time.,Maybe we can't do some things.,Maybe we can do some things.,June 19, 2013,,Bloomberg published an article I wrote called,"The Capitalist’s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage.",The good people at Forbes magazine,,among my biggest admirers,,called it "Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal.",And yet, just 350 days,after that article was published,,Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law,an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle,to 15 dollars an hour,,more than double,what the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.,How did this happen,,reasonable people might ask.,It happened because a group of us,reminded the middle class,that they are the source,of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.,We reminded them that whennworkers have more money,,businesses have more customers,,and need more employees.,We reminded them that when businesses,pay workers a living wage,,taxpayers are relieved of the burden,of funding the poverty programs,like food stamps and medical assistance,and rent assistance,that those workers need.,We reminded them that low-wage workers,make terrible taxpayers,,and that when you raise the minimum wage,for all businesses,,all businesses benefit,yet all can compete. 
 Now the orthodox reaction, of course,,is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?,Your politician's always echoing,that trickle-down idea by saying things like,,"Well, if you raise the price of employment,,guess what happens? You get less of it." 
 Are you sure?,Because there's some contravening evidence.,Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country,have gone from about 30 times the median wage,to 500 times.,That's raising the price of employment.,And yet, to my knowledge,,I have never seen a company,outsource its CEO's job, automate their job,,export the job to China.,In fact, we appear to be employing,more CEOs and senior managers than ever before.,So too for technology workers,and financial services workers,,who earn multiples of the median wage,and yet we employ more and more of them,,so clearly you can raise the price of employment,and get more of it. 
 I know that most people,think that the $15 minimum wage,is this insane, risky economic experiment.,We disagree.,We believe that the $15 minimum wage,in Seattle,is actually the continuation,of a logical economic policy.,It is allowing our city,to kick your city's ass.,Because, you see,,Washington state already has,the highest minimum wage,of any state in the nation.,We pay all workers $9.32,,which is almost 30 percent more,than the federal minimum of 7.25,,but crucially, 427 percent more,than the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.,If trickle-down thinkers were right,,then Washington state shouldnhave massive unemployment.,Seattle should be sliding into the ocean.,And yet, Seattle,is the fastest-growing big city in the country.,Washington state is generating small business jobs,at a higher rate than any other major state,in the nation.,The restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.,Why? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,,when workers have more money,,businesses have more customers,and need more workers.,When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough,so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,,that's not bad for the restaurant business.,That's good for it,,despite what some restaurateurs may tell you. 
 Is it more complicated than I'm making out?,Of course it is.,There are a lot of dynamics at play.,But can we please stop insisting,that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,,unemployment will skyrocket,and the economy will collapse?,There is no evidence for it.,The most insidious thing,about trickle-down economics,is not the claim that if the rich get richer,,everyone is better off.,It is the claim made by those who oppose,any increase in the minimum wage,that if the poor get richer,,that will be bad for the economy.,This is nonsense.,So can we please dispense with this rhetoric,that says that rich guys like me,and my plutocrat friends,made our country?,We plutocrats know,,even if we don't like to admit it in public,,that if we had been born somewhere else,,not here in the United States,,we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot,by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.,It's not that they don't have goodnentrepreneurs in other places,,even very, very poor places.,It's just that that's all,that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford. 
 So here's an idea for a new kind of economics,,a new kind of politics,that I call new capitalism.,Let's acknowledge that capitalism,beats the alternatives,,but also that the more people we include,,both as entrepreneurs and as customers,,the better it works.,Let's by all means shrink the size of government,,but not by slashing the poverty programs,,but by ensuring that workers are paid enough,so that they actually don't need those programs.,Let's invest enough in the middle class,to make our economy fairer and more inclusive,,and by fairer, more truly competitive,,and by more truly competitive,,more able to generate the solutions,to human problems,that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.,Capitalism is the greatest social technology,ever invented,for creating prosperity in human societies,,if it is well managed,,but capitalism, because of the fundamental,multiplicative dynamics of complex systems,,tends towards, inexorably, inequality,,concentration and collapse.,The work of democracies,is to maximize the inclusion of the many,in order to create prosperity,,not to enable the few to accumulate money.,Government does create prosperity and growth,,by creating the conditions that allow,both entrepreneurs and their customers,to thrive.,Balancing the power of capitalists like me,and workers isn't bad for capitalism.,It's essential to it.,Programs like a reasonable minimum wage,,affordable healthcare,,paid sick leave,,and the progressive taxation necessary,to pay for the important infrastructure,necessary for the middle class like education, R and D,,these are indispensable tools,shrewd capitalists should embrace,to drive growth, because no one benefits from it,like us. 
 Many economists would have you believe,that their field is an objective science.,I disagree, and I think that it is equally,a tool that humans use,to enforce and encode,our social and moral preferences and prejudices,about status and power,,which is why plutocrats like me,have always needed to find persuasive stories,to tell everyone else,about why our relative positions,are morally righteous and good for everyone:,like, we are indispensable, the job creators,,and you are not;,like, tax cuts for us create growth,,but investments in you,will balloon our debt,and bankrupt our great country;,that we matter;,that you don't.,For thousands of years, these stories were called,divine right.,Today, we have trickle-down economics.,How obviously, transparently self-serving,all of this is.,We plutocrats need to see,that the United States of America made us,,not the other way around;,that a thriving middle class is the source,of prosperity in capitalist economies,,not a consequence of it.,And we should never forget,that even the best of us innthe worst of circumstances,are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. 
 Fellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us,to recommit to our country,,to commit to a new kind of capitalism,which is both more inclusive and more effective,,a capitalism that will ensure,that America's economy remains,the most dynamic and prosperous in the world.,Let's secure the future for ourselves,,our children and their children.,Or alternatively, we could do nothing,,hide in our gated communities,and private schools,,enjoy our planes and yachts,— they're fun —,and wait for the pitchforks. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)For over a decade as a doctor,,I've cared for homeless veterans,,for working-class families.,I've cared for people who nlive and work in conditions,that can be hard, if not harsh,,and that work has led me to believe,that we need a fundamentally different way,of looking at healthcare.,We simply need a healthcare system,that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms,that bring people into clinics,,but instead actually is able to look,and improve health where it begins.,And where health begins,is not in the four walls of a doctor's office,,but where we live,and where we work,,where we eat, sleep, learn and play,,where we spend the majority of our lives. 
 So what does this different napproach to healthcare look like,,an approach that can improve health where it begins?,To illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.,Veronica was the 17th patient,out of my 26-patient day,at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.,She came into our clinic with a chronic headache.,This headache had been going on,for a number of years, and this particular episode,was very, very troubling.,In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us,for the first time, she went to an nemergency room in Los Angeles.,The emergency room doctors said,,"We've run some tests, Veronica.,The results are normal, sonhere's some pain medication,,and follow up with a primary care doctor,,but if the pain persists or if it worsens,,then come on back." 
 Veronica followed those standard instructions,and she went back.,She went back not just once, but twice more.,In the three weeks before Veronica met us,,she went to the emergency room three times.,She went back and forth,,in and out of hospitals and clinics,,just like she had done in years past,,trying to seek relief but still coming up short.,Veronica came to our clinic,,and despite all these encountersnwith healthcare professionals,,Veronica was still sick. 
 When she came to our clinic, though, nwe tried a different approach.,Our approach started with our medical assistant,,someone who had a GED-level training,but knew the community.,Our medical assistant asked some routine questions.,She asked, "What's your chief complaint?","Headache.","Let's get your vital signs" —,measure your blood pressure and your heart rate,,but let's also ask something equally as vital,to Veronica and a lot of patients like her,in South Los Angeles.,"Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?,Specifically, about your housing conditions?,Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?,Do you have roaches in your home?",Turns out, Veronica said yesnto three of those things:,roaches, water leaks, mold.,I received that chart in hand, reviewed it,,and I turned the handle on the door,and I entered the room. 
 You should understand that Veronica,,like a lot of patients that I haventhe privilege of caring for,,is a dignified person, a formidable presence,,a personality that's larger than life,,but here she was,doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.,Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.,She lifted her head up,,and I saw her face, said hello,,and then I immediately noticed something,across the bridge of her nose,,a crease in her skin.,In medicine, we call that crease the allergic salute.,It's usually seen among childrennwho have chronic allergies.,It comes from chronically rubbingnone's nose up and down,,trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms,,and yet, here was Veronica, a grown woman,,with the same telltale sign of allergies.,A few minutes later, in askingnVeronica some questions,,and examining her and listening to her,,I said, "Veronica, I think I know what you have.,I think you have chronic allergies,,and I think you have migrainenheadaches and some sinus congestion,,and I think all of those are nrelated to where you live.",She looked a little bit relieved,,because for the first time, she had a diagnosis,,but I said, "Veronica, now let'sntalk about your treatment.,We're going to order somenmedications for your symptoms,,but I also want to refer you tona specialist, if that's okay." 
 Now, specialists are a little hard to find,in South Central Los Angeles,,so she gave me this look, like, "Really?",And I said, "Veronica, actually,nthe specialist I'm talking about,is someone I call a community health worker,,someone who, if it's okay with you,,can come to your home,and try to understand what's going on,with those water leaks and that mold,,trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,,and if required, that specialist might refer you,to another specialist that wencall a public interest lawyer,,because it might be that your landlord,isn't making the fixes he's required to make." 
 Veronica came back in a few months later.,She agreed to all of those treatment plans.,She told us that her symptomsnhad improved by 90 percent.,She was spending more time at work,and with her family and less time,shuttling back and forth betweennthe emergency rooms of Los Angeles.,Veronica had improved remarkably.,Her sons, one of whom had asthma,,were no longer as sick as they used to be.,She had gotten better, and not coincidentally,,Veronica's home was better too. 
 What was it about this different approach we tried,that led to better care,,fewer visits to the E.R., better health?,Well, quite simply, it started with that question:,"Veronica, where do you live?",But more importantly, it was that we put in place,a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions,to Veronica and hundreds more like her,about the conditions that mattered,in her community, about where health,,and unfortunately sometimes illness, do begin,in places like South L.A.,In that community, substandard housing,and food insecurity are the major conditions,that we as a clinic had to be aware of,,but in other communities it could be,transportation barriers, obesity,,access to parks, gun violence. 
 The important thing is, we put in place a system,that worked,,and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.,It's a term many of you are familiar with.,It comes from a parable that's very common,in the public health community.,This is a parable of three friends.,Imagine that you're one of these three friends,who come to a river.,It's a beautiful scene, but it'snshattered by the cries of a child,,and actually several children,nin need of rescue in the water.,So you do hopefully what everybody would do.,You jump right in along with your friends.,The first friend says, I'm going to rescue those,who are about to drown,,those at most risk of falling over the waterfall.,The second friends says,nI'm going to build a raft.,I'm going to make sure that fewer people,need to end up at the waterfall's edge.,Let's usher more people to safety,by building this raft,,coordinating those branches together.,Over time, they're successful, but not really,,as much as they want to be.,More people slip through, and they finally look up,and they see that their third friend,is nowhere to be seen.,They finally spot her.,She's in the water. She's swimming away from them,upstream, rescuing children as she goes,,and they shout to her, "Where are you going?,There are children here to save.",And she says back,,"I'm going to find out,who or what is throwing these children in the water.",In healthcare, we have that first friend —,we have the specialist,,we have the trauma surgeon, the ICU nurse,,the E.R. doctors.,We have those people that are vital rescuers,,people you want to be therenwhen you're in dire straits.,We also know that we have the second friend —,we have that raft-builder.,That's the primary care clinician,,people on the care team who are there,to manage your chronic conditions,,your diabetes, your hypertension,,there to give you your annual checkups,,there to make sure your vaccines are up to date,,but also there to make sure that you have,a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.,But while that's also vital and very necessary,,what we're missing is that third friend.,We don't have enough of that upstreamist.,The upstreamists are the health care professionals,who know that health does begin,where we live and work and play,,but beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize,the resources to create the system,in their clinics and in their hospitals,that really does start to approach that,,to connect people to the resources they need,outside the four walls of the clinic. 
 Now you might ask, and it's na very obvious question,that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask:,"Doctors and nurses thinkingnabout transportation and housing?,Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures,and just make sure we focus on the task at hand?",Certainly, rescuing people at the water's edge,is important enough work.,Who has the time?,I would argue, though, that if wenwere to use science as our guide,,that we would find an upstreamnapproach is absolutely necessary.,Scientists now know that,the living and working conditions that we all,are part of,have more than twice the impact on our health,than does our genetic code,,and living and working conditions,,the structures of our environments,,the ways in which our social fabric is woven together,,and the impact those have on our behaviors,,all together, those have more than five times,the impact on our health,than do all the pills and procedures,administered by doctors and hospitals combined.,All together, living and working conditions,account for 60 percent of preventable death. 
 Let me give you an example of what this feels like.,Let's say there was a company, a tech startup,that came to you and said, "We have a great product.,It's going to lower your risknof death from heart disease.",Now, you might be likely to invest,if that product was a drug or a device,,but what if that product was a park?,A study in the U.K.,,a landmark study that reviewed the records,of over 40 million residents in the U.K.,,looked at several variables,,controlled for a lot of factors, and found that,when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,,one's exposure to greennspace was a powerful influence.,The closer you were to green space,,to parks and trees,,the lower your chance of heart disease,,and that stayed true for rich and for poor.,That study illustrates what my friends in public health,often say these days:,that one's zip code matters more,than your genetic code.,We're also learning that zip code,is actually shaping our genetic code.,The science of epigenetics looksnat those molecular mechanisms,,those intricate ways in whichnour DNA is literally shaped,,genes turned on and off,based on the exposures to the environment,,to where we live and to where we work.,So it's clear that these factors,,these upstream issues, do matter.,They matter to our health,,and therefore our healthcare professionalsnshould do something about it.,And yet, Veronica asked me,perhaps the most compelling question,I've been asked in a long time.,In that follow-up visit, she said,,"Why did none of my doctors,ask about my home before?,In those visits to the emergency room,,I had two CAT scans,,I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back,to collect spinal fluid,,I had nearly a dozen blood tests.,I went back and forth, I sawnall sorts of people in healthcare,,and no one asked about my home." 
 The honest answer is that in healthcare,,we often treat symptoms without addressing,the conditions that make you sick in the first place.,And there are many reasons for that, but the big three,are first, we don't pay for that.,In healthcare, we often pay nfor volume and not value.,We pay doctors and hospitals usually,for the number of services they provide,,but not necessarily on how healthy they make you.,That leads to a second phenomenon that I call,the "don't ask, don't tell" approach,to upstream issues in healthcare.,We don't ask about where younlive and where you work,,because if there's a problem there,,we don't know what to tell you.,It's not that doctors don't knownthese are important issues.,In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,,over 1,000 physicians,,80 percent of them actually said that,they know that their patients' upstream problems,are as important as their health issues,,as their medical problems,,and yet despite that widespread awareness,of the importance of upstream issues,,only one in five doctors said they had,any sense of confidence to address those issues,,to improve health where it begins.,There's this gap between knowing,that patients' lives, the contextnof where they live and work,,matters, and the ability to do something about it,in the systems in which we work. 
 This is a huge problem right now,,because it leads them to this next question, which is,,whose responsibility is it?,And that brings me to that third point,,that third answer to Veronica's compelling question.,Part of the reason that we have this conundrum,is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists,in the healthcare system.,There are not nearly enough of that third friend,,that person who is going to find out,who or what is throwing those kids in the water.,Now, there are many upstreamists,,and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,,in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country,and around the world,,and it's important to note that upstreamists,sometimes are doctors, but they need not be.,They can be nurses, other clinicians,,care managers, social workers.,It's not so important what specific degree,upstreamists have at the end of their name.,What's more important is that they all seem,to share the same ability to implement a process,that transforms their assistance,,transforms the way they practice medicine.,That process is a quite simple process.,It's one, two and three.,First, they sit down and they say,,let's identify the clinical problem,among a certain set of patients.,Let's say, for instance,,let's try to help children,who are bouncing in and out of the hospital,with asthma.,After identifying the problem, they nthen move on to that second step,,and they say, let's identify the root cause.,Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,,usually says, well, let's look at your genes,,let's look at how you're behaving.,Maybe you're not eating healthy enough.,Eat healthier.,It's a pretty simplistic,approach to root cause analyses.,It turns out, it doesn't really work,when we just limit ourselves that worldview.,The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings,to the table is to say, let's look at the living,and the working conditions in your life.,Perhaps, for children with asthma,,it's what's happening in their home,,or perhaps they live close to anfreeway with major air pollution,that triggers their asthma.,And perhaps that's what we shouldnmobilize our resources to address,,because that third element,nthat third part of the process,,is that next critical part of what upstreamists do.,They mobilize the resources to create a solution,,both within the clinical system,,and then by bringing in people from public health,,from other sectors, lawyers,,whoever is willing to play ball,,let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,,to take those patients whonactually have clinical problems,and address their root causes together,by linking them to the resources you need.,It's clear to me that there are so many stories,of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.,The problem is that there's just notnnearly enough of them out there.,By some estimates, we need one upstreamist,for every 20 to 30 cliniciansnin the healthcare system.,In the U.S., for instance, that would mean,that we need 25,000 upstreamists,by the year 2020.,But we only have a few thousand upstreamistsnout there right now, by all accounts,,and that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I,said, you know what, we need to train,and make more upstreamists. 
 So we decided to start an organization,called Health Begins,,and Health Begins simply does that:,We train upstreamists.,And there are a lot of measuresnthat we use for our success,,but the main thing that we're interested in,is making sure that we're changing,the sense of confidence,,that "don't ask, don't tell" metric among clinicians.,We're trying to make sure that clinicians,,and therefore their systems that they work in,have the ability, the confidence,to address the problems in the living,and working conditions in our lives.,We're seeing nearly a tripling,of that confidence in our work. 
 It's remarkable,,but I'll tell you the most compelling part,of what it means to be working,with upstreamists to gather them together.,What is most compelling is that every day,,every week, I hear stories just like Veronica's.,There are stories out there of Veronica,and many more like her,,people who are coming to the healthcare system,and getting a glimpse of what it feels like,to be part of something that works,,a health care system that stopsnbouncing you back and forth,but actually improves your health,,listens to you who you are,,addresses the context of your life,,whether you're rich or poor or middle class. 
 These stories are compelling because,not only do they tell us that we're this close,to getting the healthcare system that we want,,but that there's somethingnthat we can all do to get there.,Doctors and nurses can get better at asking,about the context of patients' lives,,not simply because it's better bedside manner,,but frankly, because it's a better standard of care.,Healthcare systems and payers,can start to bring in public health agencies,and departments and say,,let's look at our data together.,Let's see if we can discover some patternsnin our data about our patients' lives,and see if we can identify an upstream cause,,and then, as importantly, can we align the resources,to be able to address them?,Medical schools, nursing schools,,all sorts of health professional education programs,can help by training thennext generation of upstreamists.,We can also make sure that these schools,certify a backbone of the upstream approach,,and that's the community health worker.,We need many more of themnin the healthcare system,if we're truly going to have it be effective,,to move from a sickcare system,to a healthcare system.,But finally, and perhaps most importantly,,what do we do? What do we do as patients?,We can start by simply going to our doctors,and our nurses, to our clinics,,and asking, "Is there something in where I live,and where I work that I should be aware of?",Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,,and more importantly, if there are barriers,that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you,and I'm saying I think have a problem with,my apartment or at my workplace,or I don't have access to transportation,,or there's a park that's way too far,,so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice,to go and jog,,if those problems exist,,then doctor, are you willing to listen?,And what can we do together,to improve my health where it begins? 
 If we're all able to do this work,,doctors and healthcare systems,,payers, and all of us together,,we'll realize something about health.,Health is not just a personalnresponsibility or phenomenon.,Health is a common good.,It comes from our personal investment in knowing,that our lives matter,,the context of where we live and where we work,,eat, and sleep, matter,,and that what we do for ourselves,,we also should do for those,whose living and working conditions,again, can be hard, if not harsh.,We can all invest in making sure that we improve,the allocation of resources upstream,,but at the same time work together,and show that we can move healthcare,upstream.,We can improve health where it begins. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a lifelong traveler.,Even as a little kid,,I was actually working outnthat it would be cheaper,to go to boarding school in England,than just to the best school down the roadnfrom my parents' house in California.,So, from the time I was nine years old,I was flying alone several times a year,over the North Pole, just to go to school.,And of course the more I flewnthe more I came to love to fly,,so the very week after I graduatednfrom high school,,I got a job mopping tables,so that I could spendnevery season of my 18th year,on a different continent.,And then, almost inevitably,nI became a travel writer,so my job and my joy could become one.,And I really began to feelnthat if you were lucky enough,to walk aroundnthe candlelit temples of Tibet,or to wander along the seafronts in Havana,with music passing all around you,,you could bring those sounds nand the high cobalt skies,and the flash of the blue ocean,back to your friends at home,,and really bring some magic,and clarity to your own life.,Except, as you all know,,one of the first things you learnnwhen you travel,is that nowhere is magicalnunless you can bring the right eyes to it.,You take an angry man to the Himalayas,,he just starts complaining about the food.,And I found that the best way,that I could develop more attentivenand more appreciative eyes,was, oddly,,by going nowhere, just by sitting still.,And of course sitting stillnis how many of us get,what we most crave and neednin our accelerated lives, a break.,But it was also the only way,that I could find to sift throughnthe slideshow of my experience,and make sense of the future and the past.,And so, to my great surprise,,I found that going nowhere,was at least as excitingnas going to Tibet or to Cuba.,And by going nowhere,nI mean nothing more intimidating,than taking a few minutes out of every day,or a few days out of every season,,or even, as some people do,,a few years out of a life,in order to sit still long enough,to find out what moves you most,,to recall where your truest happiness lies,and to remember that sometimes,making a living and making a life,point in opposite directions. 
 And of course, this is what wise beingsnthrough the centuries,from every tradition have been telling us.,It's an old idea.,More than 2,000 years ago, nthe Stoics were reminding us,it's not our experiencenthat makes our lives,,it's what we do with it.,Imagine a hurricane suddenly nsweeps through your town,and reduces every last thing to rubble.,One man is traumatized for life.,But another, maybe even his brother,nalmost feels liberated,,and decides this is a great chancento start his life anew.,It's exactly the same event,,but radically different responses.,There is nothing either good or bad,nas Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,",but thinking makes it so.,And this has certainly beennmy experience as a traveler.,Twenty-four years ago I took nthe most mind-bending trip,across North Korea.,But the trip lasted a few days.,What I've done with it sitting still,ngoing back to it in my head,,trying to understand it,nfinding a place for it in my thinking,,that's lasted 24 years already,and will probably last a lifetime.,The trip, in other words,ngave me some amazing sights,,but it's only sitting still,that allows me to turn thoseninto lasting insights.,And I sometimes thinknthat so much of our life,takes place inside our heads,,in memory or imaginationnor interpretation or speculation,,that if I really want to change my life,I might best begin by changing my mind.,Again, none of this is new;,that's why Shakespeare and the Stoicsnwere telling us this centuries ago,,but Shakespeare never had to facen200 emails in a day.,(Laughter),The Stoics, as far as I know,nwere not on Facebook.,We all know that in our on-demand lives,,one of the things that's most on demand,is ourselves.,Wherever we are, any time of night or day,,our bosses, junk-mailers,nour parents can get to us.,Sociologists have actually foundnthat in recent years,Americans are working fewer hoursnthan 50 years ago,,but we feel as if we're working more.,We have more and more time-saving devices,,but sometimes, it seems,nless and less time.,We can more and more easily nmake contact with people,on the furthest corners of the planet,,but sometimes in that process,we lose contact with ourselves.,And one of my biggest surprises nas a traveler,has been to findnthat often it's exactly the people,who have most enabled us to get anywhere,who are intent on going nowhere.,In other words, precisely those beings,who have created the technologies,that override so manynof the limits of old,,are the ones wisestnabout the need for limits,,even when it comes to technology.,I once went to the Google headquarters,and I saw all the thingsnmany of you have heard about;,the indoor tree houses, the trampolines,,workers at that time enjoying 20 percentnof their paid time free,so that they could just letntheir imaginations go wandering.,But what impressed me even more,was that as I was waitingnfor my digital I.D.,,one Googler was telling menabout the program,that he was about to startnto teach the many, many Googlers,who practice yoganto become trainers in it,,and the other Googler was telling menabout the book that he was about to write,on the inner search engine,,and the ways in which sciencenhas empirically shown,that sitting still, or meditation,,can lead not just to better nhealth or to clearer thinking,,but even to emotional intelligence.,I have another friend in Silicon Valley,who is really one nof the most eloquent spokesmen,for the latest technologies,,and in fact was one of the foundersnof Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.,And Kevin wrote his last booknon fresh technologies,without a smartphonenor a laptop or a TV in his home.,And like many in Silicon Valley,,he tries really hard to observe,what they call an Internet sabbath,,whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week,they go completely offline,in order to gather the sense of direction,and proportion they'll need nwhen they go online again.,The one thing perhapsnthat technology hasn't always given us,is a sense of how to makenthe wisest use of technology.,And when you speak of the sabbath,,look at the Ten Commandments --,there's only one word therenfor which the adjective "holy" is used,,and that's the Sabbath.,I pick up the Jewish holy booknof the Torah --,its longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.,And we all know that it's reallynone of our greatest luxuries,,the empty space.,In many a piece of music, nit's the pause or the rest,that gives the piecenits beauty and its shape.,And I know I as a writer,will often try to includena lot of empty space on the page,so that the reader can completenmy thoughts and sentences,and so that her imaginationnhas room to breathe. 
 Now, in the physical domain, nof course, many people,,if they have the resources,,will try to get a place in the country,na second home.,I've never begun to have those resources,,but I sometimes remembernthat any time I want,,I can get a second home in time,nif not in space,,just by taking a day off.,And it's never easy because, of course, nwhenever I do I spend much of it,worried about all the extra stuff,that's going to crash down on menthe following day.,I sometimes think I'd rather give upnmeat or sex or wine,than the chance to check on my emails.,(Laughter),And every season I do try to takenthree days off on retreat,but a part of me still feels guiltynto be leaving my poor wife behind,and to be ignoringnall those seemingly urgent emails,from my bosses,and maybe to be missingna friend's birthday party.,But as soon as I getnto a place of real quiet,,I realize that it's only by going there,that I'll have anything freshnor creative or joyful to share,with my wife or bosses or friends.,Otherwise, really,,I'm just foisting on themnmy exhaustion or my distractedness,,which is no blessing at all. 
 And so when I was 29,,I decided to remake my entire life,in the light of going nowhere.,One evening I was coming backnfrom the office,,it was after midnight, I was in a taxindriving through Times Square,,and I suddenly realizednthat I was racing around so much,I could never catch up with my life.,And my life then, as it happened,,was pretty much the onenI might have dreamed of as a little boy.,I had really interesting friendsnand colleagues,,I had a nice apartmentnon Park Avenue and 20th Street.,I had, to me, a fascinating job nwriting about world affairs,,but I could never separate myselfnenough from them,to hear myself think --,or really, to understandnif I was truly happy.,And so, I abandoned my dream life,for a single room on the backstreetsnof Kyoto, Japan,,which was the placenthat had long exerted a strong,,really mysterious gravitational pull on me.,Even as a child,I would just look at a paintingnof Kyoto and feel I recognized it;,I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.,But it's also, as you all know,,a beautiful city encircled by hills,,filled with more than 2,000 templesnand shrines,,where people have been sitting stillnfor 800 years or more.,And quite soon after I moved there,nI ended up where I still am,with my wife, formerly our kids,,in a two-room apartmentnin the middle of nowhere,where we have no bicycle, no car,,no TV I can understand,,and I still have to support my loved ones,as a travel writer and a journalist,,so clearly this is not idealnfor job advancement,or for cultural excitement,or for social diversion.,But I realized that it gives menwhat I prize most,,which is days,and hours.,I have never once had to usena cell phone there.,I almost never have to look at the time,,and every morning when I wake up,,really the day stretches in front of me,like an open meadow.,And when life throws upnone of its nasty surprises,,as it will, more than once,,when a doctor comes into my room,wearing a grave expression,,or a car suddenly veersnin front of mine on the freeway,,I know, in my bones,,that it's the time I've spentngoing nowhere,that is going to sustain me much more,than all the time I've spentnracing around to Bhutan or Easter Island. 
 I'll always be a traveler --,my livelihood depends on it --,but one of the beauties of travel,is that it allows you to bring stillness,into the motion and the commotionnof the world.,I once got on a planenin Frankfurt, Germany,,and a young German woman ncame down and sat next to me,and engaged menin a very friendly conversation,for about 30 minutes,,and then she just turned around,and sat still for 12 hours.,She didn't once turn on her video monitor,,she never pulled out a book,nshe didn't even go to sleep,,she just sat still,,and something of her clarity and calmnreally imparted itself to me.,I've noticed more and more peoplentaking conscious measures these days,to try to open up a spaceninside their lives.,Some people go to black-hole resorts,where they'll spend hundredsnof dollars a night,in order to hand overntheir cell phone and their laptop,to the front desk on arrival.,Some people I know,njust before they go to sleep,,instead of scrolling throughntheir messages,or checking out YouTube,,just turn out the lightsnand listen to some music,,and notice that they sleep much better,and wake up much refreshed.,I was once fortunate enough,to drive into the high, dark mountainsnbehind Los Angeles,,where the great poet and singer,and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen,was living and working for many yearsnas a full-time monk,in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.,And I wasn't entirely surprised,when the record that he releasednat the age of 77,,to which he gave the deliberately nunsexy title of "Old Ideas,",went to number one in the charts nin 17 nations in the world,,hit the top five in nine others.,Something in us, I think, is crying out,for the sense of intimacy and depthnthat we get from people like that.,who take the timenand trouble to sit still.,And I think manynof us have the sensation,,I certainly do,,that we're standing about two inches awaynfrom a huge screen,,and it's noisy and it's crowded,and it's changing with every second,,and that screen is our lives.,And it's only by stepping back,nand then further back,,and holding still,,that we can begin to seenwhat the canvas means,and to catch the larger picture.,And a few people do that for usnby going nowhere. 
 So, in an age of acceleration,,nothing can be more exhilaratingnthan going slow.,And in an age of distraction,,nothing is so luxuriousnas paying attention.,And in an age of constant movement,,nothing is so urgent as sitting still.,So you can go on your next vacation,to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;,I bet you'll have a wonderful time.,But, if you want to come back homenalive and full of fresh hope,,in love with the world,,I think you might wantnto try considering going nowhere.,Thank you.,(Applause)Thank you.,I have only got 18 minutes,to explain something nthat lasts for hours and days,,so I'd better get started.,Let's start with a clipnfrom Al Jazeera's Listening Post. 
 Richard Gizbert: Norway is a country that ngets relatively little media coverage.,Even the elections this past weeknpassed without much drama.,And that's the Norwegiannmedia in a nutshell:,not much drama.,A few years back,,Norway's public TV channel NRK,decided to broadcast live coveragenof a seven-hour train ride --,seven hours of simple footage,,a train rolling down the tracks.,Norwegians, more than a million of themnaccording to the ratings, loved it.,A new kind of reality TV show was born,,and it goes against all the rulesnof TV engagement.,There is no story line, no script,,no drama, no climax,,and it's called Slow TV.,For the past two months,,Norwegians have been watching na cruise ship's journey up the coast,,and there's a lot of fog on that coast.,Executives at Norway'snNational Broadcasting Service,are now considering broadcastingna night of knitting nationwide.,On the surface, it sounds boring,,because it is,,but something about this TV experiment,has gripped Norwegians.,So we sent the Listening Post'snMarcela Pizarro to Oslo,to find out what it is,nbut first a warning:,Viewers may find some of the imagesnin the following report disappointing.,(Laughter) 
 Thomas Hellum: And then followsnan eight-minute story on Al Jazeera,about some strangenTV programs in little Norway.,Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?,We have to go back to 2009,,when one of my colleaguesngot a great idea.,Where do you get your ideas?,In the lunchroom.,So he said, why don't we makena radio program,marking the day of the German invasionnof Norway in 1940.,We tell the story at the exact timenduring the night.,Wow. Brilliant idea, except,this was just a couple of weeksnbefore the invasion day.,So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed,what other storiesncan you tell as they evolve?,What other things take a really long time? 
 So one of us came up with a train.,The Bergen Railway had its n100-year anniversary that year,It goes from western Norwaynto eastern Norway,,and it takes exactly the same timenas it did 40 years ago,,over seven hours. (Laughter),So we caught our commissioning editors nin Oslo, and we said,,we want to make a documentarynabout the Bergen Railway,,and we want to make it in full length,,and the answer was,,"Yes, but how long will the program be?","Oh," we said, "full length.","Yes, but we mean the program.",And back and forth. 
 Luckily for us, they met us with laughter,nvery, very good laughter,,so one bright day in September,,we started a program that we thoughtnshould be seven hours and four minutes.,Actually, it turned outnto be seven hours and 14 minutes,due to a signal failurenat the last station.,We had four cameras,,three of them pointing outnto the beautiful nature.,Some talking to the guests,nsome information.,(Video) Train announcement: nWe will arrive at Haugastøl Station.,TH: And that's about it,,but of course, also,the 160 tunnels gave us the opportunitynto do some archives.,Narrator [in Norwegian]: Then a bit ofnflirting while the food is digested.,The last downhill stretchnbefore we reach our destination.,We pass Mjølfjell Station.,Then a new tunnel.,(Laughter),TH: And now we thought, yes,nwe have a brilliant program.,It will fit for the 2,000ntrain spotters in Norway.,We brought it on air in November 2009.,But no, this was far more attractive.,This is the five biggest TV channelsnin Norway on a normal Friday,,and if you look at NRK2 over here,,look what happened when they put onnthe Bergen Railway show:,1.2 million Norwegiansnwatched part of this program.,(Applause),And another funny thing:,When the host on our main channel,,after they have got news for you,,she said, "And on our second channel,,the train has nownnearly reached Myrdal station.",Thousands of peoplenjust jumped on the train,on our second channel like this.n(Laughter),This was also a huge successnin terms of social media.,It was so nice to see all the thousandsnof Facebook and Twitter users,discussing the same view,,talking to each other as if they werenon the same train together.,And especially, I like this one.nIt's a 76-year-old man.,He's watched all the program,,and at the end station, he rises upnto pick up what he thinks is his luggage,,and his head hit the curtain rod,,and he realized he isnin his own living room.,(Applause) 
 So that's strong and living TV.,Four hundred and thirty-sixnminute by minute on a Friday night,,and during that first night,,the first Twitter message came:nWhy be a chicken?,Why stop at 436nwhen you can expand that,to 8,040, minute by minute,,and do the iconic journey in Norway,,the coastal ship journey Hurtigrutennfrom Bergen to Kirkenes,,almost 3,000 kilometers,ncovering most of our coast.,It has 120-year-old,nvery interesting history,,and literally takes part in lifenand death along the coast.,So just a week after the Bergen Railway,,we called the Hurtigruten companynand we started planning for our next show. 
 We wanted to do something different.,The Bergen Railway was a recorded program.,So when we sat in our editing room,,we watched this picture --nit's all Ål Station --,we saw this journalist.,We had called him, we had spoken to him,,and when we left the station,,he took this picture of usnand he waved to the camera,,and we thought,,what if more people knewnthat we were on board that train?,Would more people show up?,What would it look like?,So we decided our next project,nit should be live.,We wanted this picture of us on the fjordnand on the screen at the same time. 
 So this is not the first timenNRK had been on board a ship.,This is back in 1964,,when the technical managersnhave suits and ties,and NRK rolled all its equipmentnon board a ship,,and 200 meters out of the shore,ntransmitting the signal back,,and in the machine room,nthey talked to the machine guy,,and on the deck, they havensplendid entertainment.,So being on a ship, nit's not the first time.,But five and a half days in a row,nand live, we wanted some help.,And we asked our viewers out there,nwhat do you want to see?,What do you want us to film?nHow do you want this to look?,Do you want us to make a website?nWhat do you want on it?,And we got some answersnfrom you out there,,and it helped us a very lotnto build the program.,So in June 2011,,23 of us went on boardnthe Hurtigruten coastal ship,and we set off.,(Music) 
 I have some really strong memoriesnfrom that week, and it's all about people.,This guy, for instance,,he's head of researchnat the University in Tromsø,(Laughter),And I will show you a piece of cloth,,this one.,It's the other strong memory.,It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.,And it's people like those twonwho took a firm grip of our program,,and together with thousandsnof others along the route,,they made the program what it became.,They made all the stories.,This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.,It says, "I will be a littlenlate for school tomorrow.",He was supposed to benin the school at 8 a.m.,He came at 9 a.m., and he didn'tnget a note from his teacher,,because the teachernhad watched the program.,(Laughter) 
 How did we do this?,Yes, we took a conference roomnon board the Hurtigruten.,We turned it intona complete TV control room.,We made it all work, of course,,and then we took along 11 cameras.,This is one of them.,This is my sketch from February,,and when you give this sketchnto professional people,in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,,you get some cool stuff back.,And with some very creative solutions. 
 (Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]: nRun it up and down.,This is Norway's mostnimportant drill right now.,It regulates the height of a bowncamera in NRK's live production,,one of 11 that capturengreat shots from the MS Nord-Norge.,Eight wires keep the camera stable.,Cameraman: I work non different camera solutions.,They're just toolsnused in a different context. 
 TH: Another camera is this one.nIt's normally used for sports.,It made it possible for us to takenclose-up pictures of people,100 kilomteres away,,like this one. (Laughter),People called us and asked,nhow is this man doing?,He's doing fine. Everything went well.,We also could take pictures ofnpeople waving at us,,people along the route,nthousands of them,,and they all had a phone in their hand.,And when you take a picture of them,nand they get the message,,"Now we are on TV, dad,"nthey start waving back.,This was waving TV nfor five and a half days,,and people get so extremely happy,when they can send a warm messagento their loved ones. 
 It was also a great successnon social media.,On the last day, we metnHer Majesty the Queen of Norway,,and Twitter couldn't quite handle it.,And we also, on the web,,during this week we streamednmore than 100 years of video,to 148 nations,,and the websites are still therenand they will be forever, actually,,because Hurtigruten was selected,to be part of the NorwegiannUNESCO list of documents,,and it's also innthe Guinness Book of Records,as the longest documentary ever.,(Applause),Thank you. 
 But it's a long program,,so some watched part of it,nlike the Prime Minister.,Some watched a little bit more.,It says, "I haven't usednmy bed for five days.",And he's 82 years old,nand he hardly slept.,He kept watching becausensomething might happen,,though it probably won't. (Laughter),This is the numbernof viewers along the route.,You can see the famous Trollfjord,and a day after, all-time high for NRK2.,If you see the four biggestnchannels in Norway during June 2011,,they will look like this,,and as a TV producer, it's a pleasurento put Hurtigruten on top of it.,It looks like this:,3.2 million Norwegiansnwatched part of this program,,and we are only five million here.,Even the passengers on boardnthe Hurtigruten coastal ship --,(Laughter) --,they chose to watched the tellyninstead of turning 90 degrees,and watching out the window. 
 So we were allowed to be npart of people's living room,with this strange TV program,,with music, nature, people.,And Slow TV was now a buzzword,,and we started looking for other thingsnwe could make Slow TV about.,So we could either take something longnand make it a topic,,like with the railway and the Hurtigruten,,or we could take a topic and make it long.,This is the last project.nIt's the peep show.,It's 14 hours of birdwatchingnon a TV screen,,actually 87 days on the web.,We have made 18 hoursnof live salmon fishing.,It actually took three hoursnbefore we got the first fish,,and that's quite slow.,We have made 12 hours of boat rideninto the beautiful Telemark Canal,,and we have made another train ridenwith the northern railway,,and because this we couldn't do live,nwe did it in four seasons,just to give the viewernanother experience on the way. 
 So our next project got usnsome attention outside Norway.,This is from the Colbert Reportnon Comedy Central. 
 (Video) Stephen Colbert: I've got my eyenon a wildly popular program from Norway,called "National Firewood Night,",which consisted of mostly people in parkasnchatting and chopping in the woods,,and then eight hours of a fire nburning in a fireplace. (Laughter),It destroyed the other ntop Norwegian shows,,like "So You ThinknYou Can Watch Paint Dry",and "The Amazing Glacier Race.",And get this, almost 20 percentnof the Norwegian population tuned in,,20 percent. 
 TH: So, when wood fire and wood choppingncan be that interesting,,why not knitting?,So on our next project,,we used more than eight hoursnto go live from a sheep to a sweater,,and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,,he liked that. 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Jimmy Kimmel: Even the peoplenon the show are falling asleep,,and after all that,nthe knitters actually failed,to break the world record.,They did not succeed,,but remember the old Norwegian saying,,it's not whether you winnor lose that counts.,In fact, nothing counts, nand death is coming for us all.,(Laughter) 
 TH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?,This is so completely differentnto other TV programming.,We take the viewer on a journeynthat happens right now in real time,,and the viewer gets the feelingnof actually being there,,actually being on the train, on the boat,,and knitting together with others,,and the reason I thinknwhy they're doing that,is because we don't edit the timeline.,It's important thatnwe don't edit the timeline,,and it's also importantnthat what we make Slow TV about,is something that we all can relate to,nthat the viewer can relate to,,and that somehow has na root in our culture.,This is a picture from last summer,when we traveled the coastnagain for seven weeks.,And of course this is a lot of planning,nthis is a lot of logistics.,So this is the working plannfor 150 people last summer,,but more important is what you don't plan.,You don't plan what's going to happen.,You have to justntake your cameras with you.,It's like a sports event.,You rig them and you see what's happening.,So this is actuallynthe whole running order,for Hurtigruten, 134 hours,njust written on one page.,We didn't know anything morenwhen we left Bergen. 
 So you have to let the viewersnmake the stories themselves,,and I'll give you an example of that.,This is from last summer,,and as a TV producer,,it's a nice picture, but nownyou can cut to the next one.,But this is Slow TV,,so you have to keep this picture until nit really starts hurting your stomach,,and then you keep it a little bit longer,,and when you keep it that long,,I'm sure some of you nownhave noticed the cow.,Some of you have seen the flag.,Some of you start wondering,nis the farmer at home?,Has he left? Is he watching the cow?,And where is that cow going?,So my point is, the longernyou keep a picture like this,,and we kept it for 10 minutes,,you start makingnthe stories in your own head.,That's Slow TV. 
 So we think that Slow TV isnone nice way of telling a TV story,,and we think that wencan continue doing it,,not too often, once or twice a year,nso we keep the feeling of an event,,and we also think thatnthe good Slow TV idea,,that's the idea when people say,,"Oh no, you can't put that on TV.",When people smile, it might bena very good slow idea,,so after all, life is bestnwhen it's a bit strange. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I haven't told many people this,,but in my head, I've got,thousands of secret worlds all going on,all at the same time.,I am also autistic. 
 People tend to diagnose autism,with really specific ncheck-box descriptions,,but in reality, it's a wholenvariation as to what we're like.,For instance, my little brother,,he's very severely autistic.,He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all.,But I love to talk.,People often associate autism,with liking maths and nscience and nothing else,,but I know so many autistic people,who love being creative.,But that is a stereotype,,and the stereotypes of things,are often, if not always, wrong.,For instance, a lot of people,think autism and think n"Rain Man" immediately.,That's the common belief,,that every single autistic nperson is Dustin Hoffman,,and that's not true. 
 But that's not just with nautistic people, either.,I've seen it with LGBTQ people,,with women, with POC people.,People are so afraid of variety,that they try to fit everything ninto a tiny little box,with really specific labels.,This is something that actually,happened to me in real life:,I googled "autistic people are ...",and it comes up with suggestions,as to what you're going to type.,I googled "autistic people are ...",and the top result was "demons.",That is the first thing that people think,when they think autism.,They know.,(Laughter) 
 One of the things I can do nbecause I'm autistic —,it's an ability rather than a disability —,is I've got a very, very vivid imagination.,Let me explain it to you a bit.,It's like I'm walking in two nworlds most of the time.,There's the real world, nthe world that we all share,,and there's the world in my mind,,and the world in my mind nis often so much more real,than the real world.,Like, it's very easy for nme to let my mind loose,because I don't try and fit nmyself into a tiny little box.,That's one of the best nthings about being autistic.,You don't have the urge to do that.,You find what you want to do,,you find a way to do it, nand you get on with it.,If I was trying to fit myself into a box,,I wouldn't be here, I nwouldn't have achieved,half the things that I have now.,There are problems, though.,There are problems with being autistic,,and there are problems withnhaving too much imagination.,School can be a problem in general,,but having also to explain to a teacher,on a daily basis,that their lesson is inexplicably dull,and you are secretly taking refuge,in a world inside your head in nwhich you are not in that lesson,,that adds to your list of problems.,(Laughter),Also, when my imagination takes hold,,my body takes on a life of its own.,When something very excitingnhappens in my inner world,,I've just got to run.,I've got to rock backwards and forwards,,or sometimes scream.,This gives me so much energy,,and I've got to have an noutlet for all that energy.,But I've done that ever nsince I was a child,,ever since I was a tiny little girl.,And my parents thought it was ncute, so they didn't bring it up,,but when I got into school,,they didn't really agree that it was cute.,It can be that people ndon't want to be friends,with the girl that starts nscreaming in an algebra lesson.,And this doesn't normally nhappen in this day and age,,but it can be that people don't want nto be friends with the autistic girl.,It can be that people ndon't want to associate,with anyone who won't nor can't fit themselves,into a box that's labeled normal.,But that's fine with me,,because it sorts the wheat from the chaff,,and I can find which people nare genuine and true,and I can pick these people as my friends. 
 But if you think about it, what is normal?,What does it mean?,Imagine if that was the best ncompliment you ever received.,"Wow, you are really normal.",(Laughter),But compliments are,,"you are extraordinary",or "you step outside the box.",It's "you're amazing.",So if people want to be these things,,why are so many people nstriving to be normal?,Why are people pouring their nbrilliant individual light into a mold?,People are so afraid of variety nthat they try and force everyone,,even people who don't want nto or can't, to become normal.,There are camps for LGBTQ people,or autistic people to try and nmake them this "normal,",and that's terrifying that people nwould do that in this day and age. 
 All in all, I wouldn't trade my autismnand my imagination for the world.,Because I am autistic,,I've presented documentaries to the BBC,,I'm in the midst of writing a book,,I'm doing this — this is fantastic —,and one of the best nthings that I've achieved,,that I consider to have achieved,,is I've found ways of communicating,with my little brother and sister,,who as I've said are nonverbal. nThey can't speak.,And people would often writenoff someone who's nonverbal,,but that's silly, because nmy little brother and sister,are the best siblings that nyou could ever hope for.,They're just the best, nand I love them so much,and I care about them nmore than anything else.,I'm going to leave you with one question:,If we can't get inside the person's minds,,no matter if they're autistic or not,,instead of punishing anythingnthat strays from normal,,why not celebrate uniqueness,and cheer every time someonenunleashes their imagination? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I just met you on a bus,,and we would really like nto get to know each other,,but I've got to get off at the next stop,,so you're going to tell me nthree things about yourself,that just define you as a person,,three things about yourself,that will help me understand who you are,,three things that just nget to your very essence.,And what I'm wondering,is, of those three things,,is any one of them,surviving some kind of trauma?,Cancer survivor, rape survivor,,Holocaust survivor, incest survivor. 
 Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves,by our wounds?,And where I have seen this survivor identity,have the most consequences,is in the cancer community.,And I've been around this ncommunity for a long time,,because I've been a hospice nand a hospital chaplain,for almost 30 years.,And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center,when I received the news that,my mother had breast cancer.,And then five days later,,I received the news that I had breast cancer.,My mother and I can be competitive —,(Laughter) —,but I was really not trying toncompete with her on this one.,And in fact, I thought, well,,if you have to have cancer,,it's pretty convenient to be working,at a place that treats it. 
 But this is what I heard from na lot of outraged people.,What?,You're the chaplain.,You should be immune.,Like, maybe I should have just gotten off,with a warning instead of an actual ticket,,because I'm on the force.,So I did get my treatment at thencancer center where I worked,,which was amazingly convenient,,and I had chemotherapy,and a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in,,and so before I say another word,nlet me just say right now,,this is the fake one. (Laughter),I have found that I need to get that out of the way,,because I'll see somebody go,"Oh, I know it's this one.",And then I'll move or I'll ngesture and they'll go,,"No, it's that one.",So now you know. 
 I learned a lot being a patient,,and one of the surprising things was,that only a small part of the cancer experience,is about medicine.,Most of it is about feelings and faith,and losing and finding your identity,and discovering strength,and flexibility you never even knew you had.,It's about realizing that,the most important things in life are,not things at all, but relationships,,and it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty,and learning that the way tonget out of almost anything,is to say, "I have cancer." 
 So the other thing I learned was that,I don't have to take on "cancer survivor",as my identity,,but, boy, are there powerful forces,pushing me to do just that.,Now, don't, please, misunderstand me.,Cancer organizations,and the drive for early screening,and cancer awareness and cancer research,have normalized cancer,,and this is a wonderful thing.,We can now talk about cancer,without whispering.,We can talk about cancer andnwe can support one another.,But sometimes, it feels,like people go a little overboard,and they start telling us how we're going to feel. 
 So about a week after my surgery,,we had a houseguest.,That was probably our first mistake.,And keep in mind that,at this point in my life,I had been a chaplain for over 20 years,,and issues like dying and death,and the meaning of life,,these are all things I'd been nyakking about forever.,So at dinner that night,,our houseguest proceeds tonstretch his arms up over his head,,and say, "You know, Deb,,now you're really going to learn what's important.,Yes, you are going to make some big changes,in your life,,and now you're going to startnthinking about your death.,Yep, this cancer is your wakeup call.",Now, these are golden words,coming from someone who is speaking about,their own experience,,but when someone is telling you,how you are going to feel,,it's instant crap.,The only reason I did not kill him,with my bare hands,was because I could not lift my right arm.,But I did say a really bad word to him,,followed by a regular word, that —,(Laughter) —,made my husband say, "She's on narcotics.",(Laughter),And then after my treatment, it just felt like,everyone was telling me what mynexperience was going to mean.,"Oh, this means you're going to be doing the walk.","Oh, this means you're coming to the luncheon.","This means you're going to be wearing,the pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt,and the headband and the earrings,and the bracelet and the panties.",Panties. No, seriously, google it.,(Laughter),How is that raising awareness?,Only my husband should be seeing my panties.,(Laughter),He's pretty aware of cancer already. 
 It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God,,this is just taking over my life.,And that's when I told myself, nclaim your experience.,Don't let it claim you.,We all know that,the way to cope with trauma, with loss,,with any life-changing experience,,is to find meaning.,But here's the thing:,No one can tell us,what our experience means.,We have to decide what it means.,And it doesn't have to be some gigantic,,extroverted meaning.,We don't all have to start a foundation,or an organization or write a book,or make a documentary.,Meaning can be quiet,and introverted.,Maybe we make one small decision about our lives,that can bring about big change. 
 Many years ago, I had a patient,,just a wonderful young man,who was loved by the staff,,and so it was something of a shock to us to realize,that he had no friends.,He lived by himself,,he would come in for chemotherapy by himself,,he would receive his treatment,,and then he'd walk home alone.,And I even asked him. I said, "Hey,,how come you never bring a friend with you?",And he said, "I don't really have any friends.",But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor.,We all loved him, and people were goingnin and out of his room all the time.,So at his last chemo,,we sang him the song,and we put the crown on his nhead and we blew the bubbles,,and then I asked him, I said,,"So what are you going to do now?",And he answered,,"Make friends.",And he did.,He started volunteering nand he made friends there,,and he began going to a churchnand he made friends there,,and at Christmas he invited my husbandnand me to a party in his apartment,,and the place was filled with his friends.,Claim your experience.,Don't let it claim you.,He decided that the meaning of his experience,was to know the joy of friendship,,and then learn to make friends. 
 So what about you?,How are you going to find meaning,in your crappy experience?,It could be a recent one,,or it could be one that you've been carrying around,for a really long time.,It's never too late to change what it means,,because meaning is dynamic.,What it means today,may not be what it means a year from now,,or 10 years from now.,It's never too late to become someone other,than simply a survivor.,Hear how static that word sounds?,Survivor.,No movement, no growth.,Claim your experience.,Don't let it claim you, because if you do,,I believe you will become trapped,,you will not grow, you will not evolve. 
 But of course, sometimes it's not outside pressures,that cause us to take on that identity of survivor.,Sometimes we just like the perks.,Sometimes there's a payoff.,But then we get stuck.,Now, one of the first things I learned,as a chaplain intern was the three C's,of the chaplain's job:,Comfort, clarify and, when necessary, confront,or challenge.,Now, we all pretty much love the comforting,and the clarifying.,The confronting, not so much. 
 One of the other things that I loved,about being a chaplain was,seeing patients a year, or even several years,after their treatment, because,it was just really cool to see nhow they had changed,and how their lives had evolved,and what had happened to them.,So I was thrilled one day,to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic,from a patient who I had seen the year before,,and she was there with her two adult daughters,,who I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.,So I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic,because she had just gottennall of her test results back,and she was NED: No Evidence of Disease.,Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead.,So they were ecstatic, we sat down to visit,,and it was so weird, because,within two minutes, she nstarted retelling me the story,of her diagnosis and her nsurgery and her chemo,,even though, as her chaplain, nI saw her every week,,and so I knew this story.,And she was using words like suffering,,agony, struggle.,And she ended her story with,,"I felt crucified.",And at that point, her two ndaughters got up and said,,"We're going to go get coffee.",And they left.,Tell me three things aboutnyourself before the next stop.,People were leaving the bus before she even got,to number two or number three.,So I handed her a tissue,,and I gave her a hug,,and then, because I really cared for this woman,,I said,,"Get down off your cross.",And she said, "What?",And I repeated, "Get down off your cross.",And to her credit, she could ntalk about her reasons,for embracing and then clinging to this identity.,It got her a lot of attention.,People were taking care of her for a change.,But now, it was having the opposite effect.,It was pushing people away.,People kept leaving to get coffee.,She felt crucified by her experience,,but she didn't want to let that crucified self die.,Now, perhaps you are thinking,I was a little harsh with her,,so I must tell you that,I was speaking out of my own experience.,Many, many years before,,I had been fired from a job that I loved,,and I would not stop talking about my innocence,and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt,,until finally, just like this woman,,people were walking away from me,,until I finally realized,I wasn't just processing my feelings,,I was feeding them.,I didn't want to let that crucified self die.,But we all know that with any resurrection story,,you have to die first.,The Christian story,,Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb,before he was resurrected.,And I believe that for us,,being in the tomb,means doing our own deep inner work,around our wounds,and allowing ourselves to be healed.,We have to let that crucified self die,so that a new self, a truer self,,is born.,We have to let that old story go,so that a new story, a truer story,,can be told.,Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you. 
 What if there were no survivors,,meaning, what if people decided,to just claim their trauma as an experience,instead of taking it on as an identity?,Maybe it would be the end of being,trapped in our wounds,and the beginning of amazing,self-exploration and discovery and growth.,Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves,by who we have become,and who we are becoming. 
 So perhaps survivor was not,one of the three things that you would tell me.,No matter.,I just want you all to know that,I am really glad that we are on this bus together,,and this is my stop. 
 (Applause)I want to tell you,how 20,000 remarkable young people,from over 100 countries,ended up in Cuba,and are transforming health in their communities.,Ninety percent of them would never,have left home at all,if it weren't for a scholarshipnto study medicine in Cuba,and a commitment to go back,to places like the ones they'd come from —,remote farmlands, mountains, ghettos —,to become doctors for people like themselves,,to walk the walk. 
 Havana's Latin American Medical School:,It's the largest medical school in the world,,graduating 23,000 young doctors,since its first class of 2005,,with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline.,Its mission, to train physicians for the people,who need them the most:,the over one billion,who have never seen a doctor,,the people who live and die,under every poverty line ever invented.,Its students defy all norms.,They're the school's biggest risk,and also its best bet.,They're recruited from the poorest,,most broken places on our planet,by a school that believes they can become,not just the good,but the excellent physicians,their communities desperately need,,that they will practice where most doctors don't,,in places not only poor,but oftentimes dangerous,,carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks,or navigating neighborhoods,riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,,their home ground.,The hope is that they will help,transform access to care,,the health picture in impoverished areas,,and even the way medicine itself,is learned and practiced,,and that they will become pioneers in our global reach,for universal health coverage,,surely a tall order.,Two big storms and this notion of "walk the walk",prompted creation of ELAM back in 1998.,The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch,had ripped through the Caribbean,and Central America,,leaving 30,000 dead,and two and a half million homeless.,Hundreds of Cuban doctorsnvolunteered for disaster response,,but when they got there,,they found a bigger disaster:,whole communities with no healthcare,,doors bolted shut on rural hospitals,for lack of staff,,and just too many babies dying,before their first birthday.,What would happen when these Cuban doctors left?,New doctors were needed to make care sustainable,,but where would they come from?,Where would they train? 
 In Havana, the campus of a former naval academy,was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry,to become the Latin American Medical School,,ELAM.,Tuition, room and board, and a small stipend,were offered to hundreds of students,from the countries hardest hit by the storms.,As a journalist in Havana,,I watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive,in March 1999,,settling into dorms barely refurbished,and helping their professors notnonly sweep out the classrooms,but move in the desks and thenchairs and the microscopes.,Over the next few years,,governments throughout the Americas,requested scholarships for their own students,,and the Congressional Black Caucus,asked for and received hundreds of scholarships,for young people from the USA.,Today, among the 23,000,are graduates from 83 countries,in the Americas, Africa and Asia,,and enrollment has grown to 123 nations.,More than half the students are young women.,They come from 100 ethnic groups,,speak 50 different languages.,WHO Director Margaret Chan said,,"For once, if you are poor, female,,or from an indigenous population,,you have a distinct advantage,,an ethic that makes this medical school unique." 
 Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho,on the Atlantic coast of Honduras.,There's no running water,,no electricity there,,and to reach the village, you have to walk for hours,or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did,skirting the waves of the Atlantic.,Luther was one of 40 Tocamacho children,who started grammar school,,the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people,known as the Garífuna,,20 percent of the Honduran population.,The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away.,Luther had to walk three hours every day,to middle school.,Only 17 made that trip.,Only five went on to high school,,and only one to university:,Luther, to ELAM,,among the first crop of Garífuna graduates.,Just two Garífuna doctors had preceded them,in all of Honduran history.,Now there are 69, thanks to ELAM. 
 Big problems need big solutions,,sparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity,,but also solutions that work.,ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base,to guide them, so they learned the hard way,,by doing and correcting course as they went.,Even the brightest students,from these poor communities,weren't academically prepared,for six years of medical training,,so a bridging course was set up in sciences.,Then came language:,these were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,,indigenous peoples,who learned Spanish as a second language,,or Haitians who spoke Creole.,So Spanish became part,of the pre-pre-med curriculum.,Even so, in Cuba,,the music, the food, the smells,,just about everything was different,,so faculty became family, ELAM home.,Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs,to Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical.,Embracing diversity became a way of life. 
 Why have so many countries,asked for these scholarships?,First, they just don't have enough doctors,,and where they do, their distribution,is skewed against the poor,,because our global health crisis,is fed by a crisis in human resources.,We are short four to seven million health workers,just to meet basic needs,,and the problem is everywhere.,Doctors are concentrated in the cities,,where only half the world's people live,,and within cities,,not in the shantytowns or South L.A.,Here in the United States,,where we have healthcare reform,,we don't have the professionals we need.,By 2020, we will be short,45,000 primary care physicians.,And we're also part of the problem.,The United States is the number one importer,of doctors from developing countries. 
 The second reasons students flock to Cuba,is the island's own health report card,,relying on strong primary care.,A commission from The Lancet,rates Cuba among the best performing,middle-income countries in health.,Save the Children ranks Cuba,the best country in LatinnAmerica to become a mother.,Cuba has similar life expectancy,and lower infant mortality than the United States,,with fewer disparities,,while spending per person,one 20th of what we do on health,here in the USA. 
 Academically, ELAM is tough,,but 80 percent of its students graduate.,The subjects are familiar —,basic and clinical sciences —,but there are major differences.,First, training has moved out of the ivory tower,and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods,,the kinds of places most of these grads will practice.,Sure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too,,but community-based learning starts on day one.,Second, students treat the whole patient,,mind and body,,in the context of their nfamilies, their communities,and their culture.,Third, they learn public health:,to assess their patients' drinking water, housing,,social and economic conditions.,Fourth, they are taught,that a good patient interview,and a thorough clinical exam,provide most of the clues for diagnosis,,saving costly technology for confirmation.,And finally, they're taught over and over again,the importance of prevention,,especially as chronic diseases,cripple health systems worldwide. 
 Such an in-service learning,also comes with a team approach,,as much how to work in teams,as how to lead them,,with a dose of humility.,Upon graduation, these doctors share,their knowledge with nurse's aids, midwives,,community health workers,,to help them become better at what they do,,not to replace them,,to work with shamans and traditional healers. 
 ELAM's graduates:,Are they proving this audacious experiment right?,Dozens of projects give us an inkling,of what they're capable of doing.,Take the Garífuna grads.,They not only went to work back home,,but they organized their communities to build,Honduras' first indigenous hospital.,With an architect's help,,residents literally raised it from the ground up.,The first patients walked through the doors,in December 2007,,and since then, the hospital has received,nearly one million patient visits.,And government is paying attention,,upholding the hospital as a model,of rural public health for Honduras. 
 ELAM's graduates are smart,,strong and also dedicated.,Haiti, January 2010.,The pain.,People buried under 30 million tons of rubble.,Overwhelming.,Three hundred forty Cuban doctors,were already on the ground long term.,More were on their way. Many more were needed.,At ELAM, students worked round the clock,to contact 2,000 graduates.,As a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti,,27 countries' worth, from Mali in the Sahara,to St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA.,They spoke easily to each other in Spanish,and listened to their patients in Creole,thanks to Haitian medical students,flown in from ELAM in Cuba.,Many stayed for months,,even through the cholera epidemic. 
 Hundreds of Haitian graduates,had to pick up the pieces,,overcome their own heartbreak,,and then pick up the burden,of building a new public health system for Haiti.,Today, with aid of organizations and governments,from Norway to Cuba to Brazil,,dozens of new health centers have been built,,staffed, and in 35 cases, headed,by ELAM graduates. 
 Yet the Haitian story,also illustrates some of the bigger problems,faced in many countries.,Take a look:,748 Haitian graduates by n2012, when cholera struck,,nearly half working in the public health sector,but one quarter unemployed,,and 110 had left Haiti altogether.,So in the best case scenarios,,these graduates are staffing,and thus strengthening public health systems,,where often they're the only doctors around.,In the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs,in the public health sector,,where most poor people are treated,,not enough political will, not enough resources,,not enough anything —,just too many patients with no care.,The grads face pressure from their families too,,desperate to make ends meet,,so when there are no public sector jobs,,these new MDs decamp into private practice,,or go abroad to send money home. 
 Worst of all, in some countries,,medical societies influence accreditation bodies,not to honor the ELAM degree,,fearful these grads will take their jobs,or reduce their patient loads and income.,It's not a question of competencies.,Here in the USA, the California Medical Board,accredited the school after rigorous inspection,,and the new physicians are making good,on Cuba's big bet,,passing their boards and accepted,into highly respected residencies,from New York to Chicago to New Mexico.,Two hundred strong, they're coming,back to the United States energized,,and also dissatisfied.,As one grad put it,,in Cuba, "We are trained to provide quality care,with minimal resources,,so when I see all the resources we have here,,and you tell me that's not possible,,I know it's not true.,Not only have I seen it work, I've done the work." 
 ELAM's graduates,,some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,,have come from the poorest of the poor,to offer health, education,and a voice to their communities.,They've done the heavy lifting.,Now we need to do our part,to support the 23,000 and counting,,All of us —,foundations, residency directors, press,,entrepreneurs, policymakers, people —,need to step up.,We need to do much more globally,to give these new doctors the opportunity,to prove their mettle.,They need to be able,to take their countries' licensing exams.,They need jobs in the public health sector,or in nonprofit health centers,to put their training and commitment to work.,They need the chance to be,the doctors their patients need. 
 To move forward,,we may have to find our way back,to that pediatrician who would,knock on my family's door,on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid,,who made house calls,,who was a public servant.,These aren't such new ideas,of what medicine should be.,What's new is the scaling up,and the faces of the doctors themselves:,an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she,than a he;,In the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala,,an indigenous doctor;,in the USA, a doctor of color,who speaks fluent Spanish.,She is well trained, can be counted on,,and shares the face and culture of her patients,,and she deserves our support surely,,because whether by subway, mule, or canoe,,she is teaching us to walk the walk. 
 Thank you. (Applause)So imagine that a plane is about to crash,with 250 children and babies,,and if you knew how to stop that, would you? 
 Now imagine,that 60 planes full of babies under five,crash every single day.,That's the number of kids,that never make it to their fifth birthday.,6.6 million children,never make it to their fifth birthday. 
 Most of these deaths are preventable,,and that doesn't just make me sad,,it makes me angry,,and it makes me determined.,Diarrhea and pneumonia,are among the top two killers,of children under five,,and what we can do to prevent these diseases,isn't some smart,,new technological innovations.,It's one of the world's oldest inventions:,a bar of soap.,Washing hands with soap,,a habit we all take for granted,,can reduce diarrhea by half,,can reduce respiratory infections by one third.,Handwashing with soap,can have an impact,on reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,,and most recently in the case of cholera,and Ebola outbreak,,one of the key interventions,is handwashing with soap.,Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.,It stops babies from dying.,Handwashing with soap,is one of the most cost-effective,ways of saving children's lives.,It can save over 600,000 children every year.,That's the equivalent of stopping,10 jumbo jets,full of babies and children,from crashing every single day.,I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty,useful public health intervention. 
 So now just take a minute.,I think you need to get tonknow the person next to you.,Why don't you just shake their hands.,Please shake their hands.,All right, get to know each other.,They look really pretty.,All right.,So what if I told you,that the person whose hands you just shook,actually didn't wash their hands,when they were coming out of the toilet?n(Laughter),They don't look so pretty anymore, right?,Pretty yucky, you would agree with me. 
 Well, statistics are actually showing,that four people out of five,don't wash their hands whennthey come out of the toilet,,globally.,And the same way,,we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,,running water, and soap available,,it's the same thing in the countries,where child mortality is really high. 
 What is it? Is there no soap?,Actually, soap is available.,In 90 percent of households in India,,94 percent of households in Kenya,,you will find soap.,Even in countries where soap is the lowest,,like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent. 
 So why is it?,Why aren't people washing their hands?,Why is it that Mayank,,this young boy that I met in India,,isn't washing his hands?,Well, in Mayank's family,,soap is used for bathing,,soap is used for laundry,,soap is used for washing dishes.,His parents think sometimes,it's a precious commodity,,so they'll keep it in a cupboard.,They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.,On average, in Mayank's family,,they will use soap for washing hands,once a day,at the very best, and sometimes,even once a week for washing hands with soap.,What's the result of that?,Children pick up disease,in the place that's supposed to love them,and protect them the most, in their homes. 
 Think about where you learned to wash your hands.,Did you learn to wash your hands at home?,Did you learn to wash your hands in school?,I think behavioral scientists will tell you,that it's very difficult to change the habits,that you have had early in life. 
 However, we all copy what everyone else does,,and local cultural norms are something,that shape how we change our behavior,,and this is where the private sector comes in.,Every second in Asia and Africa,,111 mothers,will buy this bar to protect their family.,Many women in India will tell you,they learned all about hygiene, diseases,,from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.,Iconic brands like this one,have a responsibility to do good,in the places where they sell their products.,It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,,that allows us to keep talking about,handwashing with soap andnhygiene to these mothers. 
 Big businesses and brands can change,and shift those social norms,and make a difference for those habits,that are so stubborn.,Think about it:,Marketeers spend all their time,making us switch from one brand to the other.,And actually, they know how to transform,science and facts into compelling messages.,Just for a minute, imagine,when they put all their forces behind,a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.,The profit motive is transforming health outcomes,in this world. 
 But it's been happening for centuries:,the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894,in Victorian England,to actually combat cholera.,Last week, I was in Ghana,with the minister of health,,because if you don't know,,there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.,A hundred and eighteen years later,,the solution is exactly the same:,It's about ensuring that they have access,to this bar of soap,,and that they're using it,,because that's the number one way,to actually stop cholera from spreading.,I think this drive for profit,is extremely powerful,,sometimes more powerful than,the most committed charity or government. 
 Government is doing what they can,,especially in terms of the pandemics,and epidemics such as cholera,,or Ebola at the moment,,but with competing priorities.,The budget is not always there.,And when you think about this,,you think about what is required,to make handwashing a daily habit,,it requires sustained funding,to refine this behavior.,In short, those that fight for public health,are actually dependent upon the soap companies,to keep promoting handwashing with soap.,We have friends like USAID,,the Global Public-Private Partnershipnfor Handwashing with Soap,,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,,Plan, WaterAid,,that all believe,for a win-win-win partnership.,Win for the public sector,,because we help them reach their targets.,Win for the private sector,,because we build new generations,of future handwashers.,And most importantly,,win for the most vulnerable.,On October 15,,we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.,Schools, communities,,our friends in the public sector,and our friends in the private sector —,yes, on that day even our competitors,,we all join hands to celebrate,the world's most important,public health intervention.,What's required,,and again where the private sectorncan make a huge difference,,is coming up with this big, creative thinking,that drives advocacy.,If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,,we've created great films,that bring the message of handwashing with soap,to the everyday person,in a way that can relate to them.,We've had over 30 million views.,Most of these discussions are still happening online.,I urge you to take five minutes,and look at those films. 
 I come from Mali,,one of the world's poorest countries.,I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation,was around social justice.,I trained in Europe's premier school of public health.,I think I'm probably one of the only women,in my country with this high degree in health,,and the only one,with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Nine years ago, I decided,,with a successful public health career in the making,,that I could make the biggest impact coming,,selling and promoting the world's best invention,in public health: soap.,We run today the world's largest,handwashing program,by any public health standards.,We've reached over 183 million people,in 16 countries.,My team and I have the ambition,to reach one billion by 2020.,Over the last four years,,business has grown double digits,,whilst child mortality has reduced,in all the places where soap use has increased.,It may be uncomfortable for some to hear —,business growth and lives saved,somehow equated in the same sentence —,but it is that business growth,that allows us to keep doing more.,Without it, and without talking about it,,we cannot achieve the change that we need. 
 Last week, my team and I,spent time visiting mothers,that have all experienced the same thing:,the death of a newborn.,I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful,and more painful.,This one is from Myanmar.,She had the most beautiful smile,,the smile, I think, that life gives you,when you've had a second chance.,Her son, Myo, is her second one.,She had a daughter,who passed away at three weeks,,and we know that the majority,of children that actually die,die in the first month of their life,,and we know that if we give a bar of soap,to every skilled birth attendant,,and that if soap is used nbefore touching the babies,,we can reduce and make a change,in terms of those numbers.,And that's what inspires me,,inspires me to continue in this mission,,to know that I can equip her,with what's needed,so that she can do,the most beautiful job in the world:,nurturing her newborn.,And next time you think of a gift,for a new mom and her family,,don't look far: buy her soap.,It's the most beautiful invention in public health. 
 I hope you will join us,and make handwashing part of your daily lives,and our daily lives,and help more children like Myo,reach their fifth birthday. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the mid-'90s,,the CDC and Kaiser Permanente,discovered an exposurenthat dramatically increased the risk,for seven out of 10 of the leadingncauses of death in the United States.,In high doses, it affectsnbrain development,,the immune system, hormonal systems,,and even the way our DNAnis read and transcribed.,Folks who are exposed in very high doses,have triple the lifetime risknof heart disease and lung cancer,and a 20-year differencenin life expectancy.,And yet, doctors today are not trainednin routine screening or treatment.,Now, the exposure I'm talking about isnnot a pesticide or a packaging chemical.,It's childhood trauma. 
 Okay. What kind of traumanam I talking about here?,I'm not talking about failing a testnor losing a basketball game.,I am talking about threatsnthat are so severe or pervasive,that they literally get under our skinnand change our physiology:,things like abuse or neglect,,or growing up with a parent nwho struggles with mental illness,or substance dependence. 
 Now, for a long time,,I viewed these things in the way nI was trained to view them,,either as a social problem --nrefer to social services --,or as a mental health problem --nrefer to mental health services.,And then something happenednto make me rethink my entire approach.,When I finished my residency,,I wanted to go someplacenwhere I felt really needed,,someplace where I could make a difference.,So I came to work fornCalifornia Pacific Medical Center,,one of the best private hospitalsnin Northern California,,and together, we opened a clinicnin Bayview-Hunters Point,,one of the poorest, most underservednneighborhoods in San Francisco.,Now, prior to that point,,there had been onlynone pediatrician in all of Bayview,to serve more than 10,000 children,,so we hung a shingle, and we were ablento provide top-quality care,regardless of ability to pay.,It was so cool. We targetednthe typical health disparities:,access to care, immunization rates,nasthma hospitalization rates,,and we hit all of our numbers.,We felt very proud of ourselves. 
 But then I started noticingna disturbing trend.,A lot of kids were beingnreferred to me for ADHD,,or Attention DeficitnHyperactivity Disorder,,but when I actually didna thorough history and physical,,what I found was thatnfor most of my patients,,I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.,Most of the kids I was seeingnhad experienced such severe trauma,that it felt like something elsenwas going on.,Somehow I was missing something important. 
 Now, before I did my residency,nI did a master's degree in public health,,and one of the things that they teach younin public health school,is that if you're a doctor,and you see 100 kidsnthat all drink from the same well,,and 98 of them develop diarrhea,,you can go aheadnand write that prescription,for dose after dosenafter dose of antibiotics,,or you can walk over and say,n"What the hell is in this well?",So I began reading everything thatnI could get my hands on,about how exposure to adversity,affects the developing brainsnand bodies of children. 
 And then one day,nmy colleague walked into my office,,and he said, "Dr. Burke,nhave you seen this?",In his hand was a copynof a research study,called the Adverse ChildhoodnExperiences Study.,That day changed my clinical practicenand ultimately my career. 
 The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study,is something that everybodynneeds to know about.,It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaisernand Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC,,and together, they asked 17,500 adultsnabout their history of exposure,to what they called "adverse nchildhood experiences," or ACEs.,Those include physical, emotional,nor sexual abuse;,physical or emotional neglect;,parental mental illness,nsubstance dependence, incarceration;,parental separation or divorce;,or domestic violence.,For every yes, you would getna point on your ACE score.,And then what they did,was they correlated these ACE scoresnagainst health outcomes.,What they found was striking.,Two things:,Number one, ACEs are incredibly common.,Sixty-seven percent of the populationnhad at least one ACE,,and 12.6 percent, one in eight,nhad four or more ACEs.,The second thing that they found,was that there wasna dose-response relationship,between ACEs and health outcomes:,the higher your ACE score,nthe worse your health outcomes.,For a person with an ACE scorenof four or more,,their relative risk of chronicnobstructive pulmonary disease,was two and a half times thatnof someone with an ACE score of zero.,For hepatitis, it was alsontwo and a half times.,For depression, it wasnfour and a half times.,For suicidality, it was 12 times.,A person with an ACE scorenof seven or more,had triple the lifetime risknof lung cancer,and three and a half times the risknof ischemic heart disease,,the number one killernin the United States of America. 
 Well, of course this makes sense.,Some people looked at this datanand they said, "Come on.,You have a rough childhood,nyou're more likely to drink and smoke,and do all these thingsnthat are going to ruin your health.,This isn't science.nThis is just bad behavior." 
 It turns out this is exactlynwhere the science comes in.,We now understandnbetter than we ever have before,how exposure to early adversity,affects the developing brainsnand bodies of children.,It affects areas likenthe nucleus accumbens,,the pleasure and rewardncenter of the brain,that is implicatednin substance dependence.,It inhibits the prefrontal cortex,,which is necessary for impulse controlnand executive function,,a critical area for learning.,And on MRI scans,,we see measurable differencesnin the amygdala,,the brain's fear response center.,So there are real neurologic reasons,why folks exposednto high doses of adversity,are more likely to engagenin high-risk behavior,,and that's important to know. 
 But it turns out that even if you don'tnengage in any high-risk behavior,,you're still more likelynto develop heart disease or cancer.,The reason for this has to do withnthe hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,,the brain's and body'snstress response system,that governs our fight-or-flight response.,How does it work?,Well, imagine you're walkingnin the forest and you see a bear.,Immediately, your hypothalamusnsends a signal to your pituitary,,which sends a signal nto your adrenal gland that says,,"Release stress hormones!nAdrenaline! Cortisol!",And so your heart starts to pound,,Your pupils dilate, your airways open up,,and you are ready to eithernfight that bear or run from the bear.,And that is wonderful,if you're in a forestnand there's a bear.,(Laughter),But the problem is what happensnwhen the bear comes home every night,,and this system is activatednover and over and over again,,and it goes from beingnadaptive, or life-saving,,to maladaptive, or health-damaging.,Children are especially sensitivento this repeated stress activation,,because their brains and bodiesnare just developing.,High doses of adversity not only affectnbrain structure and function,,they affect the developing immune system,,developing hormonal systems,,and even the way our DNAnis read and transcribed. 
 So for me, this informationnthrew my old training out the window,,because when we understandnthe mechanism of a disease,,when we know not onlynwhich pathways are disrupted, but how,,then as doctors, it is our jobnto use this science,for prevention and treatment.,That's what we do. 
 So in San Francisco, we creatednthe Center for Youth Wellness,to prevent, screen and heal the impactsnof ACEs and toxic stress.,We started simply with routine screeningnof every one of our kids,at their regular physical,,because I know that if my patient nhas an ACE score of 4,,she's two and a half times as likelynto develop hepatitis or COPD,,she's four and half times as likelynto become depressed,,and she's 12 times as likelynto attempt to take her own life,as my patient with zero ACEs.,I know that when she's in my exam room.,For our patients who do screen positive,,we have a multidisciplinary treatment teamnthat works to reduce the dose of adversity,and treat symptoms using best practices,nincluding home visits, care coordination,,mental health care, nutrition,,holistic interventions, and yes,nmedication when necessary.,But we also educate parentsnabout the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress,the same way you would for coveringnelectrical outlets, or lead poisoning,,and we tailor the carenof our asthmatics and our diabetics,in a way that recognizes that they maynneed more aggressive treatment,,given the changes to their hormonalnand immune systems. 
 So the other thing that happensnwhen you understand this science,is that you want to shout itnfrom the rooftops,,because this isn't just an issuenfor kids in Bayview.,I figured the minutenthat everybody else heard about this,,it would be routine screening,nmulti-disciplinary treatment teams,,and it would be a race to the mostneffective clinical treatment protocols.,Yeah. That did not happen.,And that was a huge learning for me.,What I had thought of as simplynbest clinical practice,I now understand to be a movement.,In the words of Dr. Robert Block,,the former Presidentnof the American Academy of Pediatrics,,"Adverse childhood experiences,are the single greatestnunaddressed public health threat,facing our nation today.",And for a lot of people,nthat's a terrifying prospect.,The scope and scale of the problemnseems so large that it feels overwhelming,to think about how we might approach it.,But for me, that's actuallynwhere the hopes lies,,because when we have the right framework,,when we recognize this to bena public health crisis,,then we can begin to use the right ntool kit to come up with solutions.,From tobacco to lead poisoning nto HIV/AIDS,,the United States actually hasnquite a strong track record,with addressing public health problems,,but replicating those successesnwith ACEs and toxic stress,is going to take determinationnand commitment,,and when I look at whatnour nation's response has been so far,,I wonder,,why haven't we taken this more seriously? 
 You know, at first I thoughtnthat we marginalized the issue,because it doesn't apply to us.,That's an issue for those kidsnin those neighborhoods.,Which is weird, because the datandoesn't bear that out.,The original ACEs studynwas done in a population,that was 70 percent Caucasian,,70 percent college-educated.,But then, the more I talked to folks,,I'm beginning to think that maybenI had it completely backwards.,If I were to asknhow many people in this room,grew up with a family membernwho suffered from mental illness,,I bet a few hands would go up.,And then if I were to ask how many folksnhad a parent who maybe drank too much,,or who really believed thatnif you spare the rod, you spoil the child,,I bet a few more hands would go up.,Even in this room, this is an issuenthat touches many of us,,and I am beginning to believenthat we marginalize the issue,because it does apply to us.,Maybe it's easier to seenin other zip codes,because we don't want to look at it.,We'd rather be sick. 
 Fortunately, scientific advancesnand, frankly, economic realities,make that option less viable every day.,The science is clear:,Early adversity dramatically affectsnhealth across a lifetime.,Today, we are beginning to understandnhow to interrupt the progression,from early adversitynto disease and early death,,and 30 years from now,,the child who has a high ACE score,and whose behavioral symptomsngo unrecognized,,whose asthma managementnis not connected,,and who goes on to developnhigh blood pressure,and early heart disease or cancer,will be just as anomalousnas a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS.,People will look at that situationnand say, "What the heck happened there?",This is treatable.,This is beatable.,The single most important thingnthat we need today,is the courage to looknthis problem in the face,and say, this is realnand this is all of us.,I believe that we are the movement. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have a confession to make.,I'm a business professor,whose ambition has beennto help people learn to lead.,But recently, I've discovered,that what many of usnthink of as great leadership,does not work when it comesnto leading innovation. 
 I'm an ethnographer.,I use the methods of anthropology,to understand the questionsnin which I'm interested.,So along with three co-conspirators,,I spent nearly a decade observingnup close and personal,exceptional leaders of innovation.,We studied 16 men and women,,located in seven countriesnacross the globe,,working in 12 different industries.,In total, we spent hundredsnof hours on the ground,,on-site, watching these leaders in action.,We ended up with pages and pagesnand pages of field notes,that we analyzed and lookednfor patterns in what our leaders did.,The bottom line?,If we want to build organizationsnthat can innovate time and again,,we must unlearn our conventionalnnotions of leadership. 
 Leading innovation is notnabout creating a vision,,and inspiring others to execute it.,But what do we mean by innovation?,An innovation is anythingnthat is both new and useful.,It can be a product or service.,It can be a processnor a way of organizing.,It can be incremental,nor it can be breakthrough.,We have a pretty inclusive definition. 
 How many of you recognize this man?,Put your hands up.,Keep your hands up,nif you know who this is.,How about these familiar faces?,(Laughter),From your show of hands,,it looks like many of younhave seen a Pixar movie,,but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,,the founder and CEO of Pixar --,one of the companiesnI had the privilege of studying. 
 My first visit to Pixar was in 2005,,when they were working on "Ratatouille,",that provocative movie aboutna rat becoming a master chef.,Computer-generated moviesnare really mainstream today,,but it took Ed and hisncolleagues nearly 20 years,to create the firstnfull-length C.G. movie.,In the 20 years hence,nthey've produced 14 movies.,I was recently at Pixar,nand I'm here to tell you,that number 15 is sure to be a winner. 
 When many of us thinknabout innovation, though,,we think about an Einsteinnhaving an 'Aha!' moment.,But we all know that's a myth.,Innovation is not about solo genius,,it's about collective genius.,Let's think for a minute aboutnwhat it takes to make a Pixar movie:,No solo genius, no flash of inspirationnproduces one of those movies.,On the contrary, it takes aboutn250 people four to five years,,to make one of those movies. 
 To help us understand the process,,an individual in the studiondrew a version of this picture.,He did so reluctantly,,because it suggested that the process nwas a neat series of steps,done by discrete groups.,Even with all those arrows,nhe thought it failed to really tell you,just how iterative, interrelatednand, frankly, messy their process was. 
 Throughout the making of a movienat Pixar, the story evolves.,So think about it.,Some shots go through quickly.,They don't all go through in order.,It depends on how vexingnthe challenges are,that they come up with when theynare working on a particular scene.,So if you think about that scene in "Up",where the boy hands the piecenof chocolate to the bird,,that 10 seconds took one animatornalmost six months to perfect. 
 The other thing about a Pixar movie,is that no part of the movienis considered finished,until the entire movie wraps.,Partway through one production,nan animator drew a character,with an arched eyebrow thatnsuggested a mischievous side.,When the director saw thatndrawing, he thought it was great.,It was beautiful, but he said,,"You've got to lose it;nit doesn't fit the character.",Two weeks later, the directorncame back and said,,"Let's put in those few seconds of film.",Because that animatornwas allowed to share,what we referred tonas his slice of genius,,he was able to help that directornreconceive the character,in a subtle but important waynthat really improved the story. 
 What we know is, at the heartnof innovation is a paradox.,You have to unleash the talentsnand passions of many people,and you have to harness themninto a work that is actually useful.,Innovation is a journey.,It's a type of collaborativenproblem solving,,usually among peoplenwho have different expertise,and different points of view. 
 Innovations rarely get created full-blown.,As many of you know,,they're the result,nusually, of trial and error.,Lots of false starts,nmissteps and mistakes.,Innovative work can benvery exhilarating,,but it also can benreally downright scary.,So when we look at why it isnthat Pixar is able to do what it does,,we have to ask ourselves,nwhat's going on here? 
 For sure, historynand certainly Hollywood,,is full of star-studded teamsnthat have failed.,Most of those failures are attributed,to too many stars or too manyncooks, if you will, in the kitchen.,So why is it that Pixar,nwith all of its cooks,,is able to be so successfulntime and time again?,When we studiednan Islamic Bank in Dubai,,or a luxury brand in Korea,nor a social enterprise in Africa,,we found that innovative organizations,are communities thatnhave three capabilities:,creative abrasion, creativenagility and creative resolution.,Creative abrasion is about being ablento create a marketplace of ideas,through debate and discourse.,In innovative organizations,nthey amplify differences,,they don't minimize them.,Creative abrasion is notnabout brainstorming,,where people suspend their judgment.,No, they know how to have verynheated but constructive arguments,to create a portfolio of alternatives. 
 Individuals in innovative organizations,learn how to inquire, they learn hownto actively listen, but guess what?,They also learn how tonadvocate for their point of view.,They understand thatninnovation rarely happens,unless you have bothndiversity and conflict.,Creative agility is about being ablento test and refine that portfolio of ideas,through quick pursuit,nreflection and adjustment.,It's about discovery-driven learning,where you act, as opposed to plan,nyour way to the future.,It's about design thinking wherenyou have that interesting combination,of the scientific methodnand the artistic process.,It's about running a series ofnexperiments, and not a series of pilots. 
 Experiments are usually about learning.,When you get a negative outcome,,you're still really learning somethingnthat you need to know.,Pilots are often about being right.,When they don't work,nsomeone or something is to blame.,The final capabilitynis creative resolution.,This is about doing decision making,in a way that you can actually combineneven opposing ideas,to reconfigure them in new combinations,to produce a solutionnthat is new and useful.,When you look at innovative organizations,nthey never go along to get along.,They don't compromise.,They don't let one groupnor one individual dominate,,even if it's the boss,neven if it's the expert.,Instead, they have developed,a rather patient and more inclusivendecision making process,that allows for both/andnsolutions to arise,and not simply either/or solutions.,These three capabilities are why we see,that Pixar is able to do what it does. 
 Let me give you another example,,and that example is theninfrastructure group of Google.,The infrastructure groupnof Google is the group,that has to keep the websitenup and running 24/7.,So when Google was aboutnto introduce Gmail and YouTube,,they knew that their data storagensystem wasn't adequate.,The head of the engineering groupnand the infrastructure group at that time,was a man named Bill Coughran.,Bill and his leadership team,nwho he referred to as his brain trust,,had to figure out what to donabout this situation.,They thought about it for a while.,Instead of creating a groupnto tackle this task,,they decided to allow groupsnto emerge spontaneously,around different alternatives. 
 Two groups coalesced.,One became known as Big Table,,the other became knownnas Build It From Scratch.,Big Table proposed that theynbuild on the current system.,Build It From Scratch proposednthat it was time for a whole new system.,Separately, these two teamsnwere allowed to work full-time,on their particular approach.,In engineering reviews,nBill described his role as,,"Injecting honesty intonthe process by driving debate." 
 Early on, the teams were encouragednto build prototypes so that they could,"bump them up against realitynand discover for themselves,the strengths and weaknessesnof their particular approach.",When Build It From Scratch sharedntheir prototype with the group,whose beepers would havento go off in the middle of the night,if something went wrongnwith the website,,they heard loud and clear about thenlimitations of their particular design.,As the need for a solutionnbecame more urgent,and as the data, or thenevidence, began to come in,,it became pretty clearnthat the Big Table solution,was the right one for the moment.,So they selected that one. 
 But to make sure thatnthey did not lose the learning,of the Build it From Scratch team,,Bill asked two members of that teamnto join a new team that was emerging,to work on the next-generation system.,This whole process took nearly two years,,but I was told that they werenall working at breakneck speed. 
 Early in that process, one of thenengineers had gone to Bill and said,,"We're all too busynfor this inefficient system,of running parallel experiments.",But as the process unfolded,nhe began to understand,the wisdom of allowing talentednpeople to play out their passions.,He admitted, "If you had forced usnto all be on one team,,we might have focused on provingnwho was right, and winning,,and not on learning and discoveringnwhat was the best answer for Google." 
 Why is it that Pixar and Googlenare able to innovate time and again?,It's because they've masterednthe capabilities required for that.,They know how to doncollaborative problem solving,,they know how to dondiscovery-driven learning,and they know how to donintegrated decision making. 
 Some of you may be sitting therenand saying to yourselves right now,,"We don't know how to donthose things in my organization.,So why do they know how tondo those things at Pixar,,and why do they know how tondo those things at Google?",When many of the peoplenthat worked for Bill told us,,in their opinion, that Bill was onenof the finest leaders in Silicon Valley,,we completely agreed;nthe man is a genius. 
 Leadership is the secret sauce.,But it's a different kind of leadership,,not the kind many of us think aboutnwhen we think about great leadership.,One of the leaders I met withnearly on said to me,,"Linda, I don't read books on leadership.,All they do is make me feel bad."n(Laughter),"In the first chapter they saynI'm supposed to create a vision.,But if I'm trying to do somethingnthat's truly new, I have no answers.,I don't know whatndirection we're going in,and I'm not even sure I knownhow to figure out how to get there.",For sure, there are timesnwhen visionary leadership,is exactly what is needed. 
 But if we want to build organizationsnthat can innovate time and again,,we must recast our understandingnof what leadership is about.,Leading innovation is aboutncreating the space,where people are willingnand able to do the hard work,of innovative problem solving. 
 At this point, some of younmay be wondering,,"What does that leadershipnreally look like?",At Pixar, they understandnthat innovation takes a village.,The leaders focus on buildingna sense of community,and building those three capabilities.,How do they define leadership?,They say leadershipnis about creating a world,to which people want to belong.,What kind of world do peoplenwant to belong in at Pixar?,A world where you'renliving at the frontier.,What do they focus their time on?,Not on creating a vision.,Instead they spendntheir time thinking about,,"How do we design a studio that hasnthe sensibility of a public square,so that people will interact?,Let's put in a policy that anyone,nno matter what their level or role,,is allowed to give notes to the director,about how they feelnabout a particular film.,What can we do to make sure,that all the disruptors, all thenminority voices in this organization,,speak up and are heard?,And, finally, let's bestow creditnin a very generous way.",I don't know if you've ever lookednat the credits of a Pixar movie,,but the babies born duringna production are listed there.,(Laughter) 
 How did Bill think aboutnwhat his role was?,Bill said, "I leadna volunteer organization.,Talented people don't wantnto follow me anywhere.,They want to cocreatenwith me the future.,My job is to nurture the bottom-up,and not let it degenerate into chaos.",How did he see his role?,"I'm a role model,nI'm a human glue,,I'm a connector,nI'm an aggregator of viewpoints.,I'm never a dictator of viewpoints.",Advice about how you exercise the role?,Hire people who argue with you.,And, guess what?,Sometimes it's best to bendeliberately fuzzy and vague. 
 Some of you maynbe wondering now,,what are these people thinking?,They're thinking,,"I'm not the visionary,nI'm the social architect.,I'm creating the space wherenpeople are willing and able,to share and combinentheir talents and passions.",If some of you are worrying nownthat you don't work at a Pixar,,or you don't work at a Google,,I want to tell you there's still hope.,We've studied many organizations,that were really notnorganizations you'd think of,as ones where a lot of innovation happens. 
 We studied a general counselnin a pharmaceutical company,who had to figure out hownto get the outside lawyers,,19 competitors,nto collaborate and innovate.,We studied the head of marketingnat a German automaker,where, fundamentally, they believednthat it was the design engineers,,not the marketeers,nwho were allowed to be innovative.,We also studied Vineet Nayarnat HCL Technologies,,an Indian outsourcing company.,When we met Vineet,,his company was about, in hisnwords, to become irrelevant.,We watched as he turned that companyninto a global dynamo of I.T. innovation.,At HCL technologies,nlike at many companies,,the leaders had learned to seentheir role as setting direction,and making sure thatnno one deviated from it.,What he did is tell themnit was time for them,to think about rethinkingnwhat they were supposed to do.,Because what was happeningnis that everybody was looking up,and you weren't seeingnthe kind of bottom-up innovation,we saw at Pixar or Google.,So they began to work on that. 
 They stopped giving answers, theynstopped trying to provide solutions.,Instead, what they didnis they began to see,the people at the bottom of thenpyramid, the young sparks,,the people who werenclosest to the customers,,as the source of innovation.,They began to transfernthe organization's growth,to that level.,In Vineet's language, this wasnabout inverting the pyramid,so that you could unleashnthe power of the many,by loosening the stranglehold of the few,,and increase the qualitynand the speed of innovation,that was happening every day. 
 For sure, Vineet and all thenother leaders that we studied,were in fact visionaries.,For sure, they understoodnthat that was not their role.,So I don't think it is accidentalnthat many of you did not recognize Ed.,Because Ed, like Vineet, understandsnthat our role as leaders,is to set the stage, not perform on it.,If we want to invent a better future,,and I suspect that's whynmany of us are here,,then we need to reimagine our task.,Our task is to create the space,where everybody's slices of genius,can be unleashed and harnessed,,and turned into worksnof collective genius. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)George and Charlotte Blonsky, who were,a married couple living innthe Bronx in New York City,,invented something.,They got a patent inn1965 for what they call,,"a device to assist women in giving birth.",This device consists of a large, round table,and some machinery.,When the woman is ready to deliver her child,,she lies on her back,,she is strapped down to the table,,and the table is rotated at high speed.,The child comes flying out,through centrifugal force.,If you look at their patent carefully,,especially if you have anynengineering background or talent,,you may decide that you see,one or two points where the design is nnot perfectly adequate. (Laughter) 
 Doctor Ivan Schwab in California,is one of the people, none of the main people,,who helped answer the question,,"Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?",And it turns out the answer to that,is because their brains,are packaged inside their skulls,in a way different from the way,our brains, we being human beings,,true, have our brains packaged.,They, the woodpeckers, typically,will peck, they will bang their head,on a piece of wood thousands nof times every day. Every day!,And as far as anyone knows,,that doesn't bother them in the slightest. 
 How does this happen?,Their brain does not slosh around like ours does.,Their brain is packed in very tightly,,at least for blows coming nright from the front.,Not too many people paid attention,to this research untilnthe last few years,when, in this country especially,,people are becoming curious about,what happens to the brainsnof football players,who bang their heads repeatedly.,And the woodpecker maybe relates to that. 
 There was a paper published,in the medical journal The Lancet,in England a few years ago called," A man who pricked his fingernand smelled putrid for 5 years.",Dr. Caroline Mills and her team,received this patient and didn't nreally know what to do about it.,The man had cut his finger,,he worked processing chickens,,and then he started tonsmell really, really bad.,So bad that when nhe got in a room,with the doctors and the nurses,,they couldn't stand being nin the room with him.,It was intolerable.,They tried every drug,,every other treatmentnthey could think of.,After a year, he still nsmelled putrid.,After two years, still smelled putrid.,Three years, four years,nstill smelled putrid.,After five years, it went away on its own.,It's a mystery. 
 In New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin,and her team tested an old ntradition in her city.,They live in a city that has huge hills,,San Francisco-grade hills.,And in the winter there,nit gets very cold,and very icy.,There are lots of injuries.,The tradition that they tested,,they tested by asking people,who were on their way to nwork in the morning,,to stop and try something out.,Try one of two conditions.,The tradition is that in the winter,,in that city, you wear your socksnon the outside of your boots.,And what they discovered by experiment,,and it was quite graphic when they saw it,,was that it's true.,That if you wear your socks on the noutside rather than the inside,,you're much more likely nto survive and not slip and fall. 
 Now, I hope you will agreenwith me that these things,I've just described to you,,each of them, deserves some kind of prize.n(Laughter),And that's what they got,,each of them got an Ig Nobel prize.,In 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,,started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.,Every year we give out 10 prizes.,The prizes are based on just none criteria. It's very simple.,It's that you've done something that nmakes people laugh and then think.,What you've done makes npeople laugh and then think.,Whatever it is, there's something about it,that when people encounter it at first,,their only possible reaction is to laugh.,And then a week later,,it's still rattling around in their heads,and all they want to do nis tell their friends about it.,That's the quality we look for. 
 Every year, we get in the neighborhood,of 9,000 new nominations nfor the Ig Nobel prize.,Of those, consistently between 10 percent,and 20 percent of those nominations,are people who nominate themselves.,Those self-nominees almost never win.,It's very difficult, numerically, nto win a prize if you want to.,Even if you don't want to,,it's very difficult numerically.,You should know that when nwe choose somebody,to win an Ig Nobel prize,,We get in touch with that person, very quietly.,We offer them the chance to decline,this great honor if they want to.,Happily for us, almost everyone nwho's offered a prize,decides to accept. 
 What do you get if younwin an Ig Nobel prize?,Well, you get several things.,You get an Ig Nobel prize.,The design is different every year.,These are always handmadenfrom extremely cheap materials.,You're looking at a picture,of the prize we gave last year, 2013.,Most prizes in the world also give,their winners some cash, some money.,We don't have any money,,so we can't give them.,In fact, the winners have tonpay their own way,to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,,which most of them do.,Last year, though, we did managento scrape up some money.,Last year, each of the 10nIg Nobel prize winners,received from us 10 trillion dollars.,A $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe. (Laughter),You may remember that nZimbabwe had a little adventure,for a few years there of inflation.,They ended up printing bills,that were in denominations asnlarge as 100 trillion dollars.,The man responsible, who runsnthe national bank there, by the way,,won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics. 
 The other thing you win is an invitation,to come to the ceremony,,which happens at Harvard University.,And when you get there,,you come to Harvard's biggest nmeeting place and classroom.,It fits 1,100 people,,it's jammed to the gills,,and up on the stage,,waiting to shake your hand,,waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,,are a bunch of Nobel prize winners.,That's the heart of the ceremony.,The winners are kept secret until that moment,,even the Nobel laureates nwho will shake their hand,don't know who they arenuntil they're announced. 
 I am going to tell you nabout just a very few,of the other medical-related prizes we've given.,Keep in mind, we've given 230 prizes.,There are lots of these peoplenwho walk among you.,Maybe you have one.,A paper was published about 30 years ago,called "Injuries due to Falling Coconuts.",It was written by Dr. Peter Barss,,who is Canadian.,Dr. Barss came to the ceremony,and explained that as a young doctor,,he wanted to see the world.,So he went to Papua New Guinea.,When he got there, he went to worknin a hospital, and he was curious,what kinds of things happen to peoplenthat bring them to the hospital.,He looked through the nrecords, and he discovered,that a surprisingly large number of people,in that hospital were there,because of injuries due to falling coconuts.,One typical thing that happens is,people will come from the highlands,nwhere there are not many coconut trees,,down to visit their relatives on the coast,,where there are lots.,And they'll think that a coconut tree,is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.,A coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,,and has coconuts that weigh two pounds,that can drop off at any time. 
 A team of doctors in Europe,published a series of papersnabout colonoscopies.,You're all familiar with colonoscopies,,one way or another.,Or in some cases,,one way and another.,They, in these papers,,explained to their fellow doctorsnwho perform colonoscopies,,how to minimize the chance,that when you perform a colonoscopy,,your patient will explode. (Laughter),Dr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan,one of the authors,,flew in from Paris to the ceremony,,where he explained the history of this,,that in the 1950s,,when colonoscopies were becomingna common technique for the first time,,people were figuring out how to do it well.,And there were some difficulties at first.,The basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,,that you're looking inside a nlong, narrow, dark place.,And so, you want to have a larger space.,You add some gas to inflate it,so you have room to look around.,Now, that's added to the ngas, the methane gas,,that's already inside.,The gas that they used at first,nin many cases, was oxygen.,So they added oxygen to methane gas.,And then they wanted to be able to see,,they needed light,,so they'd put in a light source,,which in the 1950s was very hot.,So you had methane gas, which is flammable,,oxygen and heat.,They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly.n(Laughter),Now it's rare that patients will explode,,but it does still happen. 
 The final thing that I want nto tell you about is a prize,we gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar.,Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere,that in an emergency,can be quickly separated,into a pair of protective face masks.,One to save your life,,one to save the life of some nlucky bystander. (Laughter),Why would someone do this, you might wonder.,Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony,and she explained that nshe grew up in Ukraine.,She was one of the doctors who treated victims,of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.,And they later discovered that,a lot of the worst medical problems,came from the particles people breathed in.,So she was always thinking after that,about could there be some simple mask,that was available everywherenwhen the unexpected happens.,Years later, she moved to America.,She had a baby,,One day she looked, and on the floor,,her infant son had picked up her bra,,and had her bra on his face.,And that's where the idea came from.,She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony,with the first prototype of the bra,and she demonstrated:,(Laughter) (Applause),["Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate n(2008) in economics"],["Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel nlaureate (2001) in physics"] 
 I myself own an emergency bra. (Laughter),It's my favorite bra,,but I would be happy to nshare it with any of you,,should the need arise.,Thank you.,(Applause)I grew up,diagnosed as phobically shy,,and, like at least 20 other people,in a room of this size,,I was a stutterer.,Do you dare raise your hand? 
 And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,,because when we are treated that way,,we feel invisible sometimes,,or talked around and at.,And as I started to look at people,,which is mostly all I did,,I noticed that some people,really wanted attention and recognition.,Remember, I was young then.,So what did they do?,What we still do perhaps too often.,We talk about ourselves.,And yet there are other people I observed,who had what I called a mutuality mindset.,In each situation, they found a way to talk about us,and create that "us" idea. 
 So my idea to reimagine the world,is to see it one where we all become,greater opportunity-makers with and for others.,There's no greater opportunity,or call for action for us now,than to become opportunity-makers,who use best talents together more often,for the greater good,and accomplish things wencouldn't have done on our own.,And I want to talk to you about that,,because even more than giving,,even more than giving,,is the capacity for us to do something smarter,together for the greater good,that lifts us both up,and that can scale.,That's why I'm sitting here.,But I also want to point something else out:,Each one of you,is better than anybody else at something.,That disproves that popular notion,that if you're the smartest person in the room,,you're in the wrong room.,(Laughter) 
 So let me tell you about,a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,,and I met this up-and-coming actress,,and we were soon talking about something,that we both felt passionately about: public art.,And she had the fervent belief,that every new building in Los Angeles,should have public art in it.,She wanted a regulation for it,,and she fervently started —,who is here from Chicago? —,she fervently started talking about,these bean-shaped reflective sculptures,in Millennium Park,,and people would walk up to it,and they'd smile in the reflection of it,,and they'd pose and they'd vamp,and they'd take selfies together,,and they'd laugh.,And as she was talking, a nthought came to my mind.,I said, "I know someone you ought to meet.,He's getting out of San Quentin nin a couple of weeks" —,(Laughter) —,"and he shares your fervent desire,that art should engage andnenable people to connect.",He spent five years in solitary,,and I met him because I gavena speech at San Quentin,,and he's articulate,and he's rather easy on nthe eyes because he's buff.,He had workout regime he did every day.,(Laughter),I think she was following me at that point.,I said, "He'd be an unexpected ally.",And not just that. There's James. He's an architect,and he's a professor, and he loves place-making,,and place-making is when you have,those mini-plazas and those urban walkways,and where they're dotted with art,,where people draw and ncome up and talk sometimes.,I think they'd make good allies.,And indeed they were.,They met together. They prepared.,They spoke in front of the nLos Angeles City Council.,And the council members notnonly passed the regulation,,half of them came down and askednto pose with them afterwards.,They were startling, ncompelling and credible.,You can't buy that. 
 What I'm asking you to consider,is what kind of opportunity-nmakers we might become,,because more than wealth,or fancy titles,or a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect,around each other's nbetter side and bring it out.,And I'm not saying this is easy,,and I'm sure many of you havenmade the wrong moves too,about who you wanted to connect with,,but what I want to suggest is,,this is an opportunity.,I started thinking about it,way back when I was a nWall Street Journal reporter,and I was in Europe and I wasnsupposed to cover trends,and trends that transcended business,or politics or lifestyle.,So I had to have contacts,in different worlds very different than mine,,because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.,And third, I had to write the story,in a way stepping into the reader's shoes,,so they could see how these ntrends could affect their lives.,That's what opportunity-makers do. 
 And here's a strange thing:,Unlike an increasing number of Americans,who are working and living nand playing with people,who think exactly like them,because we then become more rigid and extreme,,opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations,with people unlike them,,and they're building relationships,,and because they do that,,they have trusted relationships,where they can bring the right team in,and recruit them to solve a nproblem better and faster,and seize more opportunities.,They're not affronted by differences,,they're fascinated by them,,and that is a huge shift in mindset,,and once you feel it, you nwant it to happen a lot more.,This world is calling out for us nto have a collective mindset,,and I believe in doing that.,It's especially important now.,Why is it important now?,Because things can be devised like drones,and drugs and data collection,,and they can be devised by more people,and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes,and then, as we know from the news every day,,they can be used for dangerous ones.,It calls on us, each of us,,to a higher calling. 
 But here's the icing on the cake:,It's not just the first opportunity,that you do with somebody else,that's probably your greatest,,as an institution or an individual.,It's after you've had that experience,and you trust each other.,It's the unexpected things,that you devise later on,you never could have predicted.,For example, Marty is the husband nof that actress I mentioned,,and he watched them nwhen they were practicing,,and he was soon talking to Wally,,my friend the ex-con,,about that exercise regime.,And he thought,,I have a set of racquetball courts.,That guy could teach it.,A lot of people who work therenare members at my courts.,They're frequent travelers.,They could practice in their hotel room,,no equipment provided.,That's how Wally got hired.,Not only that, years later,he was also teaching racquetball.,Years after that,,he was teaching the racquetball teachers.,What I'm suggesting is, when nyou connect with people,around a shared interest and action,,you're accustomed to serendipitous,things happening into the future,,and I think that's what we're looking at.,We open ourselves up to those opportunities,,and in this room nare key players in technology,,key players who are uniquely positioned to do this,,to scale systems and projects together. 
 So here's what I'm calling for you to do.,Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers.,Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength,and they become pattern seekers.,They get involved in different nworlds than their worlds,so they're trusted and they ncan see those patterns,,and they communicate to connect,around sweet spots of shared interest. 
 So what I'm asking you is,,the world is hungry.,I truly believe, in my firsthand experience,,the world is hungry for us,to unite together as opportunity-makers,and to emulate those behaviors,as so many of you already do —,I know that firsthand —,and to reimagine a world,where we use our best talents together,more often to accomplish greater things together,than we could on our own.,Just remember,,as Dave Liniger once said,,"You can't succeed,coming to the potluck with only a fork.",(Laughter) 
 Thank you very much.,Thank you. (Applause)I know a man who soars above the city every night.,In his dreams, he twirls and swirls,with his toes kissing the Earth.,Everything has motion, he claims,,even a body as paralyzed as his own.,This man is my father. 
 Three years ago, when I found out,that my father had suffered a severe stroke,in his brain stem,,I walked into his room in the ICU,at the Montreal Neurological Institute,and found him lying deathly still,,tethered to a breathing machine.,Paralysis had closed over his body slowly,,beginning in his toes, then legs,,torso, fingers and arms.,It made its way up his neck,,cutting off his ability to breathe,,and stopped just beneath the eyes.,He never lost consciousness.,Rather, he watched from within,as his body shut down,,limb by limb,,muscle by muscle. 
 In that ICU room, I walked up to my father's body, 
 and with a quivering voice and through tears,,I began reciting the alphabet.,A, B, C, D, E, F, G,,H, I, J, K.,At K, he blinked his eyes.,I began again.,A, B, C, D, E, F, G,,H, I.,He blinked again at the letter I,,then at T, then at R, and A:,Kitra.,He said "Kitra, my beauty, don't cry.,This is a blessing.",There was no audible voice, but my father,called out my name powerfully.,Just 72 hours after his stroke,,he had already embraced,the totality of his condition.,Despite his extreme physical state,,he was completely present with me,,guiding, nurturing,,and being my father as much,if not more than ever before. 
 Locked-in syndrome,is many people's worst nightmare.,In French, it's sometimes called,"maladie de l'emmuré vivant.",Literally, "walled-in-alive disease.",For many people, perhaps most,,paralysis is an unspeakable horror,,but my father's experience,losing every system of his body,was not an experience of feeling trapped,,but rather of turning the psyche inwards,,dimming down the external chatter,,facing the recesses of his own mind,,and in that place,,falling in love with life and body anew. 
 As a rabbi and spiritual man,dangling between mind and body, life and death,,the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.,He realized he no longer needed to look,beyond the corporeal world,in order to find the divine.,"Paradise is in this body.,It's in this world," he said. 
 I slept by my father's side for the first four months,,tending as much as I could,to his every discomfort,,understanding the deep nhuman psychological fear,of not being able to call out for help.,My mother, sisters, brother and I,,we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing.,We became his mouthpiece,,spending hours each day reciting the alphabet,as he whispered back sermons,and poetry with blinks of his eye.,His room, it became our temple of healing.,His bedside became a site for those,seeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,,my father was able to speak,and uplift,,letter by letter,,blink by blink.,Everything in our world became slow and tender,as the din, drama and death of the hospital ward,faded into the background.,I want to read to you one of the first things,that we transcribed in the week following the stroke.,He composed a letter,,addressing his synagogue congregation,,and ended it with the following lines:,"When my nape exploded,,I entered another dimension:,inchoate, sub-planetary, protozoan.,Universes are opened and closed continually.,There are many when low,,who stop growing.,Last week, I was brought so low,,but I felt the hand of my father around me,,and my father brought me back." 
 When we weren't his voice,,we were his legs and arms.,I moved them like I know I would have wanted,my own arms and legs to be moved,were they still for all the hours of the day.,I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face,,bending each joint to keep it soft and limber.,I'd ask him again and again,to visualize the motion,,to watch from within as the finger curled,and extended, and to move along with it,in his mind. 
 Then, one day, from the corner of my eye,,I saw his body slither like a snake,,an involuntary spasm passing through the course,of his limbs.,At first, I thought it was my own hallucination,,having spent so much time tending to this one body,,so desperate to see anything react on its own.,But he told me he felt tingles,,sparks of electricity flickering on and off,just beneath the surface of the skin.,The following week, he began ever so slightly,to show muscle resistance.,Connections were being made.,Body was slowly and gently reawakening,,limb by limb, muscle by muscle,,twitch by twitch. 
 As a documentary photographer,,I felt the need to photograph,each of his first movements,like a mother with her newborn.,I photographed him taking his first unaided breath,,the celebratory moment after he showed,muscle resistance for the very first time,,the new adapted technologies that allowed him,to gain more and more independence.,I photographed the care and the love,that surrounded him. 
 But my photographs only told the outside story,of a man lying in a hospital bed,attached to a breathing machine.,I wasn't able to portray his story from within,,and so I began to search for a new visual language,,one which strived to express the ephemeral quality,of his spiritual experience. 
 Finally, I want to share with you,a video from a series that I've been working on,that tries to express the slow, in-between existence,that my father has experienced.,As he began to regain his ability to breathe,,I started recording his thoughts,,and so the voice that you hear in this video,is his voice. 
 (Video) Ronnie Cahana: You have to believe,you're paralyzed,to play the part,of a quadriplegic.,I don't.,In my mind,,and in my dreams,every night,I Chagall-man float,over the city,twirl and swirl,with my toes kissing the floor.,I know nothing about the statement,of man without motion.,Everything has motion.,The heart pumps.,The body heaves.,The mouth moves.,We never stagnate.,Life triumphs up and down. 
 Kitra Cahana: For most of us,,our muscles begin to twitch and move,long before we are conscious,,but my father tells me his privilege,is living on the far periphery,of the human experience.,Like an astronaut who sees a perspective,that very few of us will ever get to share,,he wonders and watches as he takes,his first breaths,and dreams about crawling back home.,So begins life at 57, he says.,A toddler has no attitude in its being,,but a man insists on his world every day. 
 Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations,to the degree that my father has,,but we will all have moments of paralysis,in our lives.,I know I frequently confront walls,that feel completely unscalable,,but my father insists,that there are no dead ends.,Instead, he invites me into his space of co-healing,to give the very best of myself, and for him,to give the very best of himself to me.,Paralysis was an opening for him.,It was an opportunity to emerge,,to rekindle life force,,to sit still long enough with himself,so as to fall in love with the full continuum,of creation. 
 Today, my father is no longer locked in.,He moves his neck with ease,,has had his feeding peg removed,,breathes with his own lungs,,speaks slowly with his own quiet voice,,and works every day,to gain more movement in his paralyzed body.,But the work will never be finished.,As he says, "I'm living in a broken world,,and there is holy work to do." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Ten years ago,,I got a phone call thatnchanged my life.,At the time, I was ncardiologist at UCLA,,specializing in cardiac nimaging techniques.,The call came from a veterinariannat the Los Angeles Zoo.,An elderly female chimpanzee,had woken up with a facial droop,and the veterinarians were worriednthat she'd had a stroke.,They asked if I'd ncome to the zoo,and image the animal's heart,to look for a possiblencardiac cause. 
 Now, to be clear, North Americannzoos are staffed,by highly qualified, nboard-certified veterinarians,who take outstanding ncare of their animal patients.,But occasionally, they do reach into nthe human medical community,,particularly for some nspeciality consultation,,and I was one of the lucky physiciansnwho was invited in to help.,I had a chance to rule outna stroke in this chimpanzee,and make sure that this gorilla ndidn't have a torn aorta,,evaluate this macawnfor a heart murmur,,make sure that this California sea lion'snparicardium wasn't inflamed,,and in this picture, I'm listeningnto the heart of a lion,after a lifesaving, ncollaborative procedure,with veterinarians and physicians,where we drained 700 cc's of nfluid from the sac,in which this lion's nheart was contained.,And this procedure, which I havendone on many human patients,,was identical, with the exceptionnof that paw and that tail. 
 Now most of the time, I was workingnat UCLA Medical Center with physicians,,discussing symptomsnand diagnoses and treatments,for my human patients,,but some of the time,nI was working at the Los Angeles Zoo,with veterinarians, discussing nsymptoms and diagnoses and treatments,for their animal patients.,And occasionally, on nthe very same day,,I went on rounds at nUCLA Medical Center,and at the Los Angeles Zoo.,And here's what started comingninto very clear focus for me.,Physicians and veterinariansnwere essentially taking care,of the same disorders in their nanimal and human patients:,congestive heart failure, brain tumors,,leukemia, diabetes, narthritis, ALS, breast cancer,,even psychiatric syndromesnlike depression, anxiety,,compulsions, eating disordersnand self-injury. 
 Now, I've got a confession to make.,Even though I studied comparativenphysiology and evolutionary biology,as an undergrad --,I had even written my senior nthesis on Darwinian theory --,learning about the nsignificant overlap,between the disorders of nanimals and humans,,it came as a much needed nwake-up call for me.,So I started wondering,nwith all of these overlaps,,how was it that I had nevernthought to ask a veterinarian,,or consult the veterinary literature,,for insights into one nof my human patients?,Why had I never, nor had any of my nphysician friends and colleagues,whom I asked, ever attended na veterinary conference?,For that matter, why was nany of this a surprise?,I mean, look, every single physiciannaccepts some biological connection,between animals and humans.,Every medication that we prescribenor that we've taken ourselves,or we've given to our families,has first been tested on an animal. 
 But there's something very different,about giving an animal a nmedication or a human disease,and the animal developing ncongestive heart failure,or diabetes or breast cancer non their own.,Now, maybe some of the surprise,comes from the increasingnseparation in our world,between the urban and the nonurban.,You know, we hear about these city kids,who think that wool grows on trees,or that cheese comes from a plant.,Well, today's human hospitals,,increasingly, are turning into thesengleaming cathedrals of technology.,And this creates a psychologicalndistance between the human patients,who are being treated there,and animal patients whonare living in oceans,and farms and jungles. 
 But I think there's an neven deeper reason.,Physicians and scientists, we acceptnintellectually that our species,,Homo sapiens, is merely none species,,no more unique ornspecial than any other.,But in our hearts, we don't ncompletely believe that.,I feel it myself when I'm nlistening to Mozart,or looking at pictures of the nMars Rover on my MacBook.,I feel that tug of nhuman exceptionalism,,even as I recognize the nscientifically isolating cost,of seeing ourselves as ansuperior species, apart.,Well, I'm trying these days.,When I see a human patientnnow, I always ask,,what do the animal doctors knownabout this problem that I don't know?,And, might I be taking better ncare of my human patient,if I saw them as a humannanimal patient? 
 Here are a few examples of the nkind of exciting connections,that this kind of nthinking has led me to.,Fear-induced heart failure.,Around the year 2000,,human cardiologists "discovered"nemotionally induced heart failure.,It was described in a gambling father nwho had lost his life's savings,with a roll of the dice,,in a bride who'dnbeen left at the alter.,But it turns out, this n"new" human diagnosis,was neither new, nornwas it uniquely human.,Veterinarians had been diagnosing, ntreating and even preventing,emotionally inducednsymptoms in animals,ranging from monkeys to flamingos,nfrom to deer to rabbits,,since the 1970s.,How many human lives nmight have been saved,if this veterinary knowledgenhad been put into the hands,of E.R. docs and cardiologists? 
 Self-injury.,Some human patients nharm themselves.,Some pluck out patches of hair,,others actually cut themselves.,Some animal patients nalso harm themselves.,There are birds that npluck out feathers.,There are stallions that repetitivelynbite their flanks until they bleed.,But veterinarians have very specificnand very effective ways,of treating and evennpreventing self-injury,in their self-injuring animals.,Shouldn't this veterinary knowledgenbe put into the hands,of psychotherapists and nparents and patients,struggling with self-injury? 
 Postpartum depression and npostpartum psychosis.,Sometimes, soon after giving birth,,some women become depressed,,and sometimes they become seriously ndepressed and even psychotic.,They may neglect their newborn,,and in some extreme cases,,even harm the child.,Equine veterinarians alsonknow that occasionally,,a mare, soon after giving birth,,will neglect the foal,nrefusing to nurse,,and in some instances,nkick the foal, even to death.,But veterinarians have devised,an intervention to deal withnthis foal rejection syndrome,that involves increasing noxytocin in the mare.,Oxytocin is the bonding hormone,,and this leads to renewed interest,,on the part of the mare, in her foal.,Shouldn't this information,be put into the hands of ob/gyn's,and family doctors and patients,who are struggling with postpartumndepression and psychosis? 
 Well, despite all of this promise,,unfortunately the gulf betweennour fields remains large.,To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going nto have to air some dirty laundry.,Some physicians can be real snobs,about doctors who are not M.D.'s.,I'm talking about dentists and noptometrists and psychologists,,but maybe especially animal doctors.,Of course, most physiciansndon't realize that it is harder,to get into vet school thesendays than medical school,,and that when we go nto medical school,,we learn everything nthere is to know,about one species, Homo sapiens,,but veterinarians need to learnnabout health and disease,in mammals, amphibians,nreptiles, fish and birds.,So I don't blame the vetsnfor feeling annoyed,by my profession'sncondescension and ignorance.,But here's one from the vets:,What do you call a veterinarian,who can only take ncare of one species?,A physician. (Laughter) 
 Closing the gap has become na passion for me,,and I'm doing this nthrough programs,like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,,where we're bringing animal experts nand evolutionary biologists,and embedding themnon our medical teams,with our interns and our residents.,And through Zoobiquity conferences,,where we bring medical schools ntogether with veterinary schools,for collabortive discussions,of the shared diseases and disorders,of animal and human patients.,At Zoobiquity conferences,,participants learn how treatingnbreast cancer in a tiger,can help us better treat breast cancer,in a kindergarten teacher;,how understanding polycysticnoveries in a Holstein cow,can help us better take care,of a dance instructor nwith painful periods;,and how better understanding the ntreatment of separation anxiety,in a high-strung Sheltie,can help an anxious young childnstruggling with his first days of school. 
 In the United States and now ninternationally, at Zoobiquity conferences,physicians and veterinarians check ntheir attitudes and their preconceptions,at the door and come ntogether as colleagues,,as peers, as doctors.,After all, we humans nare animals, too,,and it's time for us physicians to embrace,our patients' and our own animal natures,and join veterinarians,in a species-spanning approach to health. 
 Because it turns out,,some of the best and nmost humanistic medicine,is being practiced by doctorsnwhose patients aren't human.,And one of the best ways nwe can take care,of the human patient is by npaying close attention,to how all the other npatients on the planet,live, grow, get sick and heal. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause).We are at a remarkable moment in time.,We face over the next two decades,two fundamental transformations,that will determine whether the next 100 years,is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. 
 Let me illustrate with an example.,I first visited Beijing 25 years ago,to teach at the People's University of China.,China was getting serious about market economics,and about university education,,so they decided to call in the foreign experts.,Like most other people,,I moved around Beijing by bicycle.,Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle,,it was a safe and easy way to get around.,Cycling in Beijing now,is a completely different prospect.,The roads are jammed by cars and trucks.,The air is dangerously polluted,from the burning of coal and diesel.,When I was there last in the spring,,there was an advisory for people of my age —,over 65 —,to stay indoors and not move much. 
 How did this come about?,It came from the way in which,Beijing has grown as a city.,It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled,,from 10 million to 20 million.,It's become a sprawling urban area,dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,,particularly coal.,China burns half the world's coal each year,,and that's why, it is a key reason why,,it is the world's largest emitter,of greenhouse gases.,At the same time, we have to recognize,that in that period China has grown remarkably.,It has become the world's second largest economy.,Hundreds of millions of people,have been lifted out of poverty.,That's really important.,But at the same time, the people of China,are asking the question:,What's the value of this growth,if our cities are unlivable?,They've analyzed, diagnosed,that this is an unsustainable path of growth,and development.,China's planning to scale back coal.,It's looking to build its cities in different ways. 
 Now, the growth of China,is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change,,in the structure of the world economy.,Just 25 years ago, the developing countries,,the poorer countries of the world,,were, notwithstanding beingnthe vast majority of the people,,they accounted for only about a third,of the world's output.,Now it's more than half;,25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds,from the countries that we saw 25 years ago,as developing.,That's a remarkable change.,It means that most countries around the world,,rich or poor, are going to be facing,the two fundamental transformations,that I want to talk about and highlight. 
 Now, the first of these transformations,is the basic structural change,of the economies and societies,that I've already begun to illustrate,through the description of Beijing.,Fifty percent now in urban areas.,That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.,Over the next two decades, we'll see,the demand for energy rise by 40 percent,,and the growth in the economy and in the population,is putting increasing pressure on our land,,on our water and on our forests. 
 This is profound structural change.,If we manage it in a negligent,or a shortsighted way,,we will create waste, pollution, congestion,,destruction of land and forests.,If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated,with my numbers — cities, energy, land —,if we manage all that badly,,then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods,of the people around the world,would be poor and damaged.,And more than that,,the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,,with immense risks to our climate.,Concentrations of greenhouse gases,in the atmosphere are already,higher than they've been for millions of years.,If we go on increasing those concentrations,,we risk temperatures over the next century or so,that we have not seen on this planet,for tens of millions of years.,We've been around as Homo sapiens —,that's a rather generous definition, sapiens —,for perhaps a quarter of a millionnyears, a quarter of a million.,We risk temperatures we haven't seen,for tens of millions of years over a century.,That would transform the relationship,between human beings and the planet.,It would lead to changing deserts,,changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,,changing sea levels,,hundreds of millions of people,,perhaps billions of people who would have to move,,and if we've learned anything from history,,that means severe and extended conflict. 
 And we couldn't just turn it off.,You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.,You can't negotiate with the laws of physics.,You're in there. You're stuck.,Those are the stakes we're playing for,,and that's why we have to makenthis second transformation,,the climate transformation,,and move to a low-carbon economy.,Now, the first of these transformations,is going to happen anyway.,We have to decide whether to do it well or badly,,the economic, or structural, transformation.,But the second of the transformations,,the climate transformations, we have to decide to do.,Those two transformations face us,in the next two decades.,The next two decades are decisive,for what we have to do.,Now, the more I've thought about this,,the two transformations coming together,,the more I've come to realize,that this is an enormous opportunity.,It's an opportunity which we can use,or it's an opportunity which we can lose.,And let me explain through those three key areas,that I've identified: cities, energy and land.,And let me start with cities.,I've already described the problems of Beijing:,pollution, congestion, waste and so on.,Surely we recognize that in many of our cities,around the world. 
 Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities,,you have to think ahead.,The cities that are going to be built —,and there are many, and many big ones —,we have to think of how to design them,in a compact way,so we can save travel time nand we can save energy.,The cities that already are nthere, well established,,we have to think about renewalnand investment in them,so that we can connect ourselves much better,within those cities, and make it easier,,encourage more people, to live closer to the center.,We've got examples building around the world,of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.,The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia,is a very important case of how to move around,safely and quickly in a non-polluting way,in a city: very frequent buses,,strongly protected routes, the same service, really,,as an underground railway system,,but much, much cheaper,and can be done much more quickly,,a brilliant idea in many more cities,around the world that's developing. 
 Now, some things in cities do take time.,Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.,Take my hometown, London.,In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people,and badly damaged the lives of many, many more.,And it happened all the time.,For those of you live outside London in the U.K.,will remember it used to be called The Smoke.,That's the way London was.,By regulating coal, within a few years,the problems of smog were rapidly reduced.,I remember the smogs well.,When the visibility dropped to [less] than,a few meters,,they stopped the buses and I had to walk.,This was the 1950s.,I had to walk home three miles from school.,Again, breathing was a hazardous activity.,But it was changed. It was changed by a decision.,Good decisions can bring good results,,striking results, quickly. 
 We've seen more: In London, we'venintroduced the congestion charge,,actually quite quickly and effectively,,and we've seen great improvements,in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.,You can see that the twontransformations I've described,,the structural and the climate,,come very much together.,But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,,and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,,we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,,more attractive cities, more productive cities,,and stronger community in those cities —,public transport, recycling, reusing,,all sorts of things that bring communities together.,We can do that, but we have to think,,we have to invest, we have to plan. 
 Let me turn to energy.,Now, energy over the last 25 years,has increased by about 50 percent.,Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.,Over the next 20 years,,perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.,We have to invest strongly in energy,,we have to use it much more efficiently,,and we have to make it clean.,We can see how to do that.,Take the example of California.,It would be in the top 10 countries in the world,if it was independent.,I don't want to start any —,(Laughter),California's a big place.,(Laughter),In the next five or six years,,they will likely move from,around 20 percent in renewables —,wind, solar and so on —,to over 33 percent,,and that would bring California back,to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020,to where they were in 1990,,a period when the economy in California,would more or less have doubled.,That's a striking achievement.,It shows what can be done.,Not just California — the nincoming government of India,is planning to get solar technology,to light up the homes,of 400 million people,who don't have electricity in India.,They've set themselves a target of five years.,I think they've got a good chance of doing that.,We'll see, but what you're seeing now,is people moving much more quickly.,Four hundred million, more than the population,of the United States.,Those are the kinds of ambitions now,people are setting themselves,in terms of rapidity of change.,Again, you can see,good decisions can bring quick results,,and those two transformations,nthe economy and the structure,and the climate and the low carbon,,are intimately intertwined.,Do the first one well, the structural,,the second one on the climate,becomes much easier. 
 Look at land,,land and particularly forests.,Forests are the hosts to valuable,plant and animal species.,They hold water in the soil,and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,,fundamental to the tackling of climate change.,But we're losing our forests.,In the last decade, we've lost a forest area,the size of Portugal,,and much more has been degraded.,But we're already seeing,that we can do so much about that.,We can recognize the problem, but we can also,understand how to tackle it.,In Brazil, the rate of deforestation,has been reduced by 70 percent,over the last 10 years.,How? By involving local communities,,investing in their agriculture and their economies,,by monitoring more carefully,,by enforcing the law more strictly. 
 And it's not just stopping deforestation.,That's of course of first and fundamental importance,,but it's also regrading degraded land,,regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.,I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.,It was desperately poor. In the following years,,it suffered devastating famines,and profoundly destructive social conflict.,Over the last few years, actually more than a few,,Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.,It has ambitions to be a middle-income country,15 years from now,and to be carbon neutral.,Again, I think it's a strong ambition,but it is a plausible one.,You're seeing that commitment there.,You're seeing what can be done.,Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.,It's working in the rehabilitation of land.,In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,,a wonderful project,to plant trees on degraded land,and work with local communities,on sustainable forest management,has led to big increases in living standards. 
 So we can see, from Beijing to London,,from California to India,,from Brazil to Ethiopia,,we do understand,how to manage those two transformations,,the structural and the climate.,We do understand how to manage those well.,And technology is changing very rapidly.,I don't have to list all those things,to an audience like this,,but you can see the electric cars,,you can see the batteries using new materials.,You can see that we can manage remotely now,our household appliances on ournmobile phones when we're away.,You can see better insulation.,And there's much more coming. 
 But, and it's a big but,,the world as a whole,is moving far too slowly.,We're not cutting emissions in the way we should.,We're not managing those structural transformations,as we can.,The depth of understanding of thenimmense risks of climate change,are not there yet.,The depth of understanding,of the attractiveness of what we can do,is not there yet.,We need political pressure to build.,We need leaders to step up.,We can have better growth,,better climate, a better world.,We can make,,by managing those two transformations well,,the next 100 years the best of centuries.,If we make a mess of it,,we, you and me, if we make a mess of it,,if we don't manage those transformations properly,,it will be, the next 100 years,will be the worst of centuries.,That's the major conclusion,of the report on the economy and climate,chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico,,and I co-chaired that with him,,and we handed that report yesterday,here in New York, in the United Nations Building,to the Secretary-General of the U.N.,,Ban Ki-moon.,We know that we can do this. 
 Now, two weeks ago,,I became a grandfather for the fourth time.,Our daughter —,(Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) —,Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York,two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa.,(Applause),Two weeks old.,Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye,and tell them that we understood the issues,,that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities,,and still we failed to act?,Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years,the best of centuries. 
 (Applause)This is my niece, Stella.,She's just turned one and started to walk.,And she's walking in that really cool way thatnone-year-olds do,,a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving-ntoo-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.,It is absolutely gorgeous.,And one of her favorite nthings to do at the moment,is to stare at herself in the mirror.,She absolutely loves her reflection.,She giggles and squeals, and givesnherself these big, wet kisses.,It is beautiful.,Apparently, all of her friends do this and my momntells me that I used to do this,,and it got me thinking:,When did I stop doing this?,When is it suddenly not okay to love nthe way that we look?,Because apparently we don't. 
 Ten thousand people every month google,,"Am I ugly?",This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she nlives in Denver.,And like any teenager, she just wants to nbe liked and to fit in.,It's Sunday night.,She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.,And she's slightly dreading it, and nshe's a bit confused because,despite her mom telling her all the time,that she's beautiful,,every day at school, someone tells her nthat she's ugly.,Because of the difference between what her mom ntells her and what her friends,at school, or her peers at school are telling her,,she doesn't know who to believe.,So, she takes a video of herself. nShe posts it to YouTube,and she asks people to please leave na comment:,"Am I pretty or am I ugly?",Well, so far, Faye has received nover 13,000 comments.,Some of them are so nasty, they don't nbear thinking about.,This is an average, healthy-looking nteenage girl receiving this feedback,at one of the most emotionally vulnerablentimes in her life.,Thousands of people are posting videos like this,,mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.,But what's leading them to do this? 
 Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.,They're under pressure to be onlinenand available at all times,,talking, messaging, liking, commenting, nsharing, posting —,it never ends.,Never before have we been so connected,,so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.,And as one mom told me, it's like there's a partynin their bedroom every night.,There's simply no privacy.,And the social pressures that go along nwith that are relentless.,This always-on environment is trainingnour kids to value themselves,based on the number of likes they get,and the types of comments that they receive.,There's no separation between online and offline life.,What's real or what isn't is reallynhard to tell the difference between.,And it's also really hard to tell the difference nbetween what's authentic,and what's digitally manipulated.,What's a highlight in someone's life versusnwhat's normal in the context of everyday. 
 And where are they looking to for inspiration?,Well, you can see the kinds of imagesnthat are covering the newsfeeds,of girls today.,Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.,Airbrushing is now routine.,And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,,#bikinibridge and #proana.,For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.,These trends are teamed with the nstereotyping and flagrant objectification,of women in today's popular culture.,It is not hard to see what girls arenbenchmarking themselves against.,But boys are not immune to this either.,Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packsnof superhero-like sports stars,and playboy music artists. 
 But, what's the problem with all of this?,Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, nwell balanced individuals.,But in an image-obsessed culture, we arentraining our kids,to spend more time and mental effort on ntheir appearance,at the expense of all of the other aspectsnof their identities.,So, things like their relationships, the developmentnof their physical abilities,,and their studies and so on begin to suffer.,Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do nsomething because they don't,think they look good enough.,These are not trivial activities.,These are fundamental activities to theirndevelopment as humans,and as contributors to society and to nthe workforce.,Thirty-one percent, nearly one in nthree teenagers, are withdrawing,from classroom debate. They're failing,to engage in classroom debate because,they don't want to draw attention to the nway that they look.,One in five are not showing up to class at all,on days when they don't feel good about it.,And when it comes to exams,,if you don't think you look good enough,,specifically if you don't think you are thin enough,,you will score a lower grade point average,than your peers who are not concerned with this.,And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.,and China, and is true regardless of how muchnyou actually weigh.,So to be super clear, we're talking about the,way you think you look, not hownyou actually look.,Low body confidence is undermining nacademic achievement. 
 But it's also damaging health.,Teenagers with low body confidencendo less physical activity,,eat less fruits and vegetables,,partake in more unhealthy weight controlnpractices,that can lead to eating disorders.,They have lower self-esteem.,They're more easily influenced by people around them,and they're at greater risk of depression.,And we think it's for all of these reasonsnthat they take more risks,with things like alcohol and drug use;,crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; nunprotected, earlier sex;,and self-harm.,The pursuit of the perfect body is puttingnpressure on our healthcare systems,and costing our governments billions of ndollars every year. 
 And we don't grow out of it.,Women who think they're overweight — again,,regardless of whether they are or are not —,have higher rates of absenteeism.,Seventeen percent of women would,not show up to a job interview on,a day when they weren't feeling confidentnabout the way that they look. 
 Have a think about what this is doing,to our economy.,If we could overcome this, what that,opportunity looks like.,Unlocking this potential is in the interest,of every single one of us. 
 But how do we do that?,Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.,It's not enough by itself.,If you actually want to make a difference,,you have to do something.,And we've learned there are three key ways:,The first is we have to educate for body confidence.,We have to help our teenagers develop,strategies to overcome image-related pressures,and build their self-esteem.,Now, the good news is that there are,many programs out there availablento do this.,The bad news is that most of them don't work.,I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning,programs are inadvertently actually,making the situation worse.,So we need to make damn sure that,the programs that our kids are receiving,are not only having a positive impact,,but having a lasting impact as well. 
 And the research shows nthat the best programs,address six key areas:,The first is the influence of family, nfriends and relationships.,The second is media and celebrity culture,,then how to handle teasing and bullying,,the way we compete and compare withnone another,based on looks,,talking about appearance — some people,call this "body talk" or "fat talk" —,and finally, the foundations of respecting,and looking after yourself.,These six things are crucial starting points,for anyone serious about delivering,body-confidence education that works.,An education is critical,,but tackling this problem is going,to require each and everyone of us,to step up and be better role models,for the women and girls in our own lives.,Challenging the status quo of how,women are seen and talked about innour own circles. 
 It is not okay that we judge the contribution,of our politicians by their haircuts,or the size of their breasts,,or to infer that the determination or the success,of an Olympian is down nto her not being a looker.,We need to start judging people by what they do,,not what they look like. 
 We can all start by taking responsibility nfor the types of pictures,and comments that we post,on our own social networks.,We can compliment people based on ntheir effort,and their actions,and not on their appearance. 
 And let me ask you,,when was the last time that you,kissed a mirror?,Ultimately, we need to work together,as communities, as governments,and as businesses to really changenthis culture of ours,so that our kids grow up valuing their nwhole selves,,valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.,We need to put the people that arenmaking a real difference,on our pedestals, making a difference,in the real world.,Giving them the airtime, because only then,will we create a different world.,A world where our kids are free to become,the best versions of themselves,,where the way they think they look,never holds them back from beingnwho they are,or achieving what they want in life. 
 Think about what this might mean nfor someone in your life.,Who have you got in mind?,Is it your wife?,Your sister?,Your daughter?,Your niece?,Your friend? It could just be the woman na couple of seats away,from you today.,What would it mean for her,if she were freed from that voice,of her inner critic, nagging her to have,longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,,shorter feet?,What could it mean for her if we overcame this,and unlocked her potential in that way? 
 Right now, our culture's obsession,with image is holding us all back.,But let's show our kids the truth.,Let's show them that the way you look,is just one part of your identity,and that the truth is we love them,for who they are,and what they do,and how they make us feel.,Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.,Let's each and every one of us change the way,we talk and compare ourselves to other people.,And let's work together as communities,,from grassroots to governments,,so that the happy little one-year-olds,of today become the confident,changemakers of tomorrow.,Let's do this.,(Applause)Sleep.,It's something we spend aboutna third of our lives doing,,but do any of us really understand what it's all about? 
 Two thousand years ago, Galen,,one of the most prominent medical researchers,of the ancient world,,proposed that while we're awake,,our brain's motive force, its juice,,would flow out to all the other parts of the body,,animating them but leaving the brain all dried up,,and he thought that when we sleep,,all this moisture that filled the rest of the body,would come rushing back,,rehydrating the brain,and refreshing the mind.,Now, that sounds completely ridiculous to us now,,but Galen was simply trying to explain,something about sleep,that we all deal with every day.,See, we all know based on our own experience,that when you sleep, it clears your mind,,and when you don't sleep,,it leaves your mind murky.,But while we know a great deal more about sleep now,than when Galen was around,,we still haven't understood why it is that sleep,,of all of our activities, has this incredible,restorative function for the mind. 
 So today I want to tell you about,some recent research,that may shed new light on this question.,We've found that sleep may actually be,a kind of elegant design solution,to some of the brain's most basic needs,,a unique way that the brain,meets the high demands and the narrow margins,that set it apart from all the other organs of the body. 
 So almost all the biology that we observe,can be thought of as a series of problems,and their corresponding solutions,,and the first problem that every organ must solve,is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel,all those cells of the body.,In the brain, that is especially critical;,its intense electrical activity uses up,a quarter of the body's entire energy supply,,even though the brain accounts,for only about two percent of the body's mass.,So the circulatory system,solves the nutrient delivery problem,by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients,and oxygen to every corner of our body. 
 You can actually see it in this video here.,Here, we're imaging blood vessels,in the brain of a living mouse.,The blood vessels form a complex network,that fills the entire brain volume.,They start at the surface of the brain,,and then they dive down into the tissue itself,,and as they spread out, they supply nutrients,and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain. 
 Now, just as every cell requires,nutrients to fuel it,,every cell also produces waste as a byproduct,,and the clearance of that waste,is the second basic problem,that each organ has to solve.,This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system,,which has evolved to meet this need.,It's a second parallel network of vessels,that extends throughout the body.,It takes up proteins and other waste,from the spaces between the cells,,it collects them, and then dumps them into the blood,so they can be disposed of. 
 But if you look really closely at this diagram,,you'll see something,that doesn't make a lot of sense.,So if we were to zoom into this guy's head,,one of the things that you would see there,is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain.,But that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?,I mean, the brain is this intensely active organ,that produces a correspondinglynlarge amount of waste,that must be efficiently cleared.,And yet, it lacks lymphatic vessels, which means that,the approach that the rest of the body takes,to clearing away its waste,won't work in the brain. 
 So how, then, does the brain solve,its waste clearance problem?,Well, that seemingly mundane question,is where our group first jumped into this story,,and what we found,as we dove down into the brain,,down among the neurons and the blood vessels,,was that the brain's solution,to the problem of waste clearance,,it was really unexpected.,It was ingenious,,but it was also beautiful.,Let me tell you about what we found. 
 So the brain has this large pool,of clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid.,We call it the CSF.,The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain,,and wastes from inside the brain,make their way out to the CSF,,which gets dumped, along with nthe waste, into the blood.,So in that way, it sounds a lot like,the lymphatic system, doesn't it?,But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste,from inside the brain,,they don't just percolate their way randomly,out to these pools of CSF.,Instead, there is a specialized network of plumbing,that organizes and facilitates this process.,You can see that in these videos.,Here, we're again imaging into the brain,of living mice.,The frame on your left shows,what's happening at the brain's surface,,and the frame on your right shows,what's happening down below the surface of the brain,within the tissue itself.,We've labeled the blood vessels in red,,and the CSF that's surrounding the brain,will be in green.,Now, what was surprising to us,was that the fluid on the outside of the brain,,it didn't stay on the outside.,Instead, the CSF was pumped back into,and through the brain,along the outsides of the blood vessels,,and as it flushed down into the brain,along the outsides of these vessels,,it was actually helping to clear away,,to clean the waste from the spaces,between the brain's cells.,If you think about it,,using the outsides of these blood vessels like this,is a really clever design solution,,because the brain is enclosed,in a rigid skull,and it's packed full of cells,,so there is no extra space inside it,for a whole second set of vesselsnlike the lymphatic system.,Yet the blood vessels,,they extend from the surface of the brain,down to reach every single cell in the brain,,which means that fluid,that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels,can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume,,so it's actually this really clever way,to repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels,,to take over and replace the function,of a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels,,to make it so you don't need them.,And what's amazing is that no other organ,takes quite this approach,to clearing away the waste from between its cells.,This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain. 
 But our most surprising finding,was that all of this,,everything I just told you about,,with all this fluid rushing through the brain,,it's only happening in the sleeping brain.,Here, the video on the left,shows how much of the CSF is moving,through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake.,It's almost nothing.,Yet in the same animal,,if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep,,what we see is that the CSF,is rushing through the brain,,and we discovered that at the same time,when the brain goes to sleep,,the brain cells themselves seem to shrink,,opening up spaces in between them,,allowing fluid to rush through,and allowing waste to be cleared out. 
 So it seems that Galen may actually have been,sort of on the right track when he wrote about,fluid rushing through the brain,when sleep came on.,Our own research, now it's 2,000 years later,,suggests that what's happening is that,when the brain is awake,and is at its most busy,,it puts off clearing away the waste,from the spaces between its cells until later,,and then, when it goes to sleep,and doesn't have to be as busy,,it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode,to clear away the waste,from the spaces between its cells,,the waste that's accumulated throughout the day.,So it's actually a little bit like how you or I,,we put off our household chores during the work week,when we don't have time to get to it,,and then we play catch up on allnthe cleaning that we have to do,when the weekend rolls around. 
 Now, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance,,but I haven't been very specific,about the kinds of waste,that the brain needs to be clearing,during sleep in order to stay healthy.,The waste product that these recent studies,focused most on is amyloid-beta,,which is a protein that's madenin the brain all the time.,My brain's making amyloid-beta right now,,and so is yours.,But in patients with Alzheimer's disease,,amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates,in the spaces between the brain's cells,,instead of being cleared away nlike it's supposed to be,,and it's this buildup of amyloid-beta,that's thought to be one of the key steps,in the development of that terrible disease.,So we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared,from the brain when it's awake,versus when it's asleep,,and we found that indeed,,the clearance of amyloid-beta,is much more rapid from the sleeping brain. 
 So if sleep, then,,is part of the brain's solution,to the problem of waste clearance,,then this may dramatically change how we think,about the relationship between sleep,,amyloid-beta, and Alzheimer's disease.,A series of recent clinical studies,suggest that among patients,who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease,,worsening sleep quality and sleep duration,are associated with a greater amount,of amyloid-beta building up in the brain,,and while it's important to point out,that these studies don't prove,that lack of sleep or poor sleep,cause Alzheimer's disease,,they do suggest that the failure of the brain,to keep its house clean,by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta,may contribute to the development,of conditions like Alzheimer's. 
 So what this new research tells us, then,,is that the one thing that all of you,already knew about sleep,,that even Galen understood about sleep,,that it refreshes and clears the mind,,may actually be a big part,of what sleep is all about.,See, you and I, we go to sleep,every single night,,but our brains, they never rest.,While our body is still,and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere,,the elegant machinery of the brain,is quietly hard at work,cleaning and maintaining,this unimaginably complex machine.,Like our housework,,it's a dirty and a thankless job,,but it's also important.,In your house, if you stop cleaning your kitchen,for a month,,your home will become completely unlivable,very quickly.,But in the brain, the consequences,of falling behind may be much greater,than the embarrassment of dirty countertops,,because when it comes to cleaning the brain,,it is the very health and function,of the mind and the body that's at stake,,which is why understanding these,very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today,may be critical for preventing and treating,diseases of the mind tomorrow. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)They told me that I'm a traitornto my own profession,,that I should be fired,,have my medical license taken away,,that I should go back to my own country.,My email got hacked.,In a discussion forum for other doctors,,someone took creditnfor "Twitter-bombing" my account.,Now, I didn't know if thisnwas a good or bad thing,,but then came the response:,"Too bad it wasn't a real bomb." 
 I never thought that I would do something,that would provoke this level of angernamong other doctors.,Becoming a doctor was my dream.,I grew up in China,,and my earliest memoriesnare of being rushed to the hospital,because I had such bad asthmanthat I was there nearly every week.,I had this one doctor, Dr. Sam,nwho always took care of me.,She was about the same age as my mother.,She had this wild, curly hair,,and she always worenthese bright yellow flowery dresses.,She was one of those doctors who,,if you fell and you broke your arm,,she would ask you why you weren't laughing,because it's your humerus. Get it?,See, you'd groan,,but she'd always make you feel betternafter having seen her.,Well, we all have that childhood hero,that we want to grow upnto be just like, right?,Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.,When I was eight,nmy parents and I moved to the U.S.,,and ours becamenthe typical immigrant narrative.,My parents cleaned hotel roomsnand washed dishes and pumped gas,so that I could pursue my dream.,Well, eventually I learned enough English,,and my parents were so happy,the day that I got into medical schoolnand took my oath of healing and service. 
 But then one day, everything changed.,My mother called me to tell menthat she wasn't feeling well,,she had a cough that wouldn't go away,nshe was short of breath and tired.,Well, I knew that my mother was someonenwho never complained about anything.,For her to tell menthat something was the matter,,I knew something had to be really wrong.,And it was:,We found out that she hadnstage IV breast cancer,,cancer that by then had spreadnto her lungs, her bones, and her brain.,My mother was brave,nthough, and she had hope.,She went through surgery and radiation,,and was on her third round of chemotherapy,when she lost her address book.,She tried to look up her oncologist'snphone number on the Internet,and she found it,nbut she found something else too.,On several websites,,he was listed as a highly paidnspeaker to a drug company,,and in fact often spoke on behalf,of the same chemo regimennthat he had prescribed her.,She called me in a panic,,and I didn't know what to believe.,Maybe this was the rightnchemo regimen for her,,but maybe it wasn't.,It made her scared and it made her doubt.,When it comes to medicine,,having that trust is a must,,and when that trust is gone,nthen all that's left is fear. 
 There's another side to this fear.,As a medical student, I was taking carenof this 19-year-old,who was biking back to his dorm,when he got struck and hit,,run over by an SUV.,He had seven broken ribs,,shattered hip bones,,and he was bleeding insidenhis belly and inside his brain.,Now, imagine being his parents,who flew in from Seattle,n2,000 miles away,,to find their son in a coma.,I mean, you'd want to find outnwhat's going on with him, right?,They asked to attend our bedside rounds,where we discussednhis condition and his plan,,which I thought was a reasonable request,,and also would give usna chance to show them,how much we were tryingnand how much we cared.,The head doctor, though, said no.,He gave all kinds of reasons.,Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.,Maybe they'll stop studentsnfrom asking questions.,He even said,,"What if they see mistakes and sue us?",What I saw behind every excusenwas deep fear,,and what I learnednwas that to become a doctor,,we have to put on our white coats,,put up a wall, and hide behind it.,There's a hidden epidemic in medicine.,Of course, patients are scarednwhen they come to the doctor.,Imagine you wake upnwith this terrible bellyache,,you go to the hospital,,you're lying in this strange place,nyou're on this hospital gurney,,you're wearing this flimsy gown,,strangers are comingnto poke and prod at you.,You don't know what's going to happen.,You don't even know if you're going to getnthe blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago.,But it's not just patients who are scared;,doctors are scared too.,We're scared of patientsnfinding out who we are,and what medicine is all about.,And so what do we do?,We put on our white coatsnand we hide behind them.,Of course, the more we hide,,the more people want to knownwhat it is that we're hiding.,The more fear then spiralsninto mistrust and poor medical care.,We don't just have a fear of sickness,,we have a sickness of fear. 
 Can we bridge this disconnect,between what patients neednand what doctors do?,Can we overcome the sickness of fear?,Let me ask you differently:,If hiding isn't the answer,nwhat if we did the opposite?,What if doctors were to becomentotally transparent with their patients? 
 Last fall, I conductedna research study to find out,what it is that people wantnto know about their healthcare.,I didn't just want to studynpatients in a hospital,,but everyday people.,So my two medical students,nSuhavi Tucker and Laura Johns,,literally took their researchnto the streets.,They went to banks,ncoffee shops, senior centers,,Chinese restaurants and train stations.,What did they find?,Well, when we asked people,,"What do you want to knownabout your healthcare?",people responded with what they wantnto know about their doctors,,because people understand health care,to be the individual interactionnbetween them and their doctors.,When we asked, "What do younwant to know about your doctors?",people gave three different answers.,Some want to knownthat their doctor is competent,and certified to practice medicine.,Some want to be surenthat their doctor is unbiased,and is making decisionsnbased on evidence and science,,not on who pays them.,Surprisingly to us,,many people want to knownsomething else about their doctors.,Jonathan, a 28-year-old law student,,says he wants to find someonenwho is comfortable with LGBTQ patients,and specializes in LGBT health.,Serena, a 32-year-old accountant,,says that it's important to hernfor her doctor to share her values,when it comes to reproductive choicenand women's rights.,Frank, a 59-year-oldnhardware store owner,,doesn't even like going to the doctor,and wants to find someonenwho believes in prevention first,,but who is comfortablenwith alternative treatments.,One after another,nour respondents told us,that that doctor-patient relationshipnis a deeply intimate one —,that to show their doctors their bodies,and tell them their deepest secrets,,they want to first understandntheir doctor's values.,Just because doctorsnhave to see every patient,doesn't mean that patientsnhave to see every doctor.,People want to knownabout their doctors first,so that they can make an informed choice. 
 As a result of this, I formed a campaign,,Who's My Doctor?,that calls for totalntransparency in medicine.,Participating doctors voluntarily disclose,on a public website,not just informationnabout where we went to medical school,and what specialty we're in,,but also our conflicts of interest.,We go beyondnthe Government in the Sunshine Act,about drug company affiliations,,and we talk about how we're paid.,Incentives matter.,If you go to your doctornbecause of back pain,,you might want to know he's getting paidn5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery,versus 25 dollars to refer younto see a physical therapist,,or if he's getting paid the same thingnno matter what he recommends.,Then, we go one step further.,We add our valuesnwhen it comes to women's health,,LGBT health, alternative medicine,,preventive health,nand end-of-life decisions.,We pledge to our patientsnthat we are here to serve you,,so you have a right to know who we are.,We believe that transparencyncan be the cure for fear. 
 I thought some doctors would sign onnand others wouldn't,,but I had no idea of the huge backlashnthat would ensue.,Within one week of startingnWho's My Doctor?,Medscape's public forum,and several online doctors' communities,had thousands of posts about this topic.,Here are a few. 
 From a gastroenterologist in Portland:,"I devoted 12 years of my lifento being a slave.,I have loans and mortgages.,I depend on lunches fromndrug companies to serve patients.",Well, times may be hard for everyone,,but try telling your patient,making 35,000 dollars a yearnto serve a family of four,that you need the free lunch. 
 From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:,"I find it an invasion of my privacynto disclose where my income comes from.,My patients don't disclosentheir incomes to me.",But your patients' sources of incomendon't affect your health. 
 From a psychiatrist in New York City:,"Pretty soon we will have to disclosenwhether we prefer cats to dogs,,what model of car we drive,,and what toilet paper we use.",Well, how you feelnabout Toyotas or Cottonelle,won't affect your patients' health,,but your viewsnon a woman's right to choose,and preventive medicinenand end-of-life decisions just might.,And my favorite,nfrom a Kansas City cardiologist:,"More government-mandated stuff?,Dr. Wen needs to movenback to her own country.",Well, two pieces of good news.,First of all, this is meant to benvoluntary and not mandatory,,and second of all, I'm Americannand I'm already here.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 Within a month, my employersnwere getting calls,asking for me to be fired.,I received mailnat my undisclosed home address,with threats to contactnthe medical board to sanction me.,My friends and family urged mento quit this campaign.,After the bomb threat, I was done.,But then I heard from patients.,Over social media, a TweetChat,,which I'd learned what that was by then,,generated 4.3 million impressions,,and thousands of people wrotento encourage me to continue.,They wrote with things like,,"If doctors are doing somethingnthey're that ashamed of,,they shouldn't be doing it.","Elected officials have to disclosencampaign contributions.,Lawyers have to disclosenconflicts of interests.,Why shouldn't doctors?",And finally, many people wrote and said,,"Let us patients decide,what's importantnwhen we're choosing a doctor.",In our initial trial,,over 300 doctors have takennthe total transparency pledge.,What a crazy new idea, right?,But actually, this is notnthat new of a concept at all.,Remember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China,,with the goofy jokes and the wild hair?,Well, she was my doctor,,but she was also our neighbor,who lived in the buildingnacross the street.,I went to the same school as her daughter.,My parents and I trusted her,because we knew who she wasnand what she stood for,,and she had no need to hide from us.,Just one generation ago,nthis was the norm in the U.S. as well.,You knew that your family doctornwas the father of two teenage boys,,that he quit smoking a few years ago,,that he says he's a regular churchgoer,,but you see him twice a year:nonce at Easter,and once when his mother-in-lawncomes to town.,You knew what he was about,,and he had no need to hide from you.,But the sickness of fear has taken over,,and patients suffer the consequences. 
 I know this firsthand.,My mother foughtnher cancer for eight years.,She was a planner,,and she thought a lotnabout how she wanted to live,and how she wanted to die.,Not only did she sign advance directives,,she wrote a 12-page documentnabout how she had suffered enough,,how it was time for her to go.,One day, when I was a resident physician,,I got a call to say that she wasnin the intensive care unit.,By the time I got there,nshe was about to be intubated,and put on a breathing machine.,"But this is not what she wants,"nI said, "and we have documents.",The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye,,pointed at my then 16-year-oldnsister, and said,,"Do you remember when you were that age?,How would you have liked to grow upnwithout your mother?",Her oncologist was there too, and said,,"This is your mother.,Can you really face yourselfnfor the rest of your life,if you don't do everything for her?",I knew my mother so well.,I understood whatnher directives meant so well,,but I was a physician.,That was the single hardestndecision I ever made,,to let her die in peace,,and I carry those wordsnof those doctors with me,every single day. 
 We can bridge the disconnect,between what doctors donand what patients need.,We can get there,nbecause we've been there before,,and we know that transparencyngets us to that trust.,Research has shown usnthat openness also helps doctors,,that having open medical records,,being willing to talknabout medical errors,,will increase patient trust,,improve health outcomes,,and reduce malpractice.,That openness, that trust,,is only going to be more important,as we move from the infectiousnto the behavioral model of disease.,Bacteria may not care so muchnabout trust and intimacy,,but for people to tacklenthe hard lifestyle choices,,to address issues like smoking cessation,,blood-pressure managementnand diabetes control,,well, that requires us to establish trust. 
 Here's what other transparentndoctors have said. 
 Brandon Combs, an internist in Denver:,"This has brought mencloser to my patients.,The type of relationship I've developed —,that's why I entered medicine." 
 Aaron Stupple, an internist in Denver:,"I tell my patientsnthat I am totally open with them.,I don't hide anything from them.,This is me. Now tell me about you.,We're in this together." 
 May Nguyen, a family physician in Houston:,"My colleagues are astoundednby what I'm doing.,They ask me how I could be so brave.,I said, I'm not being brave,,it's my job." 
 I leave you today with a final thought.,Being totally transparent is scary.,You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,,but that vulnerability, that humility,,it can be an extraordinary benefitnto the practice of medicine.,When doctors are willingnto step off our pedestals,,take off our white coats,,and show our patients who we arenand what medicine is all about,,that's when we beginnto overcome the sickness of fear.,That's when we establish trust.,That's when we changenthe paradigm of medicine,from one of secrecy and hiding,to one that is fully open and engaged,for our patients. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The first patient to ever be ntreated with an antibiotic,was a policeman in Oxford.,On his day off from work,,he was scratched by a rose thornnwhile working in the garden.,That small scratch became infected.,Over the next few days, nhis head was swollen,with abscesses,,and in fact his eye was so infected,that they had to take it out,,and by February of 1941,,this poor man was on the verge of dying.,He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,,and fortunately for him,,a small team of doctors,led by a Dr. Howard Florey,had managed to synthesize,a very small amount of penicillin,,a drug that had been discovered,12 years before by Alexander Fleming,but had never actually been nused to treat a human,,and indeed no one even nknew if the drug would work,,if it was full of impurities nthat would kill the patient,,but Florey and his team figured,if they had to use it, nthey might as well use it,on someone who was going to die anyway. 
 So they gave Albert Alexander,,this Oxford policeman, the drug,,and within 24 hours,,he started getting better.,His fever went down, nhis appetite came back.,Second day, he was doing much better.,They were starting to nrun out of penicillin,,so what they would do nwas run with his urine,across the road to re-synthesize nthe penicillin from his urine,and give it back to him,,and that worked.,Day four, well on the way to recovery.,This was a miracle.,Day five, they ran out of penicillin,,and the poor man died. 
 So that story didn't end that well,,but fortunately for nmillions of other people,,like this child who was treated nagain in the early 1940s,,who was again dying of a sepsis,,and within just six days, you can see,,recovered thanks to this nwonder drug, penicillin.,Millions have lived,,and global health has been transformed.,Now, antibiotics have been used,for patients like this,,but they've also been nused rather frivolously,in some instances,,for treating someone nwith just a cold or the flu,,which they might not have nresponded to an antibiotic,,and they've also been nused in large quantities,sub-therapeutically, whichnmeans in small concentrations,,to make chicken and hogs grow faster.,Just to save a few penniesnon the price of meat,,we've spent a lot of nantibiotics on animals,,not for treatment, not for sick animals,,but primarily for growth promotion. 
 Now, what did that lead us to?,Basically, the massive use of antibiotics,around the world,has imposed such largenselection pressure on bacteria,that resistance is now a problem,,because we've now selected for just,the resistant bacteria. 
 And I'm sure you've all readnabout this in the newspapers,,you've seen this in every magazine,that you come across,,but I really want you to appreciate,the significance of this problem.,This is serious.,The next slide I'm about to show you is nof carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter.,Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug,,and carbapenem is pretty much,the strongest class of antibiotics,that we can throw at this bug.,And you can see in 1999,this is the pattern of resistance,,mostly under about 10 percentnacross the United States.,Now watch what happens nwhen we play the video. 
 So I don't know where you live,,but wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now,than it was in 1999,,and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.,It's a global issue,affecting both rich and poor countries,,and at the heart of it, nyou might say, well,,isn't this really just a medical issue?,If we taught doctors how not nto use antibiotics as much,,if we taught patients how nnot to demand antibiotics,,perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,,and maybe the pharmaceutical companies,should be working harder to develop,more antibiotics.,Now, it turns out that there's something nfundamental about antibiotics,which makes it different from other drugs,,which is that if I misuse antibiotics,or I use antibiotics,,not only am I affected but nothers are affected as well,,in the same way as if I nchoose to drive to work,or take a plane to go somewhere,,that the costs I impose on others,through global climate change go everywhere,,and I don't necessarily takenthese costs into consideration.,This is what economists might ncall a problem of the commons,,and the problem of the commons is exactly,what we face in the case nof antibiotics as well:,that we don't consider —,and we, including individuals, patients,,hospitals, entire health systems —,do not consider the costs nthat they impose on others,by the way antibiotics are actually used. 
 Now, that's a problem that's similar,to another area that we all know about,,which is of fuel use and energy,,and of course energy use,both depletes energy as well as,leads to local pollution nand climate change.,And typically, in the case of energy,,there are two ways in whichnyou can deal with the problem.,One is, we can make betternuse of the oil that we have,,and that's analogous to making better use,of existing antibiotics,,and we can do this in a number of ways,that we'll talk about in a second,,but the other option is the n"drill, baby, drill" option,,which in the case of antibiotics nis to go find new antibiotics. 
 Now, these are not separate.,They're related, because if we invest heavily,in new oil wells,,we reduce the incentives nfor conservation of oil,in the same way that's going nto happen for antibiotics.,The reverse is also going nto happen, which is that,if we use our antibiotics appropriately,,we don't necessarily have nto make the investments,in new drug development. 
 And if you thought that these two were entirely,,fully balanced between these two options,,you might consider the fact that,this is really a game that we're playing.,The game is really one of coevolution,,and coevolution is, in nthis particular picture,,between cheetahs and gazelles.,Cheetahs have evolved to run faster,,because if they didn't run faster,,they wouldn't get any lunch.,Gazelles have evolved to run faster because,if they don't run faster, they would be lunch.,Now, this is the game we'renplaying against the bacteria,,except we're not the cheetahs,,we're the gazelles,,and the bacteria would,,just in the course of this little talk,,would have had kids and grandkids,and figured out how to be resistant,just by selection and trial and error,,trying it over and over again.,Whereas how do we stay nahead of the bacteria?,We have drug discovery processes,,screening molecules,,we have clinical trials,,and then, when we think we have a drug,,then we have the FDA regulatory process.,And once we go through all of that,,then we try to stay one step ahead,of the bacteria. 
 Now, this is clearly not a ngame that can be sustained,,or one that we can win,by simply innovating to stay ahead.,We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down,,and there are ideas that we ncan borrow from energy,that are helpful in thinking about,how we might want to do this in the case,of antibiotics as well.,Now, if you think about how we deal with,energy pricing, for instance,,we consider emissions taxes,,which means we're imposing nthe costs of pollution,on people who actually use that energy.,We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,,and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics,actually get used appropriately.,There are clean energy subsidies,,which are to switch to fuelsnwhich don't pollute as much,or perhaps don't need fossil fuels.,Now, the analogy here is, perhaps we need,to move away from using antibiotics,,and if you think about it, what are ngood substitutes for antibiotics?,Well, turns out that anything that reduces,the need for the antibiotic would really work,,so that could include improvingnhospital infection control,or vaccinating people,,particularly against nthe seasonal influenza.,And the seasonal flu is probably,the biggest driver of antibiotic use,,both in this country as wellnas in many other countries,,and that could really help.,A third option might includensomething like tradeable permits.,And these seem like faraway scenarios,,but if you consider the nfact that we might not,have antibiotics for many npeople who have infections,,we might consider the fact that we might,want to allocate who actually gets to use,some of these antibiotics over others,,and some of these might have tonbe on the basis of clinical need,,but also on the basis of pricing.,And certainly consumer education works.,Very often, people overuse antibiotics,or prescribe too much without necessarily,knowing that they do so,,and feedback mechanisms,have been found to be useful,,both on energy —,When you tell someone that they're using,a lot of energy during peak hour,,they tend to cut back,,and the same sort of example has been performed,even in the case of antibiotics.,A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up,on a chart the names of surgeons,in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used,in the previous month,,and this was purely an ninformational feedback,,there was no shaming,,but essentially that provided nsome information back,to surgeons that maybe they could rethink,how they were using antibiotics. 
 Now, there's a lot that can be done,on the supply side as well.,If you look at the price of penicillin,,the cost per day is about 10 cents.,It's a fairly cheap drug.,If you take drugs that havenbeen introduced since then —,linezolid or daptomycin —,those are significantly more expensive,,so to a world that has been used tonpaying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,,the idea of paying 180 dollars per day,seems like a lot.,But what is that really telling us?,That price is telling us,that we should no longer,take cheap, effective nantibiotics as a given,into the foreseeable future,,and that price is a signal to us,that perhaps we need to be paying,much more attention to conservation.,That price is also a signal,that maybe we need to startnlooking at other technologies,,in the same way that ngasoline prices are a signal,and an impetus, to, say,,the development of electric cars.,Prices are important signals,and we need to pay attention,,but we also need to consider the fact that,although these high pricesnseem unusual for antibiotics,,they're nothing compared to the price per day,of some cancer drugs,,which might save a patient's life onlynfor a few months or perhaps a year,,whereas antibiotics would potentially,save a patient's life forever.,So this is going to involve,a whole new paradigm shift,,and it's also a scary shift because,in many parts of this country,,in many parts of the world,,the idea of paying 200 dollars,for a day of antibiotic treatment,is simply unimaginable.,So we need to think about that. 
 Now, there are backstop options,,which is other alternative technologies,that people are working on.,It includes bacteriophages, probiotics,,quorum sensing, synbiotics. 
 Now, all of these are useful avenues to pursue,,and they will become even more lucrative,when the price of new nantibiotics starts going higher,,and we've seen that thenmarket does actually respond,,and the government is now considering,ways of subsidizing new nantibiotics and development.,But there are challenges here.,We don't want to just throw money at a problem.,What we want to be able to do,is invest in new antibiotics,in ways that actually encourage,appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,,and that really is the challenge here. 
 Now, going back to these technologies,,you all remember the line from that famous,dinosaur film, "Nature will find a way.",So it's not as if these are npermanent solutions.,We really have to remember that,nwhatever the technology might be,,that nature will find some nway to work around it. 
 You might think, well, nthis is just a problem,just with antibiotics and with bacteria,,but it turns out that we nhave the exact same,identical problem in nmany other fields as well,,with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,,which is a serious problem nin India and South Africa.,Thousands of patients are dying because,the second-line drugs are so expensive,,and in some instances, even those don't work,and you have XDR TB.,Viruses are becoming resistant.,Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites.,Right now, much of the world depends on,one drug, artemisinin drugs,,essentially to treat malaria.,Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged,,and if this were to become widespread,,that puts at risk,the single drug that we have to ntreat malaria around the world,in a way that's currently nsafe and efficacious.,Mosquitos develop resistance.,If you have kids, you probably nknow about head lice,,and if you're from New York City,,I understand that the nspecialty there is bedbugs.,So those are also resistant.,And we have to bring annexample from across the pond.,Turns out that rats are nalso resistant to poisons. 
 Now, what's common nto all of these things is,the idea that we've had these technologies,to control nature only for nthe last 70, 80 or 100 years,and essentially in a blink,,we have squandered our ability to control,,because we have not recognized,that natural selection and nevolution was going to find,a way to get back,,and we need to completely rethink,how we're going to use,measures to control biological organisms,,and rethink how we incentivize,the development, introduction,,in the case of antibiotics prescription,,and use of these valuable resources.,And we really now need to nstart thinking about them,as natural resources.,And so we stand at a crossroads.,An option is to go through that rethinking,and carefully consider incentives,to change how we do business.,The alternative is,a world in which even a blade of grass,is a potentially lethal weapon. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We all go to doctors.,And we do so with trust and blind faith,that the test they are orderingnand the medications they're prescribing,are based upon evidence --,evidence that's designed to help us.,However, the reality is that that hasn'tnalways been the case for everyone.,What if I told you,that the medical science discoverednover the past century,has been based on onlynhalf the population? 
 I'm an emergency medicine doctor.,I was trained to be preparednin a medical emergency.,It's about saving lives. How cool is that?,OK, there's a lot of runny nosesnand stubbed toes,,but no matter who walksnthrough the door to the ER,,we order the same tests,,we prescribe the same medication,,without ever thinking about the sexnor gender of our patients.,Why would we?,We were never taught that there werenany differences between men and women. 
 A recent Government Accountability studynrevealed that 80 percent of the drugs,withdrawn from the market,are due to side effects on women.,So let's think about that for a minute.,Why are we discoveringnside effects on women,only after a drug has beennreleased to the market?,Do you know that it takes yearsnfor a drug to go from an idea,to being tested on cells in a laboratory,,to animal studies,,to then clinical trials on humans,,finally to go throughna regulatory approval process,,to be available for your doctornto prescribe to you?,Not to mention the millions and billionsnof dollars of funding,it takes to go through that process.,So why are we discoveringnunacceptable side effects,on half the populationnafter that has gone through?,What's happening? 
 Well, it turns out that those cellsnused in that laboratory,,they're male cells,,and the animals usednin the animal studies were male animals,,and the clinical trials have beennperformed almost exclusively on men. 
 How is it that the male model becamenour framework for medical research?,Let's look at an example that has beennpopularized in the media,,and it has to donwith the sleep aid Ambien.,Ambien was released on the marketnover 20 years ago,,and since then, hundreds of millionsnof prescriptions have been written,,primarily to women, because womennsuffer more sleep disorders than men.,But just this past year,,the Food and Drug Administrationnrecommended cutting the dose in half,for women only,,because they just realizednthat women metabolize the drug,at a slower rate than men,,causing them to wake up in the morning,with more of the active drugnin their system.,And then they're drowsy and they'rengetting behind the wheel of the car,,and they're at risknfor motor vehicle accidents.,And I can't help but think,nas an emergency physician,,how many of my patientsnthat I've cared for over the years,were involved in a motor vehicle accident,that possibly could have been prevented,if this type of analysis was performednand acted upon 20 years ago,when this drug was first released.,How many other things neednto be analyzed by gender?,What else are we missing? 
 World War II changed a lot of things,,and one of them was this neednto protect people,from becoming victims of medical researchnwithout informed consent.,So some much-needed guidelinesnor rules were set into place,,and part of that was this desirento protect women of childbearing age,from entering into anynmedical research studies.,There was fear: what if somethingnhappened to the fetus during the study?,Who would be responsible?,And so the scientistsnat this time actually thought,this was a blessing in disguise,,because let's face it -- men's bodiesnare pretty homogeneous.,They don't have the constantlynfluctuating levels of hormones,that could disrupt clean datanthey could get if they had only men.,It was easier. It was cheaper.,Not to mention, at this time,nthere was a general assumption,that men and womennwere alike in every way,,apart from their reproductive organsnand sex hormones.,So it was decided:,medical research was performed on men,,and the results were laternapplied to women. 
 What did this do to the notionnof women's health?,Women's health became synonymousnwith reproduction:,breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.,It's this term we now refernto as "bikini medicine.",And this stayed this waynuntil about the 1980s,,when this concept was challengednby the medical community,and by the public health policymakersnwhen they realized that,by excluding womennfrom all medical research studies,we actually did them a disservice,,in that apart from reproductive issues,,virtually nothing was knownnabout the unique needs,of the female patient. 
 Since that time, an overwhelming amountnof evidence has come to light,that shows us just how differentnmen and women are in every way.,You know, we have this saying in medicine:,children are not just little adults.,And we say that to remind ourselves,that children actually havena different physiology than normal adults.,And it's because of this that the medicalnspecialty of pediatrics came to light.,And we now conduct research on childrennin order to improve their lives.,And I know the same thingncan be said about women.,Women are not just mennwith boobs and tubes.,But they have their ownnanatomy and physiology,that deserves to be studiednwith the same intensity. 
 Let's take the cardiovascularnsystem, for example.,This area in medicine has done the mostnto try to figure out,why it seems men and women havencompletely different heart attacks.,Heart disease is the number one killernfor both men and women,,but more women die within the first yearnof having a heart attack than men.,Men will complainnof crushing chest pain --,an elephant is sitting on their chest.,And we call this typical.,Women have chest pain, too.,But more women than mennwill complain of "just not feeling right,","can't seem to get enough air in,","just so tired lately.",And for some reason we call this atypical,,even though, as I mentioned,nwomen do make up half the population. 
 And so what is some of the evidencento help explain some of these differences?,If we look at the anatomy,,the blood vessels that surround the heartnare smaller in women compared to men,,and the way that those blood vesselsndevelop disease is different,in women compared to men.,And the test that we use to determinenif someone is at risk for a heart attack,,well, they were initially designednand tested and perfected in men,,and so aren't as goodnat determining that in women.,And then if we thinknabout the medications --,common medicationsnthat we use, like aspirin.,We give aspirin to healthy men to helpnprevent them from having a heart attack,,but do you know that if youngive aspirin to a healthy woman,,it's actually harmful? 
 What this is doing is merely telling us,that we are scratching the surface.,Emergency medicinenis a fast-paced business.,In how many life-saving areas of medicine,,like cancer and stroke,,are there important differences betweennmen and women that we could be utilizing?,Or even, why is it that some peoplenget those runny noses,more than others,,or why the pain medication that we givento those stubbed toes,work in some and not in others? 
 The Institute of Medicine has saidnevery cell has a sex.,What does this mean?,Sex is DNA.,Gender is how someonenpresents themselves in society.,And these two may not always match up,,as we can see with ourntransgendered population.,But it's important to realizenthat from the moment of conception,,every cell in our bodies --,skin, hair, heart and lungs --,contains our own unique DNA,,and that DNA containsnthe chromosomes that determine,whether we becomenmale or female, man or woman. 
 It used to be thought,that those sex-determiningnchromosomes pictured here --,XY if you're male, XX if you're female --,merely determined whether younwould be born with ovaries or testes,,and it was the sex hormonesnthat those organs produced,that were responsible for the differencesnwe see in the opposite sex.,But we now know thatnthat theory was wrong --,or it's at least a little incomplete.,And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Pagenfrom the Whitehead Institute,,who works on the Y chromosome,,and Doctor Yang from UCLA,,they have found evidence that tells usnthat those sex-determining chromosomes,that are in every cell in our bodies,continue to remain activenfor our entire lives,and could be what's responsiblenfor the differences we see,in the dosing of drugs,,or why there are differencesnbetween men and women,in the susceptibilitynand severity of diseases.,This new knowledge is the game-changer,,and it's up to those scientistsnthat continue to find that evidence,,but it's up to the cliniciansnto start translating this data,at the bedside, today.,Right now.,And to help do this, I'm a co-foundernof a national organization,called Sex and GendernWomen's Health Collaborative,,and we collect all of this datanso that it's available for teaching,and for patient care.,And we're working to bring togethernthe medical educators to the table.,That's a big job.,It's changing the way medical trainingnhas been done since its inception. 
 But I believe in them.,I know they're going to see the valuenof incorporating the gender lens,into the current curriculum.,It's about training the futurenhealth care providers correctly.,And regionally,,I'm a co-creator of a division withinnthe Department of Emergency Medicine,here at Brown University,,called Sex and Gendernin Emergency Medicine,,and we conduct the research to determinenthe differences between men and women,in emergent conditions,,like heart disease and strokenand sepsis and substance abuse,,but we also believenthat education is paramount. 
 We've created a 360-degreenmodel of education.,We have programs for the doctors,nfor the nurses, for the students,and for the patients.,Because this cannot just be left upnto the health care leaders.,We all have a role in making a difference.,But I must warn you: this is not easy.,In fact, it's hard.,It's essentially changing the waynwe think about medicine,and health and research.,It's changing our relationshipnto the health care system.,But there's no going back.,We now know just enough,to know that we weren't doing it right. 
 Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,,"Change does not roll innon the wheels of inevitability,,but comes through continuous struggle." 
 And the first stepntowards change is awareness.,This is not just about improvingnmedical care for women.,This is about personalized,nindividualized health care for everyone.,This awareness has the power to transformnmedical care for men and women.,And from now on, I want younto ask your doctors,whether the treatments you are receivingnare specific to your sex and gender.,They may not know the answer --,yet.,But the conversation has begun,nand together we can all learn.,Remember, for menand my colleagues in this field,,your sex and gender matter. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Rainforest noises) 
 In the summer of 2011,nas a tourist,,I visited the rainforests of Borneonfor the very first time,,and as you might imagine,,it was the overwhelming soundsnof the forest that struck me the most.,There's this constant cacophony of noise.,Some things actually do stick out.,For example, this here is a big bird,na rhinoceros hornbill.,This buzzing is a cicada.,This is a family of gibbons.,It's actually singing to each othernover a great distance. 
 The place where this was recordednwas in fact a gibbon reserve,,which is why you can hear so many of them,,but in fact the most important noise that nwas coming out of the forest that time,was one that I didn't notice,,and in fact nobody therenhad actually noticed it. 
 So, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.,They spend most of their timenrehabilitating gibbons,,but they also havento spend a lot of their time,protecting their area from illegal loggingnthat takes place on the side.,And so if we take the sound of the forest,and we actually turn down the gibbons,nthe insects, and the rest,,in the background, the entire time,nin recordings you heard,,was the sound of a chainsawnat great distance.,They had three full-time guardsnwho were posted around this sanctuary,whose job was in factnto guard against illegal logging,,and one day, we went walking,nagain as tourists, out into the forest,,and within five minutes' walk,,we stumbled upon somebodynwho was just sawing a tree down,,five minutes' walk, a few hundred metersnfrom the ranger station.,They hadn't been ablento hear the chainsaws,,because as you heard,nthe forest is very, very loud. 
 It struck me as quite unacceptablenthat in this modern time,,just a few hundred meters away nfrom a ranger station in a sanctuary,,that in fact nobody could hear it whennsomeone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.,It sounds impossible,nbut in fact, it was quite true. 
 So how do we stop illegal logging?,It's really tempting, as an engineer,nalways to come up with a high-tech,,super-crazy high-tech solution,,but in fact, you're in the rainforest.,It has to be simple,nit has to be scalable,,and so what we also noticednwhile were there was that,everything we needed was already there.,We could build a systemnthat would allow us to stop this,using what's already there. 
 Who was there? What was nalready in the forest?,Well, we had people.,We had this group there that was ndedicated, three full-time guards,,that was dedicated to go and stop it,,but they just needed to knownwhat was happening out in the forest.,The real surprise, this is the big one,,was that there was connectivitynout in the forest.,There was cell phone servicenway out in the middle of nowhere.,We're talking hundreds of kilometersnfrom the nearest road,,there's certainly no electricity,nbut they had very good cell phone service,,these people in the townsnwere on Facebook all the time,,they're surfing the web on their phones,,and this sort of got me thinkingnthat in fact it would be possible,to use the sounds of the forest,,pick up the sounds nof chainsaws programmatically,,because people can't hear them,,and send an alert.,But you have to have a devicento go up in the trees.,So if we can use some devicento listen to the sounds of the forest,,connect to the cell phonennetwork that's there,,and send an alert to people on the ground,,perhaps we could have a solutionnto this issue for them. 
 But let's take a momentnto talk about saving the rainforest,,because it's something that we'vendefinitely all heard about forever.,People in my generationnhave heard about saving the rainforest,since we were kids,,and it seems that the messagenhas never changed:,We've got to save the rainforest,nit's super urgent,,this many football fieldsnhave been destroyed yesterday.,and yet here we are today,nabout half of the rainforest remains,,and we have potentially more urgent nproblems like climate change. 
 But in fact, this is the little-known factnthat I didn't realize at the time:,Deforestation accounts nfor more greenhouse gas,than all of the world's planes,ntrains, cars, trucks and ships combined.,It's the second highest contributornto climate change.,Also, according to Interpol,,as much as 90 percent of the loggingnthat takes place in the rainforest,is illegal logging,nlike the illegal logging that we saw.,So if we can help people in the forestnenforce the rules that are there,,then in fact we could eat heavilyninto this 17 percent,and potentially have a major impactnin the short term.,It might just be the cheapest,nfastest way to fight climate change. 
 And so here's the system that we imagine.,It looks super high tech.,The moment a sound of a chainsawnis heard in the forest,,the device picks up the soundnof the chainsaw,,it sends an alert through the standardnGSM network that's already there,to a ranger in the field,who can in fact show up in real timenand stop the logging.,It's no more about going outnand finding a tree that's been cut.,It's not about seeing na tree from a satellite,in an area that's been clear cut,,it's about real-time intervention. 
 So I said it was the cheapestnand fastest way to do it,,but in fact, actually, as you saw,nthey weren't able to do it,,so it may not be so cheap and fast.,But if the devices in the treesnwere actually cell phones,,it could be pretty cheap.,Cell phones are thrown awaynby the hundreds of millions every year,,hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,,not counting the rest of the world,nwhich of course we should do,,but in fact, cell phones are great.,They're full of sensors.,They can listennto the sounds of the forest.,We do have to protect them.,We have to put them in this boxnthat you see here,,and we do have to power them.,Powering them is one of the greaternengineering challenges,that we had to deal with,,because powering a cell phonenunder a tree canopy,,any sort of solar powernunder a tree canopy,,was an as-yet-unsolved problem,,and that's this uniquensolar panel design that you see here,,which in fact is built also from recyclednbyproducts of an industrial process.,These are strips that are cut down. 
 So this is me putting it all together,in my parents' garage, actually.,Thanks very much to themnfor allowing me to do that.,As you can see,nthis is a device up in a tree.,What you can see from here, perhaps,nis that they are pretty well obscured,up in the tree canopy at a distance.,That's important, because althoughnthey are able to hear chainsaw noises,up to a kilometer in the distance,,allowing them to covernabout three square kilometers,,if someone were to take them,nit would make the area unprotected. 
 So does it actually work?,Well, to test it,nwe took it back to Indonesia,,not the same place, but another place,,to another gibbon reserve,that was threatened dailynby illegal logging.,On the very second day, it picked upnillegal chainsaw noises.,We were able to get a real-time alert.,I got an email on my phone.,Actually, we had just climbed the tree.nEveryone had just gotten back down.,All these guys are smoking cigarettes,,and then I get an email,nand they all quiet down,,and in fact you can hear the chainsaw,really, really faint in the background,,but no one had noticed it nuntil that moment.,And so then we took offnto actually stop these loggers.,I was pretty nervous.,This is the moment where we've actuallynarrived close to where the loggers are.,This is the moment where you can seenwhere I'm actually regretting,perhaps the entire endeavor.,I'm not really sure what's onnthe other side of this hill.,That guy's much braver than I am.,But he went, so I had to go, walking up,,and in fact, he made it over the hill,,and interrupted the loggers in the act.,For them, it was such a surprise --,they had never, evernbeen interrupted before --,that it was such an impressivenevent for them,,that we've heard from our partnersnthey have not been back since.,They were, in fact, great guys.,They showed us hownthe entire operation works,,and what they really convinced usnon the spot was that,if you can show upnin real time and stop people,,it's enough of a deterrentnthey won't come back. 
 So --,Thank you. (Applause) 
 Word of this spread, possiblynbecause we told a lot of people,,and in fact, then some reallynamazing stuff started to happen.,People from around the worldnstarted to send us emails, phone calls.,What we saw was that peoplenthroughout Asia,,people throughout Africa,npeople throughout South America,,they told us that they could use it too,,and what's most important,,what we'd found thatnwe thought might be exceptional,,in the forest there wasnpretty good cell phone service.,That was not exceptional, we were told,,and that particularly is on the peripherynof the forests that are most under threat.,And then something nreally amazing happened,,which was that people started sending usntheir own old cell phones.,So in fact what we have now is a system,where we can use people on the ground,npeople who are already there,,who can both improvenand use the existing connectivity,,and we're using old cell phonesnthat are being sent to us,by people from around the world,that want their phones to be doing nsomething else in their afterlife,,so to speak.,And if the rest of the devicencan be completely recycled,,then we believe it'snan entirely upcycled device. 
 So again, this didn't comenbecause of any sort of high-tech solution.,It just came from usingnwhat's already there,,and I'm thoroughly convincednthat if it's not phones,,that there's alwaysngoing to be enough there,that you can build similar solutions,that can be very effectivenin new contexts. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Technology has brought us so much:,the moon landing, the Internet,,the ability to sequence the human genome.,But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears,,and about 30 years ago,,the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book,called "Amusing Ourselves to Death,",which lays this out really brilliantly.,And here's what he said,,comparing the dystopian visions,of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley.,He said, Orwell feared we would become,a captive culture.,Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture.,Orwell feared the truth would be,concealed from us,,and Huxley feared we would be drowned,in a sea of irrelevance.,In a nutshell, it's a choice between,Big Brother watching you,and you watching Big Brother.,(Laughter) 
 But it doesn't have to be this way.,We are not passive consumersnof data and technology.,We shape the role it plays in our lives,and the way we make meaning from it,,but to do that,,we have to pay as much attention to how we think,as how we code.,We have to ask questions, and hard questions,,to move past counting things,to understanding them.,We're constantly bombarded with stories,about how much data there is in the world,,but when it comes to big data,and the challenges of interpreting it,,size isn't everything.,There's also the speed at which it moves,,and the many varieties of data types,,and here are just a few examples:,images,,text,,video,,audio.,And what unites this disparate types of data,is that they're created by people,and they require context. 
 Now, there's a group of data scientists,out of the University of Illinois-Chicago,,and they're called the Health Media Collaboratory,,and they've been working withnthe Centers for Disease Control,to better understand,how people talk about quitting smoking,,how they talk about electronic cigarettes,,and what they can do collectively,to help them quit.,The interesting thing is, if you want to understand,how people talk about smoking,,first you have to understand,what they mean when they say "smoking.",And on Twitter, there are four main categories:,number one, smoking cigarettes;,number two, smoking marijuana;,number three, smoking ribs;,and number four, smoking hot women.,(Laughter) 
 So then you have to think about, well,,how do people talk about electronic cigarettes?,And there are so many different ways,that people do this, and you can see from the slide,it's a complex kind of a query.,And what it reminds us is that,language is created by people,,and people are messy and we're complex,and we use metaphors and slang and jargon,and we do this 24/7 in many, many languages,,and then as soon as we figure it out, we change it up. 
 So did these ads that the CDC put on,,these television ads that featured a woman,with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic,and very disturbing,,did they actually have an impact,on whether people quit?,And the Health Media Collaboratorynrespected the limits of their data,,but they were able to conclude,that those advertisements —nand you may have seen them —,that they had the effect of jolting people,into a thought process,that may have an impact on future behavior.,And what I admire and nappreciate about this project,,aside from the fact, including the fact,that it's based on real human need,,is that it's a fantastic example of courage,in the face of a sea of irrelevance. 
 And so it's not just big data that causes,challenges of interpretation, because let's face it,,we human beings have a very rich history,of taking any amount of data, no matter how small,,and screwing it up.,So many years ago, you may remember,that former President Ronald Reagan,was very criticized for making a statement,that facts are stupid things.,And it was a slip of the tongue, let's be fair.,He actually meant to quote John Adams' defense,of British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials,that facts are stubborn things.,But I actually think there's,a bit of accidental wisdom in what he said,,because facts are stubborn things,,but sometimes they're stupid, too. 
 I want to tell you a personal story,about why this matters a lot to me.,I need to take a breath.,My son Isaac, when he was two,,was diagnosed with autism,,and he was this happy, hilarious,,loving, affectionate little guy,,but the metrics on his developmental evaluations,,which looked at things like nthe number of words —,at that point, none —,communicative gestures and minimal eye contact,,put his developmental level,at that of a nine-month-old baby.,And the diagnosis was factually correct,,but it didn't tell the whole story.,And about a year and a half later,,when he was almost four,,I found him in front of the computer one day,running a Google image search on women,,spelled "w-i-m-e-n.",And I did what any obsessed parent would do,,which is immediately started nhitting the "back" button,to see what else he'd been searching for.,And they were, in order: men,,school, bus and computer.,And I was stunned,,because we didn't know that he could spell,,much less read, and so I asked him,,"Isaac, how did you do this?",And he looked at me very seriously and said,,"Typed in the box." 
 He was teaching himself to communicate,,but we were looking in the wrong place,,and this is what happens when assessments,and analytics overvalue one metric —,in this case, verbal communication —,and undervalue others, suchnas creative problem-solving.,Communication was hard for Isaac,,and so he found a workaround,to find out what he needed to know.,And when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense,,because forming a question,is a really complex process,,but he could get himself a lot of the way there,by putting a word in a search box. 
 And so this little moment,had a really profound impact on me,and our family,because it helped us change our frame of reference,for what was going on with him,,and worry a little bit less and appreciate,his resourcefulness more. 
 Facts are stupid things.,And they're vulnerable to misuse,,willful or otherwise.,I have a friend, Emily Willingham, who's a scientist,,and she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago,entitled "The 10 Weirdest Things,Ever Linked to Autism.",It's quite a list.,The Internet, blamed for everything, right?,And of course mothers, because.,And actually, wait, there's more,,there's a whole bunch in nthe "mother" category here.,And you can see it's a pretty nrich and interesting list.,I'm a big fan of,being pregnant near freeways, personally.,The final one is interesting,,because the term "refrigerator mother",was actually the original hypothesis,for the cause of autism,,and that meant somebody nwho was cold and unloving. 
 And at this point, you might be thinking,,"Okay, Susan, we get it,,you can take data, you can nmake it mean anything.",And this is true, it's absolutely true,,but the challenge is that,we have this opportunity,to try to make meaning out of it ourselves,,because frankly, data doesn't ncreate meaning. We do.,So as businesspeople, as consumers,,as patients, as citizens,,we have a responsibility, I think,,to spend more time,focusing on our critical thinking skills.,Why?,Because at this point in our history, as we've heard,many times over,,we can process exabytes of data,at lightning speed,,and we have the potential to make bad decisions,far more quickly, efficiently,,and with far greater impact than we did in the past.,Great, right?,And so what we need to do instead,is spend a little bit more time,on things like the humanities,and sociology, and the social sciences,,rhetoric, philosophy, ethics,,because they give us context that is so important,for big data, and because,they help us become better critical thinkers.,Because after all, if I can spot,a problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter,whether it's expressed in words or in numbers.,And this means,teaching ourselves to find nthose confirmation biases,and false correlations,and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal,from 30 yards,,because something that happens after something,doesn't mean it happened nbecause of it, necessarily,,and if you'll let me geek out on you for a second,,the Romans called this n"post hoc ergo propter hoc,",after which therefore because of which. 
 And it means questioningndisciplines like demographics.,Why? Because they're based on assumptions,about who we all are based on our gender,and our age and where we live,as opposed to data on what nwe actually think and do.,And since we have this data,,we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls,and consumer opt-in,,and beyond that, we need to be clear,about our hypotheses,,the methodologies that we use,,and our confidence in the result.,As my high school algebra teacher used to say,,show your math,,because if I don't know what steps you took,,I don't know what steps you didn't take,,and if I don't know what questions you asked,,I don't know what questions you didn't ask.,And it means asking ourselves, really,,the hardest question of all:,Did the data really show us this,,or does the result make us feel,more successful and more comfortable? 
 So the Health Media Collaboratory,,at the end of their project, they were able,to find that 87 percent of tweets,about those very graphic and disturbing,anti-smoking ads expressed fear,,but did they conclude,that they actually made people stop smoking?,No. It's science, not magic. 
 So if we are to unlock,the power of data,,we don't have to go blindly into,Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future,,or Huxley's vision of a trivial one,,or some horrible cocktail of both.,What we have to do,is treat critical thinking with respect,and be inspired by examples,like the Health Media Collaboratory,,and as they say in the superhero movies,,let's use our powers for good. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This summer I was backnin Ohio for a family wedding,,and when I was there,,there was a meet and greetnwith Anna and Elsa from "Frozen.",Not the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen,",as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.,These two entrepreneurs hadna business of running princess parties.,Your kid is turning five?,They'll come sing some songs,nsprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.,And they were not aboutnto miss out on the opportunity,that was the phenomenonnand that was "Frozen." 
 So they get hired by a local toy store,,kids come in on a Saturday morning,,buy some Disney swag, get theirnpicture taken with the princesses,,call it a day.,It's like Santa Clausnwithout the seasonal restrictions.,(Laughter) 
 And my three-and-a-half-year-old niecenSamantha was in the thick of it.,She could care less that these two womennwere signing posters and coloring books,as Snow Queen and Princess Ananwith one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.,(Laughter),According to my niece and the 200-plusnkids in the parking lot that day,,this was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen." 
 It is a blazing hot Saturday morningnin August in Ohio.,We get there at 10 o'clock,nthe scheduled start time,,and we are handed number 59.,By 11 o'clock they had callednnumbers 21 through 25;,this was going to be a while,,and there is no amountnof free face painting or temporary tattoos,that could prevent the meltdownsnthat were occurring outside of the store.,(Laughter) 
 So, by 12:30 we get called:,"56 to 63, please.",And as we walk in, it is a scenenI can only describe you,as saying it looked like Norway threw up.,(Laughter),There were cardboardncut-out snowflakes covering the floor,,glitter on every flat surface,nand icicles all over the walls. 
 And as we stood in line,in an attempt to givenmy niece a better vantage point,than the backsidenof the mother of number 58,,I put her up on my shoulders,,and she was instantly rivetednby the sight of the princesses.,And as we moved forward,nher excitement only grew,,and as we finally gotnto the front of the line,,and number 58 unfurled her posternto be signed by the princesses,,I could literally feel the excitementnrunning through her body.,And let's be honest,nat that point, I was pretty excited too.,(Laughter),I mean, the Scandinavian decadencenwas mesmerizing.,(Laughter) 
 So we get to the front of the line,,and the haggard clerknturns to my niece and says,,"Hi, honey. You're next!,Do you want to get down,nor you're going to stay,on your dad's shoulders for the picture?',(Laughter),And I was, for a lacknof a better word, frozen.,(Laughter) 
 It's amazing that in an unexpected instantnwe are faced with the question,,who am I?,Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?,Millions of people have seen my videonabout how to have a hard conversation,,and there one was, right in front of me.,At the same time,,there's nothing more importantnto me than the kids in my life,,so I found myself in a situationnthat we so often find ourselves in,,torn between two things,ntwo impossible choices.,Would I be an advocate?,Would I take my niece off my shouldersnand turn to the clerk and explain to her,that I was in factnher aunt, not her father,,and that she should be more careful,and not to jump to gender conclusionsnbased on haircuts and shoulder rides --,(Laughter) --,and while doing that,,miss out on what was, to this point,nthe greatest moment of my niece's life.,Or would I be an aunt?,Would I brush off that comment,ntake a million pictures,,and not be distracted for an instantnfrom the pure joy of that moment,,and by doing that,,walk out with the shame that comes upnfor not standing up for myself,,especially in front of my niece. 
 Who was I?,Which one was more important?nWhich role was more worth it?,Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?,And I had a split second to decide. 
 We are taught right now,that we are living in a worldnof constant and increasing polarity.,It's so black and white,nso us and them, so right and wrong.,There is no middle,nthere is no gray, just polarity.,Polarity is a state in whichntwo ideas or opinions,are completely opposite from each other;,a diametrical opposition.,Which side are you on?,Are you unequivocally and without questionnantiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,,pro-gun regulation, proponentnof open borders and pro-union?,Or, are you absolutely nand uncompromisingly,pro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,,a believer that the SecondnAmendment is absolute,,anti-immigrant and pro-business?,It's all or none, you're with usnor against us.,That is polarity. 
 The problem with polarity nand absolutes is that,it eliminates the individualitynof our human experience,and that makes it contradictorynto our human nature.,But if we are pullednin these two directions,,but it's not really where we exist --,polarity is not our actual reality --,where do we go from there?,What's at the other end of that spectrum? 
 I don't think it's an unattainable,nharmonious utopia,,I think the oppositenof polarity is duality.,Duality is a state of having two parts,,but not in diametrical opposition,,in simultaneous existence.,Don't think it's possible?,Here are the people I know:,I know Catholics who are pro-choice,nand feminists who wear hijabs,,and veterans who are antiwar,,and NRA members who thinknI should be able to get married.,Those are the people I know,nthose are my friends and family,,that is the majority of our society,nthat is you, that is me.,(Applause),Duality is the abilitynto hold both things.,But the question is:nCan we own our duality?,Can we have the couragento hold both things? 
 I work at a restaurant in town,,I became really good friendsnwith the busser.,I was a server and we had na great relationship,,we had a really great time together.,Her Spanish was great,because she was from Mexico.,(Laughter),That line actually went the other way.,Her English was limited,nbut significantly better than my Spanish.,But we were united by our similarities,,not separated by our differences.,And we were close, even thoughnwe came from very different worlds.,She was from Mexico,,she left her family behindnso she could come here,and afford them a better life back home.,She was a devout conservative Catholic,,a believer in traditional family values,,stereotypical roles of men and women,,and I was, well, me.,(Laughter) 
 But the things that bonded usnwere when she asked about my girlfriend,,or she shared pictures that she hadnfrom her family back home.,Those were the thingsnthat brought us together.,So one day, we were in the back,,scarfing down food as quickly as we could,ngathered around a small table,,during a very rare lull,,and a new guynfrom the kitchen came over --,who happened to be her cousin --,and sat down with allnthe bravado and machismo,that his 20-year-old body could hold.,(Laughter),And he said to her,n[in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?",And she said,n[in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend.",And he said,n[in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?",And she set down her fork,nand locked eyes with him,,and said, [in Spanish] "Yes,na girlfriend. That is all.",And his smug smile quickly droppednto one of maternal respect,,grabbed his plate, walked off,nwent back to work.,She never made eye contact with me.,She left, did the same thing --,it was a 10-second conversation,nsuch a short interaction. 
 And on paper, she hadnso much more in common with him:,language, culture, history, family,nher community was her lifeline here,,but her moral compass trumped all of that.,And a little bit later, they were jokingnaround in the kitchen in Spanish,,that had nothing to do with me,,and that is duality.,She didn't have to choose some P.C. stancenon gayness over her heritage.,She didn't have to choosenher family over our friendship.,It wasn't Jesus or Ash.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Her individual moralitynwas so strongly rooted,that she had the couragento hold both things.,Our moral integrity is our responsibility,and we must be prepared to defend itneven when it's not convenient.,That's what it means to be an ally,nand if you're going to be an ally,,you have to be an active ally:,Ask questions, act when you hearnsomething inappropriate,,actually engage. 
 I had a family friend who for yearsnused to call my girlfriend my lover.,Really? Lover?,So overly sexual,,so '70s gay porn.,(Laughter),But she was trying, and she asked.,She could have called her my friend,,or my "friend," or my "special friend" --,(Laughter) --,or even worse, just not asked at all.,Believe me, we would rather have you ask.,I would rather have her say lover,nthan say nothing at all. 
 People often say to me,n"Well, Ash, I don't care.,I don't see racenor religion or sexuality.,It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it.",But I think the opposite of homophobianand racism and xenophobia is not love,,it's apathy.,If you don't see my gayness,nthen you don't see me.,If it doesn't matter to younwho I sleep with,,then you cannot imagine what it feels like,when I walk down the streetnlate at night holding her hand,,and approach a group of peoplenand have to make the decision,if I should hang on to itnor if I should I drop it,when all I want to donis squeeze it tighter.,And the small victory I feel,when I make it bynand don't have to let go.,And the incredible cowardicenand disappointment I feel when I drop it.,If you do not see that struggle,that is unique to my human experiencenbecause I am gay, then you don't see me.,If you are going to be an ally,nI need you to see me. 
 As individuals, as allies, as humans,,we need to be able to hold both things:,both the good and the bad,,the easy and the hard.,You don't learn how to holdntwo things just from the fluff,,you learn it from the grit.,And what if dualitynis just the first step?,What if through compassionnand empathy and human interaction,we are able to learn to hold two things?,And if we can holdntwo things, we can hold four,,and if we can hold four,nwe can hold eight,,and if we can hold eight,nwe can hold hundreds. 
 We are complex individuals,,swirls of contradiction.,You are all holdingnso many things right now.,What can you do to hold just a few more? 
 So, back to Toledo, Ohio.,I'm at the front of the line,,niece on my shoulders,nthe frazzled clerk calls me Dad.,Have you ever been mistakennfor the wrong gender?,Not even that.,Have you ever been callednsomething you are not?,Here's what it feels like for me:,I am instantly an internal stormnof contrasting emotions.,I break out into a sweat that isna combination of rage and humiliation,,I feel like the entire storenis staring at me,,and I simultaneously feel invisible.,I want to explode in a tirade of fury,,and I want to crawl under a rock.,And top all of that offnwith the frustration that I'm wearing,an out-of-characterntight-fitting purple t-shirt,,so this whole store can see my boobs,,to make sure this exactnsame thing doesn't happen.,(Laughter),But, despite my best effortsnto be seen as the gender I am,,it still happens.,And I hope with every ouncenof my body that no one heard --,not my sister, not my girlfriend,nand certainly not my niece.,I am accustomed to this familiar hurt,,but I will do whatever I need to donto protect the people I love from it. 
 But then I take my niece off my shoulders,,and she runs to Elsa and Anna --,the thing she's beennwaiting so long for --,and all that stuff goes away.,All that matters is the smile on her face.,And as the 30 seconds we waitedntwo and a half hours for comes to a close,we gather up our things,nand I lock eyes with the clerk again;,and she gives menan apologetic smile and mouths,,"I am so sorry!",(Laughter),And her humanity, her willingness to admitnher mistake disarms me immediately,,then I give her a: "It's okay,nit happens. But thanks." 
 And I realize in that moment,that I don't have to be,either an auntnor an advocate, I can be both.,I can live in duality,nand I can hold two things.,And if I can hold two thingsnin that environment,,I can hold so many more things.,As my girlfriend and my niece hold handsnand skip out the front of the door,,I turn to my sister and say,n"Was it worth it?",And she said, "Are you kidding me?,Did you see the look on her face?nThis was the greatest day of her life!",(Laughter),"It was worth the twonand a half hours in the heat,,it was worth the overpriced coloring booknthat we already had a copy of.",(Laughter),"It was even worth you ngetting called Dad.",(Laughter),And for the first time evernin my life, it actually was. 
 Thank you, Boulder. Have a good night. 
 (Applause)This is a kindergartennwe designed in 2007.,We made this kindergarten nto be a circle.,It's a kind of endless circulationnon top of the roof.,If you are a parent,,you know that kids lovento keep making circles.,This is how the rooftop looks. 
 And why did we design this?,The principal of this kindergarten said,,"No, I don't want a handrail.",I said, "It's impossible.",But he insisted: "How about having a netnsticking out from the edge of the roof?,So that it can catchnthe children falling off?",(Laughter),I said, "It's impossible." 
 And of course,nthe government official said,,"Of course you have to have a handrail.",But we could keep nthat idea around the trees.,There are three trees popping through.,And we were allowed to call nthis rope as a handrail.,But of course, rope has nothingnto do with them.,They fall into the net.,And you get more,,and more,,more.,(Laughter),Sometimes 40 children nare around a tree.,The boy on the branch,,he loves the treenso he is eating the tree.,(Laughter) 
 And at the time of an event,,they sit on the edge.,It looks so nice from underneath.,Monkeys in the zoo.,(Laughter),Feeding time.,(Laughter) n(Applause) 
 And we made the roof as low as possible,,because we wanted to seenchildren on top of the roof,,not only underneath the roof.,And if the roof is too high,nyou see only the ceiling. 
 And the leg washing place --nthere are many kinds of water taps.,You see with the flexible tubes,,you want to spray waternto your friends,,and the shower,,and the one in front is quite normal.,But if you look at this,,the boy is not washing his boots,,he's putting water into his boots.,(Laughter) 
 This kindergarten is completelynopen, most of the year.,And there is no boundarynbetween inside and outside.,So it means basicallynthis architecture is a roof.,And also there is no boundarynbetween classrooms.,So there is no acoustic barrier at all.,When you put many children in a quiet box,,some of them get really nervous.,But in this kindergarten,,there is no reason they get nervous.,Because there is no boundary. 
 And the principal says,if the boy in the cornerndoesn't want to stay in the room,,we let him go.,He will come back eventually,nbecause it's a circle, it comes back.,(Laughter) 
 But the point is,nin that kind of occasion,,usually children try to hide somewhere.,But here, just they leave and come back.,It's a natural process. 
 And secondly, we considernnoise very important.,You know that childrennsleep better in noise.,They don't sleep in a quiet space.,And in this kindergarten,,these children shownamazing concentration in class.,And you know, our kind grew upnin the jungle with noise.,They need noise.,And you know, you can talknto your friends in a noisy bar.,You are not supposed to be in silence. 
 And you know, these days,we are trying to makeneverything under control.,You know, it's completely open.,And you should know that,we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.,In summer you go swimming.,The sand is 50 degrees.,And also, you should knownthat you are waterproof.,You never melt in rain.,So, children are supposed to be outside.,So that is how we should treat them. 
 This is how they divide classrooms.,They are supposed to help teachers.,They don't.,(Laughter),I didn't put him in.,A classroom.,And a washbasin.,They talk to each other around the well.,And there are always nsome trees in the classroom.,A monkey trying to fishnanother monkey from above.,(Laughter),Monkeys.,(Laughter),And each classroom hasnat least one skylight.,And this is where Santa Clausncomes down at the time of Christmas. 
 This is the annex building,,right next to thatnoval-shaped kindergarten.,The building is onlynfive meters tall with seven floors.,And of course,nthe ceiling height is very low.,So you have to consider safety.,So, we put our children,na daughter and a son.,They tried to go in.,He hit his head.,He's okay. His skull is quite strong.,He is resilient. It's my son.,(Laughter),And he is trying to seenif it is safe to jump off.,And then we put other children. 
 The traffic jam is awfulnin Tokyo, as you know.,(Laughter),The driver in front,nshe needs to learn how to drive.,Now these days,,kids need a small dosage of danger.,And in this kind of occasion,,they learn to help each other.,This is society. This is the kind ofnopportunity we are losing these days. 
 Now, this drawing is showingnthe movement of a boy,between 9:10 and 9:30.,And the circumferencenof this building is 183 meters.,So it's not exactly small at all.,And this boy did 6,000 metersnin the morning.,But the surprise is yet to come.,The children in this kindergartenndo 4,000 meters on average.,And these children haventhe highest athletic abilities,among many kindergartens.,The principal says,,"I don't train them.nWe leave them on top of the roof.,Just like sheep.",(Laughter),They keep running.,(Laughter) 
 My point is don't control them,,don't protect them too much,,and they need to tumble sometimes.,They need to get some injury.,And that makes them learn,how to live in this world.,I think architecture is capablenof changing this world,,and people's lives.,And this is one of the attemptsnto change the lives of children. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)It's said that to be a poet,you have to go to hell and back. 
 The first time I visited the prison,,I was not surprised by the noisenof the padlocks,,or the closing doors,nor the cell bars,,or by any of the thingsnI had imagined. 
 Maybe because the prisonnis in a quite open space.,You can see the sky.,Seagulls fly overhead,nand you feel like you're next to the sea,,that you're really close to the beach.,But in fact, the gulls are lookingnfor food in the dump near the prison. 
 I went farther inside and I suddenly sawninmates moving across the corridors.,Then it was as if I stepped backnand thought,that I could have very well beennone of them.,If I had another story,nanother context, different luck.,Because nobody - nobody -ncan choose where they're born. 
 In 2009, I was invited to join a project,that San Martín National Universitynconducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary,,to coordinate a writing workshop.,The prison service ceded some landnat the end of the prison,,which is where they constructednthe University Center building. 
 The first time I met with the prisoners,,I asked them why they were askingnfor a writing workshop,and they told me they wanted nto put on paper,all that they couldn't say and do. 
 Right then I decided that I wanted poetrynto enter the prison.,So I said to themnwhy don't we work with poetry,,if they knew what poetry was.,But nobody had a cluenwhat poetry really was.,They also suggested to me,that the workshop should bennot just for the inmates,taking university classes, nbut for all the inmates.,And so I saidnthat to start this workshop,,I needed to find a toolnthat we all had in common.,That tool was language. 
 We had language, we had the workshop.nWe could have poetry.,But what I hadn't considerednwas that inequality exists in prison, too.,Many of the prisoners hadn't evenncompleted grammar school.,Many couldn't use cursive,ncould barely print.,They didn't write fluently, either.,So we started looking for short poems.,Very short, but very powerful. 
 And we started to read, and we'd readnone author, then another author,,and by reading such short poems,nthey all began to realize,that what the poetic language didnwas to break a certain logic,,and create another system.,Breaking the logic of languagenalso breaks the logic of the system,under which they've learned to respond.,So a new system appeared,,new rules that made themnunderstand very quickly,,- very quickly -,that with poetic language,they would be able to saynabsolutely whatever they wanted. 
 It's said that to be a poetnyou have to go to hell and back.,And they have plenty of hell.nPlenty of hell. 
 One of them once said:n"In prison you never sleep.,You can never sleep in jail.nYou can never close your eyelids.",And so, like I’m doing now,nI gave them a moment of silence,,then said,n“That's what poetry is, you guys.,It's in this prison universenthat you have all around you.,Everything you saynabout how you never sleep,,it exudes fear.,All the things that go unwritten --nall of that is poetry." 
 So we started appropriating that hell;,we plunged ourselves, headfirst,ninto the seventh circle.,And in that seventh circle of hell,nour very own, beloved circle,,they learned that they couldnmake the walls invisible,,that they could make the windows yell,,and that we could hide inside the shadows.,When the first yearnof the workshop had ended,,we organized a little closing party,,like you do when a job is donenwith so much love,,and you want to celebrate with a party. 
 We called family, friends, nthe university authorities.,The only thing the inmatesnhad to do was read a poem,,and receive their diplomas and applause.,That was our simple party.,The only thing I want to leave you with,is the moment in which those men,,some of them just hugenwhen standing next to me,,or the young boys - so young,nbut with an enormous pride,,held their papers and tremblednlike little kids and sweated,,and read their poems with theirnvoices completely broken. 
 That moment made me think a lot,that for most of them,nit was surely the very first time,that someone applauded themnfor something they had done.,In prison there are thingsnthat can't be done.,In prison, you can't dream.nIn prison, you can't cry.,There are words that are virtuallynforbidden, like the word "time,",the word "future," the word "wish".,But we dared to dream, and to dream a lot.,We decidednthat they were going to write a book.,Not only did they write a book,nbut they also bound it themselves.,That was at the end of 2010.,Then, we doubled the betnand wrote another book.,And we bound that one, too.,That was a short time ago,nat the end of last year.,What I see week after week,,is how they're turningninto different people;,how they're being transformed.,How words are empowering themnwith a dignity they had never known,,that they couldn't even imagine.,They had no idea such dignityncould come from them. 
 At the workshop, in that beloved hellnwe share, we all give something.,We open our hands and hearts and givenwhat we have, what we can.,All of us;nall of us equally.,And so you feel that at leastnin a small way,you're repairingnthat huge social fracture,which makes it so that for many of them,,prison is their only destination.,I remember a versenby a tremendous poet, a great poet,,from our Unit 48 workshop,nNicolás Dorado:,"I will need an infinite threadnto sew up this huge wound." 
 Poetry does that; it sews upnthe wounds of exclusion.,It opens doors. nPoetry works as a mirror.,It creates a mirror, which is the poem.,They recognize themselves,nthey look at themselves in the poem,and write from who they are,nand are from what they write. 
 In order to write,,they need to appropriatenthe moment of writing,which is a momentnof extraordinary freedom.,They have to get into their heads,nsearch for that bit of freedom,that can never be taken awaynwhen they write,and that is also usefulnto realize that freedom is possible,even inside a prison,,and that the only bars we havenin our wonderful space,is the word "bars,",and that all of us in our hellnburn with happiness,when we light the wick of the word. 
 (Applause) 
 I told you a lot about the prison,na lot about what I experience,every week, and how I enjoy itnand transform myself with the inmates.,But you don't know how much I'd like it,if you could feel, live, experience,neven for a few seconds,,what I enjoy every weeknand what makes me who I am.,(Applause),Martín Bustamante: nThe heart chews tears of time;,blinded by that light,,it hides the speed of existence,where the images go rowing by.,It fights; it hangs on. 
 The heart cracks under sad gazes,,rides on storms that spread fire,,lifts chests lowered by shame,,knows that it's not just readingnand going on,,it also wishes to see the infinite blue. 
 The heart sits down to think about things,,fights to avoid being ordinary,,tries to love without hurting,,breathes the sun,ngiving courage to itself,,surrenders, travels toward reason. 
 The heart fights among the swamps,,skirts the edge of the underworld,,falls exhausted, but won't give innto what's easy,,while irregular steps of intoxication,wake up,,wake the stillness. 
 I'm Martín Bustamante,,I'm a prisoner in Unit 48 of San Martín,,today is my day of temporary release.,And for me, poetry and literaturenhave changed my life. 
 Thank you very much! 
 Cristina Domenech: Thank you! 
 (Applause)Imagine you're in a bar, or a club,,and you start talking, and after a while,nthe question comes up,,"So, what do you do for work?",And since you thinknyour job is interesting,,you say, "I'm a mathematician."n(Laughter),And inevitably, during that conversation,one of these two phrases come up:,A) "I was terrible at math,nbut it wasn't my fault.,It's because the teachernwas awful." (Laughter),Or B) "But what is math really for?",(Laughter),I'll now address Case B.,(Laughter) 
 When someone asks you what math is for,nthey're not asking you,about applicationsnof mathematical science.,They're asking you,,why did I have to study that bullshitnI never used in my life again? (Laughter),That's what they're actually asking.,So when mathematicians are askednwhat math is for,,they tend to fall into two groups:,54.51 percent of mathematiciansnwill assume an attacking position,,and 44.77 percent of mathematiciansnwill take a defensive position.,There's a strange 0.8 percent,namong which I include myself. 
 Who are the ones that attack?,The attacking ones are mathematiciansnwho would tell you,this question makes no sense,,because mathematicsnhave a meaning all their own --,a beautiful edifice with its own logic --,and that there's no point,in constantly searchingnfor all possible applications.,What's the use of poetry?nWhat's the use of love?,What's the use of life itself? nWhat kind of question is that?,(Laughter),Hardy, for instance, was a modelnof this type of attack. 
 And those who stand in defense tell you,,"Even if you don't realize it, friend,nmath is behind everything.",(Laughter),Those guys,,they always bring upnbridges and computers.,"If you don't know math,nyour bridge will collapse.",(Laughter),It's true, computers are all about math.,And now these guysnhave also started saying,that behind information securitynand credit cards are prime numbers.,These are the answers your math teachernwould give you if you asked him.,He's one of the defensive ones. 
 Okay, but who's right then?,Those who say that mathndoesn't need to have a purpose,,or those who say that mathnis behind everything we do?,Actually, both are right.,But remember I told you,I belong to that strange 0.8 percentnclaiming something else?,So, go ahead, ask me what math is for. 
 Audience: What is math for? 
 Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay,n76.34 percent of you asked the question,,23.41 percent didn't say anything,,and the 0.8 percent --,I'm not sure what those guys are doing.,Well, to my dear 76.31 percent --,it's true that math doesn't neednto serve a purpose,,it's true that it'sna beautiful structure, a logical one,,probably onenof the greatest collective efforts,ever achieved in human history.,But it's also true that there,,where scientists and techniciansnare looking for mathematical theories,that allow them to advance,,they're within the structure of math,nwhich permeates everything. 
 It's true that we have to gonsomewhat deeper,,to see what's behind science.,Science operates on intuition, creativity.,Math controls intuitionnand tames creativity.,Almost everyonenwho hasn't heard this before,is surprised when they hearnthat if you take,a 0.1 millimeter thick sheet of paper,nthe size we normally use,,and, if it were big enough,nfold it 50 times,,its thickness would extend almostnthe distance from the Earth to the sun.,Your intuition tells you it's impossible.,Do the math and you'll see it's right.,That's what math is for. 
 It's true that science, all typesnof science, only makes sense,because it makes us better understandnthis beautiful world we live in.,And in doing that,,it helps us avoid the pitfallsnof this painful world we live in.,There are sciences that help usnin this way quite directly.,Oncological science, for example.,And there are others we look at from afar,nwith envy sometimes,,but knowing that we arenwhat supports them.,All the basic sciencesnsupport them,,including math.,All that makes science, sciencenis the rigor of math.,And that rigor factors innbecause its results are eternal. 
 You probably said or were toldnat some point,that diamonds are forever, right?,That depends onnyour definition of forever!,A theorem -- that really is forever.,(Laughter),The Pythagorean theorem is still true,even though Pythagoras is dead,nI assure you it's true. (Laughter),Even if the world collapsed,the Pythagorean theoremnwould still be true.,Wherever any two triangle sidesnand a good hypotenuse get together,(Laughter),the Pythagorean theorem goes all out.nIt works like crazy.,(Applause) 
 Well, we mathematicians devote ourselvesnto come up with theorems.,Eternal truths.,But it isn't always easy to knownthe difference between,an eternal truth, or theorem,nand a mere conjecture.,You need proof.,For example,,let's say I have a big,nenormous, infinite field.,I want to cover it with equal pieces,nwithout leaving any gaps.,I could use squares, right?,I could use triangles.nNot circles, those leave little gaps.,Which is the best shape to use?,One that covers the same surface,nbut has a smaller border.,In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandriansaid the best is to use hexagons,,just like bees do.,But he didn't prove it.,The guy said, "Hexagons, great!nLet's go with hexagons!",He didn't prove it,nit remained a conjecture.,"Hexagons!",And the world, as you know,nsplit into Pappists and anti-Pappists,,until 1700 years later,when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved,that Pappus and the bees were right --nthe best shape to use was the hexagon.,And that became a theorem,nthe honeycomb theorem,,that will be true forever and ever,,for longer than any diamondnyou may have. (Laughter) 
 But what happens if we gonto three dimensions?,If I want to fill the spacenwith equal pieces,,without leaving any gaps,,I can use cubes, right?,Not spheres, those leave little gaps.n(Laughter),What is the best shape to use?,Lord Kelvin, of the famousnKelvin degrees and all,,said that the best was to usena truncated octahedron,which, as you all know --,(Laughter) --,is this thing here!,(Applause),Come on.,Who doesn't have a truncatednoctahedron at home? (Laughter),Even a plastic one.,"Honey, get the truncated octahedron,nwe're having guests.",Everybody has one!n(Laughter) 
 But Kelvin didn't prove it.,It remained a conjecture --nKelvin's conjecture.,The world, as you know, then split intonKelvinists and anti-Kelvinists,(Laughter),until a hundred or so years later,,someone found a better structure.,Weaire and Phelannfound this little thing over here --,(Laughter) --,this structure to which they gaventhe very clever name,"the Weaire-Phelan structure.",(Laughter),It looks like a strange object,nbut it isn't so strange,,it also exists in nature.,It's very interesting that this structure,,because of its geometric properties,,was used to build the Aquatics Centernfor the Beijing Olympic Games. 
 There, Michael Phelpsnwon eight gold medals,,and became the best swimmer of all time.,Well, until someone betterncomes along, right?,As may happennwith the Weaire-Phelan structure.,It's the bestnuntil something better shows up.,But be careful, because this onenreally stands a chance,that in a hundred or so years,nor even if it's in 1700 years,,that someone provesnit's the best possible shape for the job.,It will then become a theorem,na truth, forever and ever.,For longer than any diamond. 
 So, if you want to tell someone,that you will love them forever,you can give them a diamond.,But if you want to tell themnthat you'll love them forever and ever,,give them a theorem!,(Laughter),But hang on a minute!,You'll have to prove it,,so your love doesn't remain,a conjecture. 
 (Applause)There is an entire genre of YouTube videos,devoted to an experience which,I am certain that everyone in this room has had.,It entails an individual who,,thinking they're alone,,engages in some expressive behavior —,wild singing, gyrating dancing,,some mild sexual activity —,only to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,,that there is a person watching and lurking,,the discovery of which causes them,to immediately cease what they were doing,in horror.,The sense of shame and humiliation,in their face is palpable.,It's the sense of,,"This is something I'm willing to do,only if no one else is watching." 
 This is the crux of the work,on which I have been singularly focused,for the last 16 months,,the question of why privacy matters,,a question that has arisen,in the context of a global debate,,enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden,that the United States and its partners,,unbeknownst to the entire world,,has converted the Internet,,once heralded as an unprecedented tool,of liberation and democratization,,into an unprecedented zone,of mass, indiscriminate surveillance. 
 There is a very common sentiment,that arises in this debate,,even among people who are uncomfortable,with mass surveillance, which says,that there is no real harm,that comes from this large-scale invasion,because only people who are engaged in bad acts,have a reason to want to hide,and to care about their privacy.,This worldview is implicitly grounded,in the proposition that there arentwo kinds of people in the world,,good people and bad people.,Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks,or who engage in violent criminality,and therefore have reasons tonwant to hide what they're doing,,have reasons to care about their privacy.,But by contrast, good people,are people who go to work,,come home, raise their children, watch television.,They use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks,but to read the news or exchange recipes,or to plan their kids' Little League games,,and those people are doing nothing wrong,and therefore have nothing to hide,and no reason to fear,the government monitoring them. 
 The people who are actually saying that,are engaged in a very extreme act,of self-deprecation.,What they're really saying is,,"I have agreed to make myself,such a harmless and unthreatening,and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear,having the government know what it is that I'm doing.",This mindset has found what I think,is its purest expression,in a 2009 interview with,the longtime CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who,,when asked about all the different ways his company,is causing invasions of privacy,for hundreds of millions of people around the world,,said this: He said,,"If you're doing something that you don't want,other people to know,,maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place." 
 Now, there's all kinds of things to say about,that mentality,,the first of which is that the people who say that,,who say that privacy isn't really important,,they don't actually believe it,,and the way you know thatnthey don't actually believe it,is that while they say with theirnwords that privacy doesn't matter,,with their actions, they take all kinds of steps,to safeguard their privacy.,They put passwords on their email,and their social media accounts,,they put locks on their bedroom,and bathroom doors,,all steps designed to prevent other people,from entering what they consider their private realm,and knowing what it is that theyndon't want other people to know.,The very same Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google,,ordered his employees at Google,to cease speaking with the online,Internet magazine CNET,after CNET published an article,full of personal, private information,about Eric Schmidt,,which it obtained exclusivelynthrough Google searches,and using other Google products. (Laughter),This same division can be seen,with the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,,who in an infamous interview in 2010,pronounced that privacy is no longer,a "social norm.",Last year, Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife,purchased not only their own house,but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto,for a total of 30 million dollars,in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy,that prevented other people from monitoring,what they do in their personal lives. 
 Over the last 16 months, as I'vendebated this issue around the world,,every single time somebody has said to me,,"I don't really worry about invasions of privacy,because I don't have anything to hide.",I always say the same thing to them.,I get out a pen, I write down my email address.,I say, "Here's my email address.,What I want you to do when you get home,is email me the passwords,to all of your email accounts,,not just the nice, respectable work one in your name,,but all of them,,because I want to be able to just troll through,what it is you're doing online,,read what I want to read andnpublish whatever I find interesting.,After all, if you're not a bad person,,if you're doing nothing wrong,,you should have nothing to hide." 
 Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.,I check and — (Applause),I check that email account religiously all the time.,It's a very desolate place.,And there's a reason for that,,which is that we as human beings,,even those of us who in words,disclaim the importance of our own privacy,,instinctively understand,the profound importance of it.,It is true that as human beings, we're social animals,,which means we have a need for other people,to know what we're doing and saying and thinking,,which is why we voluntarily publishninformation about ourselves online.,But equally essential to what it means,to be a free and fulfilled human being,is to have a place that we can go,and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.,There's a reason why we seek that out,,and our reason is that all of us —,not just terrorists and criminals, all of us —,have things to hide.,There are all sorts of things that we do and think,that we're willing to tell our physician,or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse,or our best friend that we would be mortified,for the rest of the world to learn.,We make judgments every single day,about the kinds of things that we say and think and do,that we're willing to have other people know,,and the kinds of things that we say and think and do,that we don't want anyone else to know about.,People can very easily in words claim,that they don't value their privacy,,but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief. 
 Now, there's a reason why privacy is so craved,universally and instinctively.,It isn't just a reflexive movement,like breathing air or drinking water.,The reason is that when we're in a state,where we can be monitored,nwhere we can be watched,,our behavior changes dramatically.,The range of behavioral options that we consider,when we think we're being watched,severely reduce.,This is just a fact of human nature,that has been recognized in social science,and in literature and in religion,and in virtually every field of discipline.,There are dozens of psychological studies,that prove that when somebody knows,that they might be watched,,the behavior they engage in,is vastly more conformist and compliant.,Human shame is a very powerful motivator,,as is the desire to avoid it,,and that's the reason why people,,when they're in a state ofnbeing watched, make decisions,not that are the byproduct of their own agency,but that are about the expectations,that others have of them,or the mandates of societal orthodoxy. 
 This realization was exploited most powerfully,for pragmatic ends by the 18th-ncentury philosopher Jeremy Bentham,,who set out to resolve an important problem,ushered in by the industrial age,,where, for the first time, institutions had become,so large and centralized,that they were no longer able to monitor,and therefore control each onenof their individual members,,and the solution that he devised,was an architectural design,originally intended to be implemented in prisons,that he called the panopticon,,the primary attribute of which was the construction,of an enormous tower in the center of the institution,where whoever controlled the institution,could at any moment watch any of the inmates,,although they couldn't watch all of them at all times.,And crucial to this design,was that the inmates could not actually,see into the panopticon, into the tower,,and so they never knew,if they were being watched or even when.,And what made him so excited about this discovery,was that that would mean that the prisoners,would have to assume that they were being watched,at any given moment,,which would be the ultimate enforcer,for obedience and compliance.,The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault,realized that that model could be used,not just for prisons but for every institution,that seeks to control human behavior:,schools, hospitals, factories, workplaces.,And what he said was that this mindset,,this framework discovered by Bentham,,was the key means of societal control,for modern, Western societies,,which no longer need,the overt weapons of tyranny —,punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents,,or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party —,because mass surveillance creates,a prison in the mind,that is a much more subtle,though much more effective means,of fostering compliance with social norms,or with social orthodoxy,,much more effective,than brute force could ever be. 
 The most iconic work of literature about surveillance,and privacy is the George Orwell novel "1984,",which we all learn in school, andntherefore it's almost become a cliche.,In fact, whenever you bring it upnin a debate about surveillance,,people instantaneously dismiss it,as inapplicable, and what they say is,,"Oh, well in '1984,' there werenmonitors in people's homes,,they were being watched at every given moment,,and that has nothing to do withnthe surveillance state that we face.",That is an actual fundamental misapprehension,of the warnings that Orwell issued in "1984.",The warning that he was issuing,was about a surveillance state,not that monitored everybody at all times,,but where people were aware that they could,be monitored at any given moment.,Here is how Orwell's narrator, Winston Smith,,described the surveillance system,that they faced:,"There was, of course, no way of knowing,whether you were being watchednat any given moment.",He went on to say,,"At any rate, they could plug in your wire,whenever they wanted to.,You had to live, did live,,from habit that became instinct,,in the assumption that every sound you made,was overheard and except in darkness,every movement scrutinized." 
 The Abrahamic religions similarly posit,that there's an invisible, all-knowing authority,who, because of its omniscience,,always watches whatever you're doing,,which means you never have a private moment,,the ultimate enforcer,for obedience to its dictates. 
 What all of these seemingly disparate works,recognize, the conclusion that they all reach,,is that a society in which people,can be monitored at all times,is a society that breeds conformity,and obedience and submission,,which is why every tyrant,,the most overt to the most subtle,,craves that system.,Conversely, even more importantly,,it is a realm of privacy,,the ability to go somewhere where we can think,and reason and interact and speak,without the judgmental eyesnof others being cast upon us,,in which creativity and exploration,and dissent exclusively reside,,and that is the reason why,,when we allow a society to exist,in which we're subject to constant monitoring,,we allow the essence of human freedom,to be severely crippled. 
 The last point I want to observe about this mindset,,the idea that only people who nare doing something wrong,have things to hide and thereforenreasons to care about privacy,,is that it entrenches two very destructive messages,,two destructive lessons,,the first of which is that,the only people who care about privacy,,the only people who will seek out privacy,,are by definition bad people.,This is a conclusion that we should have,all kinds of reasons for avoiding,,the most important of which is that when you say,,"somebody who is doing bad things,",you probably mean thingsnlike plotting a terrorist attack,or engaging in violent criminality,,a much narrower conception,of what people who wield power mean,when they say, "doing bad things.",For them, "doing bad things" typically means,doing something that poses meaningful challenges,to the exercise of our own power. 
 The other really destructive,and, I think, even more insidious lesson,that comes from accepting this mindset,is there's an implicit bargain,that people who accept this mindset have accepted,,and that bargain is this:,If you're willing to render yourself,sufficiently harmless,,sufficiently unthreatening,to those who wield political power,,then and only then can you be free,of the dangers of surveillance.,It's only those who are dissidents,,who challenge power,,who have something to worry about.,There are all kinds of reasons why wenshould want to avoid that lesson as well.,You may be a person who, right now,,doesn't want to engage in that behavior,,but at some point in the future you might.,Even if you're somebody who decides,that you never want to,,the fact that there are other people,who are willing to and able to resist,and be adversarial to those in power —,dissidents and journalists,and activists and a whole range of others —,is something that brings us all collective good,that we should want to preserve.,Equally critical is that the measure,of how free a society is,is not how it treats its good,,obedient, compliant citizens,,but how it treats its dissidents,and those who resist orthodoxy.,But the most important reason,is that a system of mass surveillance,suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.,It renders off-limits,all kinds of behavioral choices,without our even knowing that it's happened.,The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg,once said, "He who does not move,does not notice his chains.",We can try and render the chains,of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable,,but the constraints that it imposes on us,do not become any less potent. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Glenn, thank you.,The case is rather convincing, I have to say,,but I want to bring you back,to the last 16 months and to Edward Snowden,for a few questions, if you don't mind.,The first one is personal to you.,We have all read about the arrest of your partner,,David Miranda in London, and other difficulties,,but I assume that,in terms of personal engagement and risk,,that the pressure on you is not that easy,to take on the biggest sovereign norganizations in the world.,Tell us a little bit about that. 
 Glenn Greenwald: You know, I thinknone of the things that happens,is that people's courage in this regard,gets contagious,,and so although I and the othernjournalists with whom I was working,were certainly aware of the risk —,the United States continues to benthe most powerful country in the world,and doesn't appreciate it when you,disclose thousands of their secrets,on the Internet at will —,seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old,ordinary person who grew up in,a very ordinary environment,exercise the degree of principledncourage that Edward Snowden risked,,knowing that he was going to gonto prison for the rest of his life,or that his life would unravel,,inspired me and inspired other journalists,and inspired, I think, people around the world,,including future whistleblowers,,to realize that they can engagenin that kind of behavior as well. 
 BG: I'm curious about yournrelationship with Ed Snowden,,because you have spoken with him a lot,,and you certainly continue doing so,,but in your book, you never call him Edward,,nor Ed, you say "Snowden." How come? 
 GG: You know, I'm sure that's something,for a team of psychologists to examine.n(Laughter),I don't really know. The reason I think that,,one of the important objectives that he actually had,,one of his, I think, most important tactics,,was that he knew that one of the ways,to distract attention from thensubstance of the revelations,would be to try and personalize the focus on him,,and for that reason, he stayed out of the media.,He tried not to ever have his personal life,subject to examination,,and so I think calling him Snowden,is a way of just identifying himnas this important historical actor,rather than trying to personalize him in a way,that might distract attention from the substance. 
 Moderator: So his revelations, your analysis,,the work of other journalists,,have really developed the debate,,and many governments, for example, have reacted,,including in Brazil, with projects and programs,to reshape a little bit the design of the Internet, etc.,There are a lot of things going on in that sense.,But I'm wondering, for you personally,,what is the endgame?,At what point will you think,,well, actually, we've succeeded nin moving the dial? 
 GG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist,is very simple, which is to make sure,that every single document that's newsworthy,and that ought to be disclosed,ends up being disclosed,,and that secrets that should nevernhave been kept in the first place,end up uncovered.,To me, that's the essence of journalism,and that's what I'm committed to doing.,As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious,for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more,,I mean, I look at this as work that will never end,until governments around the world,are no longer able to subject entire populations,to monitoring and surveillance,unless they convince some court or some entity,that the person they've targeted,has actually done something wrong.,To me, that's the way thatnprivacy can be rejuvenated. 
 BG: So Snowden is very,nas we've seen at TED,,is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself,as a defender of democratic values,and democratic principles.,But then, many people really nfind it difficult to believe,that those are his only motivations.,They find it difficult to believe,that there was no money involved,,that he didn't sell some of those secrets,,even to China and to Russia,,which are clearly not the best friends,of the United States right now.,And I'm sure many people in the room,are wondering the same question.,Do you consider it possible there is,that part of Snowden we've not seen yet? 
 GG: No, I consider that absurd and idiotic.,(Laughter) If you wanted to,,and I know you're just playing devil's advocate,,but if you wanted to sell,secrets to another country,,which he could have done and become,extremely rich doing so,,the last thing you would ndo is take those secrets,and give them to journalists andnask journalists to publish them,,because it makes those secrets worthless.,People who want to enrich themselves,do it secretly by selling nsecrets to the government,,but I think there's one important point worth making,,which is, that accusation comes from,people in the U.S. government,,from people in the media who are loyalists,to these various governments,,and I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people —,"Oh, he can't really be doing this,for principled reasons,,he must have some corrupt, nefarious reason" —,they're saying a lot more about themselves,than they are the target of their accusations,,because — (Applause) —,those people, the ones who make that accusation,,they themselves never act,for any reason other than corrupt reasons,,so they assume,that everybody else is plagued by the same disease,of soullessness as they are,,and so that's the assumption.,(Applause) 
 BG: Glenn, thank you very much.nGG: Thank you very much. 
 BG: Glenn Greenwald.,(Applause)Well, good afternoon.,How many of you,took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?,(Applause),Woo hoo!,Well, I have to tell you, from nthe bottom of our hearts,,thank you so very, very much.,Do you know to date the ALS Association,has raised 125 million dollars?,Woo hoo! (Applause) 
 It takes me back to the summer of 2011.,My family, my kids had all grown up.,We were officially empty nesters,,and we decided, let's ngo on a family vacation.,Jenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law,came down from New York.,My youngest, Andrew,,he came down from his home in Charlestown,where he was working in Boston,,and my son Pete,,who had played at nBoston College, baseball,,had played baseball nprofessionally in Europe,,and had now come home and was sellingngroup insurance, he also joined us.,And one night, I found myself,having a beer with Pete,,and Pete was looking at nme and he just said,,"You know, Mom, I don't know,,selling group insurance nis just not my passion.",He said, "I just don't feel nI'm living up to my potential.,I don't feel this is my mission in life.",And he said, "You know, noh by the way, Mom,,I have to leave early from vacation,because my inter-city league team nthat I play for made the playoffs,,and I have to get back to Boston nbecause I can't let my team down.,I'm just not as passionate about my job,as I am about baseball." 
 So off Pete went, and nleft the family vacation —,break a mother's heart —,and he went, and we nfollowed four days later,to see the next playoff game.,We're at the playoff game, nPete's at the plate,,and a fastball's coming in,,and it hits him on the wrist.,Oh, Pete.,His wrist went completely limp, like this.,So for the next six months,,Pete went back to his home in Southie,,kept working that unpassionate job,,and was going to doctors,to see what was wrong with this wrist,that never came back. 
 Six months later, in March,,he called my husband nand me, and he said,,"Oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor,that found a diagnosis for that wrist.,Do you want to come with thendoctor's appointment with me?",I said, "Sure, we'll come in.",That morning, Pete, John and I,all got up, got dressed, got in our cars —,three separate cars,because we were going to go to work,after the doctor's appointment tonfind out what happened to the wrist.,We walked into the nneurologist's office, sat down,,four doctors walk in,,and the head neurologist sits down.,And he says, "Well, Pete, we'venbeen looking at all the tests,,and I have to tell you, nit's not a sprained wrist,,it's not a broken wrist,,it's not nerve damage in the wrist,,it's not an infection,,it's not Lyme disease.",And there was this deliberate nelimination going up,,and I was thinking to myself,,where is he going with this?,Then he put his hands on his knees,,he looked right at my n27-year-old kid, and said,,"I don't know how to ntell a 27-year-old this:,Pete, you have ALS.",ALS?,I had had a friend whose n80-year-old father had ALS.,I looked at my husband, he looked at me,,and then we looked at the ndoctor, and we said, "ALS?,Okay, what treatment? Let's go.,What do we do? Let's go.",And he looked at us, and hensaid, "Mr. and Mrs. Frates,,I'm sorry to tell you this,,but there's no treatment nand there's no cure.",We were the worst culprits.,We didn't even understand,that it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig,and nothing had been done nin the progress against ALS. 
 So we all went home, and Jenn and Dan,flew home from Wall Street,,Andrew came home from Charlestown,,and Pete went to B.C. to pick up,his then-girlfriend Julie nand brought her home,,and six hours later after diagnosis,,we're sitting around nhaving a family dinner,,and we're having small chat.,I don't even remember ncooking dinner that night.,But then our leader, Pete, set the vision,,and talked to us just like nwe were his new team.,He said, "There will be nno wallowing, people.",He goes, "We're not looking back,,we're looking forward.,What an amazing opportunity nwe have to change the world.,I'm going to change the face,of this unacceptable situation of ALS.,We're going to move the needle,,and I'm going to get it in frontnof philanthropists like Bill Gates.",And that was it. We nwere given our directive. 
 So in the days and months that followed,,within a week, we had nour brothers and sisters,and our family come to us,,that they were already ncreating Team Frate Train.,Uncle Dave, he was the webmaster;,Uncle Artie, he was the accountant;,Auntie Dana, she was the graphic artist;,and my youngest son, Andrew,,quit his job, left his napartment in Charlestown,and says, "I'm going to take care nof Pete and be his caregiver.",Then all those people, nclassmates, teammates,,coworkers that Pete had inspired,throughout his whole life,,the circles of Pete all startednintersecting with one another,,and made Team Frate Train. 
 Six months after diagnosis,,Pete was given an award at a nresearch summit for advocacy.,He got up and gave a very eloquent speech,,and at the end of the nspeech, there was a panel,,and on the panel were thesenpharmaceutical executives,and biochemists and clinicians,and I'm sitting there and nI'm listening to them,and most of the content nwent straight over my head.,I avoided every science nclass I ever could.,But I was watching these people,nand I was listening to them,,and they were saying, n"I, I do this, I do that,",and there was a real nunfamiliarity between them.,So at the end of their talk, the panel,,they had questions and answers,,and boom, my hand went right up,,and I get the microphone,,and I look at them and I say, "Thank you.,Thank you so much for working in ALS.,It means so very much to us.",I said, "But I do have to tell you,that I'm watching your body language,and I'm listening to what you're saying.,It just doesn't seem like there's a whole nlot of collaboration going on here.,And not only that, where's the flip chart,with the action items and the nfollow-up and the accountability?,What are you going to do nafter you leave this room?" 
 And then I turned around,and there was about 200 pairs nof eyes just staring at me.,And it was that point that I realized,that I had talked about nthe elephant in the room.,Thus my mission had begun.,So over the next couple of years,,Pete — we've had our highs and our lows.,Pete was put on a compassionate use drug.,It was hope in a bottle for nthe whole ALS community.,It was in a phase III trial.,Then six months later, the ndata comes back: no efficacy.,We were supposed to nhave therapies overseas,,and the rug was npulled out from under us.,So for the next two years,,we just watched my son nbe taken away from me,,little by little every day.,Two and a half years ago,,Pete was hitting home nruns at baseball fields.,Today, Pete's completely paralyzed.,He can't hold his head up any longer.,He's confined to a motorized wheelchair.,He can no longer swallow or eat.,He has a feeding tube.,He can't speak.,He talks with eye gaze technology,and a speech generating device,,and we're watching his lungs,,because his diaphragm neventually is going to give out,and then the decision will be madento put him on a ventilator or not.,ALS robs the human of all their physical nparts, but the brain stays intact. 
 So July 4th, 2014,,75th year of Lou Gehrig's ninspirational speech comes,,and Pete is asked by MLB.com to writenan article in the Bleacher Report.,And it was very significant, because he nwrote it using his eye gaze technology. 
 Twenty days later, nthe ice started to fall.,On July 27th, Pete's nroommate in New York City,,wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt,,signifying Pat Quinn, another nALS patient known in New York,,and B.C. shorts,said, "I'm taking the ALS nIce Bucket Challenge,",picked up the ice, put it over his head.,"And I'm nominating ..." nAnd he sent it up to Boston.,And that was on July 27th.,Over the next couple nof days, our news feed,was full of family and friends.,If you haven't gone back,nthe nice thing about Facebook,is that you have the dates, you can go back.,You've got to see Uncle Artie's nhuman Bloody Mary.,I'm telling you, it's one of the best ones,,and that was probably in day two.,By about day four, Uncle nDave, the webmaster,,he isn't on Facebook,,and I get a text from him, nand it says, "Nancy,,what the hell is going on?",Uncle Dave gets a hit nevery time Pete's website,is gone onto, and his nphone was blowing up.,So we all sat down and we realized,,money is coming in — how amazing. 
 So we knew awareness nwould lead to funding,,we just didn't know it wouldnonly take a couple of days.,So we got together, put our best n501(c)(3)s on Pete's website,,and off we went.,So week one, Boston media.,Week two, national media.,It was during week two nthat our neighbor next door,opened up our door and threw a pizza,across the kitchen floor, saying,,"I think you people might nneed food in there.",(Laughter),Week three, celebrities — nEntertainment Tonight,,Access Hollywood.,Week four, global — BBC, Irish Radio.,Did anyone see "Lost In Translation"?,My husband did Japanese television.,It was interesting.,(Laughter),And those videos, the popular ones.,Paul Bissonnette's nglacier video, incredible.,How about the redemption nuns of Dublin?,Who's seen that one?,It's absolutely fantastic.,J.T., Justin Timberlake.,That's when we knew, that nwas a real A-list celebrity.,I go back on my texts, and I can see,"JT! JT!" My sister texting me.,Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany.,Incredible.,And the ALS patients,,you know what their favoritenones are, and their families'?,All of them.,Because this misunderstood and nunderfunded "rare" disease,,they just sat and watched people nsaying it over and over: "ALS, ALS.",It was unbelievable. 
 And those naysayers,,let's just talk a couple nof stats, shall we?,Okay, so the ALS Association,,they think by year end,nit'll be 160 million dollars.,ALS TDI in Cambridge,,they raised three million dollars.,Well, guess what?,They had a clinical trial for a drugnthat they've been developing.,It was on a three-year track for funding.,Two months.,It's coming out starting in two months.,(Applause),And YouTube has reported,that over 150 countries have postednIce Bucket Challenges for ALS.,And Facebook, 2.5 million videos,,and I had the awesome adventure,visiting the Facebook campus last week,,and I said to them, "I knownwhat it was like in my house.,I can't imagine what it nwas like around here.",All she said was, "Jaw-dropping." 
 And my family's favorite video?,Bill Gates.,Because the night Pete was diagnosed,,he told us that he was going to get ALS innfront of philanthropists like Bill Gates,,and he did it.,Goal number one, check.,Now on to the treatment and cure.,(Applause) 
 So okay, after all of this ice,,we know that it was much more,than just pouring buckets of nice water over your head,,and I really would like to leave you,with a couple of things that nI'd like you to remember.,The first thing is,,every morning when you wake up,,you can choose to live your day in positivity.,Would any of you blame me,if I just was in the fetal position,and pulled the covers nover my head every day?,No, I don't think anybody would blame me,,but Pete has inspired us to wake up,every morning and be npositive and proactive.,I actually had to ditch support groups,because everybody was in there saying that,spraying their lawns with chemicals,,that's why they got ALS,,and I was like, "I don't think so,",but I had to get away from the negativity. 
 The second thing I want to leave you with,is the person at the nmiddle of the challenge,has to be willing to have nthe mental toughness,to put themselves out there.,Pete still goes to baseball games,and he still sits with his nteammates in the dugout,,and he hangs his gravity feed bag,right on the cages.,You'll see the kids, they're nup there hanging it up.,"Pete, is that okay?" "Yup.",And then they put it nright into his stomach.,Because he wants them to seenwhat the reality of this is,,and how he's never, ever going to give up. 
 And the third thing I nwant to leave you with:,If you ever come across a situation,that you see as so unacceptable,,I want you to dig down as deep as you can,and find your best mother bear,and go after it.,(Applause),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 I know that I'm running over,,but I've got to leave you with this:,the gifts that my son has given me.,I have had 29 years,of having the honor of being the mother,of Pete Frates.,Pete Frates has been inspiring nand leading his whole life.,He's thrown out kindness,,and all that kindness nhas come back to him.,He walks the face of the Earth nright now and knows why he's here.,What a gift. 
 The second thing that my son has given me,is he's given me my mission in life.,Now I know why I'm here.,I'm going to save my son,,and if it doesn't happen in time for him,,I'm going to work so that no other mother,has to go through what I'm going through. 
 And the third thing, nand last but not least,gift that my son has given me,,as an exclamation point,to the miraculous month,of August 2014:,That girlfriend that he went to get on nthe night of diagnosis is now his wife,,and Pete and Julie have given me my ngranddaughter, Lucy Fitzgerald Frates.,Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early,as the exclamation point,on August 31st, 2014. 
 And so —,(Applause) —,And so let me leave you with nPete's words of inspiration,that he would use to classmates,ncoworkers and teammates.,Be passionate.,Be genuine.,Be hardworking.,And don't forget to be great. 
 Thank you. (Applause)As a boy in Lima,,my grandfather told me a legend,of the Spanish conquest of Peru.,Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca,nhad been captured and killed.,Pizarro and his conquistadorsnhad grown rich,,and tales of their conquestnand glory had reached Spain,and was bringing new waves of Spaniards,nhungry for gold and glory.,They would go into towns and ask the Inca,,"Where's another civilizationnwe can conquer? Where's more gold?" 
 And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,,"Go to the Amazon.,You'll find all the gold you want there.,In fact, there is a city called Paititi --nEl Dorado in Spanish --,made entirely of gold." 
 The Spanish set off into the jungle,,but the few that returnncome back with stories,,stories of powerful shamans,,of warriors with poisoned arrows,,of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,,spiders that ate birds,nsnakes that swallowed men whole,and a river that boiled. 
 All this became a childhood memory.,And years passed.,I'm working on my PhD at SMU,,trying to understandnPeru's geothermal energy potential,,when I remember this legend,,and I began asking that question.,Could the boiling river exist? 
 I asked colleagues from universities,,the government,,oil, gas and mining companies,,and the answer was a unanimous no.,And this makes sense.,You see, boiling riversndo exist in the world,,but they're generallynassociated with volcanoes.,You need a powerful heat source,to produce such a largengeothermal manifestation.,And as you can see from the red dotsnhere, which are volcanoes,,we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,,nor in most of Peru.,So it follows: We should not expectnto see a boiling river. 
 Telling this same storynat a family dinner,,my aunt tells me,,"But no, Andrés, I've been there.nI've swum in that river." 
 (Laughter) 
 Then my uncle jumps in.,"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.,You see, you can only swim in itnafter a very heavy rain,,and it's protected by a powerful shaman.,Your aunt, she's friends with his wife." 
 (Laughter) 
 "¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"] 
 You know, despite allnmy scientific skepticism,,I found myself hiking into the jungle,nguided by my aunt,,over 700 kilometers awaynfrom the nearest volcanic center,,and well, honestly,nmentally preparing myself,to behold the legendaryn"warm stream of the Amazon." 
 But then ...,I heard something,,a low surge,that got louder and louder,as we came closer.,It sounded like ocean wavesnconstantly crashing,,and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,ncoming up through the trees.,And then, I saw this. 
 I immediately grabbed for my thermometer,,and the average temperatures in the river,were 86 degrees C.,This is not quitenthe 100-degree C boiling,but definitely close enough.,The river flowed hot and fast.,I followed it upriver and was led by,nactually, the shaman's apprentice,to the most sacred site on the river.,And this is what's bizarre --,It starts off as a cold stream.,And here, at this site,,is the home of the Yacumama,,mother of the waters,na giant serpent spirit,who births hot and cold water.,And here we find a hot spring,,mixing with cold stream waternunderneath her protective motherly jaws,and thus bringing their legends to life. 
 The next morning, I woke up and -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I asked for tea.,I was handed a mug, a tea bag,and, well, pointed towards the river.,To my surprise, the water was cleannand had a pleasant taste,,which is a little weirdnfor geothermal systems. 
 What was amazing,is that the locals had alwaysnknown about this place,,and that I was by no meansnthe first outsider to see it.,It was just part of their everyday life.,They drink its water.,They take in its vapor.,They cook with it,,clean with it,,even make their medicines with it. 
 I met the shaman,,and he seemed like an extensionnof the river and his jungle.,He asked for my intentions,and listened carefully.,Then, to my tremendous relief --,I was freaking out,nto be honest with you --,a smile began to snake across his face,nand he just laughed. 
 (Laughter) 
 I had received the shaman's blessingnto study the river,,on the condition that after I takenthe water samples,and analyze them in my lab,,wherever I was in the world,,that I pour the watersnback into the ground,so that, as the shaman said,,the waters could find their way back home. 
 I've been back every yearnsince that first visit in 2011,,and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,,demanding and at times dangerous.,One story was even featurednin National Geographic Magazine.,I was trapped on a small rocknabout the size of a sheet of paper,in sandals and board shorts,,in between an 80 degree C river,and a hot spring that, well,nlooked like this, close to boiling.,And on top of that,nit was Amazon rain forest.,Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.,The temperature differentialnmade it all white. It was a whiteout.,Intense. 
 Now, after years of work,,I'll soon be submitting my geophysicalnand geochemical studies for publication.,And I'd like to share, today,nwith all of you here, on the TED stage,,for the first time,nsome of these discoveries. 
 Well, first off, it's not a legend.,Surprise! 
 (Laughter) 
 When I first started the research,,the satellite imagery was toonlow-resolution to be meaningful.,There were just no good maps.,Thanks to the supportnof the Google Earth team,,I now have this.,Not only that, the indigenous namenof the river, Shanay-timpishka,,"boiled with the heat of the sun,",indicating that I'm not the firstnto wonder why the river boils,,and showing that humanitynhas always sought to explain,the world around us. 
 So why does the river boil? 
 (Bubbling sounds) 
 It actually took me three yearsnto get that footage. 
 Fault-fed hot springs.,As we have hot blood runningnthrough our veins and arteries,,so, too, the earth has hot waternrunning through its cracks and faults.,Where these arteries come to the surface,nthese earth arteries,,we'll get geothermal manifestations:,fumaroles, hot springsnand in our case, the boiling river. 
 What's truly incredible, though,nis the scale of this place.,Next time you cross the road,nthink about this.,The river flows wider than a two-lane road,along most of its path.,It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.,Truly impressive.,There are thermal poolsnlarger than this TED stage,,and that waterfall that you see there,is six meters tall --,and all with near-boiling water. 
 We mapped the temperaturesnalong the river,,and this was by far the mostndemanding part of the fieldwork.,And the results were just awesome.,Sorry -- the geoscientistnin me coming out.,And it showed this amazing trend.,You see, the river starts off cold.,It then heats up, cools back down,nheats up, cools back down,,heats up again, and then hasnthis beautiful decay curve,until it smashes into this cold river. 
 Now, I understand not all of younare geothermal scientists,,so to put it in more everyday terms:,Everyone loves coffee.,Yes? Good.,Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,,an extra-hot one, well, 60.,So, put in coffee shop terms,,the boiling river plots like this.,There you have your hot coffee.,Here you have your extra-hot coffee,,and you can seenthat there's a bit point there,where the river is still hotternthan even the extra-hot coffee.,And these are average water temperatures.,We took these in the dry season to ensurenthe purest geothermal temperatures. 
 But there's a magic number herenthat's not being shown,,and that number is 47 degrees C,,because that's where things start to hurt,,and I know this from verynpersonal experience.,Above that temperature,nyou don't want to get in that water.,You need to be careful.,It can be deadly. 
 I've seen all sorts of animals fall in,,and what's shocking to me,nis the process is pretty much the same.,So they fall in and the first thingnto go are the eyes.,Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly.nThey turn this milky-white color.,The stream is carrying them.,They're trying to swim out,nbut their meat is cooking on the bone,because it's so hot.,So they're losing power, losing power,,until finally they get to a pointnwhere hot water goes into their mouths,and they cook from the inside out. 
 (Laughter) 
 A bit sadistic, aren't we?,Jeez.,Leave them marinating for a little longer.,What's, again, amazingnare these temperatures.,They're similar to things that I've seennon volcanoes all over the world,and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone. 
 But here's the thing:,the data is showingnthat the boiling river exists,independent of volcanism.,It's neither magmaticnor volcanic in origin,,and again, over 700 kilometers awaynfrom the nearest volcanic center. 
 How can a boiling river exist like this?,I've asked geothermal expertsnand volcanologists for years,,and I'm still unable to find anothernnon-volcanic geothermal system,of this magnitude.,It's unique.,It's special on a global scale.,So, still -- how does it work?,Where do we get this heat?,There's still more research to be done,to better constrain the problemnand better understand the system,,but from what the data is telling us now,,it looks to be the resultnof a large hydrothermal system. 
 Basically, it works like this:,So, the deeper you goninto the earth, the hotter it gets.,We refer to thisnas the geothermal gradient.,The waters could be comingnfrom as far away as glaciers in the Andes,,then seeping down deep into the earth,and coming out to form the boiling river,after getting heated upnfrom the geothermal gradient,,all due to this unique geologic setting. 
 Now, we foundnthat in and around the river --,this is working with colleagues,from National Geographic,nDr. Spencer Wells,,and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis --,we genetically sequencednthe extremophile lifeforms,living in and around the river,nand have found new lifeforms,,unique species livingnin the boiling river. 
 But again, despite all of these studies,nall of these discoveries and the legends,,a question remains:,What is the significancenof the boiling river?,What is the significancenof this stationary cloud,that always hoversnover this patch of jungle?,And what is the significance,of a detail in a childhood legend? 
 To the shaman and his community,nit's a sacred site.,To me, as a geoscientist,,it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.,But to the illegal loggersnand cattle farmers,,it's just another resource to exploit.,And to the Peruvian government,nit's just another stretch,of unprotected land ready for development. 
 My goal is to ensurenthat whoever controls this land,understands the boiling river'snuniqueness and significance.,Because that's the question,,one of significance.,And the thing there is,,we define significance.,It's us. We have that power.,We are the ones who draw that line,between the sacred and the trivial.,And in this age,,where everything seems mapped,nmeasured and studied,,in this age of information,,I remind you all that discoveriesnare not just made,in the black void of the unknown,but in the white noisenof overwhelming data. 
 There remains so much to explore.,We live in an incredible world.,So go out.,Be curious.,Because we do live in a world,where shamans still singnto the spirits of the jungle,,where rivers do boil,and where legends do come to life. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I am multidisciplinary. 
 As a scientist, I've been a crew commandernfor a NASA Mars simulation last year,,and as an artist, I create multiculturalncommunity art all over the planet.,And recently, I've actuallynbeen combining both.,But let me first talk a little morenabout that NASA mission. 
 This is the HI-SEAS program.,HI-SEAS is a NASA-fundednplanetary surface analogue,on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,,and it's a research programnthat is specifically designed,to study the effectsnof long-term isolation of small crews.,I lived in this dome for four monthsnwith a crew of six,,a very interesting experience, of course.,We did all kinds of research.,Our main researchnwas actually a food study,,but apart from that food study --,developing a new food systemnfor astronauts living in deep space --,we also did all kinds of other research.,We did extra-vehicular activities,nas you can see here,,wearing mock-up space suits,,but we also had our choresnand lots of other stuff to do,,like questionnairesnat the end of every day.,Busy, busy work. 
 Now, as you can imagine,,it's quite challenging to livenwith just a small group of people,in a small space for a long time.,There's all kindsnof psychological challenges:,how to keep a team togethernin these circumstances;,how to deal with the warping of timenyou start to sense,when you're living in these circumstances;,sleep problems that arise; etc.,But also we learned a lot.,I learned a lot aboutnhow individual crew members,actually cope with a situation like this;,how you can keep a crewnproductive and happy,,for example, giving themna good deal of autonomy,is a good trick to do that;,and honestly, I learnedna lot about leadership,,because I was a crew commander. 
 So doing this mission,,I really started thinking more deeplynabout our future in outer space.,We will venture into outer space,nand we will start inhabiting outer space.,I have no doubt about it.,It might take 50 yearsnor it might take 500 years,,but it's going to happen nevertheless.,So I came up withna new art project called Seeker.,And the Seeker project is actuallynchallenging communities all over the world,to come up with starship prototypes,that re-envisionnhuman habitation and survival.,That's the core of the project. 
 Now, one important thing:,This is not a dystopian project.,This is not about, "Oh my God,nthe world is going wrong,and we have to escape because we neednanother future somewhere else.",No, no.,The project is basically inviting people,to take a step awaynfrom earthbound constraints,and, as such, reimagine our future.,And it's really helpful,nand it works really well,,so that's really the important partnof what we're doing. 
 Now, in this project,nI'm using a cocreation approach,,which is a slightly different approach,from what you would expectnfrom many artists.,I'm essentially dropping a basic ideaninto a group, into a community,,people start gravitating to the idea,,and together, we shape nand build the artwork.,It's a little bit like termites, really.,We just work together,,and even, for example,nwhen architects visit what we're doing,,sometimes they have a bitnof a hard time understanding,how we build without a master plan.,We always come up with thesenfantastic large-scale scupltures,that actually we can also inhabit.,The first version was donenin Belgium and Holland.,It was built with a teamnof almost 50 people.,This is the second iterationnof that same project,,but in Slovenia, in a different country,,and the new group was like, we're going nto do the architecture differently.,So they took away the architecture,nthey kept the base of the artwork,,and they built an entirely new,,much more biomorphicnarchitecture on top of that.,And that's anotherncrucial part of the project.,It's an evolving artwork,nevolving architecture.,This was the last version that was justnpresented a few weeks ago in Holland,,which was using caravans nas modules to build a starship.,We bought some second-hand caravans,,cut them open,,and reassembled them into a starship. 
 Now, when we're thinking about starships,,we're not just approaching itnas a technological challenge.,We're really looking at itnas a combination of three systems:,ecology, people and technology.,So there's always a strong ecologicalncomponent in the project.,Here you can see aquaponic systems,that are actuallynsurrounding the astronauts,,so they're constantly in contactnwith part of the food that they're eating. 
 Now, a very typical thing for this project,is that we run our own isolation missionsninside these art and design projects.,We actually lock ourselves upnfor multiple days on end,,and test what we build.,And this is, for example,,on the right hand sidenyou can see an isolation mission,in the Museum of Modern Artnin Ljubljana in Slovenia,,where six artists and designersnlocked themselves up --,I was part of that --,for four days inside the museum.,And, of course, obviously,nthis is a very performative,and very strong experience for all of us. 
 Now, the next version of the projectnis currently being developed,together with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran,nwho is also a TED Fellow,,in the Atacama Desert in Chile,na magical place.,First of all, it's reallynconsidered a Mars analogue.,It really does look like Marsnin certain locations,and has been used by NASAnto test equipment.,And it has a long historynof being connected to space,through observations of the stars.,It's now home to ALMA,,the large telescopenthat's being developed there.,But also, it's the driestnlocation on the planet,,and that makes it extremely interestingnto build our project,,because suddenly, sustainabilitynis something we have to explore fully.,We have no other option,,so I'm very curious to seenwhat's going to happen. 
 Now, a specific thing for thisnparticular version of the project,is that I'm very interested to see,how we can connectnwith the local population,,the native population.,These people have been living therenfor a very long time,and can be considerednexperts in sustainability,,and so I'm very interestednto see what we can learn from them,,and have an input of indigenous knowledgeninto space exploration. 
 So we're trying to redefinenhow we look at our future in outer space,by exploring integration,nbiology, technology and people;,by using a cocreation approach;,and by using and exploringnlocal traditions,and to see how we can learn from the pastnand integrate that into our deep future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the 1600s, there were so manynright whales in Cape Cod Bay,off the east coast of the U.S.,that apparently you couldnwalk across their backs,from one end of the bay to the other.,Today, they number in the hundreds,nand they're endangered.,Like them, many species of whalesnsaw their numbers drastically reduced,by 200 years of whaling,,where they were hunted and killednfor their whale meat, oil and whale bone. 
 We only have whales in our waters today,because of the Save the Whalesnmovement of the '70s.,It was instrumental in stoppingncommercial whaling,,and was built on the idea thatnif we couldn't save whales,,what could we save?,It was ultimately a testnof our political ability,to halt environmental destruction.,So in the early '80s, there wasna ban on commercial whaling,that came into forcenas a result of this campaign.,Whales in our waters are stillnlow in numbers, however,,because they do face a rangenof other human-induced threats. 
 Unfortunately, many people still thinknthat whale conservationists like myself,do what we do only because these creaturesnare charismatic and beautiful.,This is actually a disservice,,because whales are ecosystem engineers.,They help maintain the stabilitynand health of the oceans,,and even provide servicesnto human society. 
 So let's talk about whynsaving whales is critical,to the resiliency of the oceans.,It boils down to two main things:,whale poop and rotting carcasses. 
 As whales dive to the depths to feednand come up to the surface to breathe,,they actually release thesenenormous fecal plumes.,This whale pump, as it's called,,actually brings essential limiting nnutrients from the depths,to the surface waters where they nstimulate the growth of phytoplankton,,which forms the basenof all marine food chains.,So really, having more whalesnin the oceans pooping,is really beneficialnto the entire ecosystem. 
 Whales are also known to undertake some nof the longest migrations of all mammals.,Gray whales off Americanmigrate 16,000 kilometers,between productive feeding areas and lessnproductive calving, or birthing, areas,and back every year.,As they do so, they transport fertilizernin the form of their feces,from places that have itnto places that need it.,So clearly, whales are reallynimportant in nutrient cycling,,both horizontally and vertically,nthrough the oceans. 
 But what's really cool is that they're nalso really important after they're dead.,Whale carcasses are some of nthe largest form of detritus,to fall from the ocean's surface, nand they're called whale fall.,As these carcasses sink,,they provide a feastnto some 400-odd species,,including the eel-shaped, slime-producing nhagfish.,So over the 200 years of whaling,,when we were busy killing and removingnthese carcasses from the oceans,,we likely altered the rate and geographic ndistribution of these whale falls,that would descend into deep oceans,,and as a result, probably lednto a number of extinctions,of species that were most specialized,and dependent on these carcassesnfor their survival. 
 Whale carcasses are also knownnto transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,,which is the equivalent of that produced,by 80,000 cars per year,from the atmosphere to the deep oceans,,and the deep oceansnare what we call "carbon sinks,",because they trap and holdnexcess carbon from the atmosphere,,and therefore helpnto delay global warming.,Sometimes these carcassesnalso wash up on beaches,and provide a meal to a numbernof predatory species on land. 
 The 200 years of whalingnwas clearly detrimental,and caused a reductionnin the populations of whales,between 60 to 90 percent.,Clearly, the Save the Whales movement,was instrumental in preventingncommercial whaling from going on,,but we need to revise this.,We need to address the more modern,npressing problems that these whales face,in our waters today.,Amongst other things, we need to stop them,from getting plowed down by container nships when they're in their feeding areas,,and stop them from gettingnentangled in fishing nets,as they float around in the ocean.,We also need to learn to contextualizenour conservation messages,,so people really understand the true necosystem value of these creatures. 
 So, let's save the whales again,,but this time, let's not just ndo it for their sake.,Let's also do it for ours. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher,,and I'll explain hownthese identities come together. 
 It started four years ago,,when a friend and I openednour first Ramadan fast,at one of the busiest mosquesnin New York City.,Crowds of men with beards and skullcapsnwere swarming the streets.,It was an FBI agent's wet dream.n(Laughter),But being a part of this community,nwe knew how welcoming this space was.,For years, I'd seen photos nof this space being documented,as a lifeless and cold monolith,,much like the stereotypical imagenpainted of the American Muslim experience. 
 Frustrated by this myopic view,,my friend and I had this crazy idea:,Let's break our fastnat a different mosque in a different state,each night of Ramadan,and share those stories on a blog.,We called it "30 Mosques in 30 Days,",and we drove to all the 50 states,and shared stories from over 100nvastly different Muslim communities,,ranging from the Cambodian refugeesnin the L.A. projects,to the black Sufis livingnin the woods of South Carolina.,What emerged was a beautifulnand complicated portrait of America.,The media coveragenforced local journalists,to revisit their Muslim communities,,but what was really excitingnwas seeing people from around the world,being inspired to takentheir own 30-mosque journey.,There were even these two NFL athletes,who took a sabbaticalnfrom the league to do so. 
 And as 30 Mosquesnwas blossoming around the world,,I was actually stuck in Pakistannworking on a film.,My codirector, Omar, and I were at na breaking point with many of our friends,on how to position the film.,The movie is called "These Birds Walk,",and it is about wayward street kids,who are struggling to findnsome semblance of family.,We focus on the complexitiesnof youth and family discord,,but our friends kept on nudging usnto comment on drones and target killings,to make the film "more relevant,",essentially reducing these peoplenwho have entrusted us with their stories,into sociopolitical symbols.,Of course, we didn't listen to them,,and instead, we championednthe tender gestures of love,and headlong flashes of youth.,The agenda behind our cinematic nimmersion was only empathy,,an emotion that's largely ndeficient from films,that come from our region of the world. 
 And as "These Birds Walk" played at film nfestivals and theaters internationally,,I finally had my feetnplanted at home in New York,,and with all the extra timenand still no real money,,my wife tasked me to cook more for us.,And whenever I'd go to the local butchernto purchase some halal meat,,something felt off. 
 For those that don't know,nhalal is a term used for meat,that is raised and slaughtered humanelynfollowing very strict Islamic guidelines.,Unfortunately, the majoritynof halal meat in America,doesn't rise to the standardnthat my faith calls for.,The more I learnednabout these unethical practices,,the more violated I felt,,particularly because businessesnfrom my own community,were the ones taking advantagenof my orthodoxy.,So, with emotions running high,nand absolutely no experience in butchery,,some friends and I opened a meat store,in the heart of thenEast Village fashion district.,(Laughter),We call it Honest Chops,,and we're reclaiming halal by sourcingnorganic, humanely raised animals,,and by making it accessible and affordablento working-class families.,There's really nothing like it in America.,The unbelievable part is actuallynthat 90 percent of our in-store customers,are not even Muslim.,For many, it is their first time ninteracting with Islam,on such an intimate level. 
 So all these disparate projects --n(Laughter) --,are the result of a restlessness.,They are a visceral responsento the businesses and curators,who work hard to oversimplifynmy beliefs and my community,,and the only way to beat their machinenis to play by different rules.,We must fight with an inventive approach.,With the trust, with the access,nwith the love that only we can bring,,we must unapologeticallynreclaim our beliefs,in every moving image,nin every cut of meat,,because if we whitewash our storiesnfor the sake of mass appeal,,not only will we fail,,but we will be trumped by thosenwith more money and more resources,to tell our stories.,But the call for creative couragenis not for novelty or relevance.,It is simply because our communitiesnare so damn unique and so damn beautiful.,They demand us to find uncompromising waysnto be acknowledged and respected.,Thank you.,(Applause)Has anyone among younever been exposed to tear gas?,Tear gas? Anyone?,I'm sorry to hear that, so you might knownthat it's a very toxic substance,,but you might not knownthat it's a very simple molecule,with an unpronouncable name:,it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile.,I made it.,It's decades old, but it's becomingnvery trendy among police forces,around the planet lately, it seems,,and according to my experiencenas a non-voluntary breather of it,,tear gas has two mainnbut quite opposite effects.,One, it can really burn your eyes,,and two, it can alsonhelp you to open them. 
 Tear gas definitely helpednto open mine to something,that I want to sharenwith you this afternoon:,that livestreaming the powernof independent broadcasts through the web,can be a game-changer in journalism,,in activism, and as I see it,nin the political discourse as well. 
 That idea started nto dawn on me in early 2011,when I was coveringna protest in São Paulo.,It was the marijuana march,,a gathering of people askingnfor the legalization of cannabis.,When that group started to move,,the riot police came from the backnwith rubber bullets, bombs,,and then the gas.,But to make a long story short,,I had entered that protestnas the editor-in-chief,of a well-established printed magazinenwhere I'd worked for 11 years,,and thanks to this unsolicitedneffects of tear gas,,I left it as a journalist that was nowncommitted to new ways,of sharing the raw experiencenof what it's like to be there, actually. 
 So in the following week,nI was back in the streets,,but that time, I wasn't a membernof any media outlet anymore.,I was there as an independentnlivestreamer, and all I had with me,was basically borrowed equipment.,I had a very simple cameranand a backpack with 3G modems.,And I had this weblinknthat could be shared through social media,,could be put in any website,,and that time,nthe protest went along fine.,There was no violence.,There was no action scenes.,But there was something really exciting,,because I could see at a distancenthe TV channels covering it,,and they had these big vansnand the teams and the cameras,,and I was basically doing the same thing,and all I had was a backpack.,And that was reallynexciting to a journalist,,but the most interesting partnwas when I got back home, actually,,because I learned that I had been watched,by more than 90,000 people,,and I got hundreds of emails and messagesnof people asking me, basically,,how did I do it,,how it was possible to do such a thing. 
 And I learned something else,nthat that was actually the first time,that somebody had ever donena livestreaming in a street protest,in the country.,And that really shocked me,,because I was no geek,nI was no technology guy,,and all the equipment needednwas already there,,was easily available.,And I realized thatnwe had a frontier here,,a very important one,,that it was just a matternof changing the perspective,,and the web could be actually used,,already used, as a colossalnand uncontrollable,and highly anarchical TV channel,nTV network,,and anyone with very basic skillsnand very basic equipment,,even someone like me who had thisnlittle stuttering issue,,so if it happens, bear with me please,,even someone like mencould become a broadcaster.,And that sounded revolutionary in my mind. 
 So for the next couple of years,,I started to experiment withnlivestreaming in different ways,,not only in the streetsnbut mostly in studios and in homes,,until the beginning of 2013, last year,,when I became the cofounder of a groupncalled Mídia NINJA.,NINJA is an acronym,that stands for Narrativas Independentes nJornalismo e Ação,,or in English, independent narratives,njournalism, and action.,It was a media groupnthat had little media plan.,We didn't have any financial structure.,We were not planningnto make money out of this,,which was wise, because you shouldn'tntry to make money out of journalism now.,But we had a very solidnand clear conviction,,that we knew that the hyperconnectednenvironment of social media,could maybe allow us to consolidate,a network of experimental journalistsnthroughout the country.,So we launched a Facebook page first,nand then a manifesto,,and started to cover the streetsnin a very simple way. 
 But then something happened,nsomething that wasn't predicted,,that no one could have anticipated.,Street protests startednto erupt in São Paulo.,They began as very local and specific.,They were against the bus fare hikenthat had just happened in the city.,This is a bus.,It's written there, "Theft.",But those kind of manifestationsnstarted to grow,,and they kept happening.,So the police violence against themnstarted to grow as well.,But there was another conflict,,the one I believe that'snmore important here,to make my point thatnit was a narrative conflict.,There was this mainstream medianversion of the facts,that anyone who was on the streetsncould easily challenge,if they presented their own visionnof what was actually happening there.,And it was this clash of visions,nthis clash of narratives,,that I think turned those protests,into a long period in the countrynof political reckoning,where hundreds of thousands of people,,probably more than a million people,took to the streets in the whole country. 
 But it wasn't aboutnthe bus fare hike anymore.,It was about everything.,The people's demands, their expectations,,the reasons why they were on the streets,could be as diverse as they couldnbe contradictory in many cases.,If you could read it,nyou would understand me.,But it was in this environmentnof political catharsis,that the country was going through,that it had to do with politics, indeed,,but it had to do alsonwith a new way of organizing,,through a new way of communicating.,It was in that environmentnthat Mídia NINJA emerged,from almost anonymitynto become a national phenomenon,,because we did have the right equipment.,We are not using big cameras.,We are using basically this.,We are using smartphones.,And that, actually, allowed us to becomeninvisible in the middle of the protests,,but it allowed us to do something else:,to show what it was likento be in the protests,,to present to people at homena subjective perspective. 
 But there was somethingnthat is more important,,I think, than the equipment.,It was our mindset,,because we are not behavingnas a media outlet.,We are not competing for news.,We are trying to encourage people,,to invite people,nand to actually teach people,how to do this, how they alsoncould become broadcasters.,And that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJAnfrom a small group of people,,and in a matter of weeks,,we multiplied and we grewnexponentially throughout the country.,So in a matter of a week or two,nas the protests kept happening,,we were hundreds of young people,connected in this networknthroughout the country.,We were covering more thann50 cities at the same time.,That's something thatnno TV channel could ever do.,That was responsiblenfor turning us suddenly, actually,,into kind of the mainstreamnmedia of social media.,So we had a couple of thousandsnof followers on our Facebook page,,and soon we had a quarternof a million followers.,Our posts and our videos,were being seen by more thann11 million timelines a week.,It was way more than any newspapernor any magazine could ever do. 
 And that turned Mídia NINJAninto something else,,more than a media outlet,nthan a media project.,It became almost like a public service,to the citizen, to the protester,,to the activist,,because they had a very simplenand efficient and peaceful tool,to confront both policenand media authority.,Many of our images started nto be used in regular TV channels.,Our livestreams started to be broadcastneven in regular televisions,when things got really rough.,Some our images were responsiblento take some people out of jail,,people who were being arrested unfairly,under false accusations,nand we could prove them innocent.,And that also turned Mídia NINJA very soon,to be seen as almostnan enemy of cops, unfortunately,,and we started to be severely beaten,nand eventually arrested on the streets.,It happened in many cases.,But that was also useful,nbecause we were still at the web,,so that helped to triggernan important debate in the country,on the role of the media itself,and the state of the freedomnof the press in the country. 
 So Mídia NINJA now evolved,and finally consolidated itselfnin what we hoped it would become:,a national networknof hundreds of young people,,self-organizing themselves locally,to cover social, human rights issues,,and expressing themselvesnnot only politically,but journalistically. 
 What I started to donin the beginning of this year,,as Mídia NINJA is alreadyna self-organizing network,,I'm dedicating myself to another project.,It's called Fluxo,nwhich is Portuguese for "stream.",It's a journalism studionin São Paulo downtown,,where I used livestream to experiment,with what I call post-television formats.,But I'm also trying to come up with waysnto finance independent journalism,through a direct relationshipnwith an audience,,with an active audience,,because now I really wantnto try to make a living,out of my tear gas resolution back then. 
 But there's somethingnmore significant here,,something that I believe is more importantnand more crucial than my personal example.,I said that livestream could turn the webninto a colossal TV network,,but I believe it does something else,,because after watching people using it,,not only to cover things but to express,nto organize themselves politically,,I believe livestream can turn cyberspaceninto a global political arena,where everyone might have a voice,,a proper voice,,because livestream takes the monopolynof the broadcast political discourse,,of the verbal aspectnof the political dialogue,out of the mouths of just politiciansnand political pundits alone,,and it empowers the citizennthrough this direct and non-mediated power,of exchanging experiences and dialogue,,empowers them to questionnand to influence authorities,in ways in which we are about to see. 
 And I believe it does something elsenthat might be even more important,,that the simplicity of the technologyncan merge objectivity and subjectivity,in a very political way, as I see it,,because it really helps the audience,,the citizen, to see the worldnthrough somebody else's eye,,so it helps the citizennto put him- or herself,in other people's place.,And that idea, I think, nshould be the intention,,should be the goal of any good journalism,nany good activism,,but most of all, any good politics. 
 Thank you very much. It was an honor. 
 (Applause)Our world has many superheroes.,But they have the worst ofnall superpowers: invisibility.,For example, the catadores,,workers who collect recyclable nmaterials for a living.,Catadores emerged from nsocial inequality, unemployment,,and the abundance of solid waste,from the deficiency of the nwaste collection system.,Catadores provide a heavy, nhonest and essential work,that benefits the entire population.nBut they are not acknowledged for it.,Here in Brazil, they collect 90 percentnof all the waste that's actually recycled. 
 Most of the catadores work independently,,picking waste from the streets and nselling to junk yards at very low prices.,They may collect over 300 kilos,in their bags, shopping carts, nbicycles and carroças.,Carroças are cartsnbuilt from wood or metal,and found in several streets in Brazil,,much like graffiti and street art.,And this is how I first met these nmarginalized superheroes. 
 I am a graffiti artist and activist,and my art is social, environmental nand political in nature.,In 2007, I took my work beyond wallsnand onto the carroças,,as a new urban support for my message.,But at this time, ngiving voice to the catadores.,By adding art and humor to the cause,nit became more appealing,,which helped call attention nto the catadores,and improve their self-esteem.,And also, they are famous now non the streets, on mass media and social. 
 So, the thing is,,I plunged into this universe nand have not stopped working since.,I have painted over 200 ncarroças in many cities,and have been invited to do exhibitions nand trips worldwide.,And then I realized that catadores,nin their invisibility,,are not exclusive to Brazil.,I met them in Argentina, Chile,,Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey,and even in developed countries suchnas the United States and Japan.,And this was when I realized that I needednto have more people join the cause,because it's a big challenge.,And then, I created a collaborative nmovement called Pimp My Carroça --,(Laughter) -- which is na large crowdfunded event.,Thank you.,(Applause).,So Pimp My Carroça is a large ncrowdfunded event,to help catadores and their carroças.,Catadores are assisted by well-being nprofessionals and healthcare,,like physicians, dentists, podiatrists, nhair stylists, massage therapists,and much more.,But also, they also receive safety shirts,ngloves, raincoats and eyeglasses,to see in high-definition the city,,while their carroças are renovatednby our incredible volunteers.,And then they receive safety items, too:,reflective tapes, horns and mirrors.,Then, finally, painted by a street artist,and become part of part of this huge, namazing mobile art exhibition. 
 Pimp My Carroça took to the streetsnof São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.,But to meet the demand in other cities,nincluding outside of Brazil,,we have created Pimpx,nwhich is inspired by TEDx,,and it's a simplified, do-it-yourself,ncrowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça.,So now everybody can join. 
 In two years, over 170 catadores,n800 volunteers and 200 street artists,and more than 1,000 donors,have been involved in the nPimp My Carroça movement,,whose actions have even been usednin teaching recycling at a local school. 
 So catadores are leaving ninvisibility behind,and becoming increasinglynrespected and valued.,Because of their pimped carroças,nthey are able to fight back to prejudice,,increase their income and ntheir interaction with society. 
 So now, I'd like to challenge you nto start looking at and acknowledging,the catadores and other ninvisible superheroes from your city.,Try to see the world as one, nwithout boundaries or frontiers.,Believe it or not,,there are over 20 million ncatadores worldwide.,So next time you see one,,recognize them as a vital partnof our society.,Muito obrigado, thank you.,(Applause).Traditional prescriptions for growthnin Africa are not working very well.,After one trillion dollarsnin African development-related aid,in the last 60 years,,real per capita income todaynis lower than it was in the 1970s.,Aid is not doing too well. 
 In response,,the Bretton Woods institutions --nthe IMF and the World Bank --,pushed for free trade not aid,,yet the historical recordnshows little empirical evidence,that free trade leads to economic growth. 
 The newly prescribed nsilver bullet is microcredit.,We seem to be fixatednon this romanticized idea,that every poor peasant in Africanis an entrepreneur.,(Laughter),Yet my work and travelnin 40-plus countries across Africa,have taught me that most peoplenwant jobs instead. 
 My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.,Let's invest in buildingnpan-African titans,like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.,Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa whennhe founded Celtel International in '98,and built it into a mobile ncellular provider,with 24 million subscribersnacross 14 African countries by 2004.,The Mo model might be betternthan the everyman entrepreneur model,,which prevents an effective meansnof diffusion and knowledge-sharing.,Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa,where many actors and small enterprisesnleads to growth through competition. 
 Consider these two alternative scenarios.,One: You loan 200 dollars nto each of 500 banana farmers,allowing them to dry ntheir surplus bananas,and fetch 15 percent more revenuenat the local market.,Or two: You give 100,000 dollarsnto one savvy entrepreneur,and help her set up a factorynthat yields 40 percent additional income,to all 500 banana farmersnand creates 50 additional jobs.,We invested in the second scenario,,and backed 26-year-oldnKenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi,to set up an agro-processingnfactory called Stawi,to produce gluten-freenbanana-based flour and baby food.,Stawi is leveraging economies of scale,and using modern manufacturing processesnto create value for not only its owners,but its workers, who havenan ownership in the business.,Our dream is to take an Eric Muthominand try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,,which requires skill, financing,nlocal and global partnerships,,and extraordinary perseverance. 
 But why pan-African?,The scramble for Africanduring the Berlin Conference of 1884 --,where, quite frankly, we Africansnwere not exactly consulted --,(Laughter) (Applause) --,resulted in massive fragmentation,and many sovereign statesnwith small populations:,Liberia, four million;nCape Verde, 500,000.,Pan-Africa gives you one billion people,,granted across 55 countriesnwith trade barriers and other impediments,,but our ancestors tradednacross the continent,before Europeans drew lines around us.,The pan-African opportunitiesnoutweigh the challenges,,and that's why we're expandingnStawi's markets from just Kenya,to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana,nand anywhere else that will buy our food.,We hope to help solve food security,nempower farmers, create jobs,,develop the local economy,nand we hope to become rich in the process.,While it's not the sexiest approach,,and maybe it doesn'tnachieve the same feel-good,as giving a woman 100 dollars nto buy a goat on kiva.org,,perhaps supporting fewer,nhigher-impact entrepreneurs,to build massive businessesnthat scale pan-Africa,can help change this. 
 The political freedomnfor which our forebearers fought,is meaningless without economic freedom.,We hope to aid this fightnfor economic freedom,by building world-class businesses,,creating indigenous wealth,,providing jobs that wenso desperately need,,and hopefully helping achieve this. 
 Africa shall rise. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course,nthis is strong rhetoric.,You're making 100 percent contrastnbetween microcredit,and regular investmentnand growing regular investment.,Do you think there isna role for microcredit at all? 
 Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.,Microcredit has been a great,ninnovative way,to expand financial accessnto the bottom of the pyramid.,But for the problems we face in Africa,,when we are lookingnat the Marshall Plan,to revitalize war-torn Europe,,it was not full of donations of sheep.,We need more than just microcredit.,We need more than just give 200 dollars.,We need to build big businesses,nand we need jobs. 
 TR: Very good. Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)Fifty-four percent of the world's population,lives in our cities.,In developing countries,,one third of that population,is living in slums.,Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption,occurs in our cities,,and 80 percent of gas emissions,that cause global warming,come from our cities.,So things that you and I might think about,as global problems,,like climate change, the energy crisis,or poverty,,are really, in many ways, city problems.,They will not be solved,unless people who live in cities,,like most of us,,actually start doing a better job,,because right now, we are nnot doing a very good one.,And that becomes very clear,when we look into three aspects of city life:,first, our citizens' willingness to engage,with democratic institutions;,second, our cities' ability to really include,all of their residents;,and lastly, our own ability,to live fulfilling and happy lives. 
 When it comes to engagement,,the data is very clear.,Voter turnout around the world,peaked in the late '80s,,and it has been declining at a pace,that we have never seen before,,and if those numbers are bad at the national level,,at the level of our cities,,they are just dismal.,In the last two years,,two of the world's most consolidated,,oldest democracies, the U.S. and France,,held nationwide municipal elections.,In France, voter turnout hit a record low.,Almost 40 percent of voters decided,not to show up.,In the U.S., the numbers were even scarier.,In some American cities,,voter turnout was close to five percent.,I'll let that sink in for a second.,We're talking about democratic cities,in which 95 percent of people,decided that it was not important,to elect their leaders.,The city of L.A., a city of four million people,,elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes.,That was the lowest turnout the city had seen,in 100 years.,Right here, in my city of Rio,,in spite of mandatory voting,,almost 30 percent of the voting population,chose to either annul their votes,or stay home and pay a fine,in the last mayoral elections. 
 When it comes to inclusiveness,,our cities are not the best cases of success either,,and again, you don't need to look very far,in order to find proof of that.,The city of Rio is incredibly unequal.,This is Leblon.,Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood.,And this is Complexo do Alemão.,This is where over 70,000,of the city's poorest residents live.,Leblon has an HDI, a Human Development Index,,of .967.,That is higher than Norway, Switzerland,or Sweden.,Complexo do Alemão has an HDI of .711.,It sits somewhere in between the HDI,of Algeria and Gabon.,So Rio, like so many cities across the global South,,is a place where you can go from northern Europe,to sub-Saharan Africa,in the space of 30 minutes.,If you drive, that is.,If you take public transit, it's about two hours. 
 And lastly, perhaps most importantly,,cities, with the incredible wealth,of relations that they enable,,could be the ideal places for human happiness,to flourish.,We like being around people.,We are social animals.,Instead, countries where urbanization,has already peaked seem to be the very countries,in which cities have stopped making us happy.,The United States population has suffered,from a general decrease in happiness,for the past three decades,,and the main reason is this.,The American way of building cities,has caused good quality public spaces,to virtually disappear in many,,many American cities,,and as a result, they have seen,a decline of relations,,of the things that make us happy.,Many studies show an increase,in solitude and a decrease in solidarity,,honesty, and social and civic participation. 
 So how do we start building cities,that make us care?,Cities that value their most important asset:,the incredible diversity,of the people who live in them?,Cities that make us happy?,Well, I believe that if we want to change,what our cities look like,,then we really have to change,the decision-making processes,that have given us the results nthat we have right now.,We need a participation revolution,,and we need it fast.,The idea of voting as our nonly exercise in citizenship,does not make sense anymore.,People are tired of only being treated,as empowered individuals every few years,when it's time to delegate that power,to someone else.,If the protests that swept Brazil,in June 2013 have taught us anything,,it's that every time we try,to exercise our power,outside of an electoral context,,we are beaten up, humiliated or arrested.,And this needs to change,,because when it does,,not only will people re-engage,with the structures of representation,,but also complement these structures,with direct, effective, and ncollective decision making,,decision making of the kind,that attacks inequality,by its very inclusive nature,,decision making of the kind,that can change our cities,into better places for us to live. 
 But there is a catch, obviously:,Enabling widespread participation,and redistributing power,can be a logistical nightmare,,and there's where technology can play,an incredibly helpful role,,by making it easier for people to organize,,communicate and make decisions,without having to be in the same room,at the same time. 
 Unfortunately for us,,when it comes to fostering democratic processes,,our city governments have not used technology,to its full potential.,So far, most city governments have been effective,at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors,who serve authorities with data on the city:,potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.,They have also, to a lesser extent,,invited people to participate in improving,the outcome of decisions,that were already made for them,,just like my mom when I was eight,and she told me that I had a choice:,I had to be in bed by 8 p.m.,,but I could choose my pinknpajamas or my blue pajamas.,That's not participation,,and in fact, governments have not been very good,at using technology to enable participation,on what matters —,the way we allocate our budget,,the way we occupy our land,,and the way we manage our natural resources.,Those are the kinds of decisions,that can actually impact global problems,that manifest themselves in our cities. 
 The good news is,,and I do have good news to share with you,,we don't need to wait for governments to do this.,I have reason to believe,that it's possible for citizens to build,their own structures of participation.,Three years ago, I cofounded an organization,called Meu Rio,,and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio,to organize around causes and places,that they care about in their own city,,and have an impact on those causes and places,every day.,In these past three years, Meu Rio grew,to a network of 160,000 citizens of Rio.,About 40 percent of those nmembers are young people,aged 20 to 29.,That is one in every 15 young people,of that age in Rio today. 
 Amongst our members is this adorable little girl,,Bia, to your right,,and Bia was just 11 years old,when she started a campaign using one of our tools,to save her model public school from demolition.,Her school actually ranks among the best,public schools in the country,,and it was going to be demolished,by the Rio de Janeiro state government,to build, I kid you not,,a parking lot for the World Cup,right before the event happened.,Bia started a campaign, and we even watched,her school 24/7 through webcam monitoring,,and many months afterwards,,the government changed their minds.,Bia's school stayed in place. 
 There's also Jovita.,She's an amazing woman whose daughter,went missing about 10 years ago,,and since then, she has been looking,for her daughter.,In that process, she found out,that first, she was not alone.,In the last year alone, 2013,,6,000 people disappeared,in the state of Rio.,But she also found out that in spite of that,,Rio had no centralized intelligence system,for solving missing persons cases.,In other Brazilian cities, those systems,have helped solve up to 80 percent,of missing persons cases.,She started a campaign,,and after the secretary of nsecurity got 16,000 emails,from people asking him to do this,,he responded, and started to build a police unit,specializing in those cases.,It was open to the public at the end of last month,,and Jovita was there,giving interviews and being very fancy. 
 And then, there is Leandro.,Leandro is an amazing guy,in a slum in Rio,,and he created a recycling project in the slum.,At the end of last year, December 16,,he received an eviction order,by the Rio de Janeiro state government,giving him two weeks to leave the space,that he had been using for two years.,The plan was to hand it over to a developer,,who planned to turn it into a construction site.,Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools,,the Pressure Cooker,,the same one that Bia and Jovita used,,and the state government changed their minds,before Christmas Eve. 
 These stories make me happy,,but not just because they have happy endings.,They make me happy because they are,happy beginnings.,The teacher and parent community at Bia's school,is looking for other ways they could improve,that space even further.,Leandro has ambitious plans,to take his model to othernlow-income communities in Rio,,and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit,that she helped created.,Bia, Jovita and Leandro,are living examples of something,that citizens and city ngovernments around the world,need to know:,We are ready.,As citizens, we are ready,to decide on our common destinies,,because we know that the way we distribute power,says a lot about how we actually value everyone,,and because we know,that enabling and participating in local politics,is a sign that we truly care,about our relations to one another,,and we are ready to do this,in cities around the world right now.,With the Our Cities network,,the Meu Rio team,hopes to share what we have learned,with other people who want to create,similar initiatives in their own cities.,We have already started doing it in São Paulo,with incredible results,,and want to take it to cities around the world,through a network of citizen-centric,,citizen-led organizations,that can inspire us,,challenge us, and remind us to demand,real participation in our city lives. 
 It is up to us,to decide whether we want schools,or parking lots,,community-driven recycling projects,or construction sites,,loneliness or solidarity, cars or buses,,and it is our responsibility to do that now,,for ourselves, for our families,,for the people who make our lives worth living,,and for the incredible creativity,,beauty, and wonder that make our cities,,in spite of all of their problems,,the greatest invention of our time. 
 Obrigado. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I dedicated the past two yearsnto understanding,how people achieve their dreams.,When we think about the dreams we have,,and the dent we want to leavenin the universe,,it is striking to see how bignof an overlap there is,between the dreams that we have,nand projects that never happen. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'm here to talk to you today,about five waysnhow not to follow your dreams. 
 One: Believe in overnight success.,You know the story, right?,The tech guy built a mobile appnand sold it very fast for a lot of money.,You know, the story may seem real,nbut I bet it's incomplete.,If you go investigate further,,the guy has done 30 apps before,and he has done a master'snon the topic, a PhD.,He has been workingnon the topic for 20 years. 
 This is really interesting.,I myself have a story in Brazilnthat people think is an overnight success.,I come from a humble family,,and two weeks beforenthe deadline to apply for MIT,,I started the application process.,And, voilà! I got in.,People may thinknit's an overnight success,,but that only workednbecause for the 17 years prior to that,,I took life and education seriously.,Your overnight success storynis always a result,of everything you've donenin your life through that moment. 
 Two: Believe someone elsenhas the answers for you.,Constantly, people wantnto help out, right?,All sorts of people: your family,nyour friends, your business partners,,they all have opinionsnon which path you should take:,"And let me tell you,ngo through this pipe.",But whenever you go inside,,there are other waysnyou have to pick as well.,And you need to makenthose decisions yourself.,No one else has the perfectnanswers for your life.,And you need to keep pickingnthose decisions, right?,The pipes are infinitenand you're going to bump your head,,and it's a part of the process. 
 Three, and it's very subtlenbut very important:,Decide to settlenwhen growth is guaranteed.,So when your life is going great,,you have put together a great team,,and you have growing revenue,nand everything is set --,time to settle.,When I launched my first book,,I worked really, really hardnto distribute it everywhere in Brazil.,With that, over three millionnpeople downloaded it,,over 50,000 people bought physical copies.,When I wrote a sequel,nsome impact was guaranteed.,Even if I did little, sales would be OK.,But OK is never OK.,When you're growing towards a peak,,you need to work harder than evernand find yourself another peak.,Maybe if I did little,,a couple hundred thousandnpeople would read it,,and that's great already.,But if I work harder than ever,,I can bring this number up to millions.,That's why I decided, with my new book,nto go to every single state of Brazil.,And I can already see a higher peak.,There's no time to settle down. 
 Fourth tip, and that's really important:,Believe the fault is someone else's.,I constantly see people saying,,"Yes, I had this great idea,nbut no investor had the vision to invest.","Oh, I created this great product,,but the market is so bad,nthe sales didn't go well.",Or, "I can't find good talent;nmy team is so below expectations.",If you have dreams,,it's your responsibilitynto make them happen.,Yes, it may be hard to find talent.,Yes, the market may be bad.,But if no one invested in your idea,,if no one bought your product,,for sure, there is something therenthat is your fault. 
 (Laughter) 
 Definitely.,You need to get your dreamsnand make them happen.,And no one achieved their goals alone.,But if you didn't make them happen,nit's your fault and no one else's.,Be responsible for your dreams. 
 And one last tip, and this onenis really important as well:,Believe that the only things that matternare the dreams themselves.,Once I saw an ad,nand it was a lot of friends,,they were going up a mountain,nit was a very high mountain,,and it was a lot of work.,You could see that they were sweatingnand this was tough.,And they were going up,nand they finally made it to the peak.,Of course, they decidednto celebrate, right?,I'm going to celebrate, so,n"Yes! We made it, we're at the top!",Two seconds later,none looks at the other and says,,"OK, let's go down." 
 (Laughter) 
 Life is never about the goals themselves.,Life is about the journey.,Yes, you should enjoynthe goals themselves,,but people think that you have dreams,,and whenever you get to reachingnone of those dreams,,it's a magical placenwhere happiness will be all around.,But achieving a dreamnis a momentary sensation,,and your life is not.,The only way to really achievenall of your dreams,is to fully enjoy every stepnof your journey.,That's the best way. 
 And your journey is simple --nit's made of steps.,Some steps will be right on.,Sometimes you will trip.,If it's right on, celebrate, becausensome people wait a lot to celebrate.,And if you tripped,nturn that into something to learn.,If every step becomes somethingnto learn or something to celebrate,,you will for sure enjoy the journey. 
 So, five tips:,Believe in overnight success,,believe someone elsenhas the answers for you,,believe that when growth is guaranteed,nyou should settle down,,believe the fault is someone else's,,and believe that onlynthe goals themselves matter.,Believe me, you do that,nand you will destroy your dreams. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)I live in Washington, D.C.,,but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa,nin India.,My father was a government worker.,My mother could not read or write, but she,would say to me, "A king is nworshipped only in his,own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere.",So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.,But I almost didn't go to college,until an aunt offered financial help. 
 I went to study in Sambalpur,,the largest town in the region,,where, already in college, I saw antelevision for the first time.,I had dreams of going to the United States,for higher studies.,When the opportunity came,,I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money,for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.,In the U.S., I worked in a research center,,part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.,And with the little I earned, I would,finance myself and then I would send,money home to my brother and my father. 
 My story is not unique.,There are millions of people who migrate each year.,With the help of the family, they cross oceans,,they cross deserts, they cross nrivers, they cross mountains.,They risk their lives to realize a dream,,and that dream is as simple as having a,decent job somewhere so they can send money home,and help the family,,which has helped them before. 
 There are 232 million international nmigrants in the world.,These are people who live in a country,other than their country of birth.,If there was a country made up of,only international migrants,,that would be larger, in population,,than Brazil.,That would be larger, in its size,of the economy, than France.,Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,,send money home regularly. 
 Those sums of money are called remittances.,Here is a fact that might surprise you:,413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars,was the amount of remittances sent last year,by migrants to developing countries.,Migrants from developing countries,,money sent to developing countries —,413 billion dollars.,That's a remarkable number because,that is three times the size of,the total of development aid money.,And yet, you and I,,my colleagues in Washington,,we endlessly debate and,discuss about development aid,,while we ignore remittances as small change. 
 True, people send 200 dollars per month,,on average. But, repeated month after month,,by millions of people,,these sums of money add up to rivers nof foreign currency.,So India, last year, received 72 nbillion dollars, larger than,its IT exports.,In Egypt remittances are three times,the size of revenues from the Suez Canal.,In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.,And in poorer countries, smaller ncountries, fragile countries,,conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,,as in Somalia or in Haiti. 
 No wonder these flows have huge,impacts on economies and on poor people.,Remittances, unlike private investment money,,they don't flow back at the first,sign of trouble in the country.,They actually act like an insurance.,When the family is in trouble,,facing hardship, facing hard times,,remittances increase, they act like an insurance.,Migrants send more money then.,Unlike development aid money,,that must go through official agencies,,through governments, remittances,directly reach the poor,,reach the family,,and often with business advice. 
 So in Nepal, the share of poor,people was 42 percent in 1995,,the share of poor people in the population.,By 2005, a decade later, at a,time of political crisis, economic crisis,,the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.,That decline in poverty, most of it,,about half of it, is believed to be,because of remittances from India,,another poor country.,In El Salvador, the school dropout,rate among children is lower,in families that receive remittances.,In Mexico and Sri Lanka,,the birth weight of children is higher,among families that receive remittances. 
 Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.,Migrants send money home for food,,for buying necessities, for building houses,,for funding education, for funding,healthcare for the elderly, for business,investments for friends and family.,Migrants send even more money home,for special occasions like a surgery,or a wedding. And migrants also send,money, perhaps far too many times,,for unexpected funerals that,they cannot attend. 
 Much as these flows do all that good,,there are barriers to these,flows of remittances, these,400 billion dollars of remittances.,Foremost among them is,the exorbitant cost of sending money home.,Money transfer companies structure,their fees to milk the poor.,They will say, "Up to 500 dollars,if you want to send, we will charge you,30 dollars fixed.",If you are poor and if you have nonly 200 dollars to send,,you have to pay that $30 fee.,The global average cost of sending,money is eight percent.,That means you send 100 dollars,,the family on the other side receives only,92 dollars.,To send money to Africa,,the cost is even higher:,12 percent.,To send money within Africa,,the cost is even higher:,over 20 percent.,For example, sending money from Benin nto Nigeria.,And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,,because of exchange controls,,you send 100 dollars and you,are lucky if the family on the other side,receives even 10 dollars.,Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela,through the official channel.,It all goes in suitcases.,Whereever costs are high,,money goes underground. 
 And what is worse,,many developing countries actually,have a blanket ban on sending money,out of the country.,Many rich nations also have a,blanket ban on sending money nto specific countries.,So, is it that there are no options,,no better options, cheaper options, to send money? 
 There are.,M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money,and receive money at a fixed cost of only,60 cents per transaction.,U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico,to enable money service businesses,to send money to Mexico,for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.,And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options,can't be applied internationally,because of the fear of money laundering,,even though there is little data,to support any connection, any significant,connection between money laundering,and these small remittance transactions.,Many international banks now,are wary of hosting bank accounts,of money service businesses, especially,those serving Somalia. 
 Somalia, a country where the,per capita income is only 250 dollars per year.,Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia,is larger than that amount.,Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.,And yet, this is an example of,the right hand giving a lot of aid,,while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood,to that economy, through regulations.,Then there is the case of poor peoplenfrom villages, like me.,In the villages, the only place where you can,get money is through the post office.,Most of the governments in the world,have allowed their post offices to have,exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.,So, if I have to send money to my,father in the village, I must send money,through that particular money transfer company,,even if the cost is high.,I cannot go to a cheaper option.,This has to go. 
 So, what can international organizations and,social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost,of sending money home?,First, relax regulations on small remittancesnunder 1,000 dollars.,Governments should recognize that,small remittances are not money laundering.,Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships,between their post office and the money ntransfer company.,For that matter, between the post office,and any national banking system that,has a large network that serves the poor.,In fact, they should promote competition,,open up the partnership so that,we will bring down costs like we did,,like they did, in the telecommunications industry.,You have seen what has happened there.,Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations,should create a remittance platform,on a nonprofit basis.,They should create a nonprofit,remittance platform to serve the money transfer,companies so that they can send money at a low cost,,while complying with all the complex,regulations all over the world. 
 The development community should,set a goal of reducing remittance costs,to one percent from the current eight percent.,If we reduce costs to one percent,,that would release a saving of n30 billion dollars per year.,Thirty billion dollars, that's nlarger than the entire,bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.,That is larger than, or almost similar to,,the total aid budget of the United States government,,the largest donor on the planet.,Actually, the savings would be larger,than that 30 billion because remittance channels,are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes. 
 Another major impediment to the,flow of remittances reaching the family,is the large and exorbitant,and illegal cost of recruitment,,fees that migrants pay, migrant workers,pay to laborers who found them the job. 
 I was in Dubai a few years ago.,I visited a camp for workers.,It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.,Workers were coming back from,their grueling day of work,,and I struck a conversation,with a Bangladeshi construction worker.,He was preoccupied that he is sending,money home, he has been,sending money home for a few months now,,and the money is mostly going,to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent,who found him that job.,And in my mind, I could picture,the wife waiting for,the monthly remittance.,The remittance arrives.,She takes the money and hands,it over to the recruitment agent,,while the children are looking on.,This has to stop. 
 It is not only construction nworkers from Bangladesh,,it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant,workers who suffer from this problem.,A construction worker from Bangladesh,,on an average, pays about 4,000 ndollars in recruitment fees,for a job that gives him only 2,000 ndollars per year in income.,That means that for the two years or three years,of his life, he is basically sending money,to pay for the recruitment fees.,The family doesn't get to see any of it. 
 It is not only Dubai, it is the dark,underbelly of every major city in the world.,It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,,it is workers from all over the world.,It is not only men.,Women are especially vulnerable to,recruitment malpractices. 
 One of the most exciting and newest,thing happening in the area of remittances,is how to mobilize, through innovation,,diaspora saving and diaspora giving.,Migrants send money home,,but they also save a large amount of,money where they live.,Annually, migrant savings are estimated,to be 500 billion dollars.,Most of that money is parked in,bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.,If a country were to come nand offer a three percent,or four percent interest rate, and then say,that the money would be used for building schools,,roads, airports, train systems,in the country of origin, a lot,of migrants would be interested in,parting with their money because,it's not only financial gains that,give them an opportunity,to stay engaged with their country's development.,Remittance channels can be used,to sell these bonds to migrants,because when they come,on a monthly basis to send remittances,,that's when you can actually sellnit to them.,You can also do the same,for mobilizing diaspora giving.,I would love to invest in a,bullet train system in India,and I would love to contribute to efforts,to fight malaria in my village.,Remittances are a great way of,sharing prosperity between places,in a targeted way that benefits,those who need them most. 
 Remittances empower people.,We must do all we can to make remittances,and recruitment,safer and cheaper.,And it can be done. 
 As for myself, I have been,away from India for two decades now.,My wife is a Venezuelan.,My children are Americans.,Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.,And yet, I am growing nostalgic,about my country of birth.,I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.,My parents are not there anymore.,My brothers and sisters have moved on.,There is no real urgency for me to send money home.,And yet, from time to time,,I send money home to friends,,to relatives, to the village,,to be there, to stay engaged —,that's part of my identity.,And, I'm still striving to be a poet,for the hardworking migrants,and their struggle to break free,of the cycle of poverty.,Thank you.,(Applause)So, I thought a lot aboutnthe first word I'd say today,,and I decided to say "Colombia.",And the reason, I don't knownhow many of you have visited Colombia,,but Colombia is just northnof the border with Brazil.,It's a beautiful country,with extraordinary people,nlike me and others -- (Laughter) --,and it's populatednwith incredible fauna, flora.,It's got water; it's got everythingnto be the perfect place. 
 But we have a few problems.,You may have heard of some of them.,We have the oldestnstanding guerrilla in the world.,It's been around for over 50 years,,which means that in my lifetime,,I have never lived one day nof peace in my country.,This guerrilla -- and the main groupnis the FARC guerrillas,,Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia --,they have financed their warnby kidnapping, by extortion,,by getting into the drug trade,nby illegal mining.,There has been terrorism.nThere have been random bombs.,So it's not good.nIt's not really good.,And if you look at the human costnof this war over 50 years,,we have had more thann5.7 million displaced population.,It's one of the biggest displacednpopulations in the world,,and this conflict has costnover 220,000 lives.,So it's a little bit likenthe Bolívar wars again.,It's a lot of people whonhave died unnecessarily. 
 We are now in the middle of peace talks,,and we've been trying to helpnresolve this problem peacefully,,and as part of that,,we decided to try somethingncompletely lateral and different:,Christmas lights. 
 So Christmas lights, and you're saying,,what the hell is this guyngoing to talk about?,I am going to talk about gigantic trees,that we put in nine strategic npathways in the jungle,covered with Christmas lights.,These trees helped us ndemobilize 331 guerrillas,,roughly five percentnof the guerrilla force at the time.,These trees were lit up at night,,and they had a sign beside them,that said, "If Christmas can comento the jungle, you can come home.,Demobilize.,At Christmas, everything is possible." 
 So how do we know these trees worked?,Well, we got 331, which is okay,,but we also know thatnnot a lot of guerrillas saw them,,but we know that a lot ofnguerrillas heard about them,,and we know this,because we are constantly talkingnto demobilized guerrillas. 
 So let me take you backnfour years before the trees.,Four years before the trees,nwe were approached by the government,to help them come up withna communications strategy,to get as many guerrillasnas we could out of the jungle.,The government had a military strategy,,it had a legal strategy,,it had a political strategy, but it said,,"We don't really havena communications strategy,,and it probably would bena good thing to have,",so we decided tonimmediately jump into this,,because it is an opportunitynto affect the outcome of the conflict,with the things that we do,nwith the tools that we have. 
 But we didn't know very much about it.,We didn't understand in Colombia, nif you live in the cities,,you're very far away from where nthe war is actually happening,,so you don't really understand it,,and we asked the government nto give us access,to as many demobilizednguerrillas as possible.,And we talked to about 60 of them,before we felt we fullynunderstood the problem.,We talked about -- they told us why nthey had joined the guerrillas,,why the left the guerrillas,nwhat their dreams were,,what their frustrations were,,and from those conversationsncame the underlying insight,that has guided this whole campaign,,which is that guerrillas are as muchnprisoners of their organizations,as the people they hold hostage. 
 And at the beginning, we werenso touched by these stories,,we were so amazed by these stories,,that we thought that maybe nthe best way to talk to the guerrillas,was to have them talk to themselves,,so we recorded about a hundredndifferent stories during the first year,,and we put them onnthe radio and television,so that the guerrillas in the junglencould hear stories, their stories,,or stories similar to theirs,,and when they heard them,nthey decided to go out. 
 I want to tell you one of these stories.,This person you see here nis Giovanni Andres.,Giovanni Andres is 25nwhen we took that picture.,He had been seven years in the guerrilla,nand he had demobilized very recently.,His story is the following:,He was recruited when he was 17,,and sometime later,nin his squadron, if you will,,this beautiful girl was recruited,nand they fell in love.,Their conversations were aboutnwhat their family was going to be like,,what their kids' names would be,,how their life would benwhen they left the guerrilla.,But it turns out,that love is very strictly forbiddennin the lower ranks of the guerrilla,,so their romance was discoverednand they were separated.,He was sent very far away,nand she was left behind.,She was very familiar with the territory,,so one night, when she was on guard,,she just left,,and she went to the army, she demobilized,,and she was one of the personsnthat we had the fortune to talk to,,and we were really touched by this story,,so we made a radio spot,,and it turns out, by chance,,that far away, many, nmany kilometers north,,he heard her on the radio,,and when he heard her on the radio,nhe said, "What am I doing here?,She had the balls to get out.nI need to do the same thing.",And he did.,He walked for two days and two nights,,and he risked his life and he got out,,and the only thingnhe wanted was to see her.,The only thing that wasnin his mind was to see her.,The story was, they did meet.,I know you're wondering if they did meet.,They did meet.,She had been recruited when she was 15,nand she left when she was 17,,so there were a lotnof other complications,,but they did eventually meet.,I don't know if they're together now,nbut I can find out. (Laughter),But what I can tell you is thatnour radio strategy was working. 
 The problem is that it was workingnin the lower ranks of the guerrilla.,It was not working with the commanders,,the people that arenmore difficult to replace,,because you can easily recruitnbut you can't get the older commanders.,So we thought, well,nwe'll use the same strategy.,We'll have commandersntalking to commanders.,And we even went as farnas asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla,to fly on helicopters with microphones,telling the people thatnused to fight with them,,"There is a better life out there,","I'm doing good,"n"This is not worth it," etc.,But, as you can all imagine,nit was very easy to counteract,,because what wasnthe guerrilla going to say?,"Yeah, right, if he doesn't do that,nhe's going to get killed.",So it was easy, so we werensuddenly left with nothing,,because the guerrillanwere spreading the word,that all of those things are done,because if they don't do it, nthey're in danger. 
 And somebody, somenbrilliant person in our team,,came back and said,n"You know what I noticed?,I noticed that around Christmastime,,there have been peaks of demobilization,since this war has started.",And that was incredible,,because that led us to think nthat we needed to talk to the human being,and not to the soldier.,We needed to step away from talking,from government to army,nfrom army to army,,and we needed to talknabout the universal values,,and we needed to talk about humanity.,And that was whennthe Christmas tree happened.,This picture that I have here,,you see this is the planningnof the Christmas trees,,and that man you see therenwith the three stars,,he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez.,Captain Valdez was the first nhigh-ranking official,to give us the helicopters nand the support we needed,to put these Christmas trees up,,and he said in that meetingnsomething that I will never forget.,He said, "I want to do thisnbecause being generous makes me stronger,,makes my men feel stronger.",And I get very emotionalnwhen I remember him,because he was killed later in combatnand we really miss him,,but I wanted you all to see him,nbecause he was really, really important.,He gave us all the supportnto put up the first Christmas trees. 
 What happened later is thatnthe guerrillas who came out,during the Christmas tree noperation and all of that,said, "That's really good,nChristmas trees are really cool,,but you know what?nWe really don't walk anymore.,We use rivers." 
 So rivers are the highways of the jungle,,and this is something we learned,,and most of the recruiting was being donenin and around the river villages.,So we went to these river villages,,and we asked the people,,and probably some of them werendirect acquaintances of the guerrillas.,We asked them, "Can you sendnguerrillas a message?",We collected over 6,000 messages.,Some of them were notes saying, get out.,Some of them were toys.nSome of them were candy.,Even people took off their jewelry,ntheir little crosses and religious things,,and put them in these floating ballsnthat we sent down the rivers,so that they could be picked up at night.,And we sent thousandsnof these down the rivers,,and then picked them upnlater if they weren't.,But lots of them were picked up.,This generated, on average,na demobilization every six hours,,so this was incredible and it was about:nCome home at Christmas. 
 Then came the peace process,,and when the peace process started,,the whole mindsetnof the guerrilla changed.,And it changed because,it makes you think, "Well,nif there's a peace process,,this is probably going to be over.,At some point I'm going to get out.",And their fears completely changed,,and their fears were not about,n"Am I going to get killed?",Their fears were, "Am Ingoing to be rejected?,When I get out of this,nam I going to be rejected?",So the past Christmas, nwhat we did was we asked --,we found 27 mothers of guerrillas,,and we asked them to give us npictures of their children,,when they only could recognize themselves,nso as not to put their lives in danger,,and we asked them to giventhe most motherly message you can get,,which is, "Before you were a guerrilla,nyou were my child,,so come home, I'm waiting for you.",You can see the pictures here.nI'll show you a couple.,(Applause),Thank you. 
 And these pictures were placednin many different places,,and a lot of them came back,,and it was really, really beautiful. 
 And then we decided to work with society.,So we did mothers around Christmastime.,Now let's talk aboutnthe rest of the people.,And you may be aware of this or not,nbut there was a World Cup this year,,and Colombia played really well,nand it was a unifying moment for Colombia.,And what we did was tell the guerrillas,,"Come, get out of the jungle.nWe're saving a place for you.",So this was television, this was nall different types of media saying,,"We are saving a place for you.",The soldier here in the commercial says,,"I'm saving a place for younright here in this helicopter,so that you can get out of this junglenand go enjoy the World Cup.",Ex-football players, radio announcers,,everybody was savingna place for the guerrilla. 
 So since we started this workna little over eight years ago,,17,000 guerrillas have demobilized.,I do not -- (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 I don't want to say in any waynthat it only has to do with what we do,,but what I do know is that our worknand the work that we do,may have helped a lot of themnstart thinking about demobilization,,and it may have helped a lot of themntake the final decision.,If that is true, advertising is stillnone of the most powerful tools of change,that we have available.,And I speak not only my behalf,,but on behalf of allnthe colleagues I see here,who work in advertising,,and of all the team that hasnworked with me to do this,,that if you want to change the world,,or if you want to achieve npeace, please call us.,We'd love to help. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have the feeling that we can all agree,that we're moving towards a new,model of the state and society.,But, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is,or what it should be.,It seems like we need to have,a conversation about democracy 
 in our day and age.,Let's think about it this way:,We are 21st-century citizens, doing our,very, very best to interact with 19th century-designedninstitutions,that are based on an information technology of the 15th century.,Let's have a look at some of the,characteristics of this system.,First of all, it's designed for an information technology,that's over 500 years old.,And the best possible system,that could be designed for it,is one where the few make daily decisions,in the name of the many.,And the many get to vote once every ncouple of years.,In the second place, the costs of,participating in this system are,incredibly high.,You either have to have a fair nbit of money,and influence, or you have to devote your entire,life to politics.,You have to become a party member,and slowly start working up the ranks,until maybe, one day, you'll get nto sit at a table,where a decision is being made.,And last but not least,,the language of the system —,it's incredibly cryptic.,It's done for lawyers, by lawyers, 
 and no one else can understand.,So, it's a system where we can,choose our authorities,,but we are completely left out on hownthose authorities,reach their decisions.,So, in a day where a new information technology,allows us to participate globallynin any conversation,,our barriers of information are completely lowered,and we can, more than ever before,,express our desires and our concerns.,Our political system remains the same,for the past 200 years,and expects us to be contented with being nsimply passive recipients 
 of a monologue.,So, it's really not surprising that,this kind of system is only able to produce,two kinds of results:,silence or noise.,Silence, in terms of citizens not engaging,,simply not wanting to participate.,There's this commonplace n[idea] that I truly, truly dislike,,and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally,apathetic. That we shun commitment.,But, can you really blame us,for not jumping at the opportunity of going,to the middle of the city in the middle,of a working day to attend, physically,,a public hearing that has no impact,whatsoever?,Conflict is bound to happen between a system,that no longer represents, nor has any dialogue capacity,,and citizens that are increasingly used,to representing themselves.,And, then we find noise:,Chile, Argentina, Brazil, MexiconItaly, France, Spain, the United States,,they're all democracies.,Their citizens have access to,the ballot boxes. But they still feel the need, 
 they need to take to the streets in order nto be heard.,To me, it seems like the 18th-century,slogan that was the basis for the formation,of our modern democracies, "No taxation,without representation,",can now be updated to "No representationnwithout a conversation.",We want our seat at the table. 
 And rightly so.,But in order to be part of this conversation,,we need to know what we want to do next,,because political action is being able,to move from agitation,to construction.,My generation has been incredibly good at,using new networks and technologies,to organize protests,,protests that were able to successfully,impose agendas,,roll back extremely pernicious legislation,,and even overthrow authoritarian governments.,And we should be immensely,proud of this.,But, we also must admit that we,haven't been good at using those,same networks and technologies,to successfully articulate an alternativento what we're seeing,and find the consensus and build nthe alliances that are needed 
 to make it happen.,And so the risk that we face,is that we can create these huge power vacuums,that will very quickly get filled up by de facto,powers, like the military or highly,motivated and already organized groups 
 that generally lie on the extremes.,But our democracy is neither,just a matter of voting once every,couple of years.,But it's not either the ability to bring millionsnonto the streets.,So the question I'd like to raise here,,and I do believe it's the most important nquestion we need to answer,,is this one:,If Internet is the new printing press,,then what is democracy for the Internet era?,What institutions do we want to build 
 for the 21st-century society?,I don't have the answer, just in case.,I don't think anyone does.,But I truly believe we can't affordnto ignore this question anymore.,So, I'd like to share our experience,and what we've learned so far,and hopefully contribute two cents 
 to this conversation.,Two years ago, with a group of friendsnfrom Argentina,,we started thinking, "how can nwe get our representatives,,our elected representatives,,to represent us?",Marshall McLuhan once said that politics,is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.,So the question that motivated us was,,can we try and solve some of today's problems,with the tools that we use every singlenday of our lives?,Our first approach was to design and develop,a piece of software called DemocracyOS.,DemocracyOS is an open-source web application,that is designed to become a bridge,between citizens and their elected representatives 
 to make it easier for us to participate nfrom our everyday lives.,So first of all, you can get informed so every new,project that gets introduced in Congress,gets immediately translated and explained,in plain language on this platform.,But we all know that social change,is not going to come from just knowing,more information,,but from doing something with it.,So better access to information,should lead to a conversation,about what we're going to do next,,and DemocracyOS allows for that.,Because we believe that democracy is,not just a matter of stacking up,preferences, one on top of each other,,but that our healthy and robust public debate 
 should be, once again, one of its fundamental values.,So DemocracyOS is about persuading nand being persuaded.,It's about reaching a consensus,as much as finding a proper way,of channeling our disagreement.,And finally, you can vote,how you would like your elected nrepresentative to vote.,And if you do not feel comfortable,voting on a certain issue,,you can always delegate your vote,to someone else, allowing 
 for a dynamic and emerging social leadership.,It suddenly became very easy for us,to simply compare these results,with how our representatives were,voting in Congress.,But, it also became very evident that,technology was not going to do the trick.,What we needed to do to was to find,actors that were able to,grab this distributed knowledge,in society and use it to make betternand more fair decisions.,So we reached out to traditional political parties,and we offered them DemocracyOS.,We said, "Look, here you have a platformnthat you can use to build,a two-way conversation with your constituencies.",And yes, we failed.,We failed big time.,We were sent to play noutside like little kids.,Amongst other things, we were called naive.,And I must be honest: I think, in hindsight, we were.,Because the challenges that we face, they're not,technological, they're cultural.,Political parties were never willing,to change the way they make their decisions.,So it suddenly became a bit obvious,that if we wanted to move forwardnwith this idea, 
 we needed to do it ourselves.,And so we took quite a leap of faith,,and in August last year, we founded,our own political party,,El Partido de la Red,,or the Net Party, in the city of nBuenos Aires.,And taking an even bigger leap of faith,,we ran for elections in October last year,with this idea:,if we want a seat in Congress,,our candidate, our representatives,were always going to vote according to,what citizens decided on DemocracyOS.,Every single project that got introduced,in Congress, we were going vote,according to what citizens decidednon an online platform.,It was our way of hacking the political system.,We understood that if we wanted,to become part of the conversation,,to have a seat at the table,,we needed to become valid stakeholders, 
 and the only way of doing it is to play by the nsystem rules.,But we were hacking it in the sense that,we were radically changing the way a political party,makes its decisions.,For the first time, we were making our decisions,together with those who we were 
 affecting directly by those decisions.,It was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party,in the city of Buenos Aires.,But it got attention.,We got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes,,and we came in second for the local options.,So, even if that wasn't enough to win a,seat in Congress, it was enough,for us to become part of the conversation,,to the extent that next month,,Congress, as an institution, is launching,for the first time in Argentina's history,,a DemocracyOS to discuss,,with the citizens, three pieces of legislation:,two on urban transportation and 
 one on the use of public space.,Of course, our elected representatives are not,saying, "Yes, we're going to vote,according to what citizens decide,",but they're willing to try.,They're willing to open up a new space,for citizen engagement and hopefully 
 they'll be willing to listen as well.,Our political system can be transformed,,and not by subverting it, by destroying it,,but by rewiring it with the tools that 
 Internet affords us now.,But a real challenge is to find, to design,to create, to empower those connectors,that are able to innovate, to transform,noise and silence into signal,and finally bring our democracies 
 to the 21st century.,I'm not saying it's easy.,But in our experience, we actually stand a chance,of making it work.,And in my heart, it's most definitely,worth trying.,Thank you.,(Applause)Last year, I went on my first book tour.,In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries,and gave some hundred talks.,Every talk in every country,began with an introduction,,and every introduction began,nalas, with a lie:,"Taiye Selasi comesnfrom Ghana and Nigeria,",or "Taiye Selasi comesnfrom England and the States.",Whenever I heard this opening sentence,,no matter the country that concluded it --,England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --,I thought, "But that's not true.",Yes, I was born in Englandnand grew up in the United States.,My mum, born in England,nand raised in Nigeria,,currently lives in Ghana.,My father was born in Gold Coast,na British colony,,raised in Ghana,,and has lived for over 30 yearsnin the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.,For this reason, my introducersnalso called me "multinational.","But Nike is multinational," I thought,,"I'm a human being." 
 Then, one fine day, mid-tour,,I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark,where I shared the stagenwith the writer Colum McCann.,We were discussing the rolenof locality in writing,,when suddenly it hit me.,I'm not multinational.,I'm not a national at all.,How could I come from a nation?,How can a human being come from a concept?,It's a question that had been bothering menfor going on two decades.,From newspapers, textbooks, conversations,,I had learned to speak of countries,as if they were eternal, singular,nnaturally occurring things,,but I wondered:,to say that I came from a country,suggested that the countrynwas an absolute,,some fixed point in place in time,,a constant thing, but was it?,In my lifetime, countriesnhad disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;,appeared -- Timor-Leste;nfailed -- Somalia.,My parents came from countriesnthat didn't exist when they were born.,To me, a country -- this thing that couldnbe born, die, expand, contract --,hardly seemed the basisnfor understanding a human being. 
 And so it came as a huge reliefnto discover the sovereign state.,What we call countries are actually,various expressionsnof sovereign statehood,,an idea that came into fashionnonly 400 years ago.,When I learned this, beginning mynmasters degree in international relations,,I felt a sort of surge of relief.,It was as I had suspected.,History was real, cultures were real,,but countries were invented.,For the next 10 years, I soughtnto re- or un-define myself,,my world, my work, my experience,,beyond the logic of the state. 
 In 2005, I wrote an essay,n"What is an Afropolitan,",sketching out an identitynthat privileged culture over country.,It was thrilling how many peoplencould relate to my experience,,and instructional how many othersndidn't buy my sense of self.,"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,"none such critic asked,,"when she's never known the indignities,of traveling abroadnon a Ghanian passport?" 
 Now, if I'm honest,,I knew just what she meant.,I've got a friend named Laylanwho was born and raised in Ghana.,Her parents are third-generationnGhanians of Lebanese descent.,Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,nknows Accra like the back of her hand,,but when we first met years ago,nI thought, "She's not from Ghana.",In my mind, she came from Lebanon,,despite the patent factnthat all her formative experience,took place in suburban Accra.,I, like my critics,,was imagining some Ghananwhere all Ghanaians had brown skin,or none held U.K. passports.,I'd fallen into the limiting trap,that the language of comingnfrom countries sets --,the privileging of a fiction,nthe singular country,,over reality: human experience.,Speaking with Colum McCann that day,nthe penny finally dropped.,"All experience is local," he said.,"All identity is experience," I thought.,"I'm not a national,"nI proclaimed onstage.,"I'm a local. I'm multi-local." 
 See, "Taiye Selasi comesnfrom the United States," isn't the truth.,I have no relationshipnwith the United States,,all 50 of them, not really.,My relationship is with Brookline,nthe town where I grew up;,with New York City, where I started work;,with Lawrenceville,nwhere I spend Thanksgiving.,What makes America home for menis not my passport or accent,,but these very particular experiences,and the places they occur.,Despite my pride in Ewe culture,,the Black Stars,nand my love of Ghanaian food,,I've never had a relationshipnwith the Republic of Ghana, writ large.,My relationship is with Accra,nwhere my mother lives,,where I go each year,,with the little garden in Dzorwulunwhere my father and I talk for hours.,These are the placesnthat shape my experience.,My experience is where I'm from. 
 What if we asked, insteadnof "Where are you from?" --,"Where are you a local?",This would tell us so much morenabout who and how similar we are.,Tell me you're from France,nand I see what, a set of clichés?,Adichie's dangerous single story,nthe myth of the nation of France?,Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,,better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I seena set of experiences.,Our experience is where we're from. 
 So, where are you a local?,I propose a three-step test.,I call these the three "R’s":nrituals, relationships, restrictions. 
 First, think of your daily rituals,nwhatever they may be:,making your coffee, driving to work,,harvesting your crops,nsaying your prayers.,What kind of rituals are these?,Where do they occur?,In what city or cities in the worldndo shopkeepers know your face?,As a child, I carried out fairly standardnsuburban rituals in Boston,,with adjustments made for the ritualsnmy mother brought from London and Lagos.,We took off our shoes in the house,,we were unfailinglynpolite with our elders,,we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.,In snowy North America,nours were rituals of the global South.,The first time I went to Delhinor to southern parts of Italy,,I was shocked by how at home I felt.,The rituals were familiar.,"R" number one, rituals. 
 Now, think of your relationships,nof the people who shape your days.,To whom do you speak at least once a week,,be it face to face or on FaceTime?,Be reasonable in your assessment;,I'm not talking aboutnyour Facebook friends.,I'm speaking of the people who shapenyour weekly emotional experience.,My mother in Accra,nmy twin sister in Boston,,my best friends in New York:,these relationships are home for me.,"R" number two, relationships. 
 We're local where we carry outnour rituals and relationships,,but how we experience our locality,depends in part on our restrictions.,By restrictions, I mean,nwhere are you able to live?,What passport do you hold?,Are you restricted by, say, racism,nfrom feeling fully at home where you live?,By civil war, dysfunctional governance,neconomic inflation,,from living in the localitynwhere you had your rituals as a child?,This is the least sexy of the R’s,,less lyric than rituals and relationships,,but the question takes us pastn"Where are you now?",to "Why aren't you there, and why?",Rituals, relationships, restrictions. 
 Take a piece of paper,and put those three wordsnon top of three columns,,then try to fill those columnsnas honestly as you can.,A very different picturenof your life in local context,,of your identity as a set of experiences,,may emerge. 
 So let's try it.,I have a friend named Olu.,He's 35 years old.,His parents, born in Nigeria,ncame to Germany on scholarships.,Olu was born in Nurembergnand lived there until age 10.,When his family moved to Lagos,nhe studied in London,,then came to Berlin.,He loves going to Nigeria --,the weather, the food, the friends --,but hates the political corruption there.,Where is Olu from? 
 I have another friend named Udo.,He's also 35 years old.,Udo was born in Córdoba,nin northwest Argentina,,where his grandparents migratednfrom Germany, what is now Poland,,after the war.,Udo studied in Buenos Aires,nand nine years ago came to Berlin.,He loves going to Argentina -- nthe weather, the food, the friends --,but hates the economic corruption there.,Where is Udo from?,With his blonde hair and blue eyes,nUdo could pass for German,,but holds an Argentinian passport,nso needs a visa to live in Berlin.,That Udo is from Argentinanhas largely to do with history.,That he's a localnof Buenos Aires and Berlin,,that has to do with life. 
 Olu, who looks Nigerian,nneeds a visa to visit Nigeria.,He speaks Yoruba with an English accent,,and English with a German one.,To claim that he'sn"not really Nigerian," though,,denies his experience in Lagos,,the rituals he practiced growing up,,his relationship with family and friends. 
 Meanwhile, though Lagosnis undoubtedly one of his homes,,Olu always feels restricted there,,not least by the fact that he's gay. 
 Both he and Udo are restrictednby the political conditions,of their parents' countries,,from living where some of theirnmost meaningful rituals,and relationships occur.,To say Olu is from Nigerianand Udo is from Argentina,distracts from their common experience.,Their rituals, their relationships,nand their restrictions are the same. 
 Of course, when we ask,n"Where are you from?",we're using a kind of shorthand.,It's quicker to say "Nigeria"nthan "Lagos and Berlin,",and as with Google Maps,nwe can always zoom in closer,,from country to city to neighborhood.,But that's not quite the point.,The difference betweenn"Where are you from?",and "Where are you a local?",isn't the specificity of the answer;,it's the intention of the question.,Replacing the language of nationalitynwith the language of locality asks us,to shift our focusnto where real life occurs.,Even that most glorious expressionnof countryhood, the World Cup,,gives us national teams comprisednmostly of multilocal players.,As a unit of measurementnfor human experience,,the country doesn't quite work.,That's why Olu says, "I'm German,nbut my parents come from Nigeria.",The "but" in that sentencenbelies the inflexibility of the units,,one fixed and fictional entitynbumping up against another.,"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,"nsuggests overlapping experiences,,layers that merge together,nthat can't be denied or removed.,You can take away my passport,,but you can't take away my experience.,That I carry within me.,Where I'm from comes wherever I go. 
 To be clear, I'm not suggestingnthat we do away with countries.,There's much to be saidnfor national history,,more for the sovereign state.,Culture exists in community,nand community exists in context.,Geography, tradition, collective memory:nthese things are important.,What I'm questioning is primacy.,All of those introductions on tournbegan with reference to nation,,as if knowing what country I camenfrom would tell my audience who I was.,What are we really seeking, though,nwhen we ask where someone comes from?,And what are we really seeingnwhen we hear an answer? 
 Here's one possibility:,basically, countries represent power.,"Where are you from?"nMexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.,America. Germany. Japan. More power.,China. Russia. Ambiguous. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's possible that without realizing it,nwe're playing a power game,,especially in the contextnof multi-ethnic countries.,As any recent immigrant knows,,the question "Where are you from?"nor "Where are you really from?",is often code for "Why are you here?" 
 Then we have the scholarnWilliam Deresiewicz's writing,of elite American colleges.,"Students think thatntheir environment is diverse,if one comes from Missourinand another from Pakistan --,never mind that all of their parentsnare doctors or bankers." 
 I'm with him.,To call one student American,nanother Pakistani,,then triumphantly claimnstudent body diversity,ignores the fact that these studentsnare locals of the same milieu.,The same holds true on the other endnof the economic spectrum.,A Mexican gardener in Los Angelesnand a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi,have more in commonnin terms of rituals and restrictions,than nationality implies. 
 Perhaps my biggest problemnwith coming from countries,is the myth of going back to them.,I'm often asked if I plannto "go back" to Ghana.,I go to Accra every year,nbut I can't "go back" to Ghana.,It's not because I wasn't born there.,My father can't go back, either.,The country in which he was born,,that country no longer exists.,We can never go back to a placenand find it exactly where we left it.,Something, somewherenwill always have changed,,most of all, ourselves.,People. 
 Finally, what we're talkingnabout is human experience,,this notoriously and gloriouslyndisorderly affair.,In creative writing,nlocality bespeaks humanity.,The more we knownabout where a story is set,,the more local color and texture,,the more humannthe characters start to feel,,the more relatable, not less.,The myth of national identitynand the vocabulary of coming from,confuses us into placing ourselvesninto mutually exclusive categories.,In fact, all of us are multi --nmulti-local, multi-layered.,To begin our conversationsnwith an acknowledgement of this complexity,brings us closer together, I think,nnot further apart.,So the next time that I'm introduced,,I'd love to hear the truth:,"Taiye Selasi is a human being,nlike everybody here.,She isn't a citizen of the world,nbut a citizen of worlds.,She is a local of New York,nRome and Accra." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Twenty-five years ago, scientists at CERNncreated the World Wide Web.,Since then, the Internet has transformed nthe way we communicate,,the way we do business,nand even the way we live.,In many ways,,the ideas that gave birth to Google,nFacebook, Twitter, and so many others,,have now really transformed our lives,,and this has brought us many real benefitsnsuch as a more connected society.,However, there are alsonsome downsides to this.,Today, the average personnhas an astounding amount,of personal information online,,and we add to this online informationnevery single time we post on Facebook,,each time we search on Google,,and each time we send an email. 
 Now, many of us probably think,,well, one email,nthere's nothing in there, right?,But if you considerna year's worth of emails,,or maybe even a lifetime of email,,collectively, this tells a lot.,It tells where we have been,nwho we have met,,and in many ways,neven what we're thinking about.,And the more scary part about this isnour data now lasts forever,,so your data can and will outlive you.,What has happened is that we've largelynlost control over our data,and also our privacy. 
 So this year, as the web turns 25,,it's very important for usnto take a moment,and think about the implications of this.,We have to really think.,We've lost privacy, yes,,but actually what we've also lostnis the idea of privacy itself.,If you think about it,,most of us here today probably remember nwhat life was like before the Internet,,but today, there's a new generation,that is being taught from a very young agento share everything online,,and this is a generation that is not ngoing to remember when data was private.,So we keep going down this road,n20 years from now,,the word 'privacy' is going to havena completely different meaning,from what it means to you and I. 
 So, it's time for us nto take a moment and think,,is there anything we can do about this?,And I believe there is. 
 Let's take a look at one of the mostnwidely used forms of communication,in the world today: email.,Before the invention of email,nwe largely communicated using letters,,and the process was quite simple.,You would first start by writingnyour message on a piece of paper,,then you would place itninto a sealed envelope,,and from there,nyou would go ahead and send it,after you put a stamp and address on it.,Unfortunately, today,,when we actually send an email,nwe're not sending a letter.,What you are sending, in many ways,nis actually a postcard,,and it's a postcard in the sensenthat everybody that sees it,from the time it leaves your computernto when it gets to the recipient,can actually read the entire contents. 
 So, the solution to thisnhas been known for some time,,and there's many attempts to do it.,The most basic solutionnis to use encryption,,and the idea is quite simple.,First, you encrypt the connection,between your computernand the email server.,Then, you also encrypt the datanas it sits on the server itself.,But there's a problem with this,,and that is, the email serversnalso hold the encryption keys,,so now you have a really big locknwith a key placed right next to it.,But not only that, any governmentncould lawfully ask for,and get the key to your data,,and this is all without younbeing aware of it. 
 So the way we fix this problemnis actually relatively easy, in principle:,You give everybody their own keys,,and then you make sure the serverndoesn't actually have the keys.,This seems like common sense, right?,So the question that comes up is,nwhy hasn't this been done yet? 
 Well, if we really think about it,,we see that the business modelnof the Internet today,really isn't compatible with privacy.,Just take a look at somenof the biggest names on the web,,and you see that advertisingnplays a huge role.,In fact, this year alone,nadvertising is 137 billion dollars,,and to optimize the adsnthat are shown to us,,companies have to knowneverything about us.,They need to know where we live,,how old we are, what we like,nwhat we don't like,,and anything elsenthey can get their hands on.,And if you think about it,,the best way to get this informationnis really just to invade our privacy.,So these companiesnaren't going to give us our privacy.,If we want to have privacy online,,what we have to do isnwe've got to go out and get it ourselves. 
 For many years, when it came to email,,the only solutionnwas something known as PGP,,which was quite complicatednand only accessible to the tech-savvy.,Here's a diagram that basically shows,the process for encryptingnand decrypting messages.,So needless to say,nthis is not a solution for everybody,,and this actually is part of the problem,,because if you think about communication,,by definition, it involvesnhaving someone to communicate with.,So while PGP does a great jobnof what it's designed to do,,for the people out therenwho can't understand how to use it,,the option to communicate privatelynsimply does not exist.,And this is a problemnthat we need to solve.,So if we want to have privacy online,,the only way we can succeednis if we get the whole world on board,,and this is only possiblenif we bring down the barrier to entry.,I think this is actually the key challengenthat lies in the tech community.,What we really have to donis work and make privacy more accessible. 
 So last summer, whennthe Edward Snowden story came out,,several colleagues and I decided to seenif we could make this happen.,At that time, we were working at thenEuropean Organization for Nuclear Research,at the world's largest particle collider,nwhich collides protons, by the way.,We were all scientists,nso we used our scientific creativity,and came up with a veryncreative name for our project:,ProtonMail.n(Laughter),Many startups these daysnactually begin in people's garages,or people's basements.,We were a bit different.,We started out at the CERN cafeteria,,which actually is great, because look,,you have all the foodnand water you could ever want.,But even better than thisnis that every day,between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.,nfree of charge,,the CERN cafeteria comes withnseveral thousand scientists and engineers,,and these guys basically knownthe answers to everything.,So it was in this environmentnthat we began working.,What we actually want to donis we want to take your email,and turn it into somethingnthat looks more like this,,but more importantly,nwe want to do it in a way,that you can't even tellnthat it's happened.,So to do this, we actually needna combination of technology,and also design. 
 So how do we go aboutndoing something like this?,Well, it's probably a good ideannot to put the keys on the server.,So what we do is we generatenencryption keys on your computer,,and we don't generate a single key,nbut actually a pair of keys,,so there's an RSA private keynand an RSA public key,,and these keysnare mathematically connected. 
 So let's have a looknand see how this works,when multiple people communicate.,So here we have Bob and Alice,nwho want to communicate privately.,So the key challengenis to take Bob's message,and to get it to Alice in such a waynthat the server cannot read that message.,So what we have to donis we have to encrypt it,before it even leaves Bob's computer,,and one of the tricks is, we encrypt itnusing the public key from Alice.,Now this encrypted data is sentnthrough the server to Alice,,and because the message was encryptednusing Alice's public key,,the only key that can now decrypt itnis a private key that belongs to Alice,,and it turns out Alice is the only personnthat actually has this key.,So we've now accomplished the objective,,which is to get the messagenfrom Bob to Alice,without the server being ablento read what's going on. 
 Actually, what I've shown herenis a highly simplified picture.,The reality is much more complex,and it requires a lot of softwarenthat looks a bit like this.,And that's actuallynthe key design challenge:,How do we take all this complexity,nall this software,,and implement it in a waynthat the user cannot see it.,I think with ProtonMail,nwe have gotten pretty close to doing this. 
 So let's see how it works in practice.,Here, we've got Bob and Alice again,,who also want to communicate securely.,They simply create accounts on ProtonMail,,which is quite simplenand takes a few moments,,and all the key encryption and generation,is happening automaticallynin the background,as Bob is creating his account.,Once his account is created,nhe just clicks "compose,",and now he can write his emailnlike he does today.,So he fills in his information,,and then after that, nall he has to do is click "send,",and just like that,nwithout understanding cryptography,,and without doing anything differentnfrom how he writes email today,,Bob has just sent an encrypted message. 
 What we have herenis really just the first step,,but it shows thatnwith improving technology,,privacy doesn't have to be difficult,nit doesn't have to be disruptive.,If we change the goal from maximizing nad revenue to protecting data,,we can actually make it accessible.,Now, I know a questionnon everybody's minds is,,okay, protecting privacy,nthis is a great goal,,but can you actually do this,without the tons of moneynthat advertisements give you?,And I think the answer is actually yes,,because today, we've reached a point,where people around the world reallynunderstand how important privacy is,,and when you have that,nanything is possible.,Earlier this year,,ProtonMail actually had so many users nthat we ran out of resources,,and when this happened,nour community of users got together,and donated half a million dollars.,So this is just an examplenof what can happen,when you bring the community togetherntowards a common goal.,We can also leverage the world.,Right now,,we have a quarter of a million peoplenthat have signed up for ProtonMail,,and these people come from everywhere,,and this really shows that privacy,is not just an Americannor a European issue,,it's a global issuenthat impacts all of us.,It's something that we reallynhave to pay attention to going forward. 
 So what do we have to donto solve this problem?,Well, first of all,,we need to support a differentnbusiness model for the Internet,,one that does not relynentirely on advertisements,for revenue and for growth.,We actually need to build a new Internet,where our privacy and our ability nto control our data is first and foremost.,But even more importantly,,we have to build an Internet nwhere privacy is no longer just an option,but is also the default. 
 We have done the first stepnwith ProtonMail,,but this is really just the first stepnin a very, very long journey.,The good news I can sharenwith you guys today,,the exciting news,nis that we're not traveling alone.,The movement to protect people's privacynand freedom online,is really gaining momentum,,and today, there are dozens of projectsnfrom all around the world,who are working togethernto improve our privacy.,These projects protect thingsnfrom our chat to voice communications,,also our file storage, our online search,,our online browsing,nand many other things.,And these projects are not backednby billions of dollars in advertising,,but they've found supportnreally from the people,,from private individuals like you and Infrom all over the world. 
 This really matters, because ultimately,,privacy depends on eachnand every one of us,,and we have to protect it nownbecause our online data,is more than just a collectionnof ones and zeros.,It's actually a lot more than that.,It's our lives, our personal stories,,our friends, our families,,and in many ways,nalso our hopes and our aspirations.,We need to spend time nownto really protect our right,to share this only with peoplenthat we want to share this with,,because without this,nwe simply can't have a free society.,So now's the time for usnto collectively stand up and say,,yes, we do want to livenin a world with online privacy,,and yes, we can work togethernto turn this vision into a reality. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Dre Urhahn: This theater nis built on Copacabana,,which is the most famous nbeach in the world,,but 25 kilometers away from here,in the North Zone of Rio,lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro,,and roughly 60,000 people live there.,Now, the people here in Rio mostly know,Vila Cruzeiro from the news,,and unfortunately, news nfrom Vila Cruzeiro often,is not good news.,But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place,where our story begins. 
 Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years nago, we first came to Rio,to shoot a documentary nabout life in the favelas.,Now, we learned that favelas nare informal communities.,They emerged over the years,when immigrants from the countryside,came to the cities looking for work,,like cities within the cities,,known for problems like crime, poverty,,and the violent drug war between,police and the drug gangs.,So what struck us was that,these were communities that the people,who lived there had built nwith their own hands,,without a master plan,and like a giant work in progress.,Where we're from, in Holland,,everything is planned.,We even have rules for nhow to follow the rules.,(Laughter) 
 DU: So the last day of nfilming, we ended up,in Vila Cruzeiro, and nwe were sitting down,and we had a drink,,and we were overlooking this hill,with all these houses,,and most of these houses looked unfinished,,and they had walls of bare brick,,but we saw some of these houses,which were plastered and painted,,and suddenly we had this idea:,what would it look like if all these houses,would be plastered and painted?,And then we imagined one big design,,one big work of art.,Who would expect something like that,in a place like this?,So we thought, would that even be possible?,So first we started to count the houses,,but we soon lost count.,But somehow the idea stuck. 
 JK: We had a friend.,He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.,His name was Nanko,,and he also liked the idea.,He said, "You know, everybody here,would pretty much love nto have their houses,plastered and painted.,It's when a house is finished.",So he introduced us to the right people,,and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.,We picked three houses innthe center of the community,and we start here. We made a few designs,,and everybody liked this design,of a boy flying a kite the best.,So we started painting, nand the first thing we did,was to paint everything blue,,and we thought that looked nalready pretty good.,But they hated it. The peoplenwho lived there really hated it.,They said, "What did you do?,You painted our house in nexactly the same color,as the police station.",(Laughter),In a favela, that is not a good thing.,Also the same color as the prison cell.,So we quickly went ahead nand we painted the boy,,and then we thought we were finished,,we were really happy, but still,,it wasn't good because the littlenkids started coming up to us,,and they said, "You know, nthere's a boy flying the kite,,but where is his kite?",We said, "Uh, it's art.,You know, you have to imagine the kite.",(Laughter),And they said, "No, no, no, nwe want to see the kite.",So we quickly installed a kite,way up high on the hill,,so that you could see nthe boy flying the kite,and you could actually see a kite.,So the local news started writing about it,,which was great,,and then even The Guardian wrote about it:,"Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery." 
 JK: So, encouraged by this success,,we went back to Rio for a second project,,and we stumbled upon this street.,It was covered in concrete nto prevent mudslides,,and somehow we saw a sort of river in it,,and we imagined this rivernto be a river in Japanese style,with koi carp swimming upstream.,So we decided to paint that river,,and we invited Rob Admiraal,,who is a tattoo artist,,and he specialized in the Japanese style.,So little did we know that we would spend,almost an entire year painting that river,,together with Geovaninand Robinho and Vitor,,who lived nearby.,And we even moved into the neighborhood,when one of the guys that nlived on the street, Elias,,told us that we could come nand live in his house,,together with his family,,which was fantastic.,Unfortunately, during that time,,another war broke out between the police,and the drug gangs.,(Video) (Gunfire),We learned that during those times,,people in communities nreally stick together,during these times of hardship,,but we also learned a nvery important element,,the importance of barbecues. n(Laughter),Because, when you throw a barbecue,,it turns you from a guest into a host,,so we decided to throw one,almost every other week,,and we got to know everybody nin the neighborhood. 
 JK: We still had this nidea of the hill, though. 
 DU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about,the scale of this, because this painting,was incredibly big,,and it was insanely detailed,,and this process almost drovenus completely insane ourselves.,But we figured that maybe, nduring this process,,all the time that we had nspent in the neighborhood,was maybe actually even more important,than the painting itself. 
 JK: So after all that time,,this hill, this idea was still there,,and we started to make sketches,,models, and we figured something out.,We figured that our ideas, our designs,had to be a little bit more simple than that last project,so that we could paint with more people,and cover more houses at the same time.,And we had an opportunity to try that out,in a community in the central part of Rio,,which is called Santa Marta,,and we made a design for this place,which looked like this,,and then we got people to go along with it,because turns out that if nyour idea is ridiculously big,,it's easier to get people to ngo along with this. (Laughter),And the people of Santa Marta,got together and in a little over a month,they turned that square into this.,(Applause),And this image somehow nwent all over the world. 
 DU: So then we received nan unexpected phone call,from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program,,and they had this question,if this idea, our approach,,if this would actually nwork in North Philly,,which is one of the poorest neighborhoods,in the United States.,So we immediately said yes.,We had no idea how,,but it seemed like a very ninteresting challenge,,so we did exactly the nsame as we did in Rio,,and we moved into the neighborhood,and started barbecuing.,(Laughter),So the project took almost two years to complete,,and we made individual designs,for every single house on nthe avenue that we painted,,and we made these designs together,with the local store owners, nthe building owners,,and a team of about a dozen nyoung men and women.,They were hired, and thennthey were trained as painters,,and together they transformedntheir own neighborhood,,the whole street, into a ngiant patchwork of color.,(Applause),And at the end, the city of Philadelphia,thanked every single one of them,and gave them a merit forntheir accomplishment. 
 JK: So now we had painted a whole street.,How about we do this whole hill now?,We started looking for funding,,but instead, we just ran into questions,,like, how many houses nare you going to paint?,How many square meters is that?,How much paint are you going to use,,and how many people are you going to employ?,And we did try for years to write plans,for the funding and answer nall those questions,,but then we thought,,in order to answer all those questions,,you have to know exactly nwhat you're going to do,before you actually get there and start.,And maybe it's a mistake nto think like that.,It would lose some of the nmagic that we had learned,about that if you go somewhere,and you spend time there,,you can let the project grow organically,and have a life of its own. 
 DU: So what we did is,we decided to take this nplan and strip it away,from all the numbers,and all the ideas and presumptions,and just go back to the base idea,,which was to transform this hill,into a giant work of art.,And instead of looking for funding,,we started a crowdfunding campaign,,and in a little over a month,,more than 1,500 people put together,and donated over 100,000 dollars.,So for us, this was an amazing nmoment, because now —,(Applause) —,because now we finally had the freedom,to use all the lessons that we had learned,and create a project that was built,the same way that the favela was built,,from the ground on up, bottom up,,with no master plan. 
 JK: So we went back, nand we employed Angelo,,and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,,very talented guy, and henknows almost everybody there,,and then we employed Elias, our former landlord,who invited us into his house,,and he's a master of construction.,Together with them, we decided where to start.,We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,,and houses are being plastered as we speak.,And the good thing about them is that,they are deciding which houses go next.,They're even printing t-shirts,,they're putting up banners,explaining everything to everybody,,and talking to the press.,This article about Angelo appeared. 
 DU: So while this is happening,,we are bringing this nidea all over the world.,So, like the project we ndid in Philadelphia,,we are also invited to do workshops,,for instance in Curaçao,,and right now we're planning na huge project in Haiti. 
 JK: So the favela was not only the place,where this idea started:,it was also the place that made it possible,to work without a master plan,,because these communities are informal —,this was the inspiration —,and in a communal effort, ntogether with the people,,you can almost work like in an orchestra,,where you can have a hundred instruments,playing together to create a symphony. 
 DU: So we want to thank everybody who,wanted to become part of this dream,and supported us along the way,,and we are looking at continuing. 
 JK: Yeah. And so one day pretty soon,,when the colors start ngoing up on these walls,,we hope more people will join us,,and join this big dream,,and maybe one day, the nwhole of Vila Cruzeiro,will be painted. 
 DU: Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I started working,with refugees because I wanted,to make a difference,,and making a difference starts,with telling their stories.,So when I meet refugees,,I always ask them questions.,Who bombed your house?,Who killed your son?,Did the rest of your family make it out alive?,How are you coping,in your life in exile?,But there's one question that always seems to me,to be most revealing, and that is:,What did you take?,What was that most important thing,that you had to take with you,when the bombs were exploding in your town,,and the armed gangs were approaching your house? 
 A Syrian refugee boy I know,told me that he didn't hesitate,when his life was in imminent danger.,He took his high school diploma,,and later he told me why.,He said, "I took my high school diploma,because my life depended on it.",And he would risk his life to get that diploma.,On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.,His classroom sometimes shook,with the sound of bombs and shelling,,and his mother told me,,"Every day, I would say to him every morning,,'Honey, please don't go to school.'",And when he insisted, she said,,"I would hug him as if it were for the last time.",But he said to his mother,,"We're all afraid,,but our determination to graduate,is stronger than our fear." 
 But one day, the family got terrible news.,Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin,were murdered in their homes for refusing,to leave their house.,Their throats were slit.,It was time to flee. 
 They left that day, right away, in their car,,Hany hidden in the back because they were facing,checkpoints of menacing soldiers.,And they would cross the border into Lebanon,,where they would find peace.,But they would begin a life of grueling hardship,and monotony.,They had no choice but to build a shack,on the side of a muddy field,,and this is Hany's brother Ashraf,,who plays outside. 
 And that day, they joined,the biggest population of refugees in the world,,in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.,It only has four million citizens,,and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.,There's not a town, a city or a village,that is not host to Syrian refugees.,This is generosity and humanity,that is remarkable.,Think about it this way, proportionately.,It would be as if,the entire population of Germany,,80 million people,,would flee to the United States in just three years.,Half of the entire population of Syria,is now uprooted,,most of them inside the country.,Six and a half million people,have fled for their lives.,Over and well over three million people,have crossed the borders,and have found sanctuarynin the neighboring countries,,and only a small proportion, as you see,,have moved on to Europe.,What I find most worrying,is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.,I took this picture of this little girl.,It was just two hours after she had arrived,after a long trek from Syria into Jordan. 
 And most troubling of all,is that only 20 percent of nSyrian refugee children,are in school in Lebanon.,And yet, Syrian refugee children,,all refugee children tell us,education is the most important thing in their lives.,Why? Because it allows them to think of their future,rather than the nightmare of their past.,It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred. 
 I'm reminded of a recent visit I took,to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,,and I met this girl,,and I thought, "She's beautiful,",and I went up to her and asked her,,"Can I take your picture?",And she said yes,,but she refused to smile.,I think she couldn't,,because I think she must realize that she represents,a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,,a generation isolated and frustrated.,And yet, look at what they fled:,utter destruction,,buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.,Hany's home was also destroyed.,This will need to be rebuilt,by architects, by engineers, by electricians.,Communities will need teachers and lawyers,and politicians interested in reconciliation,and not revenge.,Shouldn't this be rebuilt,by the people with the largest stake,,the societies in exile, the refugees? 
 Refugees have a lot of time,to prepare for their return.,You might imagine that being a refugee,is just a temporary state.,Well far from it.,With wars going on and on,,the average time a refugee will spend in exile,is 17 years.,Hany was into his second year in limbo,when I went to visit him recently,,and we conducted our entire conversation in English,,which he confessed to me he learned,from reading all of Dan Brown's novels,and from listening to American rap.,We also spent some nice moments of laughter,and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.,But I'll never forget what he told me,when we ended our conversation that day.,He said to me,,"If I am not a student, I am nothing." 
 Hany is one of 50 million people,uprooted in this world today.,Never since World War II,have so many people been forcibly displaced.,So while we're making sweeping progress,in human health,,in technology, in education and design,,we are doing dangerously little,to help the victims,and we are doing far too little,to stop and prevent,the wars that are driving them from their homes. 
 And there are more and more victims.,Every day, on average,,by the end of this day,,32,000 people will be forcibly displaced,from their homes —,32,000 people.,They flee across borders like this one.,We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,,and this is a typical day.,Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,,risking their lives in this case,just to reach safety in Europe.,This Syrian young man,survived one of these boats that capsized —,most of the people drowned —,and he told us,,"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place,where nobody hurts you,,where nobody humiliates you,,and where nobody kills you.",Well, I think that should be the minimum.,How about a place of healing,,of learning,,and even opportunity?,Americans and Europeans,have the impression that proportionally,huge numbers of refugees are coming,to their country,,but the reality is,that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,,are living in the developing world,,in countries struggling with their own insecurity,,with their own issues of helping their own populations,and poverty.,So wealthy countries in the world should recognize,the humanity and the generosity of the countries,that are hosting so many refugees.,And all countries should make sure that no one,fleeing war and persecution,arrives at a closed border. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 But there is something more that we can do,than just simply helping refugees survive.,We can help them thrive.,We should think of refugee camps and communities,as more than just temporary population centers,where people languish,waiting for the war to end.,Rather, as centers of excellence,,where refugees can triumph over their trauma,and train for the day that they can go home,as agents of positive change,and social transformation. 
 It makes so much sense,,but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia,that has been raging on for 22 years.,And imagine living in this camp.,I visited this camp.,It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,,and it was so remote,that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.,It was dusty and it was terribly hot.,And we went to visit a school,and started talking to the children,,and then I saw this girl across the room,who looked to me to be the same age,as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.,And I asked her the questions,that grown-ups ask kids,,like, "What is your favorite subject?",and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?",And this is when her face turned blank,,and she said to me,,"I have no future.,My schooling days are over.",And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,,so I turned to my colleague,and she confirmed to me,there is no funding for secondary education,in this camp.,And how I wished at that moment,that I could say to her,,"We will build you a school.",And I also thought, what a waste.,She should be and she is,the future of Somalia. 
 A boy named Jacob Atem,had a different chance, but not before he experienced,terribly tragedy.,He watched — this is in Sudan —,as his village — he was only seven years old —,burned to the ground, and he learned,that his mother and his father,and his entire family,were killed that day.,Only his cousin survived, and the two of them,walked for seven months —,this is boys like him —,chased and pursued by wildnanimals and armed gangs,,and they finally made it to refugee camps,where they found safety,,and he would spend the next seven years,in Kenya in a refugee camp. 
 But his life changed,when he got the chance to be resettled,to the United States,,and he found love in a foster family,and he was able to go to school,,and he wanted me to share with you,this proud moment,when he graduated from university. 
 (Applause) 
 I spoke to him on Skype the other day,,and he was in his new university in Florida,pursuing his Ph.D. in public health,,and he proudly told me how he was able to raise,enough funds from the American public,to establish a health clinic back in his village,back home. 
 So I want to take you back to Hany.,When I told him I was going to have the chance,to speak to you here on the TED stage,,he allowed me to read you a poem,that he sent in an email to me. 
 He wrote:,"I miss myself,,my friends,,times of reading novels or writing poems,,birds and tea in the morning.,My room, my books, myself,,and everything that was making me smile.,Oh, oh, I had so many dreams,that were about to be realized." 
 So here is my point:,Not investing in refugees,is a huge missed opportunity.,Leave them abandoned,,and they risk exploitation and abuse,,and leave them unskilled and uneducated,,and delay by years the return,to peace and prosperity in their countries.,I believe how we treat the uprooted,will shape the future of our world.,The victims of war can hold the keys,to lasting peace,,and it's the refugees,who can stop the cycle of violence. 
 Hany is at a tipping point.,We would love to help him go to university,and to become an engineer,,but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:,tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,,food rations and a bit of medicine.,University is a luxury.,But leave him to languish in this muddy field,,and he will become a member,of a lost generation.,Hany's story is a tragedy,,but it doesn't have to end that way. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)On January 4, 1934,,a young man delivered a report,to the United States Congress,that 80 years on,,still shapes the lives ofneveryone in this room today,,still shapes the lives ofneveryone on this planet.,That young man wasn't a politician,,he wasn't a businessman,,a civil rights activist,or a faith leader.,He was that most unlikely of heroes,,an economist.,His name was Simon Kuznets,and the report that nhe delivered was called,"National Income, 1929-1932." 
 Now, you might think,this is a rather dry and dull report.,And you're absolutely right.,It's dry as a bone.,But this report is the foundation,of how, today, we judge the nsuccess of countries:,what we know best asnGross Domestic Product,,GDP. 
 GDP has defined and shaped our lives,for the last 80 years.,And today I want to talk about,a different way to measurenthe success of countries,,a different way to define nand shape our lives,for the next 80 years. 
 But first, we have to understand,how GDP came tondominate our lives.,Kuznets' report was delivered,at a moment of crisis.,The U.S. economy was plummeting,into the Great Depression,and policy makers were nstruggling to respond.,Struggling because they didn'tnknow what was going on.,They didn't have data and statistics.,So what Kuznet's report gave them,was reliable data on what nthe U.S. economy,was producing,,updated year by year.,And armed with this information,,policy makers were, eventually,,able to find a way out nof the slump.,And because Kuznets' invention,was found to be so useful,,it spread around the world.,And now today, every country,produces GDP statistics. 
 But, in that first report,,Kuznets himself delivered a warning.,It's in the introductory chapter.,On page seven he says,,"The welfare of a nation can, therefore,,scarcely be inferred,from a measurement of nnational income,as defined above.",It's not the greatest sound nbite in the world,,and it's dressed up in the cautious nlanguage of the economist.,But his message was clear:,GDP is a tool,to help us measureneconomic performance.,It's not a measurenof our well-being.,And it shouldn't be a guide nto all decision making. 
 But we have ignored Kuznets' warning.,We live in a world where,GDP is the benchmark of success,in a global economy.,Our politicians boast whennGDP goes up.,Markets move,and trillions of dollars of capital,move around the world,based on which countriesnare going up,and which countries nare going down,,all measured in GDP.,Our societies have become,engines to create more GDP. 
 But we know that GDP is flawed.,It ignores the environment.,It counts bombs and prisons as progress.,It can't count happiness or community.,And it has nothing to say nabout fairness or justice.,Is it any surprise that our world,,marching to the drumbeat of GDP,,is teetering on the brinknof environmental disaster,and filled with anger and conflict? 
 We need a better waynto measure our societies,,a measure based on the real nthings that matter to real people.,Do I have enough to eat?,Can I read and write?,Am I safe?,Do I have rights?,Do I live in a society wherenI'm not discriminated against?,Is my future and the future of my children nprevented from environmental destruction?,These are questions that GDP,does not and cannot answer. 
 There have, of course,,been efforts in the past,to move beyond GDP.,But I believe that we're living,in a moment when we,are ready for a measurement revolution.,We're ready because we've seen,,in the financial crisis of 2008,,how our fetish for economic growth,led us so far astray.,We've seen, in the Arab Spring,,how countries like Tunisia,were supposedly economic superstars,,but they were societies,that were seething with discontentment.,We're ready, because todaynwe have the technology,to gather and analyze data,in ways that would have beennunimaginable to Kuznets. 
 Today, I'd like to introduce you nto the Social Progress Index.,It's a measure of the nwell-being of society,,completely separate from GDP.,It's a whole new waynof looking at the world.,The Social Progress Index,begins by defining what it,means to be a good society,based around three dimensions.,The first is, does everyone haventhe basic needs for survival:,food, water, shelter, safety?,Secondly, does everyone have,access to the building blocks nto improve their lives:,education, information, healthnand sustainable environment?,And then third, does every nindividual have access,to a chance to pursue their goals,and dreams and ambitions,free from obstacles?,Do they have rights,,freedom of choice,,freedom from discrimination,and access to the the world'snmost advanced knowledge?,Together, these 12 components,form the Social Progress framework.,And for each of these 12 components,,we have indicators to measure nhow countries are performing.,Not indicators of effort or intention,,but real achievement.,We don't measure how muchna country spends on healthcare,,we measure the length and nquality of people's lives.,We don't measure whether governmentsnpass laws against discrimination,,we measure whether people nexperience discrimination. 
 But what you want to know,is who's top, don't you?n(Laughter),I knew that, I knew that, I knew that.,Okay, I'm going to show you.,I'm going to show you on this chart.,So here we are,,what I've done here is put on the nvertical axis social progress.,Higher is better.,And then, just for comparison,,just for fun,,on the horizontal axisnis GDP per capita.,Further to the right is more.,So the country in the world,with the highest social progress,,the number one country on social progress,is New Zealand.,(Applause),Well done! Never been; must go.,(Laughter),The country with the least social progress,,I'm sorry to say, is Chad.,I've never been; maybe next year.,(Laughter),Or maybe the year after. 
 Now, I know what you're thinking.,You're thinking, "Aha,,but New Zealand has a higher GDP,than Chad!",It's a good point, well made.,But let me show you,two other countries.,Here's the United States —,considerably richer than New Zealand,,but with a lower level of social progress.,And then here's Senegal —,it's got a higher level of nsocial progress than Chad,,but the same level of GDP.,So what's going on? Well, look.,Let me bring in the rest of nthe countries of the world,,the 132 we've been able to measure,,each one represented by a dot.,There we go. Lots of dots.,Now, obviously I can't do all of them,,so a few highlights for you:,The highest ranked G7 country is Canada.,My country, the United Kingdom,,is sort of middling, sort of dull,,but who cares —,at least we beat the French.,(Laughter),And then looking at the nemerging economies,,top of the BRICS, npleased to say, is Brazil.,(Applause),Come on, cheer!,Go, Brazil!,Beating South Africa,,then Russia,,then China,and then India.,Tucked away on the right-hand side,,you will see a dot of a ncountry with a lot of GDP,but not a huge amount nof social progress —,that's Kuwait.,Just above Brazil,is a social progress superpower —,that's Costa Rica.,It's got a level of social progress the same nas some Western European countries,,with a much lower GDP. 
 Now, my slide is getting na little cluttered,and I'd like to step back a bit.,So let me take away these countries,,and then pop in the regression line.,So this shows the average relationship,between GDP and social progress.,The first thing to notice,,is that there's lots of noise,around the trend line.,And what this shows,,what this empirically demonstrates,,is that GDP is not destiny.,At every level of GDP per capita,,there are opportunitiesnfor more social progress,,risks of less.,The second thing to notice,is that for poor countries,,the curve is really steep.,So what this tells us is that,if poor countries can get,a little bit of extra GDP,,and if they reinvest that,in doctors, nurses, water supplies,,sanitation, etc.,,there's a lot of social progress bang,for your GDP buck.,And that's good news, and that's what nwe've seen over the last 20, 30 years,,with a lot of people lifted out of poverty,by economic growth and good policies,in poorer countries. 
 But go on a bit further up the curve,,and then we see it flattening out.,Each extra dollar of GDP,is buying less and less social progress.,And with more and morenof the world's population,living on this part of the curve,,it means GDP is becoming,less and less useful,as a guide to our development.,I'll show you an example of Brazil. 
 Here's Brazil:,social progress of about 70 out of 100,,GDP per capita about n14,000 dollars a year.,And look, Brazil's above the line.,Brazil is doing a reasonably good job,of turning GDP into social progress.,But where does Brazil go next?,Let's say that Brazil,adopts a bold economic plan,to double GDP in the next decade.,But that is only half a plan.,It's less than half a plan,,because where does Brazilnwant to go on social progress?,Brazil, it's possible,to increase your growth,,increase your GDP,,while stagnating or going backwards,on social progress.,We don't want Brazil,to become like Russia.,What you really want is for Brazil,to get ever more efficient at creating nsocial progress from its GDP,,so it becomes more like New Zealand.,And what that means is that,Brazil needs to prioritize social progress,in its development plan,and see that it's not just growth alone,,it's growth with social progress.,And that's what the Social nProgress Index does:,It reframes the debate about development,,not just about GDP alone,,but inclusive, sustainable growth,that brings real improvements nin people's lives.,And it's not just about countries. 
 Earlier this year,,with our friends from the Imazon nnonprofit here in Brazil,,we launched the first subnational nSocial Progress Index.,We did it for the Amazon region.,It's an area the size of nEurope, 24 million people,,one of the most deprived nparts of the country.,And here are the results,,and this is broken down,into nearly 800 different municipalities.,And with this detailed information,about the real quality of life,in this part of the country,,Imazon and other partners,from government, nbusiness and civil society,can work together to construct,a development plan,that will help really improvenpeople's lives,,while protecting that nprecious global asset,that is the Amazon Rainforest.,And this is just the beginning,,You can create a Social Progress Index,for any state, region, ncity or municipality.,We all know and love TEDx;,this is Social Pogress-x.,This is a tool for anyone to come and use. 
 Contrary to the way we nsometimes talk about it,,GDP was not handed down from nGod on tablets of stone. (Laughter),It's a measurement toolninvented in the 20th century,to address the challengesnof the 20th century.,In the 21st century,,we face new challenges:,aging, obesity, climate change, and so on.,To face those challenges,,we need new tools of measurement,,new ways of valuing progress. 
 Imagine if we could measure,what nonprofits, charities,,volunteers, civil society organizations,really contribute to our society.,Imagine if businesses competed,not just on the basis ofntheir economic contribution,,but on their contribution nto social progress.,Imagine if we could hold npoliticians to account,for really improving people's lives.,Imagine if we could work together —,government, business, ncivil society, me, you —,and make this century the ncentury of social progress.,Thank you.,(Applause)If there's any power in design,,that's the power of synthesis.,The more complex the problem,,the more the need for simplicity.,So allow me to share three cases,where we tried to apply,design's power of synthesis. 
 Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization.,It's a fact that people are moving towards cities.,and even if counterintuitive, it's good news.,Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.,But there's a problem that I would call,the "3S" menace:,The scale, speed, and scarcity of means,with which we will have tonrespond to this phenomenon,has no precedence in history.,For you to have an idea,,out of the three billion npeople living in cities today,,one billion are under the line of poverty.,By 2030, out of the five billion people,that will be living in cities,,two billion are going to nbe under the line of poverty.,That means that we will have to build,a one million-person city per week,with 10,000 dollars per family,during the next 15 years.,A one million-person city per week,with 10,000 dollars per family.,If we don't solve this equation,,it is not that people nwill stop coming to cities.,They will come anyhow,,but they will live in slums, favelas,and informal settlements. 
 So what to do? Well, an answer may come,from favelas and slums themselves.,A clue could be in this nquestion we were asked,10 years ago.,We were asked to accommodate 100 families,that had been occupying illegally,half a hectare in the center,of the city of Iquique nin the north of Chile,using a $10,000 subsidy,with which we had to buy the land,,provide the infrastructure,,and build the houses that, nin the best of the cases,,would be of around 40 square meters.,And by the way, they said,,the cost of the land,,because it's in the center of the city,,is three times more,than what social housing can normally afford.,Due to the difficulty of the question,,we decided to include the families,in the process of understanding the constraints,,and we started a participatory design process,,and testing what was navailable there in the market.,Detached houses,,30 families could be accommodated.,Row houses, 60 families.,["100 families"]nThe only way to accommodate all of them,was by building in height,,and they threatened us,to go on a hunger strike,if we even dared to offer this,as a solution,,because they could not nmake the tiny apartments,expand.,So the conclusion with the families —,and this is important, nnot our conclusion —,with the families, was that we had a problem.,We had to innovate. 
 So what did we do?,Well, a middle-class family,lives reasonably well,in around 80 square meters,,but when there's no money,,what the market does,is to reduce the size of the house,to 40 square meters.,What we said was,,what if,,instead of thinking of 40 square meters,as a small house,,why don't we consider it,half of a good one?,When you rephrase the problem,as half of a good house,instead of a small one,,the key question is, which half do we do?,And we thought we had nto do with public money,the half that families won't nbe able to do individually.,We identified five design conditions,that belonged to the hard half of a house,,and we went back to the nfamilies to do two things:,join forces and split tasks.,Our design was something in between,a building and a house.,As a building, it could pay,for expensive, well-located land,,and as a house, it could expand.,If, in the process of not being expelled,to the periphery while getting a house,,families kept their nnetwork and their jobs,,we knew that the expansion nwould begin right away.,So we went from this initial social housing,to a middle-class unit achievednby families themselves,within a couple of weeks. 
 This was our first project,in Iquique 10 years ago.,This is our last project in Chile.,Different designs, same principle:,You provide the frame,,and from then on, families take over. 
 So the purpose of design,,trying to understand and ntrying to give an answer,to the "3S" menace,,scale, speed, and scarcity,,is to channel people's own building capacity.,We won't solve the one millionnpeople per week equation,unless we use people's own power for building.,So, with the right design,,slums and favelas may not be the problem,but actually the only possible solution.,The second case is how design can contribute,to sustainability.,In 2012, we entered the competition,for the Angelini Innovation Center,,and the aim was to build,the right environment for knowledge creation.,It is accepted that for such an aim,,knowledge creation,,interaction among people, nface-to-face contact,,it's important, and we agreed on that.,But for us, the question nof the right environment,was a very literal question.,We wanted to have a working space,with the right light, with the right temperature,,with the right air.,So we asked ourselves:,Does the typical office building,help us in that sense?,Well, how does that nbuilding look, typically?,It's a collection of floors,,one on top of each other,,with a core in the center,with elevators, stairs, npipes, wires, everything,,and then a glass skin on the outside,that, due to direct sun radiation,,creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.,In addition to that, let's say a guy,working on the seventh floor,goes every single day nthrough the third floor,,but has no idea what the guy on that floor,is working on.,So we thought, well, maybe nwe have to turn this scheme,inside out.,And what we did was,,let's have an open atrium,,a hollowed core,,the same collection of floors,,but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,,so that when the sun hits,,it's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.,When you have an open atrium inside,,you are able to see what others are doing,from within the building, and you have,a better way to control light,,and when you place the mass and the walls,in the perimeter,,then you are preventing direct sun radiation.,You may also open those windows,and get cross-ventilation.,We just made those openings,of such a scale that they could work,as elevated squares,,outdoor spaces throughout,the entire height of the building.,None of this is rocket science.,You don't require sophisticated programming.,It's not about technology.,This is just archaic, nprimitive common sense,,and by using common sense,,we went from 120 kilowatts,per square meter per year,,which is the typical energy consumption,for cooling a glass tower,,to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.,So with the right design,,sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use,of common sense.,Last case I would like nto share is how design,can provide more comprehensive answers,against natural disasters.,You may know that Chile, in 2010,,was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale,earthquake and tsunami,,and we were called to work,in the reconstruction of the Constitución,,in the southern part of the country.,We were given 100 days, three months,,to design almost everything,,from public buildings to public space,,street grid, transportation, housing,,and mainly how to protect the city,against future tsunamis.,This was new in Chilean urban design,,and there were in the nair a couple of alternatives.,First one:,Forbid installation on ground zero.,Thirty million dollars spent mainly,in land expropriation.,This is exactly what's beingndiscussed in Japan nowadays,,and if you have a disciplined population,like the Japanese, this may work,,but we know that in Chile,,this land is going to be noccupied illegally anyhow,,so this alternative was nunrealistic and undesirable.,Second alternative: build a big wall,,heavy infrastructure to resist,the energy of the waves.,This alternative was conveniently lobbied,by big building companies,,because it meant 42 million ndollars in contracts,,and was also politically preferred,,because it required no land expropriation.,But Japan proved that trying to resist,the force of nature is useless.,So this alternative was irresponsible.,As in the housing process,,we had to include the community,in the way of finding a solution for this,,and we started a participatory design process. 
 (Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker:nWhat kind of city do you want?,Vote for Constitución.,Go to the Open House and express your options.,Participate! 
 Fisherman: I am a fisherman.,Twenty-five fishermen work for me.,Where should I take them? To the forest? 
 Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense?,Done well, of course. 
 Man 2: I am the history of Constitución.,And you come here to tell menthat I cannot keep on living here?,My whole family has lived here,,I raised my children here,,and my children will also nraise their children here.,and my grandchildren nand everyone else will.,But why are you imposing this on me?,You! You are imposing this on me!,In danger zone I am not authorized to build.,He himself is saying that. 
 Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves... 
 Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able,to read the subtitles, but you can tell,from the body language,that participatory design,is not a hippie, romantic,,let's-all-dream-together-about-nthe-future-of-the-city,kind of thing.,It is actually — (Applause),It is actually not even with the families,trying to find the right answer.,It is mainly trying to identify with precision,what is the right question.,There is nothing worse than answering well,the wrong question. 
 So it was pretty obvious after this process,that, well, we chicken out here,and go away because it's too tense,,or we go even further in asking,,what else is bothering you?,What other problems do you have,and you want us to take ncare of now that the city,will have to be rethought from scratch?,And what they said was,,look, fine to protect the city nagainst future tsunamis,,we really appreciate, but the next one nis going to come in, what, 20 years?,But every single year, we have problems,of flooding due to rain.,In addition, we are in the middle,of the forest region of the country,,and our public space sucks.,It's poor and it's scarce.,And the origin of the city, our identity,,is not really connected to the buildings that fell,,it is connected to the river,,but the river cannot be accessed publicly,,because its shores are privately owned.,So we thought that we hadnto produce a third alternative,,and our approach was nagainst geographical threats,,have geographical answers.,What if, in between the city,and the sea,we have a forest,,a forest that doesn't try to resist,the energy of nature,,but dissipates it by introducing friction?,A forest that may be able to laminate the water,and prevent the flooding?,That may pay the historical debt of public space,,and that may provide, finally,,democratic access to the river.,So as a conclusion of the participatory design,,the alternative was validated politically and socially,,but there was still the problem of the cost:,48 million dollars.,So what we did was a survey,in the public investment system,,and found out that there nwere three ministries,with three projects in nthe exact same place,,not knowing of the existence nof the other projects.,The sum of them: 52 million dollars.,So design's power of synthesis,is trying to make a more efficient use,of the scarcest resource in cities,,which is not money but coordination.,By doing so, we were able to save,four million dollars, and nthat is why the forest,is today under construction.,(Applause) 
 So be it the force of self construction,,the force of common sense,,or the force of nature, all these forces,need to be translated into form,,and what that form is modeling and shaping,is not cement, bricks, or wood.,It is life itself.,Design's power of synthesis,is just an attempt to put,at the innermost core of architecture,the force of life. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)Now, I've been making picturesnfor quite a long time,,and normally speaking,na picture like this, for me,,should be straightforward.,I'm in southern Ethiopia.nI'm with the Daasanach.,There's a big family,nthere's a very beautiful tree,,and I make these picturesnwith this very large,,extremely cumbersome, very awkwardntechnical plate film camera.,Does anybody known4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,,and you're setting it up,nputting it on the tripod.,I've got the family, spent the better partnof a day talking with them.,They sort of understand what I'm on about.,They think I'm a bit crazy,nbut that's another story.,And what's most important for menis the beauty and the aesthetic,,and that's based on the light.,So the light's settingnon my left-hand side,,and there's a balancenin the communication with the Daasanach,,the family of 30, all ages.,There's babies and there's grandparents,,I'm getting them in the treenand waiting for the light to set,,and it's going, going,nand I've got one sheet of film left,,and I think, I'm okay,nI'm in control, I'm in control.,I'm setting it up and I'm setting up,nand the light's just about to go,,and I want it to be golden,nI want it to be beautiful.,I want it to be hanging on the horizonnso it lights these people,,in all the potential glorynthat they could be presented.,And it's about to go nand it's about to go,,and I put my sheet in the camera,,it's all focused,,and all of a suddennthere's a massive "whack,",and I'm looking around,nand in the top corner of the tree,,one of the girls slapsnthe girl next to her,,and the girl next to her pulls her hair,nand all hell breaks loose,,and I'm standing there going,n"But the light, the light.,Wait, I need the light.nStay still! Stay still!",And they start screaming,,and then one of the men turns aroundnand starts screaming, shouting,,and the whole tree collapses,nnot the tree, but the people in the tree.,They're all running around screaming,nand they run back off into the village,in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'mnleft there standing behind my tripod.,I've got my sheet, and the light's gone,nand I can't make the picture.,Where have they all gone? I had no idea. 
 It took me a week, it took me a week tonmake the picture which you see here today,,and I'll tell you why. (Applause),It's very, very, very simple --nI spent a week going around the village,,and I went to every single one:n"Hello, can you meet at the tree?,What's your story? Who are you?",And it all turned out to benabout a boyfriend, for crying out loud.,I mean, I have teenage kids.nI should know.,It was about a boyfriend. The girlnon the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,,and they'd started having a fight.,And there was a very, very beautifulnlesson for me in that:,If I was going to photograph these people,in the dignified, respectful waynthat I had intended,,and put them on a pedestal,nI had to understand them.,It wasn't just about turning up.nIt wasn't just about shaking a hand.,It wasn't about just saying,n"I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer.",I had to get to knownevery single one of them,,right down to whose boyfriend is whonand who is allowed to kiss who. 
 So in the end, a week later,,and I was absolutely exhausted,,I mean on my knees going,n"Please get back up in that tree.,It's a picture I need to make.",They all came back.nI put them all back up in the tree.,I made sure the girlsnwere in the right position,,and the ones that slapped,none was over there.,They did look at each other.nIf you look at it later,,they're staringnat each other very angrily,,and I've got the tree and everything,,and then at the last minute, I go,n"The goat, the goat!,I need something for the eye to look at.nI need a white goat in the middle.",So I swapped all the goats around.nI put the goats in.,But even then I got it wrong, becausenif you can see on the left-hand side,,another little boy storms offnbecause I didn't choose his goat.,So the moral being I have to learnnto speak Goat as well as Daasanach. 
 But anyway, the effortnthat goes into that picture,and the story that I'venjust related to you,,as you can imagine,,there are hundreds of othernbizarre, eccentric stories,of hundreds of other peoplenaround the world.,And this was about four years ago,nand I set off on a journey,,to be honest, a very indulgent journey.,I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist,nperhaps in some ways naive.,But I truly believe that there are peoplenon the planet that are beautiful.,It's very, very simple.nIt's not rocket science.,I wanted to putnthese people on a pedestal.,I wanted to put them on a pedestalnlike they'd never been seen before.,So, I chose about 35 different groups,,tribes, indigenous cultures.,They were chosen purelynbecause of their aesthetic,,and I'll talk more about that later.,I'm not an anthropologist, I havenno technical study with the subject,,but I do have a very,nvery, very deep passion,,and I believe that I had to choosenthe most beautiful people on the planet,in the most beautifulnenvironment that they lived in,,and put the two togethernand present them to you. 
 About a year ago,,I published the first pictures,,and something extraordinarilynexciting happened.,The whole world came running,,and it was a bizarre experience,nbecause everybody, from everywhere:,"Who are they? What are they?nHow many are they?,Where did you find them?nAre they real? You faked it.,Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."nMillions of questions for which,,to be honest, I don't have the answers.,I really didn't have the answers,,and I could sort of understand, okay,nthey're beautiful, that was my intention,,but the questions that Inwas being fired at,,I could not answer them. 
 Until, it was quite amusing,nabout a year ago,somebody said, "You've beenninvited to do a TED Talk.",And I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted?nI haven't met Ted before.",He said, "No, a TED Talk."nI said, "But who's Ted?,Do I have to talk to him or do wensit with each other on the stage?",And, "No, no, the TED group.nYou must know about it.",And I said, "I've been in a teepeenand in a yurt for the last five years.,How do I know who Ted is?nIntroduce me to him.",Anyway, to cut a long story short,nhe said, "We have to do a TED Talk.",Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!,And then eventually you're goingnto go to TEDGlobal.,Even more exciting.,But what you need to do, you neednto teach the people lessons,,lessons that you've learnednon your travels around the world,with these tribes.,I thought, lessons, okay, well,nwhat did I learn? Good question.,Three. You need three lessons,nand they need to be terribly profound.,(Laughter),And I thought, three lessons, well,nI'm going to think about it.,(Applause) 
 So I thought long and hard,nand I stood here two days ago,,and I had my test run,nand I had my cards,and my clicker in my handsnand my pictures were on the screen,,and I had my three lessons,nand I started presenting them,,and I had this very oddnout-of-body experience.,I sort of looked at myselfnstanding there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,,this is complete loads of codswallop.,All these people sitting here,nthey've had more of these talks,,they've heard more lessons in their life.,Who are you to tell themnwhat you've learned?,Who are you to guide themnand who are you to show them,what is right, what is wrong,nwhat these people have to say?",And I had a little bit of a,nit was very private,,a little bit of a meltdown.,I went back, and a little bit like the boynwalking away from the tree with his goats,,very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,,It wasn't what I wanted to communicate.,And I thought long and hard about it,nand I thought, well, the only thing,I can communicate is very, very basic.,You have to turn it all the way around.,There's only one personnI know here, and that's me.,I'm still getting to know myself,,and it's a lifelong journey, and Inprobably won't have all the answers,,but I did learn some extraordinarynthings on this journey. 
 So what I'm going to donis share with you my lessons.,It's a very, as I explained at thenbeginning, very indulgent, very personal,,how and why I made these pictures,,and I leave it to you as the audiencento interpret what these lessons,have meant to me, what they couldnperhaps mean to you. 
 I traveled enormously as a child.,I was very nomadic.nIt was actually very exciting.,All around the world,,and I had this feeling that Inwas pushed off at great speed,to become somebody,nbecome that individual, Jimmy.,Go off into the planet,nand so I ran, and I ran,,and my wife sometimes kids me,n"Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,",but I'm, "No, it's allnabout something, trust me.",So I kept running and I kept running,nand I sort of got somewhere,and I sort of stood there and lookednaround me and I thought, well,,where do I belong? Where do I fit?,What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.,So I hope there aren't too manynpsychologists in this audience.,Perhaps part of this journey,is about me trying to find outnwhere I belonged.,So whilst going, and don't worry, I didn'tnwhen I arrived with these tribes,,I didn't paint myself yellow and runnaround with these spears and loincloths. 
 But what I did find were peoplenthat belonged themselves,,and they inspired me,nsome extraordinary people,,and I'd like to introduce younto some heroes of mine.,They're the Huli. 
 Now, the Huli are some of the mostnextraordinarily beautiful people,on the planet.,They're proud. They live innthe Papua New Guinean highlands.,There's not many of them left,nand they're called the Huli wigmen.,And images like this, I mean,nthis is what it's all about for me.,And you've spent weeks and months therentalking with them, getting there,,and I want to put them on a pedestal,nand I said, "You have something,that many people have not seen.,You sit in this stunning nature.",And it really does look like this,nand they really do look like this.,This is the real thing.,And you know why they're proud?nYou know why they look like this,,and why I broke my back literally,to photograph themnand present them to you?,It's because they haventhese extraordinary rituals. 
 And the Huli have this ritual:nWhen they're teenagers,,becoming a man,nthey have to shave their heads,,and they spend the rest of their lifenshaving their heads every single day,,and what they do with that hair,,they make it into a creation,,a creation that'sna very personal creation.,It's their creation.nIt's their Huli creation.,So they're called the Huli wigmen.,That's a wig on his head.,It's all made out of his human hair.,And then they decorate that wig withnthe feathers of the birds of paradise,,and don't worry,nthere are many birds there.,There's very few people living,nso nothing to get too upset about,,and they spend the rest of their lifenrecreating these hats,and getting furthernand further,,and it's extraordinary,nand there's another group,,they're called the Kalam,nand they live in the next valley,,but they speak a completelyndifferent language,,they look completely different,nand they wear a hat,,and it's built out of scarabs,,these fantastic emerald greennlittle scarabs,,and sometimes there are 5,000nor 6,000 scarabs in this hat,,and they spend the whole of their lifencollecting these scarabs,to build these hats. 
 So the Huli inspired menin that they belong.,Perhaps I have to work hardernat finding a ritual which matters for me,and going back into my pastnto see where I actually fit. 
 An extremely important partnof this project,was about how I photographnthese extraordinary people.,And it's basically beauty.nI think beauty matters.,We spend the whole of our existencenrevolving around beauty:,beautiful places, beautiful things,nand ultimately, beautiful people.,It's very, very, very significant.,I've spent all of my life analyzingnwhat do I look like?,Am I perceived as beautiful?,Does it matter if I'mna beautiful person or not,,or is it purely based on my aesthetic?,And then when I went off,nI came to a very narrow conclusion.,Do I have to go around the worldnphotographing, excuse me,,women between the age of 25 and 30?nIs that what beauty is going to be?,Is everything before and after thatnutterly irrelevant? 
 And it was only until I went on a journey,,a journey that was so extreme,,I still get shivers when I think about it.,I went to a part of the world,nand I don't know whether any of you,have ever heard of Chukotka.nHas anybody ever heard of Chukotka?,Chukotka probably is, technically,nas far as one can go,and still be on the living planet.,It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.,First you've got to get to Moscow, andnthen 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.,And that's if you get there.,As you can see, some peoplensort of miss the runway. 
 And then when you land there,nin Chukotka are the Chukchis.,Now, the Chukchis are the lastnindigenous Inuits of Siberia,,and they're people I'd heard about,nI'd hardly seen any images of,,but I knew they were there,,and I'd been in touch with this guide,,and this guide said,,"There's this fantastic tribe.nThere's only about 40 of them.,You'll be okay. We'll find them."nSo off we went on this journey.,When we arrived there, after a monthnof traveling across the ice,,and we'd got to them, but thennI was not allowed to photograph them.,They said, "You cannot photograph us.nYou have to wait.,You have to wait until you get to know us.nYou have to wait until you understand us.,You have to wait until you seenhow we interact with one another.",And only then, it was many,nmany weeks later, I saw a respect.,They had zero judgment.,They observed one another, from the youth,nfrom the middle aged to the old.,They need each other.,The children need to chew the meat all day,because the adults don't have any teeth,,but at the same time, the childrenntake the old aged people out,to the toilet because they're infirm,,so there's this fantasticncommunity of respect.,And they adore and admire one another,nand they truly taught me,what beauty was.,(Applause) 
 Now I'm going to ask for a little bitnof audience interaction.,This is extremely importantnfor the end of my talk.,If you could look at somebodynleft to the right of you,,and I want you to observe them,,and I want you to give them a compliment.nThis is very important.,Now, it may be their nose or their hairnor even their aura, I don't mind,,but please look at each other,ngive them a compliment.,You have to be quick,nbecause I'm running out of time.,And you have to remember it. 
 Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you,nyou've given each other compliments.,Hold that compliment very, very tightly.nHold it for later. 
 And the last thing, it wasnextraordinarily profound,,and it happened only two weeks ago.nTwo weeks ago I went back to the Himba.,Now, the Himba live in northern Namibianon the border of Angola,,and I'd been there a few times before,,and I'd gone backnto present this book I'd made,,to show them the pictures,nto get into a discussion with them,,to say, "This is how I saw you.nThis is how I love you.,This is how I respect you. Whatndo you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?",So I wanted this debate.nIt was very, very, very emotional,,and one night we were sittingnaround the campfire,,and I have to be honest, I think I'd hadna little bit too much to drink,,and I was sort of sitting under the starsngoing, "This is great,,you've seen my pictures,nwe love each other." (Laughter),And I'm a little bit slow,,and I looked around me, and I said,,I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.,Wasn't there a fence herenlast time I came?,You know, this bignprotective fence around the village,,and they sort of looked at menand go, "Yeah, chief die.",And I thought, okay,nchief dying, right, you know,,look up at the stars again,nlook at the campfire.,Chief die. What on Earth doesnchief die have to do with the fence?,"Chief die.,First we destroy, yeah?nThen we reflect.,Then we rebuild. Then we respect.",And I burst out in tears, becausenmy father had only just died,prior to this journey,,and I didn't ever acknowledge him,,I didn't ever appreciate him for the factnthat I'm probably standing here today,because of him.,These people taught me that we are onlynwho we are because of our parents,and our grandparentsnand our forefathers,going on and on and on before that,,and I, no matter how romanticnor how idealistic I am on this journey,,I did not know that until two weeks ago.,I did not know that until two weeks ago. 
 So what's this all about?,Well, there's an imagenI'd like to show you,,quite a special image, and it wasn'tnessentially the image I wanted to choose.,I was sitting there the other day,nand I have to finish on a strong image.,And somebody said, "You have to shownthem the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets.",I was like, yeah, but that's notnmy favorite picture.,She went, "No no no no no no no.nIt's an amazing picture.,You're in his eyes.",I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes?nIt's a picture of the Nenets.",She said, "No, look, look closely,nyou're in his eyes.",And when you look closely at this picture,nthere is a reflection of me in his eyes,,so I think perhaps he has my soul,nand I'm in his soul,,and whilst these pictures look at you,nI ask you to look at them.,You may not be reflected in his eyes,,but there is something extraordinarilynimportant about these people.,I don't ultimately have the answers,nas I've just shared with you,,but you must do.nThere must be something there.,So if you can briefly reflectnon what I was discussing,about beauty and about belongingnand about our ancestors and our roots,,and I need you allnto stand for me, please.,(Laughter),Now you have no excuse.nIt's almost lunchtime,,and this is not a standing ovation,nso don't worry,,I'm not fishing for compliments.,But you were given a complimentna few minutes ago.,Now I want you to stand tall.,I want you to breathe in.nThis is what I say.,I'm not going to getnon my knees for two weeks.,I'm not going to ask younto carry a goat,,and I know you don't have any camels.,Photography's extraordinarily powerful.,It's this language whichnwe now all understand.,We truly do all understand it,,and we have this globalndigital fireplace, don't we,,but I want to share you with the world,,because you are also a tribe.,You are the TED tribe, yeah?nBut you have to remember that compliment.,You have to stand tall,nbreathe in through your nose,,and I'm going to photograph you. Okay?,I need to do a panoramic shot,nso it's going to take a minute,,so you have to concentrate, okay?,Breathe in, stand tall, no laughing.nShh, breathe through your nose.,I'm going to photograph. 
 (Clicks) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Almost a year ago,,my aunt started suffering back pains.,She went to see the doctor,and they told her it was a normal injury,for someone who had been playing tennis,for almost 30 years.,They recommended that she do some therapy,,but after a while she wasn't feeling better,,so the doctors decided to do further tests.,They did an x-ray,and discovered an injury in her lungs,,and at the time they thought that the injury,was a strain in the muscles and tendons,between her ribs,,but after a few weeks of treatment,,again her health wasn't getting any better.,So finally, they decided to do a biopsy,,and two weeks later,,the results of the biopsy came back.,It was stage 3 lung cancer. 
 Her lifestyle was almost free of risk.,She never smoked a cigarette,,she never drank alcohol,,and she had been playing sports,for almost half her life.,Perhaps, that is why it took them almost six months,to get her properly diagnosed. 
 My story might be, unfortunately,,familiar to most of you.,One out of three people sitting in this audience,will be diagnosed with some type of cancer,,and one out of four,will die because of it.,Not only did that cancer diagnosis,change the life of our family,,but that process of going,back and forth with new tests,,different doctors describing symptoms,,discarding diseases over and over,,was stressful and frustrating,,especially for my aunt.,And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done,since the beginning of history.,We have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs,to treat cancer,,but we still have 20th-century procedures,and processes for diagnosis, if any. 
 Today, most of us have to wait for symptoms,to indicate that something is wrong.,Today, the majority of people still don't have access,to early cancer detection methods,,even though we know,that catching cancer early,is basically the closest thing we have,to a silver bullet cure against it.,We know that we can change this in our lifetime,,and that is why my team and I,have decided to begin this journey,,this journey to try to make cancer detection,at the early stages,and monitoring the appropriate nresponse at the molecular level,easier, cheaper, smarter,and more accessible than ever before. 
 The context, of course,,is that we're living at a time,where technology is disrupting our present,at exponential rates,,and the biological realm is no exception.,It is said today that biotech is advancing,at least six times faster than the growth rate,of the processing power of computers.,But progress in biotech,is not only being accelerated,,it is also being democratized.,Just as personal computers or the Internet,or smartphones leveled the playing field,for entrepreneurship, politics or education,,recent advances have leveled itnup for biotech progress as well,,and that is allowing,multidisciplinary teams like ours,to try to tackle and look at these problems,with new approaches. 
 We are a team of scientists and technologists,from Chile, Panama,,Mexico, Israel and Greece,,and based on recent scientific discoveries,,we believe that we have found,a reliable and accurate way,of detecting several types of cancer,at the very early stages through a blood sample.,We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules,that circulate freely in our blood,called microRNAs. 
 To explain what microRNAs are,and their important role in cancer,,I need to start with proteins,,because when cancer is present in our body,,protein modification is observed,in all cancerous cells.,As you might know,,proteins are large biological molecules,that perform different functions within our body,,like catalyzing metabolic reactions,or responding to stimuli,or replicating DNA,,but before a protein is expressed or produced,,relevant parts of its genetic code,present in the DNA,are copied into the messenger RNA,,so this messenger RNA,has instructions on how to build a specific protein,,and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,,but the one that tells them when to build them,and how many to build,are microRNAs.,So microRNAs are small molecules,that regulate gene expression.,Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,,microRNAs can vary depending on internal,and environmental conditions at any given time,,telling us which genes are actively nexpressed at that particular moment.,And that is what makes microRNAs,such a promising biomarker for cancer,,because as you know,,cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.,It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.,Another important thing to consider,is that no two cancers are the same,,but at the microRNA level, there are patterns.,Several scientific studies have shown,that abnormal microRNA expression levels,varies and creates a unique, specific pattern,for each type of cancer,,even at the early stages,,reflecting the progression of the disease,,and whether it's responding to medication,or in remission,,making microRNAs a perfect,,highly sensitive biomarker. 
 However, the problem with microRNAs,is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology,to detect them in a reliable way,,because they are very short sequences of nucleotides,,much smaller than DNA.,And also, all microRNAs arenvery similar to each other,,with just tiny differences.,So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,,extremely similar, extremely small. 
 We believe that we have found a way to do so,,and this is the first time that we've shown it in public.,Let me do a demonstration.,Imagine that next time you go to your doctor,and do your next standard blood test,,a lab technician extracts a total RNA,,which is quite simple today,,and puts it in a standard n96-well plate like this one.,Each well of these plates,has specific biochemistry that we assign,,that is looking for a specific microRNA,,acting like a trap that closes,only when the microRNA is present in the sample,,and when it does, it will shine with green color.,To run the reaction,,you put the plate inside a device like this one,,and then you can put your smartphone on top of it.,If we can have a camera here,so you can see my screen.,A smartphone is a connected computer,and it's also a camera,,good enough for our purpose.,The smartphone is taking pictures,,and when the reaction is over,,it will send the pictures,to our online database for processing,and interpretation.,This entire process lasts around 60 minutes,,but when the process is over,,wells that shine are matched nwith the specific microRNAs,and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast,they shine.,And then, when this entire process is over,,this is what happens.,This chart is showing the specific microRNAs,present in this sample,and how they reacted over time.,Then, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA,of this person's samples,and compare it with existing scientific documentation,that correlates microRNA patterns,with a specific presence of a disease,,this is how pancreatic cancer looks like.,This inside is a real sample,where we just detected pancreatic cancer. 
 (Applause) 
 Another important aspect of this approach,is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,,so we can get results in real time,and analyze them with our contextual information.,If we want to better understand,and decode diseases like cancer,,we need to stop treating them,as acute, isolated episodes,,and consider and measure everything,that affects our health on a permanent basis.,This entire platform is a working prototype.,It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,,a low-cost, 3D-printed device,,and data science,to try to tackle one of humanity's ntoughest challenges.,Since we believe early cancer detection,should really be democratized,,this entire solution costs at least 50 times less,than current available methods,,and we know that the community can help us,accelerate this even more,,so we're making the design of the device,open-source. 
 (Applause) 
 Let me say very clearly,that we are at the very early stages,,but so far, we have been able,to successfully identify the microRNA pattern,of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,,breast cancer and hepatic cancer.,And currently, we're doing a clinical trial,in collaboration with thenGerman Cancer Research Center,with 200 women for breast cancer. 
 (Applause),This is the single non-invasive,,accurate and affordable test,that has the potential to dramatically change,how cancer procedures and diagnostics,have been done.,Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns,in your blood at any given time,,you don't need to knownwhich cancer you're looking for.,You don't need to have any symptoms.,You only need one milliliter of blood,and a relatively simple array of tools. 
 Today, cancer detection happens mainly,when symptoms appear.,That is, at stage 3 or 4,,and I believe that is too late.,It is too expensive for our families.,It is too expensive for humanity.,We cannot lose the war against cancer.,It not only costs us billions of dollars,,but it also costs us the people we love.,Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely,and going through this processnwith a very positive attitude.,However, I want fights like this,to become very rare.,I want to see the day,when cancer is treated easily,because it can be routinely diagnosed,at the very early stages,,and I'm certain,that in the very near future,,because of this,and other breakthroughs that we are seeing,every day in the life sciences,,the way we see cancer,will radically change.,It will give us the chance of detecting it early,,understanding it better,,and finding a cure. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)When you grow up in a developing countrynlike India, as I did,,you instantly learn to get more valuenfrom limited resources,and find creative ways to reusenwhat you already have.,Take Mansukh Prajapati,na potter in India.,He has created a fridgenmade entirely of clay,that consumes no electricity.,He can keep fruits and vegetablesnfresh for many days.,That's a cool invention, literally.,In Africa, if you run out ofnyour cell phone battery, don't panic.,You will find somenresourceful entrepreneurs,who can recharge your ncell phone using bicycles.,And since we are in South America,,let's go to Lima in Peru,,a region with high humidity,that receives only one inchnof rainfall each year.,An engineering college in Limandesigned a giant advertising billboard,that absorbs air humiditynand converts it into purified water,,generating over 90 litersnof water every day.,The Peruvians are amazing.,They can literally createnwater out of thin air. 
 For the past seven years,,I have met and studiednhundreds of entrepreneurs,in India, China, Africa and South America,nand they keep amazing me.,Many of them did not go to school.,They don't invent stuff in big R&D labs.,The street is the lab.,Why do they do that?,Because they don't have the kindnof basic resources we take for granted,,like capital and energy,,and basic servicesnlike healthcare and education,are also scarce in those regions.,When external resources are scarce,nyou have to go within yourself,to tap the most abundantnresource, human ingenuity,,and use that ingenuity to find clever waysnto solve problems with limited resources. 
 In India, we call it Jugaad.,Jugaad is a Hindi word,that means an improvised fix,na clever solution born in adversity.,Jugaad solutions are notnsophisticated or perfect,,but they create more value at lower cost.,For me, the entrepreneursnwho will create Jugaad solutions,are like alchemists.,They can magically transformnadversity into opportunity,,and turn something of less valueninto something of high value.,In other words, they mastered the artnof doing more with less,,which is the essence of frugal innovation. 
 Frugal innovation is the ability nto create more economic and social value,using fewer resources.,Frugal innovation is not about making do;nit's about making things better.,Now I want to show you how,nacross emerging markets,,entrepreneurs and companies are adopting nfrugal innovation on a larger scale,to cost-effectively deliver healthcarenand energy to billions of people,who may have little incomenbut very high aspirations. 
 Let's first go to China,,where the country's largestnI.T. service provider, Neusoft,,has developed a telemedicine solution,to help doctors in citiesnremotely treat old and poor patients,in Chinese villages.,This solution is based onnsimple-to-use medical devices,that less qualified health workersnlike nurses can use in rural clinics.,China desperately needsnthese frugal medical solutions,because by 2050 it will be homento over half a billion senior citizens. 
 Now let's go to Kenya,,a country where half the populationnuses M-Pesa, a mobile payment solution.,This is a great solutionnfor the African continent,because 80 percent of Africansndon't have a bank account,,but what is exciting is that M-Pesanis now becoming the source,of other disruptive business modelsnin sectors like energy.,Take M-KOPA, the home solar solutionnthat comes literally in a box,that has a solar rooftop panel,nthree LED lights,,a solar radio, and a cell phone charger.,The whole kit, though, costs 200 dollars,nwhich is too expensive for most Kenyans,,and this is where mobile telephonyncan make the solution more affordable.,Today, you can buy this kit by makingnan initial deposit of just 35 dollars,,and then pay off the rest by makingna daily micro-payment of 45 cents,using your mobile phone.,Once you've made 365 micro-payments,nthe system is unlocked,,and you own the product and you start nreceiving clean, free electricity.,This is an amazing solution for Kenya,,where 70 percent of peoplenlive off the grid.,This shows that with frugal innovation,what matters is that you take what isnmost abundant, mobile connectivity,,to deal with what is scarce,nwhich is energy. 
 With frugal innovation,nthe global South is actually catching up,and in some cases neven leap-frogging the North.,Instead of building expensive hospitals,nChina is using telemedicine,to cost-effectively treatnmillions of patients,,and Africa, instead of buildingnbanks and electricity grids,,is going straight to mobile paymentsnand distributed clean energy. 
 Frugal innovation is diametrically opposednto the way we innovate in the North.,I live in Silicon Valley,,where we keep chasingnthe next big technology thing.,Think of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.,Companies in the West spendnbillions of dollars investing in R&D,,and use tons of natural resourcesnto create ever more complex products,,to differentiate their brandsnfrom competition,,and they charge customersnmore money for new features.,So the conventional business model nin the West is more for more.,But sadly, this more for more modelnis running out of gas, for three reasons:,First, a big portionnof customers in the West,because of the diminishingnpurchasing power,,can no longer affordnthese expensive products.,Second, we are running out ofnnatural water and oil.,In California, where I live,nwater scarcity is becoming a big problem.,And third, most importantly,,because of the growing income disparity,between the rich nand the middle class in the West,,there is a big disconnectnbetween existing products and services,and basic needs of customers.,Do you know that today,,there are over 70 million Americansntoday who are underbanked,,because existing banking services,are not designed to addressntheir basic needs. 
 The prolonged economic crisisnin the West is making people think,that they are about to losenthe high standard of living,and face deprivation.,I believe that the only way we can sustainngrowth and prosperity in the West,is if we learn to do more with less. 
 The good news is,nthat's starting to happen.,Several Western companiesnare now adopting frugal innovation,to create affordable productsnfor Western consumers.,Let me give you two examples. 
 When I first saw this building,,I told myself it's somenkind of postmodern house.,Actually, it's a small manufacturing plantnset up by Grameen Danone,,a joint venture between nGrameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus,and the food multinational Danone,to make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh.,This factory is 10 percent the sizenof existing Danone factories,and cost much less to build.,I guess you can call it a low-fat factory.,Now this factory, unlike Western factoriesnthat are highly automated,,relies a lot on manual processes in order nto generate jobs for local communities.,Danone was so inspired by this model,that combines economic efficiencynand social sustainability,,they are planning to roll it outnin other parts of the world as well. 
 Now, when you see this example,,you might be thinking, "Well,nfrugal innovation is low tech.",Actually, no.,Frugal innovation is alsonabout making high tech,more affordable and morenaccessible to more people.,Let me give you an example. 
 In China, the R&D engineersnof Siemens Healthcare,have designed a C.T. scannernthat is easy enough to be used,by less qualified health workers,nlike nurses and technicians.,This device can scannmore patients on a daily basis,,and yet consumes less energy,,which is great for hospitals,nbut it's also great for patients,because it reduces the costnof treatment by 30 percent,and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent.,This solution was initially designednfor the Chinese market,,but now it's selling like hotcakesnin the U.S. and Europe,,where hospitals are pressurednto deliver quality care at lower cost. 
 But the frugal innovation revolution,in the West is actually lednby creative entrepreneurs,who are coming up with amazing solutions,to address basic needsnin the U.S. and Europe.,Let me quickly give younthree examples of startups,that personally inspire me.,The first one happens to be launchednby my neighbor in Silicon Valley.,It's called gThrive.,They make these wireless sensorsndesigned like plastic rulers,that farmers can sticknin different parts of the field,and start collecting detailedninformation like soil conditions.,This dynamic data allows farmersnto optimize use of water energy,while improving qualitynof the products and the yields,,which is a great solution for California,nwhich faces major water shortage.,It pays for itself within one year. 
 Second example is Be-Bound,nalso in Silicon Valley,,that enables younto connect to the Internet,even in no-bandwidth areasnwhere there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G.,How do they do that?,They simply use SMS, a basic technology,nbut that happens to be the most reliable,and most widely availablenaround the world.,Three billion people today with ncell phones can't access the Internet.,This solution can connect themnto the Internet in a frugal way. 
 And in France, there isna startup calle Compte Nickel,,which is revolutionizingnthe banking sector.,It allows thousands of peoplento walk into a Mom and Pop store,and in just five minutes activatenthe service that gives them two products:,an international bank account numbernand an international debit card.,They charge a flat annual nmaintenance fee of just 20 Euros.,That means you can donall banking transactions --,send and receive money,npay with your debit card --,all with no additional charge.,This is what I call low-cost bankingnwithout the bank.,Amazingly, 75 percentnof the customers using this service,are the middle-class Frenchnwho can't afford high banking fees. 
 Now, I talked about frugal innovation,ninitially pioneered in the South,,now being adopted in the North.,Ultimately, we would like to see,developed countriesnand developing countries,come together and co-createnfrugal solutions,that benefit the entire humanity.,The exciting news isnthat's starting to happen.,Let's go to Nairobi to find that out. 
 Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams.,When I first saw them,nI thought, "Holy cow.",Literally, because you have to dodge cowsnas well when you drive in Nairobi.,To ease the situation,,the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenyanare piloting a solution called Megaffic,,which initially was designednby the Japanese engineers.,Unlike in the West, Megafficndoesn't rely on roadside sensors,,which are very expensivento install in Nairobi.,Instead they process images, traffic data,,collected from a small number ofnlow-resolution webcams in Nairobi streets,,and then they use analytic softwarento predict congestion points,,and they can SMS driversnalternate routes to take.,Granted, Megaffic is notnas sexy as self-driving cars,,but it promises to take Nairobi driversnfrom point A to point B,at least 20 percent faster.,And earlier this year, UCLA Healthnlaunched its Global Lab for Innovation,,which seeks to identify frugal healthcare nsolutions anywhere in the world,that will be at least 20 percent cheapernthan existing solutions in the U.S.,and yet more effective.,It also tries to bring togetherninnovators from North and South,to cocreate affordable healthcarensolutions for all of humanity. 
 I gave tons of examples of frugalninnovators from around the world,,but the question is, how do you go aboutnadopting frugal innovation?,Well, I gleaned out three principlesnfrom frugal innovators around the world,that I want to share with you,that you can applynin your own organization,to do more with less. 
 The first principle is: Keep it simple.,Don't create solutionsnto impress customers.,Make them easy enough to usenand widely accessible,,like the C.T. scanner we saw in China. 
 Second principle: nDo not reinvent the wheel.,Try to leverage existing resourcesnand assets that are widely available,,like using mobile telephonynto offer clean energy,or Mom and Pop storesnto offer banking services. 
 Third principle is:nThink and act horizontally.,Companies tend to scale up vertically,by centralizing operationsnin big factories and warehouses,,but if you want to be agile and dealnwith immense customer diversity,,you need to scale out horizontallynusing a distributed supply chain,with smaller manufacturingnand distribution units,,like Grameen Bank has shown. 
 The South pioneered frugal innovationnout of sheer necessity.,The North is now learning to donmore and better with less,as it faces resource constraints.,As an Indian-born French nationalnwho lives in the United States,,my hope is that we transcendnthis artificial North-South divide,so that we can harnessnthe collective ingenuity,of innovators from around the world,to cocreate frugal solutions,that will improve the quality of lifenof everyone in the world,,while preserving our precious planet. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Vincent Moon: How can we use computers,,cameras, microphones to represent the world,in an alternative way,,as much as possible?,How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet,to create a new form of cinema?,And actually, why do we record? 
 Well, it is with such simple questions in mind,that I started to make films 10 years ago,,first with a friend, Christophe Abric.,He had a website, La Blogothèque,,dedicated to independent music.,We were crazy about music.,We wanted to represent nmusic in a different way,,to film the music we love,nthe musicians we admired,,as much as possible, far nfrom the music industry,and far from the cliches attached to it.,We started to publish every week,sessions on the Internet.,We are going to see a few extracts now. 
 From Grizzly Bear in the shower,to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe.,From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower,to Tom Jones in his nhotel room in New York.,From Arcade Fire in an elevator,in the Olympia,to Beirut going downna staircase in Brooklyn.,From R.E.M. in a car,to The National around a table at night,in the south of France.,From Bon Iver playing with some friends,in an apartment in Montmartre,to Yeasayer having a long night,,and many, many, many more,unknown or very famous bands. 
 We published all those films,for free on the Internet,,and we wanted to share,all those films and represent music,in a different way.,We wanted to create nanother type of intimacy,using all those new technologies.,At the time, 10 years ago actually,,there was no such project on the Internet,,and I guess that's why the project we nwere making, the Take Away Shows,,got quite successful,,reaching millions of viewers. 
 After a while, I got a bit —,I wanted to go somewhere else.,I felt the need to travel andnto discover some other music,,to explore the world,,going to other corners,,and actually it was also,this idea of nomadic cinema,nsort of, that I had in mind.,How could the use of new technologies nand the road fit together?,How could I edit my films in a bus,crossing the Andes?,So I went on five-year travels,around the globe.,I started at the time in the digital film nand music label collection Petites Planètes,,which was also an homage tonFrench filmmaker Chris Marker.,We're going to see now a few more extracts,of those new films. 
 From the tecno brega diva ofnnorthern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos,to a female ensemble in Chechnya.,From experimental electronic music nin Singapore with One Man Nation,to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singingnon his rooftop in São Paolo.,From The Bambir, the great nrock band from Armenia,to some traditional songs,in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia.,From White Shoes, a great retro npop band from Jakarta, Indonesia,to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary nband from Kiev, Ukraine.,From Tomi Lebrero,and his bandoneon and his friendsnin Buenos Aires, Argentina,,to many other places,and musicians around the world. 
 My desire was to make it as a trek.,To do all those films,,it would have been impossible,with a big company behind me,,with a structure or anything.,I was traveling alone with a backpack —,computer, camera, microphones in it.,Alone, actually, but njust with local people,,meeting my team, which was absolutely not,professional people, on the spot there,,going from one place to another,and to make cinema as a trek.,I really believed that cinema could be,this very simple thing:,I want to make a film and you're going nto give me a place to stay for the night.,I give you a moment of cinemanand you offer me a capirinha.,Well, or other drinks,,depending on where you are. 
 In Peru, they drink pisco sour.,Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually,,I had no idea about what I would do there.,And I just had one phone number, actually,,of one person.,Three months later,,after traveling all around the ncountry, I had recorded 33 films,,only with the help of local people,,only with the help of people,that I was asking all the ntime the same question:,What is important to record here today?,By living in such a way,,by working without any structure,,I was able to react to the moment,and to decide, oh, this is nimportant to make now.,This is important to nrecord that whole person.,This is important to create this exchange.,When I went to Chechnya,,the first person I met,looked at me and was like,,"What are you doing here?,Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics?,What kind of problems nare you going to study?",Well, I was there to research,on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually —,incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya,,which is absolutely unknown noutside of the region.,As soon as people understood,that I would give them those films —,I would publish them online for freenunder a Creative Commons license,,but I would also really ngive them to the people,and I would let them do nwhat they want with it.,I just want to represent nthem in a beautiful light.,I just want to portray them in a way that,their grandchildren are goingnto look at their grandfather,,and they're going to be like,,"Whoa, my grandfather is as ncool as Beyoncé." (Laughter),It's a really important thing.,(Applause) 
 It's really important,,because that's the way,people are going to look differently at ntheir own culture, at their own land.,They're going to think about it differently.,It may be a way to maintain na certain diversity.,Why you will record?,Hmm. There's a really good quote,by American thinker Hakim Bey,which says, "Every recording,is a tombstone of a live performance.",It's a really good nsentence to keep in mind,nowadays in an era saturated by images.,What's the point of that?,Where do we go with it?,I was researching. I was still nkeeping this idea in mind:,What's the point?,I was researching on music, trying to pull,,trying to get closer to a certain origin of it.,Where is this all coming from?,I am French. I had no idea about,what I would discover, nwhich is a very simple thing:,Everything was sacred, at first,,and music was spiritual healing.,How could I use my camera,,my little tool, to get closer,and maybe not only capture the trance,but find an equivalent, na cine-trance, maybe,,something in complete harmony,with the people? 
 That is now my new research I'm doing,on spirituality, on new nspirits around the world.,Maybe a few more extracts now.,From the Tana Toraja nfuneral ritual in Indonesia,to an Easter ceremony nin the north of Ethiopia.,From jathilan, a popular trance ritual,on the island of Java,,to Umbanda in the north of Brazil.,The Sufi rituals of Chechnya,to a mass in the holiest nchurch of Armenia.,Some Sufi songs in Harar,,the holy city of Ethiopia,,to an ayahuasca ceremony,deep in the Amazon of nPeru with the Shipibo.,Then to my new project, nthe one I'm doing now,here in Brazil, named "Híbridos.",I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon.,It's research on the new nspiritualities all around the country.,This is my quest, my own little quest nof what I call experimental ethnography,,trying to hybrid all nthose different genres,,trying to regain a certain complexity. 
 Why do we record?,I was still there.,I really believe cinema teaches us to see.,The way we show the world,is going to change the nway we see this world,,and we live in a moment where the mass media,are doing a terrible, terrible job,at representing the world:,violence, extremists,,only spectacular events,,only simplifications of everyday life.,I think we are recording,to regain a certain complexity.,To reinvent life today,,we have to make new forms of images.,And it's very simple. 
 Muito obrigado. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.,Merci. We have to prepare fornthe following performance,,and I have a question for you,nand the question is this:,You show up in places like the nones you just have shown us,,and you are carrying a camera,and I assume that you are welcome,but you are not always absolutely welcome.,You walk into sacred rituals,,private moments in a village, a town,,a group of people.,How do you break the barrier,when you show up with a lens? 
 VM: I think you break it with your body,,more than with your knowledge.,That's what it taught me to travel,,to trust the memory of the body,more than the memory of the brain.,The respect is stepping forward,,not stepping backward, and I really think that,by engaging your body in thenmoment, in the ceremony,,in the places, people welcome you,and understand your energy. 
 BG: You told me that most of the videos,you have made are nactually one single shot.,You don't do much editing.,I mean, you edited the ones for us,at the beginning of the sessionsnbecause of the length, etc.,Otherwise, you just go in and capture,whatever happens in front of your eyes,without much planning, and so is that the case?,It's correct? 
 VM: My idea is that I think that,as long as we don't cut, in a way,,as long as we let the viewer watch,,more and more viewers nare going to feel closer,,are going to get closer to the moment,,to that moment and to that place.,I really think of that as a matter nof respecting the viewer,,to not cut all the time from one place to another,,to just let the time go. 
 BG: Tell me in a few words nabout your new project,,"Híbridos," here in Brazil.,Just before coming to nTEDGlobal, you have actually,been traveling around nthe country for that.,Tell us a couple of things. 
 VM: "Híbridos" is — nI really believe Brazil,,far from the cliches, is the greatestnreligious country in the world,,the greatest country nin terms of spirituality,and in experimentations in spiritualities.,And it's a big project I'm ndoing over this year,,which is researching in veryndifferent regions of Brazil,,in very different forms of cults,,and trying to understand nhow people live together,with spirituality nowadays. 
 BG: The man who is going to nappear onstage momentarily,,and Vincent's going to introduce him,,is one of the subjects of none of his past videos.,When did you do a video with him? 
 VM: I guess four years ago,,four years in my first travel. 
 BG: So it was one of nyour first ones in Brazil.,VM: It was amongst the nfirst ones in Brazil, yeah.,I shot the film in Recife,,in the place where he is from. 
 BG: So let's introduce him. nWho are we waiting for? 
 VM: I'll just make it very short.,It's a very great honor for nme to welcome onstage,one of the greatest Brazilian nmusicians of all time.,Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos. 
 BG: Naná Vasconcelos! 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 Naná Vasconcelos: Let's go to the jungle. 
 (Applause)When I was 14 years old,nI was interested in science --,fascinated by it,nexcited to learn about it.,And I had a high school science teachernwho would say to the class,,"The girls don't have to listen to this." 
 Encouraging, yes. 
 (Laughter) 
 I chose not to listen --nbut to that statement alone. 
 So let me take younto the Andes mountains in Chile,,500 kilometers, 300 milesnnortheast of Santiago.,It's very remote, it's very drynand it's very beautiful.,And there's not much there.,There are condors, there are tarantulas,,and at night, when the light dims,,it reveals one of the darkestnskies on Earth.,It's kind of a magic place, the mountain.,It's a wonderful combinationnof very remote mountaintop,with exquisitely sophisticated technology. 
 And our ancestors, for as longnas there's been recorded history,,have looked at the night skynand pondered the nature of our existence.,And we're no exception, our generation.,The only difficulty isnthat the night sky now is blocked,by the glare of city lights.,And so astronomers gonto these very remote mountaintops,to view and to study the cosmos.,So telescopesnare our window to the cosmos. 
 It's no exaggeration to say thatnthe Southern Hemisphere is going to be,the future of astronomynfor the 21st century.,We have an arraynof existing telescopes already,,in the Andes mountains in Chile,,and that's soon to be joined by a reallynsensational array of new capability.,There will be two international groupsnthat are going to be building,giant telescopes, sensitivento optical radiation, as our eyes are.,There will be a survey telescope,that will be scanning the skynevery few nights.,There will be radio telescopes,,sensitive to long-wavelengthnradio radiation.,And then there will bentelescopes in space.,There'll be a successornto the Hubble Space Telescope;,it's called the James Webb Telescope,,and it will be launched in 2018.,There'll be a satellite called TESS,that will discover planetsnoutside of our solar system. 
 For the last decade,nI've been leading a group --,a consortium -- international group,,to build what will be, when it's finished,,the largest opticalntelescope in existence.,It's called the GiantnMagellan Telescope, or GMT.,This telescope is going to have mirrorsnthat are 8.4 meters in diameter --,each of the mirrors.,That's almost 27 feet.,So it dwarfs this stage -- maybenout to the fourth row in this audience.,Each of the seven mirrorsnin this telescope,will be almost 27 feet in diameter.,Together, the seven mirrorsnin this telescope will comprise,80 feet in diameter.,So, essentially the sizenof this entire auditorium.,The whole telescope will standnabout 43 meters high,,and again, being in Rio,,some of you have been to seenthe statue of the giant Christ.,The scale is comparable in height;,in fact, it's smallernthan this telescope will be.,It's comparable to the sizenof the Statue of Liberty.,And it's going to be housednin an enclosure that's 22 stories --,60 meters high.,But it's an unusual buildingnto protect this telescope.,It will have open windows to the sky,,be able to point and look at the sky,,and it will actually rotate on a base --,2,000 tons of rotating building. 
 The Giant Magellan Telescopenwill have 10 times the resolution,of the Hubble Space Telescope.,It will be 20 million timesnmore sensitive than the human eye.,And it may, for the first time ever,nbe capable of finding life on planets,outside of our solar system.,It's going to allow us to look backnat the first light in the universe --,literally, the dawn of the cosmos.,The cosmic dawn.,It's a telescope that'sngoing to allow us to peer back,,witness galaxies as they werenwhen they were actually assembling,,the first black holes in the universe,nthe first galaxies. 
 Now, for thousands of years,nwe have been studying the cosmos,,we've been wonderingnabout our place in the universe.,The ancient Greeks told us,that the Earth was the centernof the universe.,Five hundred years ago,nCopernicus displaced the Earth,,and put the Sunnat the heart of the cosmos.,And as we've learned over the centuries,,since Galileo Galilei,nthe Italian scientist,,first turned, in that time, a two-inch,nvery small telescope, to the sky,,every time we have builtnlarger telescopes,,we have learned somethingnabout the universe;,we've made discoveries, without exception.,We've learned in the 20th centurynthat the universe is expanding,and that our own solar systemnis not at the center of that expansion.,We know now that the universenis made of about 100 billion galaxies,that are visible to us,,and each one of those galaxiesnhas 100 billion stars within it. 
 So we're looking nownat the deepest image of the cosmos,that's ever been taken.,It was taken usingnthe Hubble Space Telescope,,and by pointing the telescope at whatnwas previously a blank region of sky,,before the launch of Hubble.,And if you can imagine this tiny area,,it's only one-fiftiethnof the size of the full moon.,So, if you can imagine the full moon.,And there are now 10,000 galaxiesnvisible within that image.,And the faintness of those imagesnand the tiny size is only a result,of the fact that those galaxiesnare so far away, the vast distances.,And each of those galaxiesnmay contain within it,a few billion or even hundredsnof billions of individual stars.,Telescopes are like time machines.,So the farther back we look in space,nthe further back we see in time.,And they're like light buckets --nliterally, they collect light.,So larger the bucket,nthe larger the mirror we have,,the more light we can see,nand the farther back we can view. 
 So, we've learned in the last century,that there are exotic objectsnin the universe -- black holes.,We've even learnednthat there's dark matter and dark energy,that we can't see.,So you're looking nownat an actual image of dark matter. 
 (Laughter) 
 You got it. Not all audiences get that. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the way we infernthe presence of dark matter --,we can't see it -- but there'snan unmistakable tug, due to gravity.,We now can look out,nwe see this sea of galaxies,in a universe that's expanding. 
 What I do myself is to measurenthe expansion of the universe,,and one of the projectsnthat I carried out in the 1990s,used the Hubble Space Telescope to measurenhow fast the universe is expanding.,We can now trace back to 14 billion years.,We've learned over timenthat stars have individual histories;,that is, they have birth,nthey have middle ages,and some of themneven have dramatic deaths.,So the embers from those stars actuallynthen form the new stars that we see,,most of which turn out to havenplanets going around them. 
 And one of the really surprising resultsnin the last 20 years,has been the discoverynof other planets going around other stars.,These are called exoplanets.,And until 1995, we didn't even knownthe existence of any other planets,,other than going around our own sun.,But now, there are almost 2,000nother planets orbiting other stars,that we can now detect,nmeasure masses for.,There are 500 of thosenthat are multiple-planet systems.,And there are 4,000 --nand still counting -- other candidates,for planets orbiting other stars.,They come in a bewildering varietynof different kinds.,There are Jupiter-likenplanets that are hot,,there are other planets that are icy,nthere are water worlds,and there are rocky planetsnlike the Earth, so-called "super-Earths,",and there have even been planetsnthat have been speculated diamond worlds. 
 So we know there's at least one planet,nour own Earth, in which there is life.,We've even found planetsnthat are orbiting two stars.,That's no longer the provincenof science fiction.,So around our own planet,nwe know there's life,,we've developed a complex life,nwe now can question our own origins.,And given all that we've discovered,nthe overwhelming numbers now suggest,that there may be millions, perhaps --nmaybe even hundreds of millions --,of other [planets]nthat are close enough --,just the right distance from their starsnthat they're orbiting --,to have the existence of liquid waternand maybe could potentially support life.,So we marvel now at those odds,nthe overwhelming odds,,and the amazing thingnis that within the next decade,,the GMT may be able to take spectranof the atmospheres of those planets,,and determine whether or notnthey have the potential for life. 
 So, what is the GMT project?,It's an international project.,It includes Australia, South Korea,nand I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,,that the newest partnernin our telescope is Brazil. 
 (Applause) 
 It also includes a number of institutionsnacross the United States,,including Harvard University,,the Smithsoniannand the Carnegie Institutions,,and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago,nTexas-Austin and Texas A&M University.,It also involves Chile. 
 So, the making of the mirrorsnin this telescope is also fascinating,in its own right.,Take chunks of glass, melt themnin a furnace that is itself rotating.,This happens underneathnthe football stadium,at the University of Arizona.,It's tucked away under 52,000 seats.,Nobody know it's happening.,And there's essentiallyna rotating cauldron.,The mirrors are castnand they're cooled very slowly,,and then they're polishednto an exquisite precision.,And so, if you thinknabout the precision of these mirrors,,the bumps on the mirror,nover the entire 27 feet,,amount to lessnthan one-millionth of an inch.,So, can you visualize that?,Ow! 
 (Laughter) 
 That's one five-thousandthsnof the width of one of my hairs,,over this entire 27 feet.,It's a spectacular achievement.,It's what allows us to haventhe precision that we will have. 
 So, what does that precision buy us?,So the GMT, if you can imagine --,if I were to hold up a coin,nwhich I just happen to have,,and I look at the face of that coin,nI can see from here,the writing on the coin;nI can see the face on that coin.,My guess that even in the front row,nyou can't see that.,But if we were to turnnthe Giant Magellan Telescope,,all 80-feet diameternthat we see in this auditorium,,and point it 200 miles away,,if I were standing in São Paulo,nwe could resolve the face of this coin.,That's the extraordinary resolutionnand power of this telescope.,And if we were -- 
 (Applause) 
 If an astronaut went up to the Moon,na quarter of a million miles away,,and lit a candle -- a single candle --,then we would be ablento detect it, using the GMT.,Quite extraordinary. 
 This is a simulated imagenof a cluster in a nearby galaxy.,"Nearby" is astronomical,nit's all relative.,It's tens of millions of light-years away.,This is what this cluster would look like.,So look at those four bright objects,,and now lets compare it with a cameranon the Hubble Space Telescope.,You can see faint detailnthat starts to come through.,And now finally -- and look how dramaticnthis is -- this is what the GMT will see.,So, keep your eyes on thosenbright images again.,This is what we see on one of the mostnpowerful existing telescopes on the Earth,,and this, again, what the GMT will see.,Extraordinary precision. 
 So, where are we?,We have now leveled the topnof the mountaintop in Chile.,We blasted that off.,We've tested and polishednthe first mirror.,We've cast the secondnand the third mirrors.,And we're about to cast the fourth mirror.,We had a series of reviews this year,,international panelsnthat came in and reviewed us,,and said, "You're readynto go to construction.",And so we plan on building this telescopenwith the first four mirrors.,We want to get on the air quickly,nand be taking science data --,what we astronomers calln"first light," in 2021.,And the full telescope will be finishednin the middle of the next decade,,with all seven mirrors. 
 So we're now poised to look backnat the distant universe,,the cosmic dawn.,We'll be able to study other planetsnin exquisite detail. 
 But for me, one of the mostnexciting things about building the GMT,is the opportunitynto actually discover something,that we don't know about --nthat we can't even imagine at this point,,something completely new.,And my hope is that with the constructionnof this and other facilities,,that many young women and mennwill be inspired to reach for the stars. 
 Thank you very much.,Obrigado. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.,Stay with me, becausenI have a question for you.,You mentioned different facilities.,So the Magellan Telescope is going up,nbut also ALMA and others in Chile,and elsewhere, including in Hawaii.,Is it about cooperationnand complementarity, or about competition?,I know there's competition in termsnof funding, but what about the science? 
 Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science,nthey're very complementary.,The telescopes that are in space,nthe telescopes on the ground,,telescopes with differentnwavelength capability,,telescopes even that are similar,nbut different instruments --,they will all look at different partsnof the questions that we're asking.,So when we discover other planets,nwe'll be able to test those observations,,we'll be able to measure the atmospheres,,be able to look in spacenwith very high resolution.,So, they're very complementary.,You're right aboutnthe funding, we compete;,but scientifically,nit's very complementary. 
 BG: Wendy, thank you very muchnfor coming to TEDGlobal. 
 WF: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was raised by lesbians in the mountains,,and I sort of came like a forest gnomento New York City a while back.,(Laughter),Really messed with my head,nbut I'll get into that later. 
 I'll start with whennI was eight years old.,I took a wood box,,and I buried a dollar bill, a pennand a fork inside this box in Colorado.,And I thought some strange humanoidsnor aliens in 500 years would find this box,and learn about the waynour species exchanged ideas,,maybe how we ate our spaghetti.,I really didn't know.,Anyway, this is kind of funny,,because here I am, 30 years later,nand I'm still making boxes. 
 Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --,I like to hike and surfnand do all that weird stuff,,and I was making a collage for my ma.,And I took a dictionarynand I ripped it up,,and I made it into a sortnof Agnes Martin grid,,and I poured resin all over itnand a bee got stuck.,Now, she's afraid of beesnand she's allergic to them,,so I poured more resin on the canvas,nthinking I could hide it or something.,Instead, the opposite happened:,It sort of created a magnification,,like a magnifying glass,non the dictionary text. 
 So what did I do? I built more boxes.,This time, I started puttingnelectronics, frogs,,strange bottles I'd find in the street --nanything I could find --,because I was alwaysnfinding things my whole life,,and trying to make relationshipsnand tell stories between these objects.,So I started drawing around the objects,,and I realized: Holy moly,nI can draw in space!,I can make free-floating lines,,like the way you would drawnaround a dead body at a crime scene.,So I took the objects out,,and I created my own taxonomynof invented specimens.,First, botanical --nwhich you can kind of get a sense of.,Then I made somenweird insects and creatures.,It was really fun; I was justndrawing on the layers of resin. 
 And it was cool, because I was actuallynstarting to have shows and stuff,,I was making some money,nI could take my girlfriend for dinner,,and like, go to Sizzler.,It was some good shit, man.,(Laughter) 
 At some point, I got up to the human form,,life-size resin sculpturesnwith drawings of humans inside the layers.,This was great, except for one thing:,I was going to die.,I didn't know what to do,nbecause the resin was going to kill me.,And I went to bed every nightnthinking about it. 
 So I tried using glass.,I started drawing on the layers of glass,,almost like if you drew on a window,nthen you put another window,,and another window, and you hadnall these windows together,that made a three-dimensional composition.,And this really worked,nbecause I could stop using the resin. 
 So I did this for years,,which culminated in a very large work,nwhich I call "The Triptych.","The Triptych" was largely inspired,by Hieronymus Bosch'sn"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,",which is a paintingnin the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.,Do you guys know this painting?,Good, it's a cool painting.,It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.,So, "The Triptych."nI'll walk you through this piece.,It weighs 24,000 pounds.,It's 18 feet long.,It's double-sided,nso it's 36 feet of composition.,It's kind of weird.,Well, that's the blood fountain.,(Laughter),To the left, you havenJesus and the locusts.,There's a cave,where all these animal-headed creaturesntravel between two worlds.,They go from the representational world,,to this analog-mesh underworld,nwhere they're hiding.,This is where the animal-headed creaturesnare by the lighthouse,,and they're all about to commitnmass suicide into the ocean.,The ocean is made upnof thousands of elements.,This is a bird godntied up to a battleship.,(Laughter),Billy Graham is in the ocean;,the Horizon from the oil spill;nWaldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter --,there's all kinds of weird stuffnthat you can find,if you look really hard, in the ocean.,Anyway, this is a lady creature.,She's coming out of the ocean,nand she's spitting oil into one hand,and she has cloudsncoming out of her other hand.,Her hands are like scales,,and she has the mythological referencenof the Earth and cosmos in balance. 
 So that's one side of "The Triptych.",It's a little narrative thing.,That's her hand that she's spitting into.,And then, when you go to the other side,,she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,,and she's spitting cloudsnout of her trunk.,Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent'sntail that connects "The Triptych.",Anyway, her tail catches on firenfrom the back of the volcano.,(Laughter),I don't know why that happened. 
 (Laughter) 
 That happens, you know.,Her tail terminatesnin a cycloptic eyeball,,made out of 1986 terrorist cards.,Have you guys seen those?,They were made in the 1980's,nthey're like baseball cards of terrorists.,Way ahead of their time. 
 (Laughter) 
 That will bring you to my latest project.,I'm in the middle of two projects:,One's called "Psychogeographies.",It's about a six-year projectnto make 100 of these humans.,Each one is an archive of our culture,,through our ripped-up media and matter,,whether it's encyclopediasnor dictionaries or magazines.,But each one acts as a sort of an archivenin the shape of a human,,and they travel in groupsnof 20, 4, or 12 at a time.,They're like cells --nthey come together, they divide.,And you kind of walk through them.nIt's taking me years.,Each one is basicallyna 3,000-pound microscope slide,with a human stuck inside. 
 This one has a little cave in his chest.,That's his head; there's the chest,nyou can kind of see the beginning.,I'm going to go down the body for you:,There's a waterfallncoming out of his chest,,covering his penis -- or not-penis,nor whatever it is,,a kind of androgynous thing.,I'll take you quickly through these works,,because I can't explain them for too long.,There are the layers,nyou can kind of see it.,That's a body getting split in half.,This one has two heads,,and it's communicatingnbetween the two heads.,You can see the pills coming out,,going into one headnfrom this weird statue.,There's a little forest sceneninside the chest cavity.,Can you see that? 
 Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,,like the boxes we're in.,This box we're in,nthe solar system is a box.,This brings you to my latest box.,It's a brick box.nIt's called Pioneer Works. 
 (Cheers) 
 Inside of this box is a physicist,,a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,,a writer, a radio station,na museum, a school,,a publishing arm to disseminate allnthe content we make there into the world;,a garden.,We shake this box up,,and all these people kind of startnhitting each other like particles. 
 And I think that's the waynyou change the world.,You redefine your insidesnand the box that you're living in.,And you come together to realizenthat we're all in this together,,that this delusion of difference --,this idea of countries, of borders,nof religion -- doesn't work.,We're all really made upnof the same stuff, in the same box.,And if we don't startnexchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,,we're all going to die real soon. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Let me tell you a story,about a little girl named Naghma.,Naghma lived in a refugee camp,with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters.,Every morning, her father would wake up,in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work,,and on a good month he would earn 50 dollars.,The winter was very harsh,,and unfortunately, Naghma's brother died,and her mother became very ill.,In desperation, her father went to a neighbor,to borrow 2,500 dollars.,After several months of waiting,,the neighbor became very impatient,,and he demanded that he be paid back.,Unfortunately, Naghma'snfather didn't have the money,,and so the two men agreed to a jirga.,So simply put, a jirga is a form of mediation,that's used in Afghanistan's ninformal justice system.,It's usually presided over by religious leaders,and village elders,,and jirgas are often used innrural countries like Afghanistan,,where there's deep-seated resentment,against the formal system.,At the jirga, the men sat together,and they decided that the nbest way to satisfy the debt,would be if Naghma marriednthe neighbor's 21-year-old son.,She was six. 
 Now, stories like Naghma's unfortunately,are all too common,,and from the comforts of our home,,we may look at these stories as another,crushing blow to women's rights.,And if you watched Afghanistan on the news,,you may have this view that it's a failed state.,However, Afghanistan does have a legal system,,and while jirgas are built onnlong-standing tribal customs,,even in jirgas, laws are supposed to be followed,,and it goes without saying,that giving a child to satisfy a debt,is not only grossly immoral, it's illegal. 
 In 2008, I went to Afghanistan,for a justice funded program,,and I went there originally non this nine-month program,to train Afghan lawyers.,In that nine months, I went around the country,and I talked to hundreds ofnpeople that were locked up,,and I talked to many businesses,that were also operating in Afghanistan.,And within these conversations,,I started hearing the connections,between the businesses and the people,,and how laws that were meant to protect them,were being underused,,while gross and illegal punitivenmeasures were overused.,And so this put me on a quest for justness,,and what justness means to me,is using laws for their intended purpose,,which is to protect.,The role of laws is to protect.,So as a result, I decided to nopen up a private practice,,and I became the first foreigner to litigate,in Afghan courts.,Throughout this time, I also studied many laws,,I talked to many people,,I read up on many cases,,and I found that the lack of justness,is not just a problem in Afghanistan,,but it's a global problem.,And while I originally shied away from,representing human rights cases,because I was really concerned about how it would,affect me both professionally and personally,,I decided that the need for justness was so great,that I couldn't continue to ignore it.,And so I started representing people like Naghma,pro bono also. 
 Now, since I've been in Afghanistan,and since I've been an attorney for over 10 years,,I've represented from CEOs nof Fortune 500 companies,to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma,,and with much success.,And the reason for my success is very simple:,I work the system from the inside out,and use the laws in the ways,that they're intended to be used. 
 I find that,achieving justness in places like Afghanistan,is difficult, and there's three reasons.,The first reason is that simply put,,people are very uneducated asnto what their legal rights were,,and I find that this is a global problem.,The second issue,is that even with laws on the books,,it's often superseded or ignored,by tribal customs, like in the first jirga,that sold Naghma off.,And the third problem with achieving justness,is that even with good, existing laws on the books,,there aren't people or lawyers nthat are willing to fight,for those laws.,And that's what I do: I use existing laws,,often unused laws,,and I work those to the benefits of my clients.,We all need to create a global culture,of human rights,and be investors in a global nhuman rights economy,,and by working in this mindset,,we can significantly improve justice globally. 
 Now let's get back to Naghma.,Several people heard about this story,,and so they contacted me because they wanted,to pay the $2,500 debt.,And it's not just that simple;,you can't just throw money at this problem,and think that it's going to disappear.,That's not how it works in Afghanistan.,So I told them I'd get involved,,but in order to get involved, nwhat needed to happen,is a second jirga needed to be called,,a jirga of appeals.,And so in order for that to happen,,we needed to get the village elders together,,we needed to get the tribal leaders together,,the religious leaders.,Naghma's father needed to agree,,the neighbor needed to agree,,and also his son needed to agree.,And I thought, if I'm going to nget involved in this thing,,then they also need to agree nthat I preside over it. 
 So, after hours of talking,and tracking them down,,and about 30 cups of tea,,they finally agreed that we could sit down,for a second jirga, and we did.,And what was different about the second jirga,is this time, we put the law at the center of it,,and it was very important for me,that they all understood that Naghma,had a right to be protected.,And at the end of this jirga,,it was ordered by the judge,that the first decision was erased,,and that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,,and we all signed a written order,where all the men acknowledged,that what they did was illegal,,and if they did it again, that nthey would go to prison.,Most —,(Applause),Thanks.,And most importantly,,the engagement was terminated,and Naghma was free.,Protecting Naghma and her right to be free,protects us. 
 Now, with my job, there's above-average,amount of risks that are involved.,I've been temporarily detained.,I've been accused of running a brothel,,accused of being a spy.,I've had a grenade thrown at my office.,It didn't go off, though.,But I find that with my job,,that the rewards far outweigh the risks,,and as many risks as I take,,my clients take far greater risks,,because they have a lot more to lose,if their cases go unheard,,or worse, if they're penalizednfor having me as their lawyer.,With every case that I take,,I realize that as much asnI'm standing behind my clients,,that they're also standing behind me,,and that's what keeps me going. 
 Law as a point of leverage,is crucial in protecting all of us.,Journalists are very vital in making sure,that that information is given to the public.,Too often, we receive information from journalists,but we forget how that information was given.,This picture is a picture of the,British press corps in Afghanistan.,It was taken a couple of yearsnago by my friend David Gill.,According to the Committee to Protect Journalists,,since 2010, there have been nthousands of journalists,who have been threatened, injured,,killed, detained.,Too often, when we get this information,,we forget who it affects,or how that information is given to us.,What many journalists do, nboth foreign and domestic,,is very remarkable, especiallynin places like Afghanistan,,and it's important that we never forget that,,because what they're protecting,is not only our right to receive that information,but also the freedom of the press, which is vital,to a democratic society. 
 Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan.,He works for The New York Times,,and unfortunately, a few months ago,he wrote an article that displeased,people in the government.,As a result, he was temporarily detained,and he was illegally exiled out of the country.,I represent Matt,,and after dealing with the government,,I was able to get legal acknowledgment,that in fact he was illegally exiled,,and that freedom of thenpress does exist in Afghanistan,,and there's consequences if that's not followed.,And I'm happy to say that,as of a few days ago,,the Afghan government,formally invited him back into the country,and they reversed their exile order of him. 
 (Applause) 
 If you censor one journalist, nthen it intimidates others,,and soon nations are silenced.,It's important that we protect our journalists,and freedom of the press,,because that makes governmentsnmore accountable to us,and more transparent.,Protecting journalists and our right,to receive information protects us. 
 Our world is changing. We livenin a different world now,,and what were once individual problems,are really now global problems for all of us.,Two weeks ago, Afghanistan had its first,democratic transfer of power,and elected president Ashraf Ghani, which is huge,,and I'm very optimistic about him,,and I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan,the changes that it needs,,especially within the legal sector.,We live in a different world.,We live in a world where my neight-year-old daughter,only knows a black president.,There's a great possibility that our next president,will be a woman,,and as she gets older, she may question,,can a white guy be president?,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Our world is changing, and nwe need to change with it,,and what were once individual problems,are problems for all of us.,According to UNICEF,,there are currently over 280 million,boys and girls who are married,under the age of 15.,Two hundred and eighty million.,Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle,of poverty, poor health, lack of education. 
 At the age of 12, Sahar was married.,She was forced into this marriage,and sold by her brother.,When she went to her in-laws' house,,they forced her into prostitution.,Because she refused, she was tortured.,She was severely beaten with metal rods.,They burned her body.,They tied her up in a basement and starved her.,They used pliers to take out her fingernails.,At one point,,she managed to escape from this torture chamber,to a neighbor's house,,and when she went there, instead of protecting her,,they dragged her back,to her husband's house,,and she was tortured even worse. 
 When I met first Sahar, thankfully,,Women for Afghan Women,gave her a safe haven to go to.,As a lawyer, I try to be very strong,for all my clients,,because that's very important to me,,but seeing her,,how broken and very weak as she was,,was very difficult.,It took weeks for us to really get to,what happened to her,when she was in that house,,but finally she started opening up to me,,and when she opened up,,what I heard was,she didn't know what her rights were,,but she did know she had na certain level of protection,by her government that failed her,,and so we were able to talk about,what her legal options were. 
 And so we decided to take this case,to the Supreme Court.,Now, this is extremely significant,,because this is the first time,that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan,was being represented by a lawyer,,a law that's been on the nbooks for years and years,,but until Sahar, had never been used.,In addition to this, we also decided,to sue for civil damages,,again using a law that's never been used,,but we used it for her case.,So there we were at the Supreme Court,arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices,,me as an American female lawyer,,and Sahar, a young woman,who when I met her couldn't nspeak above a whisper.,She stood up,,she found her voice,,and my girl told them that she wanted justice,,and she got it.,At the end of it all, the court unanimously agreed,that her in-laws should benarrested for what they did to her,,her fucking brother should also be arrested,for selling her —,(Applause) —,and they agreed that she did have a right,to civil compensation.,What Sahar has shown us is that we can attack,existing bad practices by using the laws,in the ways that they're intended to be used,,and by protecting Sahar,,we are protecting ourselves. 
 After having worked in Afghanistan,for over six years now,,a lot of my family and friends think,that what I do looks like this.,(Laughter),But in all actuality, what I do looks like this.,Now, we can all do something.,I'm not saying we should all buy anplane ticket and go to Afghanistan,,but we can all be contributors,to a global human rights economy.,We can create a culture of transparency,and accountability to the laws,,and make governments more accountable to us,,as we are to them. 
 A few months ago, a South African lawyer,visited me in my office,and he said, "I wanted to meet you.,I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like.",The laws are ours,,and no matter what your ethnicity,,nationality, gender, race,,they belong to us,,and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity.,Businesses also need to get with the program.,A corporate investment in human rights,is a capital gain on your businesses,,and whether you're a business, an NGO,,or a private citizen, rule nof law benefits all of us.,And by working together with a concerted mindset,,through the people, public and private sector,,we can create a global human rights economy,and all become global investors in human rights.,And by doing this,,we can achieve justness together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.,That's a scientist who nworks in the rainforest,to document how people use local plants.,I've been doing this for a long time,,and I want to tell you,,these people know these forestsnand these medicinal treasures,better than we do andnbetter than we ever will.,But also, these cultures,,these indigenous cultures,,are disappearing much fasternthan the forests themselves.,And the greatest andnmost endangered species,in the Amazon Rainforest,is not the jaguar,,it's not the harpy eagle,,it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. 
 Now four years ago, I injured my nfoot in a climbing accident,and I went to the doctor.,She gave me heat,,she gave me cold, aspirin,,narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories,,cortisone shots.,It didn't work.,Several months later,,I was in the northeast Amazon,,walked into a village,,and the shaman said, "You're limping.",And I'll never forgetnthis as long as I live.,He looked me in the face and he said,,"Take off your shoe and give nme your machete.",(Laughter),He walked over to a palm tree,and carved off a fern,,threw it in the fire,,applied it to my foot,,threw it in a pot of water,,and had me drink the tea.,The pain disappeared for seven months.,When it came back, I wentnto see the shaman again.,He gave me the same treatment,,and I've been cured for three years now.,Who would you rather be treated by?,(Applause),Now, make no mistake — Western medicine,is the most successful systemnof healing ever devised,,but there's plenty of holes in it.,Where's the cure for breast cancer?,Where's the cure for schizophrenia?,Where's the cure for acid reflux?,Where's the cure for insomnia?,The fact is that these people,can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes,cure things we cannot.,Here you see a medicine mannin the northeast Amazon,treating leishmaniasis,,a really nasty protozoal disease,that afflicts 12 millionnpeople around the world.,Western treatment areninjections of antimony.,They're painful, they're expensive,,and they're probablynnot good for your heart;,it's a heavy metal.,This man cures it with three plantsnfrom the Amazon Rainforest. 
 This is the magic frog.,My colleague, the latengreat Loren McIntyre,,discoverer of the source nlake of the Amazon,,Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes,,was lost on the Peru-Brazilnborder about 30 years ago.,He was rescued by a group of nisolated Indians called the Matsés.,They beckoned for him to follownthem into the forest, which he did.,There, they took out palm leaf baskets.,There, they took out thesengreen monkey frogs —,these are big suckers,nthey're like this —,and they began licking them.,It turns out, they'renhighly hallucinogenic.,McIntyre wrote about this and it was read nby the editor of High Times magazine.,You see that ethnobotanists have nfriends in all sorts of strange cultures.,This guy decided he would go downnto the Amazon and give it a whirl,,or give it a lick, and nhe did, and he wrote,,"My blood pressure went through the roof,,I lost full control ofnmy bodily functions,,I passed out in a heap,,I woke up in a hammock six hours later,,felt like God for two days.",(Laughter),An Italian chemist read this and said,,"I'm not really interested in the theological naspects of the green monkey frog.,What's this about thenchange in blood pressure?",Now, this is an Italian chemist,who's working on a new treatmentnfor high blood pressure,based on peptides in the skinnof the green monkey frog,,and other scientists are looking,at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.,How ironic if these isolated nIndians and their magic frog,prove to be one of the cures. 
 Here's an ayahuasca shaman,in the northwest Amazon, innthe middle of a yage ceremony.,I took him to Los Angeles tonmeet a foundation officer,looking for support for moniesnto protect their culture.,This fellow looked at thenmedicine man, and he said,,"You didn't go to nmedical school, did you?",The shaman said, "No, I did not.",He said, "Well, then what cannyou know about healing?",The shaman looked at him and he said,,"You know what? If you have nan infection, go to a doctor.,But many human afflictions are diseases nof the heart, the mind and the spirit.,Western medicine can't ntouch those. I cure them.",(Applause) 
 But all is not rosy in learning fromnnature about new medicines.,This is a viper from Brazil,,the venom of which was studied atnthe Universidade de São Paulo here.,It was later developedninto ACE inhibitors.,This is a frontline treatmentnfor hypertension.,Hypertension causes over 10 percent,of all deaths on the planet every day.,This is a $4 billion industry,based on venom from a Brazilian snake,,and the Brazilians did not get a nickel.,This is not an acceptablenway of doing business. 
 The rainforest has been called the ngreatest expression of life on Earth.,There's a saying in Surinamenthat I dearly love:,"The rainforests hold answersnto questions we have yet to ask.",But as you all know,nit's rapidly disappearing.,Here in Brazil, in the Amazon,,around the world.,I took this picture from a small plane,flying over the eastern bordernof the Xingu indigenous reserve,in the state of Mato Grossonto the northwest of here.,The top half of the picture,,you see where the Indians live.,The line through the middle,is the eastern border of the reserve.,Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.,Top half wonder drugs,,bottom half just a bunchnof skinny-ass cows.,Top half carbon sequesterednin the forest where it belongs,,bottom half carbon in the atmosphere,where it's driving climate change.,In fact, the number two cause,of carbon being releasedninto the atmosphere,is forest destruction. 
 But in talking about destruction,,it's important to keep in mind,that the Amazon is the mightiestnlandscape of all.,It's a place of beauty and wonder.,The biggest anteater in the world,lives in the rain forest,,tips the scale at 90 pounds.,The goliath bird-eating spider,is the world's largest spider.,It's found in the Amazon as well.,The harpy eagle wingspannis over seven feet.,And the black cayman —,these monsters can tip thenscale at over half a ton.,They're known to be man-eaters.,The anaconda, the largest snake,,the capybara, the largest rodent.,A specimen from here in Brazil,tipped the scale at 201 pounds. 
 Let's visit where these creatures live,,the northeast Amazon,,home to the Akuriyo tribe.,Uncontacted peoples hold a nmystical and iconic role,in our imagination.,These are the people who nknow nature best.,These are the people who truly live,in total harmony with nature.,By our standards, some wouldndismiss these people as primitive.,"They don't know how to make fire,,or they didn't when theynwere first contacted.",But they know the forest farnbetter than we do.,The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey,,and other Indians look up to them,as being the true mastersnof the emerald realm.,Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay.,When I was a teenager rocking out,to the Rolling Stones in mynhometown of New Orleans,,Pohnay was a forest nomad,roaming the jungles ofnthe northeast Amazon,in a small band, looking for game,,looking for medicinal plants,,looking for a wife,,in other small nomadic bands.,But it's people like these,that know things that we don't,,and they have lots of nlessons to teach us. 
 However, if you go into most ofnthe forests of the Amazon,,there are no indigenous peoples.,This is what you find:,rock carvings which indigenous peoples,,uncontacted peoples, used to sharpennthe edge of the stone axe.,These cultures that once danced,,made love, sang to the gods,,worshipped the forest,,all that's left is an imprint in stone,nas you see here. 
 Let's move to the western Amazon,,which is really the epicenternof isolated peoples.,Each of these dots represents,a small, uncontacted tribe,,and the big reveal today is we believenthere are 14 or 15 isolated groups,in the Colombian Amazon alone. 
 Why are these people isolated?,They know we exist, theynknow there's an outside world.,This is a form of resistance.,They have chosen to remain isolated,,and I think it is theirnhuman right to remain so.,Why are these the tribesnthat hide from man?,Here's why.,Obviously, some of this nwas set off in 1492.,But at the turn of the last century,was the rubber trade.,The demand for natural rubber,,which came from the Amazon,,set off the botanicalnequivalent of a gold rush.,Rubber for bicycle tires,,rubber for automobile tires,,rubber for zeppelins.,It was a mad race to get that rubber,,and the man on the left, Julio Arana,,is one of the true thugs of the story.,His people, his company,,and other companies like them,killed, massacred, tortured,nbutchered Indians,like the Witotos you see on thenright hand side of the slide. 
 Even today, when peoplencome out of the forest,,the story seldom has a happy ending.,These are Nukaks. Theynwere contacted in the '80s.,Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead.,And remember, thesenare preliterate societies.,The elders are the libraries.,Every time a shaman dies,,it's as if a library has burned down.,They have been forced off their lands.,The drug traffickers haventaken over the Nukak lands,,and the Nukaks live as beggars,in public parks in eastern Colombia.,From the Nukak lands, I want to ntake you to the southwest,,to the most spectacular nlandscape in the world:,Chiribiquete National Park.,It was surrounded by three isolated tribes,and thanks to the Colombian governmentnand Colombian colleagues,,it has now expanded.,It's bigger than the state of Maryland.,It is a treasure trovenof botanical diversity.,It was first explored botanically in 1943,by my mentor, Richard Schultes,,seen here atop the Bell Mountain,,the sacred mountains of the Karijonas.,And let me show younwhat it looks like today.,Flying over Chiribiquete,,realize that these lost worldnmountains are still lost.,No scientist has been atop them.,In fact, nobody has beennatop the Bell Mountain,since Schultes in '43.,And we'll end up herenwith the Bell Mountain,just to the east of the picture.,Let me show you what it looks like today. 
 Not only is this a treasurentrove of botanical diversity,,not only is it home tonthree isolated tribes,,but it's the greatest treasure trove,of pre-Colombian art in the world:,over 200,000 paintings.,The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen,described this as the Sistine Chapelnof the Amazon Rainforest. 
 But move from Chiribiquetendown to the southeast,,again in the Colombian Amazon.,Remember, the Colombian Amazonnis bigger than New England.,The Amazon's a big forest,,and Brazil's got a big part of it,,but not all of it.,Moving down to these two national parks,,Cahuinari and Puré,in the Colombian Amazon —,that's the Braziliannborder to the right —,it's home to several groups,of isolated and uncontacted peoples.,To the trained eye, youncan look at the roofs,of these malocas, these longhouses,,and see that there's cultural diversity.,These are, in fact, different tribes.,As isolated as these areas are,,let me show you how the noutside world is crowding in.,Here we see trade and transportnincreased in Putumayo.,With the diminishment ofnthe Civil War in Colombia,,the outside world is showing up.,To the north, we have illegal gold mining,,also from the east, from Brazil.,There's increased hunting and fishingnfor commercial purposes.,We see illegal loggingncoming from the south,,and drug runners are trying tonmove through the park,and get into Brazil.,This, in the past, is why you didn't mess,with isolated Indians.,And if it looks like thisnpicture is out of focus,because it was takennin a hurry, here's why.,(Laughter),This looks like — (Applause),This looks like a hangarnfrom the Brazilian Amazon.,This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.,A group called Los Carpinteros.,This is their perception of why you nshouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians. 
 But the world is changing.,These are Mashco-Pirosnon the Brazil-Peru border,who stumbled out of the jungle,because they were essentially chased out,by drug runners and timber people.,And in Peru, there'sna very nasty business.,It's called human safaris.,They will take you in to isolatedngroups to take their picture.,Of course, when you give them nclothes, when you give them tools,,you also give them diseases.,We call these "inhuman safaris.",These are Indians again non the Peru border,,who were overflown by flightsnsponsored by missionaries.,They want to get in therenand turn them into Christians.,We know how that turns out. 
 What's to be done?,Introduce technologynto the contacted tribes,,not the uncontacted tribes,,in a culturally sensitive way.,This is the perfect marriage of nancient shamanic wisdom,and 21st century technology.,We've done this now with over 30 tribes,,mapped, managed and increased protection,of over 70 million acresnof ancestral rainforest.,(Applause) 
 So this allows the Indians to take control,of their environmentalnand cultural destiny.,They also then set up guard houses,to keep outsiders out.,These are Indians, trainednas indigenous park rangers,,patrolling the borders,and keeping the outside world at bay.,This is a picture of actual contact.,These are Chitonahua Indians,on the Brazil-Peru border.,They've come out of the jungle,asking for help.,They were shot at,,their malocas, their nlonghouses, were burned.,Some of them were massacred.,Using automatic weapons to nslaughter uncontacted peoples,is the single most despicable and ndisgusting human rights abuse,on our planet today, and it has to stop.,(Applause) 
 But let me conclude by saying,,this work can be spiritually rewarding,,but it's difficult andnit can be dangerous.,Two colleagues of minenpassed away recently,in the crash of a small plane.,They were serving the forest,to protect those uncontacted tribes.,So the question is, in conclusion,,is what the future holds.,These are the Uray people in Brazil.,What does the future hold for them,,and what does the future hold for us?,Let's think differently.,Let's make a better world.,If the climate's going to change,,let's have a climate that changes fornthe better rather than the worse.,Let's live on a planet,full of luxuriant vegetation,,in which isolated peoples,can remain in isolation,,can maintain that mystery,and that knowledge,if they so choose.,Let's live in a world,where the shamans live in these forests,and heal themselves and us,with their mystical plants,and their sacred frogs. 
 Thanks again. 
 (Applause)Let's go south.,All of you are actually going south.,This is the direction of south, this way,,and if you go 8,000 kilometersnout of the back of this room,,you will come to as far southnas you can go anywhere on Earth,,the Pole itself. 
 Now, I am not an explorer.,I'm not an environmentalist.,I'm actually just a survivor,,and these photographsnthat I'm showing you here are dangerous.,They are the ice meltnof the South and North Poles.,And ladies and gentlemen,,we need to listen to whatnthese places are telling us,,and if we don't, we will end upnwith our own survival situation,here on planet Earth. 
 I have faced head-on these places,,and to walk across a melting ocean of ice,is without doubtnthe most frightening thing,that's ever happened to me. 
 Antarctica is such a hopeful place.,It is protected by nthe Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.,In 1991, a 50-year agreementnwas entered into,that stops any exploitation in Antarctica,,and this agreement could be altered,,changed, modified, or even abandoned,starting in the year 2041.,Ladies and gentlemen,,people already far up northnfrom here in the Arctic,are already taking advantage,of this ice melt,,taking out resources from areasnalready that have been covered in ice,for the last 10, 20, 30,000,,100,000 years.,Can they not join the dots,and think, "Why is the icenactually melting?" 
 This is such an amazing place,,the Antarctic, and I have worked hard,for the last 23 years on this mission,to make sure that what's happeningnup here in the North,does never happen, ncannot happen in the South. 
 Where did this all begin?,It began for me at the age of 11.,Check out that haircut. nIt's a bit odd. (Laughter),And at the age of 11, nI was inspired by the real explorers,to want to try to be the firstnto walk to both Poles.,I found it incredibly inspiring,that the idea of becoming a polar traveler,went down pretty well with girls nat parties when I was at university.,That was a bit more inspiring.,And after years, sevennyears of fundraising,,seven years of being told no,,seven years of being toldnby my family to seek counseling,and psychiatric help,,eventually three of us found ourselvesnmarching to the South Geographic Pole,on the longest unassisted marchnever made anywhere on Earth in history.,In this photograph,nwe are standing in an area,the size of the United States of America,,and we're on our own.,We have no radio ncommunications, no backup.,Beneath our feet,n90 percent of all the world's ice,,70 percent of all the world's fresh water.,We're standing on it.,This is the power of Antarctica. 
 On this journey, we facednthe danger of crevasses,,intense cold,,so cold that sweat turnsnto ice inside your clothing,,your teeth can crack,,water can freeze in your eyes.,Let's just say it's a bit chilly.n(Laughter),And after 70 desperate days,nwe arrive at the South Pole.,We had done it.,But something happened to menon that 70-day journey in 1986,that brought me here, and it hurt.,My eyes changed colornin 70 days through damage.,Our faces blistered out.,The skin ripped offnand we wondered why.,And when we got home,nwe were told by NASA,that a hole in the ozonenhad been discovered,above the South Pole,,and we'd walked underneath itnthe same year it had been discovered.,Ultraviolet rays down, hit the ice,nbounced back, fried out the eyes,,ripped off our faces.,It was a bit of a shock --n(Laughter) --,and it started me thinking. 
 In 1989, we now head north.,Sixty days, every step awaynfrom the safety of land,across a frozen ocean.,It was desperately cold again.,Here's me coming in from washingnnaked at -60 Celsius.,And if anybody ever says to you,n"I am cold" -- (Laughter) --,if they look like this, nthey are cold, definitely.,(Applause) 
 And 1,000 kilometers awaynfrom the safety of land,,disaster strikes.,The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feetnfour months before it ever had in history,,and we're 1,000 kilometers from safety.,The ice is crashing around us, grinding,nand I'm thinking, "Are we going to die?",But something clickednin my head on this day,,as I realized we, as a world,nare in a survival situation,,and that feeling has never gone awaynfor 25 long years.,Back then, we had to march or die.,And we're not some TV survivor program.,When things go wrong for us,nit's life or death,,and our brave African-American Daryl,,who would become the first Americannto walk to the North Pole,,his heel dropped off nfrom frostbite 200 klicks out.,He must keep going, he does,,and after 60 days on the ice,nwe stood at the North Pole.,We had done it.,Yes, I became the first person in historynstupid enough to walk to both Poles,,but it was our success. 
 And sadly, on return home,,it was not all fun.,I became very low.,To succeed at something is often hardernthan actually making it happen.,I was empty, lonely,nfinancially destroyed.,I was without hope,,but hope came in the formnof the great Jacques Cousteau,,and he inspired me to take on nthe 2041 mission.,Being Jacques, he gave menclear instructions:,Engage the world leaders,ntalk to industry and business,,and above all, Rob, inspire young people,,because they will choose the futurenof the preservation of Antarctica. 
 For the world leaders, we've beennto every world Earth Summit,,all three of them,nwith our brave yacht, 2041,,twice to Rio, once in '92, once in 2012,,and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg,,we made the longest overland voyagenever made with a yacht,,13,000 kilometers aroundnthe whole of Southern Africa,doing our best to inspirenover a million young people in person,about 2041 and about their environment. 
 For the last 11 years,nwe have taken over 1,000 people,,people from industry and business,nwomen and men from companies,,students from all over the world,ndown to Antarctica,,and during those missions,nwe've managed to pull out,over 1,500 tons of twisted metalnleft in Antarctica.,That took eight years,nand I'm so proud of it,because we recycled all of it nback here in South America.,I have been inspirednever since I could walk,to recycle by my mum.,Here she is, and my mum --,(Applause) --,my mum is still recycling,,and as she is in her 100th year,nisn't that fantastic?,(Applause),And when -- I love my mum.,(Laughter),But when Mum was born,,the population of our planetnwas only 1.8 billion people,,and talking in terms of billions,,we have taken young peoplenfrom industry and business,from India, from China.,These are game-changing nations,nand will be hugely important,in the decision aboutnthe preservation of the Antarctic.,Unbelievably, we've engaged and inspirednwomen to come from the Middle East,,often for the first time they've nrepresented their nations in Antarctica.,Fantastic people, so inspired.,To look after Antarctica,,you've got to first engage peoplenwith this extraordinary place,,form a relationship, form a bond,,form some love.,It is such a privilegento go to Antarctica,,I can't tell you.,I feel so lucky,,and I've been 35 times in my life,,and all those people who come with usnreturn home as great champions,,not only for Antarctica,,but for local issuesnback in their own nations. 
 Let's go back to where we began:nthe ice melt of the North and South Poles.,And it's not good news.,NASA informed us six months ago,that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelfnis now disintegrating.,Huge areas of ice --,look how big Antarctica isneven compared to here --,Huge areas of ice nare breaking off from Antarctica,,the size of small nations.,And NASA have calculatednthat the sea level will rise,,it is definite,,by one meter in the next 100 years,,the same time that my mumnhas been on planet Earth.,It's going to happen,,and I've realized that nthe preservation of Antarctica,and our survival here on Earth are linked.,And there is a very simple solution.,If we are using more renewable energynin the real world,,if we are being more efficientnwith the energy here,,running our energy mix in a cleaner way,,there will be no financial reasonnto go and exploit Antarctica.,It won't make financial sense,,and if we manage our energy better,nwe also may be able to slow down,,maybe even stop,,this great ice melt that threatens us. 
 It's a big challenge, and whatnis our response to it?,We've got to go back one last time,,and at the end of next year,,we will go back to thenSouth Geographic Pole,,where we arrived 30 years ago on foot,,and retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers,,but this time only usingnrenewable energy to survive.,We will walk across those icecaps,nwhich far down below are melting,,hopefully inspiring somensolutions on that issue. 
 This is my son, Barney.,He is coming with me.,He is committed to walkingnside by side with his father,,and what he will do isnto translate these messages,and inspire these messagesnto the minds of future young leaders.,I'm extremely proud of him.,Good on him, Barney. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, na survivor -- and I'm good --,a survivor sees a problemnand doesn't go, "Whatever.",A survivor sees a problemnand deals with that problem,before it becomes a threat.,We have 27 yearsnto preserve the Antarctic.,We all own it.,We all have responsibility.,The fact that nobody owns it nmaybe means that we can succeed.,Antarctica is a moral line in the snow,,and on one side of that linenwe should fight,,fight hard for this one beautiful,npristine place left alone on Earth.,I know it's possible.,We are going to do it.,And I'll leave you withnthese words from Goethe.,I've tried to live by them. 
 "If you can do, or dream you can,,begin it now,,for boldness has genius,npower and magic in it." 
 Good luck to you all. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Hi.,Today I'm going to sharenmy personal journey,with female genital mutilation, FGM.,Feel free to cry, laugh, cross your legs,,or do anything your body feels like doing.,I'm not going to namenthe things your body does. 
 I was born in Sierra Leone.,Did anybody watch "Blood Diamond"?,If you have any thoughts --,I don't have any diamonds non me, by the way.,If you have heard of Ebola,nwell, that's in Sierra Leone as well.,I don't have Ebola. You're all safe.,Don't rush to the door.,Be seated. You're fine.nI was checked before I got here. 
 My grandfather had three wives.,Don't ask me why a mannneeds more than one wife.,Men, do you need more than one wife?,I don't think so. There you go.,He was looking for a heart attack,nthat's what I say.,Oh yeah, he was. 
 When I was three, war broke outnin Sierra Leone in 1991.,I remember literally going to bednone night, everything was good.,The next day, I woke up,,bombs were dropping everywhere,,and people were tryingnto kill me and my family.,We escaped the war and ended upnin Gambia, in West Africa.,Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it.,While we were there as refugees,,we didn't know whatnwas going to become of us.,My mom applied for refugee status.,She's a wonderful, smart woman, that one,,and we were lucky.,Australia said, we will take you in.,Good job, Aussies. 
 Before we were meant to travel,,my mom came home one day, and said,,"We're going on na little holiday, a little trip.",She put us in a car,,and we drove for hoursnand ended up in a bush,in a remote area in Gambia.,In this bush, we found two huts.,An old lady came towards us.,She was ethnic-looking, very old.,She had a chat with my mom, and went back.,Then she came back and walkednaway from us into a second hut.,I'm standing there thinking,,"This is very confusing.nI don't know what's going on.",The next thing I knew,,my mom took me into this hut.,She took my clothes off,,and then she pinned me down on the floor.,I struggled and triednto get her off me, but I couldn't.,Then the old lady came towards menwith a rusty-looking knife,,one of the sharp knives,,orange-looking, has never seennwater or sunlight before.,I thought she was going to slaughter me,,but she didn't.,She slowly slid down my body,and ended up where my vagina is.,She took hold of what I now knownto be my clitoris,,she took that rusty knife,nand started cutting away, inch by inch.,I screamed, I cried,,and asked my mom to get off menso this pain will stop,,but all she did was say, "Be quiet.",This old lady sawed away at my fleshnfor what felt like forever,,and then when she was done,,she threw that piece of fleshnacross the floor,as if it was the most disgusting thingnshe's ever touched.,They both got off me,nand left me there bleeding,,crying, and confusednas to what just happened. 
 We never talked about this again.,Very soon, we foundnthat we were coming to Australia,,and this is when you hadnthe Sydney Olympics at the time,,and people said we were goingnto the end of the world,,there was nowhere elsento go after Australia.,Yeah, that comforted us a bit.,It took us three days to get here.,We went to Senegal, then France,nand then Singapore.,We went to the bathroom to wash our hands.,We spent 15 minutesnopening the tap like this.,Then somebody came in,,slid their hand under and water came out,,and we thought, is this what we're in for?,Like, seriously. 
 We got to Adelaide, small place,,where literally they dumped usnin Adelaide, that's what I would say.,They dumped us there.,We were very grateful.,We settled and we liked it.,We were like, "We're home, we're here.",Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall.,Adelaide has only one mall.,It's this small place.,And we saw a lot of Asian people.,My mom said all of a sudden, panicking,,"You brought us to the wrong place.nYou must take us back to Australia.",Yeah. It had to be explained to her that nthere were a lot of Asians in Australia,and we were in the right place.,So fine, it's all good. 
 My mom then had this brilliant idea,that I should go to a girls schoolnbecause they were less racist.,I don't know where she read nthat publication. (Laughter),Never found evidence of it to this day.,Six hundred white kids, nand I was the only black child there.,No, I was the only personnwith a bit of a color on me.,Let me say that. Chocolate color.,There were no Asians, no indigenous.,All we had was some tan girls,,girls who felt the neednto be under the sun.,It wasn't the same as my chocolate,nthough. Not the same.,Settling in Australia was quite hard,,but it became harder when I startednvolunteering for an organization,called Women's Health Statewide,,and I joined theirnfemale genital mutilation program,without any awareness of whatnthis program was actually about,,or that it related to me in any way.,I spent months educatingnnurses and doctors,about what female genital mutilation was,and where it was practiced:,Africa, the Middle East, Asia,nand now, Australia and London and America,,because, as we all know,nwe live in a multicultural society,,and people who come from those backgroundsncome with their culture,,and sometimes they have cultural practicesnthat we may not agree with,,but they continue to practice them. 
 One day, I was looking at the chart,of the different typesnof female genital mutilation,,FGM, I will just say FGM for short.,Type I is when they cut off the hood.,Type II is whennthey cut off the whole clitoris,and some of your labia majora,nor your outer lips,,and Type III is when they ncut off the whole clitoris,and then they sew you up,so you only have a little holento pee and have your period.,My eyes went onto Type II.,Before all of this,nI pretty much had amnesia.,I was in so much shock nand traumatized by what had happened,,I didn't remember any of it.,Yes, I was aware something badnhappened to me,,but I had no recollectionnof what had happened.,I knew I had a scar down there,,but I thought everybodynhad a scar down there.,This had happened to everybody else.,But when I looked at Type II,nit all came back to me.,I remembered what was done to me.,I remembered being in that hut,with that old lady and my momnholding me down. 
 Words cannot express the pain I felt,,the confusion that I felt,,because now I realized that nwhat was done to me was a terrible thing,that in this society was called barbaric,,it was called mutilation.,My mother had saidnit was called circumcision,,but here it was mutilation.,I was thinking, I'm mutilated?nI'm a mutilated person.,Oh my God. 
 And then the anger came.,I was a black angry woman.n(Laughter),Oh yeah.,A little one, but angry nevertheless.,I went home and said to my mom,,"You did something.",This is not the African thing to do,npointing at your mother,,but hey, I was ready for any consequences.,"You did something to me.",She's like, "What are yountalking about, Khadija?",She's used to me mouthing off.,I'm like, "Those years ago,nYou circumcised me.,You cut away somethingnthat belonged to me.",She said, "Yes, I did.,I did it for your own good.,It was in your best interest.,Your grandmother did it to me,nand I did it to you.,It's made you a woman.",I'm like, "How?",She said, "You're empowered, Khadija.,Do you get itchy down there?",I'm like, "No, why would Inget itchy down there?",She said, "Well,nif you were not circumcised,,you would get itchy down there.,Women who are not circumcisednget itchy all the time.,Then they sleep around with everybody.,You are not goingnto sleep around with anybody.",And I thought,,her definition of empowermentnwas very strange. (Laughter),That was the endnof our first conversation.,I went back to school.,These were the days when we had nDolly and Girlfriend magazines.,There was always the sealed section.nAnybody remember those sealed sections?,The naughty bits, you know?,Oh yeah, I love those.n(Laughter),Anyway, there was alwaysnan article about pleasure,and relationships and, of course, sex.,But it always assumednthat you had a clitoris, though,,and I thought, this doesn't fit me.,This doesn't talk about people like me.,I don't have a clitoris.,I watched TV and those womennwould moan like, "Oh! Oh!",I was like, these peoplenand their damned clitoris.,(Laughter),What is a woman without a clitorisnsupposed to do with her life?,That's what I want to know.,I want to do that too --n"Oh! Oh!" and all of that.,Didn't happen. 
 So I came home once againnand said to my mom,,"Dolly and Girlfriend saidnI deserve pleasure,,that I should be having orgasms,,and that white men should figure outnhow to find the clitoris.",Apparently, white mennhave a problem finding the clitoris.,(Laughter),Just saying, it wasn't me.nIt was Dolly that said that.,And I thought to myself,nI had an inner joke in my head,that said, "I will marry a white man.,He won't have that problem with me."n(Laughter),So I said to my mom,,"Dolly and Girlfriend saidnI deserve pleasure, and do you know,what you have taken away from me,nwhat you have denied me?,You have invaded menin the most sacred way.,I want pleasure.,I want to get horny, dammit, as well.",And she said to me,n"Who is Dolly and Girlfriend?,Are they your new friends, Khadija?",I was like, "No, they're not.nThat's a magazine, mom, a magazine." 
 She didn't get it.,We came from two different worlds.,When she was growing up,nnot having a clitoris was the norm.,It was celebrated.,I was an African Australian girl.,I lived in a societynthat was very clitoris-centric.,It was all about the damn clitoris!,And I didn't have one!,That pissed me off. 
 So once I went throughnthis strange phase of anger,and pain and confusion,,I remember bookingnan appointment with my therapist.,Yes, I'm an African nwho has a therapist. There you go.,And I said to her,,"I was 13. I was a child.,I was settling in a new country,,I was dealing with racismnand discrimination,,English is my third language,nand then there it was.",I said to her, "I feel likenI'm not a woman,because of what was done to me.,I feel incomplete.,Am I going to be asexual?",Because from what I knew about FGM,,the whole aim of it was to controlnthe sexuality of women.,It's so that we don't havenany sexual desire.,And I said, "Am I asexual now?,Will I just live the rest of my lifennot feeling like having sex,,not enjoying sex?",She couldn't answer my questions,,so they went unanswered. 
 When I started having my periodnaround the age of 14,,I realized I didn't have nnormal periods because of FGM.,My periods were heavy, they were long,nand they were very painful.,Then they told me I had fibroids.,They're like these little ballsnsitting there.,One was covering one of my ovaries. 
 And there came then the big news.,"We don't think you cannhave children, Khadija.",And once again, I wasnan angry black woman. 
 I went home and I said to my mom,,"Your act, your action,nno matter what your may defense may be" --,because she thought she did it out love --,"what you did out of love nis harming me, and it's hurting me.,What do you have to say for that?",She said, "I did what I had to donas a mother.",I'm still waitingnfor an apology, by the way. 
 Then I got married.,And once again --,FGM is like the gift that keeps giving.,You figure that out very soon.,Sex was very painful.,It hurt all the time.,And of course I realized, they said,n"You can't have kids.",I thought, "Wow, is this my existence?nIs this what life is all about?",I'm proud to tell you,,five months ago,,I was told I was pregnant.,(Applause) 
 I am the lucky girl.,There are so many women out therenwho have gone through FGM,who have infertility.,I know a nine-year-old girl who hasnincontinence, constant infections, pain.,It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving.,It affects every area of your life,,and this happened to menbecause I was born a girl,in the wrong place.,That's why it happened to me. 
 I channel all that anger, nall that pain, into advocacy,because I needed my painnto be worth something.,So I'm the director of an organizationncalled No FGM Australia.,You heard me right.,Why No FGM Australia?,FGM is in Australia.,Two days ago, I had to callnChild Protective Services,,because somewhere in Australia,,there's a four-year old,there's a four-year-old whose mom nis planning on performing FGM on her.,That child is in kindy.nI'll let that sink in: four years old.,A couple of months ago, I met a ladynwho is married to a Malaysian man.,Her husband came home one day and saidnhe was going to take their daughters,back to Malaysianto cut off their clitoris.,And she said, "Why?"nHe said they were dirty.,And she said, "Well, you married me.",He said, "Oh, this is my cultural belief.",They then went into a whole discussionnwhere she said to him,,"Over my dead bodynwill you do that to my daughters.",But imagine if this womannwasn't aware of what FGM was,,if they never had that conversation?,Her children would have beennflown over to Malaysia,and they would have come backnchanged for the rest of their lives.,Do you know the millions of dollars,it would take us to dealnwith an issue like that?,[Three children per day] in Australia,are at risk of having FGMnperformed on them.,This is an Australian problem, people.,It's not an African problem.nIt's not a Middle Eastern problem.,It's not white, it's not black,nit has no color, it's everybody's problem.,FGM is child abuse.,It's violence against women.,It's saying that women don't havena right to sexual pleasure.,It says we don't havena right to our bodies.,Well, I say no to that,nand you know what? Bullshit.,That's what I have to say to that.,(Applause) 
 I am proud to say thatnI'm doing my part in ending FGM.,What are you going to do?,There may be a child in your classroomnwho is at risk of FGM.,There may be a patientnwho comes to your hospital,who is at risk of FGM.,But this is the reality,,that even in our beloved Australia,,the most wonderful place in the world,,children are being abusednbecause of a culture.,Culture should not bena defense for child abuse.,I want ever single one of younto see FGM as an issue for you.,Make it personal.,It could be your daughter,nyour sister, your cousin. 
 I can't fight FGM alone.,I could try, but I can't.,So my appeal to you is, please join me.,Sign my petition on Change.org,and type in Khadija, my name,nand it'll come up, and sign it.,The aim of that is to get supportnfor FGM victims in Australia,and to protect little girlsngrowing up here,to not have this evil done to them,,because every childnhas a right to pleasure.,Every child has a rightnto their bodies being left intact,,and dammit, ever childnhas a right to a clitoris.,So please join me in ending this act. 
 My favorite quote is,,"All it takes for evil to prevail,is for a few good mennand women to do nothing.",Are you going to let this evilnof female genital mutilation,to prevail in Australia?,I don't think so,,so please join me in ensuringnthat it ends in my generation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When we think about mapping cities,,we tend to think about roadsnand streets and buildings,,and the settlement narrativenthat led to their creation,,or you might think aboutnthe bold vision of an urban designer,,but there's other waysnto think about mapping cities,and how they got to be made.,Today, I want to show youna new kind of map.,This is not a geographic map.,This is a map of the relationships nbetween people in my hometown,of Baltimore, Maryland,,and what you can see here is thatneach dot represents a person,,each line represents a relationshipnbetween those people,,and each color represents a communitynwithin the network. 
 Now, I'm here on the green side,ndown on the far right where the geeks are,,and TEDx also is down non the far right. (Laughter),Now, on the other side of the network,,you tend to have primarilynAfrican-American and Latino folks,who are really concerned about somewhatndifferent things than the geeks are,,but just to give some sense,,the green part of the network nwe call Smalltimore,,for those of us that inhabit it,,because it seems as thoughnwe're living in a very small town.,We see the same peoplenover and over again,,but that's becausenwe're not really exploring,the full depth and breadth of the city.,On the other end of the network,,you have folks who are interestednin things like hip-hop music,and they even identify with livingnin the DC/Maryland/Virginia area,over, say, the Baltimore cityndesignation proper.,But in the middle, you see that there's,something that connectsnthe two communities together,,and that's sports.,We have the Baltimore Orioles,nthe Baltimore Ravens football team,,Michael Phelps, the Olympian.,Under Armour, you may have heard of,nis a Baltimore company,,and that community of sportsnacts as the only bridge,between these two ends of the network. 
 Let's take a look at San Francisco.,You see something a little bitndifferent happening in San Francisco.,On the one hand, you do haventhe media, politics and news lobe,that tends to existnin Baltimore and other cities,,but you also have thisnvery predominant group,of geeks and techies that are sort ofntaking over the top half of the network,,and there's even a groupnthat's so distinct and clear,that we can identify itnas Twitter employees,,next to the geeks, in betweennthe gamers and the geeks,,at the opposite endnof the hip-hop spectrum.,So you can see, though,,that the tensions that we'venheard about in San Francisco,in terms of people beingnconcerned about gentrification,and all the new tech companiesnthat are bringing new wealth,and settlement into the city are real,,and you can actually seenthat documented here.,You can see the LGBT community,is not really getting alongnwith the geek community that well,,the arts community, the music community.,And so it leads to things like this.,["Evict Twitter"],Somebody sent me this photona few weeks ago,,and it shows what is happeningnon the ground in San Francisco,,and I think you cannactually try to understand that,through looking at a map like this. 
 Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.,I spent the last few weeksngathering data about Rio,,and one of the thingsnthat stood out to me about this city,is that everything'snreally kind of mixed up.,It's a very heterogenous city in a way nthat Baltimore or San Francisco is not.,You still have the lobe of people involved,with government, newspapers,npolitics, columnists.,TEDxRio is down in the lower right,nright next to bloggers and writers.,But then you also have thisntremendous diversity of people,that are interestednin different kinds of music.,Even Justin Bieber fansnare represented here.,Other boy bands, country singers,,gospel music, funk and rapnand stand-up comedy,,and there's even a whole sectionnaround drugs and jokes.,How cool is that?,And then the Flamengo football teamnis also represented here.,So you have that same kind of spread,of sports and civicsnand the arts and music,,but it's representednin a very different way,,and I think that maybe fitsnwith our understanding of Rio,as being a very multicultural,nmusically diverse city. 
 So we have all this data.,It's an incredibly rich set of datanthat we have about cities now,,maybe even richer than any data setnthat we've ever had before.,So what can we do with it?,Well, I think the first thingnthat we can try to understand,is that segregation is a social construct.,It's something that we choose to do,nand we could choose not to do it,,and if you kind of think about it,,what we're doing with this datanis aiming a space telescope at a city,and looking at it as if wasna giant high school cafeteria,,and seeing how everybody arrangednthemselves in a seating chart.,Well maybe it's time to shake upnthe seating chart a little bit. 
 The other thing that we start to realize,is that race is a reallynpoor proxy for diversity.,We've got people representednfrom all different types of races,across the entire map here --,only looking at race,doesn't really contribute tonour development of diversity.,So if we're trying to use diversity,as a way to tackle some of ournmore intractable problems,,we need to start to think nabout diversity in a new way. 
 And lastly, we have the ability to create,interventions to start to reshapenour cities in a new way,,and I believe that ifnwe have that capability,,we may even bear somenresponsibility to do so. 
 So what is a city?,I think some might say that it is,a geographical area or a collectionnof streets and buildings,,but I believe that a city nis the sum of the relationships,of the people that live there,,and I believe that if we can start tondocument those relationships in a real way,then maybe we have a real shot,at creating those kinds of citiesnthat we'd like to have. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have a confession to make.,I am addicted to adventure,,and as a young boy,,I would rather look outside the window,at the birds in the trees and the sky,than looking at that two-dimensional,chalky blackboard where time stands still,and even sometimes dies.,My teachers thought there was something wrong,with me because I wasn't paying attention in class.,They didn't find anything nspecifically wrong with me,,other than being slightly ndyslexic because I'm a lefty.,But they didn't test for curiosity.,Curiosity, to me,,is about our connection,with the world, with the universe.,It's about seeing what's naround that next coral head,or what's around that next tree,,and learning more not only about our environment,but about ourselves. 
 Now, my dream of dreams,,I want to go explore the oceans of Mars,,but until we can go there,,I think the oceans still hold,quite a few secrets.,As a matter of fact,,if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is,and dissect it into a living space,,the ocean represents over 3.4 billion,cubic kilometers of volume, within which,we've explored less than five percent.,And I look at this, and I go, well,,there are tools to go ndeeper, longer and further:,submarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving.,But if we're going to explore the final frontier,on this planet, we need to live there.,We need to build a log cabin, if you will,,at the bottom of the sea. 
 And so there was a great curiosity in my soul,when I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner],by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.,Maybe you've heard of her.,Two years ago, she was staked out,at the last undersea marine laboratory,to try and save it,,to try and petition,for us not to scrap it,and bring it back on land.,We've only had about a dozen or so,scientific labs at the bottom of the sea.,There's only one left in the world:,it's nine miles offshore,and 65 feet down.,It's called Aquarius.,Aquarius, in some fashion,,is a dinosaur,,an ancient robot chained to the bottom,,this Leviathan.,In other ways, it's a legacy.,And so with that visit, I realized nthat my time is short,if I wanted to experience,what it was like to become an aquanaut. 
 When we swam towards this after many,moons of torture and two years of preparation,,this habitat waiting to invite us,was like a new home.,And the point of going down to,and living at this habitat was not to stay inside.,It wasn't about living at somethingnthe size of a school bus.,It was about giving us the luxury of time,outside to wander, to explore,,to understand more about this oceanic final frontier. 
 We had megafauna come and visit us.,This spotted eagle ray is a fairlyncommon sight in the oceans.,But why this is so important,,why this picture is up,,is because this particular animalnbrought his friends around,,and instead of being thenpelagic animals that they were,,they started getting curious about us,,these new strangers that werenmoving into the neighborhood,,doing things with plankton.,We were studying all sorts of animals and critters,,and they got closer and closer to us,,and because of the luxury of time,,these animals, these residents of the coral reef,,were starting to get used to us,,and these pelagics thatnnormal travel through stopped.,This particular animal actually circled,for 31 full days during our mission.,So mission 31 wasn't so much,about breaking records.,It was about that human-ocean connection. 
 Because of the luxury of time, we were able,to study animals such as sharks and grouper,in aggregations that we've never seen before.,It's like seeing dogs and ncats behaving well together.,Even being able to commune with animals,that are much larger than us,,such as this endangered goliath grouper,who only still resides in the Florida Keys.,Of course, just like any neighbor,,after a while, if they get tired,,the goliath grouper barks at us,,and this bark is so powerful,that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all,within a split second.,For us, it's just telling us to go back,into the habitat and leave them alone. 
 Now, this wasn't just about adventure.,There was actually a serious note to it.,We did a lot of science, and again,nbecause of the luxury of time,,we were able to do over three years of science,in 31 days.,In this particular case, we were using a PAM,,or, let me just see if I can get this straight,,a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.,And our scientists from FIU, MIT,,and from Northeastern,were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do,when we're not around.,The Pulse Amplitude ModulatednFluorometer, or PAM,,gauges the fluorescence of corals,as it pertains to pollutants in the water,as well as climate change-related issues.,We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,,such as this sonde, or what I like to call,the sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde,itself tests for metabolism rates,in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,,or the redwoods of the [ocean].,And this gives us a much better gauge,of what's happening underwater,with regard to climate change-related issues,,and how the dynamics of that,affect us here on land.,And finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.,And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,,because as we take away some of the predators,on these coral reefs around the world,,the prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.,What we realized is,not only do they stop taking care of the reef,,darting in, grabbing a little bit of algae,and going back into their homes,,they start spreading out and disappearing,from those particular coral reefs.,Well, within that 31 days,,we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers,on each one of these topics. 
 But the point of adventure is not only to learn,,it's to be able to share that nknowledge with the world,,and with that, thanks to a ncouple of engineers at MIT,,we were able to use a prototypencamera called the Edgertronic,to capture slow-motion video,,up to 20,000 frames per second,in a little box,that's worth 3,000 dollars.,It's available to every one of us.,And that particular camera gives us an insight,into what fairly common animals do,but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.,Let me show you a quick video,of what this camera does.,You can see the silky bubble come out,of our hard hats.,It gives us an insight,into some of the animals that we were sitting,right next to for 31 days,and never normally would have paid attention to,,such as hermit crabs.,Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology,that's not really meant for the oceans,is not always easy.,We sometimes had to put the camera upside down,,cordon it back to the lab,,and actually man the trigger,from the lab itself.,But what this gives us,is the foresight to look at and analyze,in scientific and engineering terms,some of the most amazing behavior,that the human eye just can't pick up,,such as this manta shrimp,trying to catch its prey,,within about .3 seconds.,That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,,and if you ever try to catch a bullet,in mid-flight with your eye, impossible.,But now we can see things,such as these Christmas tree worms,pulling in and fanning out,in a way that the eye just can't capture,,or in this case,,a fish throwing up grains of sand.,This is an actual sailfin goby,,and if you look at it in real time,,it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion,because it's so quick. 
 One of the most precious giftsnthat we had underwater,is that we had WiFi,,and for 31 days straight we were able to connect,with the world in real time nfrom the bottom of the sea,and share all of these experiences.,Quite literally right there,I am Skyping in the classroom,with one of the six continents,and some of the 70,000 nstudents that we connected,every single day to some of these experiences.,As a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took,with my smartphone from underwater,of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.,We had never seen that before. 
 And I dream of the day,that we have underwater cities,,and maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries,of adventure and knowledge,,and we share that knowledge with others out there,,we can solve all sorts of problems.,My grandfather used to say,,"People protect what they love.",My father, "How can people protect,what they don't understand?",And I've thought about this my whole life.,Nothing is impossible.,We need to dream, we need to be creative,,and we all need to have an adventure,in order to create miracles in the darkest of times.,And whether it's about climate change,or eradicating poverty,or giving back to future generations,what we've taken for granted,,it's about adventure.,And who knows, maybenthere will be underwater cities,,and maybe some of you,will become the future aquanauts. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We can cut violent deathsnaround the world,by 50 percent in the next three decades.,All we have to donis drop killing by 2.3 percent a year,,and we'll hit that target. 
 You don't believe me?,Well, the leading epidemiologistsnand criminologists around the world,seem to think we can, and so do I,,but only if we focus on our cities,nespecially the most fragile ones. 
 You see, I've been thinkingnabout this a lot.,For the last 20 years, I've been working,in countries and citiesnripped apart by conflict,,violence, terrorism, or someninsidious combination of all.,I've tracked gun smugglersnfrom Russia to Somalia,,I've worked with warlordsnin Afghanistan and the Congo,,I've counted cadavers in Colombia, in nHaiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea.,You don't need to benon the front line, though,,to get a sense that our planetnis spinning out of control, right?,There's this feeling that internationalninstability is the new normal.,But I want you to take a closer look,,and I think you'll see thatnthe geography of violence is changing,,because it's not so much our nation statesnthat are gripped by conflict and crime,as our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, nErbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.,Violence is migrating to the metropole. 
 And maybe this is to be expected, right?,After all, most people today,nthey live in cities, not the countryside.,Just 600 cities, including 30 megacities,naccount for two thirds of global GDP.,But when it comes to cities,,the conversation isndominated by the North,,that is, North America, Western Europe,nAustralia and Japan,,where violence is nactually at historic lows.,As a result, city enthusiasts, they talknabout the triumph of the city,,of the creative classes, and the mayorsnthat will rule the world.,Now, I hope that mayorsndo one day rule the world,,but, you know, the fact is,,we don't hear any conversation, really,nabout what is happening in the South.,And by South, I meannLatin America, Africa, Asia,,where violence in somencases is accelerating,,where infrastructure is overstretched,,and where governance is sometimesnan aspiration and not a reality. 
 Now, some diplomatsnand development experts and specialists,,they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states,that will shape securitynin the 21st century.,I think it's fragile cities which willndefine the future of order and disorder.,That's because warfarenand humanitarian action,are going to benconcentrated in our cities,,and the fight for development,,whether you define thatnas eradicating poverty,,universal healthcare,nbeating back climate change,,will be won or lost in the shantytowns,nslums and favelas of our cities.,I want to talk to you about four megarisks,that I think will definenfragility in our time,,and if we can get to grips with these,,I think we can do somethingnwith that lethal violence problem. 
 So let me start with some good news.,Fact is, we're living in the mostnpeaceful moment in human history.,Steven Pinker and others have shown hownthe intensity and frequency of conflict,is actually at an all-time low.,Now, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine,,as ghastly as these conflicts are,nand they are horrific,,they represent a relativelynsmall blip upwards,in a 50-year-long secular decline.,What's more, we're seeingna dramatic reduction in homicide.,Manuel Eisner and others have shown,that for centuries, we've seennthis incredible drop in murder,,especially in the West.,Most Northern cities today are 100 timesnsafer than they were just 100 years ago. 
 These two facts -- the decline in armed nconflict and the decline in murder --,are amongst the most extraordinary,,if unheralded, accomplishmentsnof human history,,and we should be really excited, right?,Well, yeah, we should.,There's just one problem:nThese two scourges are still with us.,You see, 525,000 people --nmen, women, boys and girls --,die violently every single year.,Research I've been doingnwith Keith Krause and others,has shown that between 50,000 and 60,000npeople are dying in war zones violently.,The rest, almost 500,000 people,nare dying outside of conflict zones.,In other words, 10 times more peoplenare dying outside of war than inside war.,What's more, violence is moving south,,to Latin America and the Caribbean,,to parts of Central and Southern Africa,,and to bits of the Middle Eastnand Central Asia.,Forty of the 50 most dangerous ncities in the world,are right here in Latin America,,13 in Brazil,,and the most dangerous of all, it's nSan Pedro Sula, Honduras' second city,,with a staggering homicide ratenof 187 murders per 100,000 people.,That's 23 times the global average. 
 Now, if violence isnre-concentrating geographically,,it's also being reconfigurednto the world's new topography,,because when it comes to cities,nthe world ain't flat,,like Thomas Friedman likes to say.,It's spiky.,The dominance of the citynas the primary mode of urban living,is one of the most extraordinaryndemographic reversals in history,,and it all happened so fast.,You all know the figures, right?,There's 7.3 billion peoplenin the world today;,there will be 9.6 billion by 2050.,But consider this one fact:,In the 1800s, one in 30npeople lived in cities,,today it's one in two,,and tomorrow virtually everyonenis going to be there.,And this expansion in urbanizationnis going to be neither even nor equitable.,The vast majority, 90 percent,,will be happening in the South,nin cities of the South. 
 So urban geographers and demographers,,they tell us that it's not necessarilynthe size or even the density of cities,that predicts violence, no.,Tokyo, with 35 million people,,is one of the largest, and some might saynsafest, urban metropolises in the world.,No, it's the speed ofnurbanization that matters.,I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's none of the key drivers of fragility. 
 When you think about the incrediblenexpansion of these cities,,and you think about turbo-urbanization,nthink about Karachi.,Karachi was about 500,000 people in 1947,na hustling, bustling city.,Today, it's 21 million people,,and apart from accountingnfor three quarters of Pakistan's GDP,,it's also one of the most violentncities in South Asia.,Dhaka, Lagos, Kinshasa,,these cities are now 40 times largernthan they were in the 1950s. 
 Now take a look at New York.,The Big Apple, it took 150 yearsnto get to eight million people.,São Paulo, Mexico City, took 15nto reach that same interval. 
 Now, what do these medium,nlarge, mega-, and hypercities look like?,What is their profile?,Well, for one thing, they're young.,What we're seeing in many of themnis the rise of the youth bulge.,Now, this is actually a good news story.,It's a function of reductionsnin child mortality rates.,But the youth bulge is somethingnwe've got to watch.,What it basically means,is the proportion of young peoplenliving in our fragile cities,is much larger than those living nin our healthier and wealthier ones.,In some fragile cities,,75 percent of the populationnis under the age of 30.,Think about that:nThree in four people are under 30.,It's like Palo Alto on steroids.,Now, if you look at Mogadishu for example,,in Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old.,Ditto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul.,And Tokyo? It's 46.,Same for most Western European cities.,Now, it's not just youthnthat necessarily predicts violence.,That's one factor among many,,but youthfulness combinednwith unemployment, lack of education,,and -- this is the kicker -- nbeing male, is a deadly proposition.,They're statistically correlated,nall those risk factors, with youth,,and they tend to relatento increases in violence. 
 Now, for those of you who arenparents of teenage sons,,you know what I'm talking about, right?,Just imagine your boynwithout any structure,with those unruly friends of his,nout there cavorting about.,Now, take away the parents,,take away the education,nlimit the education possibilities,,sprinkle in a little bit of drugs,nalcohol and guns,,and sit back and watch the fireworks.,The implications are disconcerting.,Right here in Brazil,nthe life expectancy is 73.6 years.,If you live in Rio, I'm sorry,nshave off two right there.,But if you're young, you're uneducated,,you lack employment,nyou're black, and you're male,,your life expectancy dropsnto less than 60 years old.,There's a reason why youthfulnessnand violence are the number one killers,in this country. 
 Okay, so it's not all doomnand gloom in our cities.,After all, cities are hubs of innovation,,dynamism, prosperity, nexcitement, connectivity.,They're where the smart people gather.,And those young people I just mentioned,,they're more digitally savvynand tech-aware than ever before.,And this explosion, the Internet,nand mobile technology,,means that the digital dividenseparating the North and the South,between countriesnand within them, is shrinking.,But as we've heard so many times,,these new technologiesnare dual-edged, right?,Take the case of law enforcement.,Police around the world are startingnto use remote sensing and big data,to anticipate crime.,Some cops are able to predictncriminal violence before it even happens.,The future crime scenario,nit's here today,,and we've got to be careful.,We have to manage the issuesnof the public safety,against rights to individual privacy. 
 But it's not just the copsnwho are innovating.,We've heard extraordinary activitiesnof civil society groups,who are engaging in local nand global collective action,,and this is leading to digital protestnand real revolution.,But most worryingnof all are criminal gangs,who are going onlinenand starting to colonize cyberspace.,In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,nwhere I've been working,,groups like the Zetasnand the Sinaloa cartel,are hijacking social media.,They're using it to recruit,nto sell their products,,to coerce, to intimidate and to kill.,Violence is going virtual. 
 So this is just a partial sketch,of a fast-moving and dynamicnand complex situation.,I mean, there are many other megarisks,that are going to definenfragility in our time,,not least income inequality,,poverty, climate change, impunity.,But we're facing a stark dilemma,where some cities are going to thrivenand drive global growth,and others are going to stumblenand pull it backwards.,If we're going to change course,nwe need to start a conversation.,We can't only focusnon those cities that work,,the Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs,,the Dubais, the Shanghais.,We've got to bring those fragile citiesninto the conversation. 
 One way to do this might bento start twinning,our fragile cities with our healthiernand wealthier ones,,kickstarting a process of learningnand collaboration,and sharing of practices,nof what works and what doesn't.,A wonderful example of this is comingnfrom El Salvador and Los Angeles,,where the mayors in San Salvadornand Los Angeles are collaborating,on getting ex-gang membersnto work with current gang members,,offering tutoring, education,,and in the process are helpingnincubate cease-fires and truces,,and we've seen homicide ratesngo down in San Salvador,,once the world's most violent city,,by 50 percent.,We can also focus non hot cities, but also hot spots.,Place and location matter fundamentallynin shaping violence in our cities.,Did you know that betweennone and two percent,of street addresses in any fragile city,can predict up to 99 percentnof violent crime?,Take the case of São Paulo,nwhere I've been working.,It's gone from being Brazil's mostndangerous city to one of its safest,,and it did this by doubling down,on information collection,nhot spot mapping, and police reform,,and in the process, it dropped homicidenby 70 percent in just over 10 years.,We also got to focus on those hot people.,It's tragic, but being young,nunemployed, uneducated, male,,increases the risksnof being killed and killing.,We have to break this cycle of violence,and get in there early with our children,nour youngest children,,and valorize them, not stigmatize them.,There's wonderful work that's happeningnthat I've been involved with,in Kingston, Jamaicanand right here in Rio,,which is putting education,nemployment, recreation,up front for these high-risk groups,,and as a result, we're seeing violencengoing down in their communities. 
 We've also got to make our cities safer,nmore inclusive, and livable for all.,The fact is, social cohesion matters.,Mobility matters in our cities.,We've got to get away from this modelnof segregation, exclusion,,and cities with walls.,My favorite example of how to do thisncomes from Medellín.,When I lived in Colombianin the late 1990s,,Medellín was the murder capital nof the world, but it changed course,,and it did this by deliberately investingnin its low-income and most violent areas,and integrating themnwith the middle-class ones,through a network of cable cars,,of public transport,nand first-class infrastructure,,and in the process, it dropped homicidenby 79 percent in just under two decades. 
 And finally, there's technology.,Technology has enormousnpromise but also peril.,We've seen examples herenof extraordinary innovation,,and much of it coming from this room,,The police are engaging nin predictive analytics.,Citizens are engagingnin new crowdsourcing solutions.,Even my own group is involvednin developing applications,to provide more accountability over policenand increase safety among citizens.,But we need to be careful. 
 If I have one singlenmessage for you, it's this:,There is nothing inevitablenabout lethal violence,,and we can make our cities safer.,Folks, we have the opportunitynof a lifetime to drop homicidal violence,in half within our lifetime.,So I have just one question:,What are we waiting for? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So recently, we heard a lot aboutnhow social media helps empower protest,,and that's true,,but after more than a decade,of studying and participatingnin multiple social movements,,I've come to realize,that the way technologynempowers social movements,can also paradoxically help weaken them.,This is not inevitable,nbut overcoming it requires diving deep,into what makes success possiblenover the long term.,And the lessons apply in multiple domains. 
 Now, take Turkey'snGezi Park protests, July 2013,,which I went back to study in the field.,Twitter was key to its organizing.,It was everywhere in the park --nwell, along with a lot of tear gas.,It wasn't all high tech.,But the people in Turkey had alreadyngotten used to the power of Twitter,because of an unfortunate incidentnabout a year before,when military jets had bombed and killed,34 Kurdish smugglersnnear the border region,,and Turkish media completelyncensored this news.,Editors sat in their newsrooms,and waited for the governmentnto tell them what to do.,One frustrated journalistncould not take this anymore.,He purchased his own plane ticket,,and went to the villagenwhere this had occurred.,And he was confronted by this scene:,a line of coffins coming down a hill,nrelatives wailing.,He later he told menhow overwhelmed he felt,,and didn't know what to do,,so he took out his phone,,like any one of us might,,and snapped that picturenand tweeted it out.,And voila, that picture went viral,and broke the censorshipnand forced mass media to cover it. 
 So when, a year later,nTurkey's Gezi protests happened,,it started as a protestnabout a park being razed,,but became an anti-authoritarian protest.,It wasn't surprisingnthat media also censored it,,but it got a little ridiculous at times.,When things were so intense,,when CNN Internationalnwas broadcasting live from Istanbul,,CNN Turkey instead was broadcastingna documentary on penguins.,Now, I love penguin documentaries,nbut that wasn't the news of the day.,An angry viewer put his two screensntogether and snapped that picture,,and that one too went viral,,and since then, people call Turkish medianthe penguin media. (Laughter) 
 But this time, people knew what to do.,They just took out their phonesnand looked for actual news.,Better, they knew to go to the parknand take pictures and participate,and share it more on social media.,Digital connectivity was usednfor everything from food to donations.,Everything was organized partiallynwith the help of these new technologies. 
 And using Internet to mobilizenand publicize protests,actually goes back a long way.,Remember the Zapatistas,,the peasant uprisingnin the southern Chiapas region of Mexico,led by the masked, pipe-smoking,ncharismatic Subcomandante Marcos?,That was probably the first movement,that got global attentionnthanks to the Internet.,Or consider Seattle '99,,when a multinational grassroots effortnbrought global attention,to what was then an obscure organization,nthe World Trade Organization,,by also utilizing these digitalntechnologies to help them organize.,And more recently, movement after movement,has shaken country after country:,the Arab uprisings from Bahrainnto Tunisia to Egypt and more;,indignados in Spain, Italy, Greece;nthe Gezi Park protests;,Taiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.,And think of more recent initiatives,nlike the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags.,Nowadays, a network of tweetsncan unleash a global awareness campaign.,A Facebook page can become the hubnof a massive mobilization.,Amazing. 
 But think of the moments I just mentioned.,The achievements they werenable to have, their outcomes,,are not really proportionalnto the size and energy they inspired.,The hopes they rightfully raisednare not really matched,by what they were able to havenas a result in the end.,And this raises a question:,As digital technology makes thingsneasier for movements,,why haven't successful outcomesnbecome more likely as well?,In embracing digital platformsnfor activism and politics,,are we overlooking some of the benefitsnof doing things the hard way?,Now, I believe so.,I believe that the rule of thumb is:,Easier to mobilize does not always meanneasier to achieve gains. 
 Now, to be clear,,technology does empower in multiple ways.,It's very powerful.,In Turkey, I watchednfour young college students,organize a countrywide citizen journalismnnetwork called 140Journos,that became the central hubnfor uncensored news in the country.,In Egypt, I saw another four young peoplenuse digital connectivity,to organize the supplies and logisticsnfor 10 field hospitals,,very large operations,,during massive clashesnnear Tahrir Square in 2011.,And I asked the foundernof this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,,how long it took him to go from whennhe had the idea to when he got started.,"Five minutes," he said. Five minutes.,And he had no trainingnor background in logistics.,Or think of the Occupy movementnwhich rocked the world in 2011.,It started with a single email,from a magazine, Adbusters,nto 90,000 subscribers in its list.,About two months after that first email,,there were in the United Statesn600 ongoing occupations and protests.,Less than one month after the firstnphysical occupation in Zuccotti Park,,a global protest was heldnin about 82 countries, 950 cities.,It was one of the largestnglobal protests ever organized. 
 Now, compare that to what the Civil RightsnMovement had to do in 1955 Alabama,to protest the racially segregatednbus system, which they wanted to boycott.,They'd been preparing for many years,and decided it was timento swing into action,after Rosa Parks was arrested.,But how do you get the word out --,tomorrow we're going tonstart the boycott --,when you don't have Facebook,ntexting, Twitter, none of that?,So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets,by sneaking into a universitynduplicating room,and working all night, secretly.,They then used the 68nAfrican-American organizations,that criss-crossed the citynto distribute those leaflets by hand.,And the logistical tasks were daunting,nbecause these were poor people.,They had to get to work, boycott or no,,so a massive carpool was organized,,again by meeting.,No texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.,They had to meet almost all the timento keep this carpool going. 
 Today, it would be so much easier.,We could create a database,navailable rides and what rides you need,,have the database coordinate,nand use texting.,We wouldn't have to meet all that much.,But again, consider this:,the Civil Rights Movementnin the United States,navigated a minefieldnof political dangers,,faced repression and overcame,nwon major policy concessions,,navigated and innovated through risks.,In contrast, three yearsnafter Occupy sparked,that global conversation about inequality,,the policies that fueled itnare still in place.,Europe was also rockednby anti-austerity protests,,but the continentndidn't shift its direction.,In embracing these technologies,,are we overlooking some of the benefitsnof slow and sustained?,To understand this,,I went back to Turkeynabout a year after the Gezi protests,and I interviewed a range of people,,from activists to politicians,,from both the ruling partynand the opposition party and movements.,I found that the Gezi protestersnwere despairing.,They were frustrated,,and they had achieved much lessnthan what they had hoped for.,This echoed what I'd been hearingnaround the world,from many other protestersnthat I'm in touch with.,And I've come to realizenthat part of the problem,is that today's protests have becomena bit like climbing Mt. Everest,with the help of 60 Sherpas,,and the Internet is our Sherpa.,What we're doing is taking the fast routes,and not replacing the benefitsnof the slower work.,Because, you see,,the kind of work that went into organizing,all those daunting,ntedious logistical tasks,did not just take care of those tasks,,they also created the kind of organizationnthat could think together collectively,and make hard decisions together,,create consensus and innovate,nand maybe even more crucially,,keep going together through differences.,So when you see thisnMarch on Washington in 1963,,when you look at that picture,,where this is the march wherenMartin Luther King gave his famous,"I have a dream" speech, 1963,,you don't just see a marchnand you don't just hear a powerful speech,,you also see the painstaking,nlong-term work that can put on that march.,And if you're in power,,you realize you have to takenthe capacity signaled by that march,,not just the march, but the capacitynsignaled by that march, seriously.,In contrast, when you looknat Occupy's global marches,that were organized in two weeks,,you see a lot of discontent,,but you don't necessarily see teeth thatncan bite over the long term.,And crucially, the Civil Rights Movementninnovated tactically,from boycotts to lunch counter sit-insnto pickets to marches to freedom rides.,Today's movements scale up very quicklynwithout the organizational base,that can see them through the challenges.,They feel a little like startupsnthat got very big,without knowing what to do next,,and they rarely manage to shift tactically,because they don't haventhe depth of capacity,to weather such transitions. 
 Now, I want to be clear:nThe magic is not in the mimeograph.,It's in that capacity to work together,nthink together collectively,,which can only be builtnover time with a lot of work.,To understand all this,,I interviewed a top officialnfrom the ruling party in Turkey,,and I ask him, "How do you do it?",They too use digital technologynextensively, so that's not it.,So what's the secret?,Well, he told me.,He said the key isnhe never took sugar with his tea.,I said, what has thatngot to do with anything?,Well, he said, his party startsngetting ready for the next election,the day after the last one,,and he spends all day every daynmeeting with voters in their homes,,in their wedding parties,ncircumcision ceremonies,,and then he meets with his colleaguesnto compare notes.,With that many meetings every day,nwith tea offered at every one of them,,which he could not refuse,nbecause that would be rude,,he could not take even one cube of sugarnper cup of tea,,because that would be many kilos of sugar,nhe can't even calculate how many kilos,,and at that point I realizednwhy he was speaking so fast.,We had met in the afternoon,nand he was already way over-caffeinated.,But his party won two major elections,within a year of the Gezi protestsnwith comfortable margins.,To be sure, governments havendifferent resources to bring to the table.,It's not the same game,nbut the differences are instructive.,And like all such stories, this is notna story just of technology.,It's what technology allows us to donconverging with what we want to do.,Today's social movementsnwant to operate informally.,They do not want institutional leadership.,They want to stay out of politics becausenthey fear corruption and cooptation.,They have a point.,Modern representative democraciesnare being strangled in many countries,by powerful interests.,But operating this waynmakes it hard for them,to sustain over the long termnand exert leverage over the system,,which leads to frustratednprotesters dropping out,,and even more corrupt politics.,And politics and democracynwithout an effective challenge hobbles,,because the causes that have inspirednthe modern recent movements are crucial.,Climate change is barreling towards us.,Inequality is stifling human growthnand potential and economies.,Authoritarianism is chokingnmany countries.,We need movements to be more effective. 
 Now, some people have arguednthat the problem is,today's movements are not formed of peoplenwho take as many risks as before,,and that is not true.,From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere,,I've seen people put their livesnand livelihoods on the line.,It's also not true,nas Malcolm Gladwell claimed,,that today's protestersnform weaker virtual ties.,No, they come to these protests,njust like before,,with their friends, existing networks,,and sometimes they donmake new friends for life.,I still see the friends that I made,in those Zapatista-convenednglobal protests more than a decade ago,,and the bonds between strangersnare not worthless.,When I got tear-gassed in Gezi,,people I didn't know helped menand one another instead of running away.,In Tahrir, I saw people, protesters,,working really hard to keepneach other safe and protected.,And digital awareness-raising is great,,because changing mindsnis the bedrock of changing politics.,But movements today have to move beyondnparticipation at great scale very fast,and figure out hownto think together collectively,,develop strong policy proposals,ncreate consensus,,figure out the political stepsnand relate them to leverage,,because all these good intentionsnand bravery and sacrifice by itself,are not going to be enough. 
 And there are many efforts.,In New Zealand, a group of young peoplenare developing a platform called Loomio,for participatoryndecision making at scale.,In Turkey, 140Journosnare holding hack-a-thons,so that they support communitiesnas well as citizen journalism.,In Argentina, an open-source platformncalled DemocracyOS,is bringing participationnto parliaments and political parties.,These are all great, and we need more,,but the answer won't just benbetter online decision-making,,because to update democracy, we are goingnto need to innovate at every level,,from the organizationalnto the political to the social.,Because to succeed over the long term,,sometimes you do need tea without sugar,along with your Twitter.,Thank you.,(Applause)When I arrived in Kiev,,on February 1 this year,,Independence Square was under siege,,surrounded by policenloyal to the government.,The protesters who occupied Maidan,,as the square is known,,prepared for battle,,stockpiling homemade weapons,and mass-producing improvised body armor.,The Euromaidan protests began peacefullynat the end of 2013,,after the president of Ukraine,nViktor Yanukovych,,rejected a far-reaching accordnwith the European Union,in favor of stronger ties with Russia.,In response, tens of thousandsnof dissatisfied citizens,poured into central Kievnto demonstrate against this allegiance. 
 As the months passed,,confrontations between policenand civilians intensified.,I set up a makeshift portrait studionby the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.,There, I photographednthe fighters against a black curtain,,a curtain that obscurednthe highly seductive and visual backdrop,of fire, ice and smoke.,In order to tell the individualnhuman stories here,,I felt that I needed to removenthe dramatic visuals,that had become so familiar and repetitivenwithin the mainstream media.,What I was witnessingnwas not only news, but also history.,With this realization,,I was free fromnthe photojournalistic conventions,of the newspaper and the magazine.,Oleg, Vasiliy and Maximnwere all ordinary men,,with ordinary lives from ordinary towns.,But the elaborate costumesnthat they had bedecked themselves in,were quite extraordinary.,I say the word "costume",because these were not clothesnthat had been issued,or coordinated by anyone.,They were improvised uniforms,made up of decommissionednmilitary equipment,,irregular combat fatiguesnand trophies taken from the police.,I became interested in the way theynwere choosing to represent themselves,,this outward expression of masculinity,,the ideal of the warrior. 
 I worked slowly,nusing an analog film camera,with a manual focusing loopnand a handheld light meter.,The process is old-fashioned.,It gives me time to speak with each person,and to look at them, in silence,nwhile they look back at me. 
 Rising tensions culminatednin the worst day of violence,on February 20,,which became known as Bloody Thursday.,Snipers, loyal to the government,,started firing on the civiliansnand protesters on Institutskaya Street.,Many were killednin a very short space of time.,The reception of the Hotel Ukrainenbecame a makeshift morgue.,There were linesnof bodies laid in the street.,And there was bloodnall over the pavements.,The following day,nPresident Yanukovych fled Ukraine.,In all, three months of protests,resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead,and many more missing.,History unfolded quickly,,but celebration remainednelusive in Maidan. 
 As the days passednin Kiev's central square,,streams of armed fighters,were joined by tens of thousandsnof ordinary people,,filling the streets in an actnof collective mourning.,Many were women who often carried flowers,that they had brought to laynas marks of respect for the dead.,They came day after day,and they covered the squarenwith millions of flowers.,Sadness enveloped Maidan.,It was quiet and I could hearnthe birds singing.,I hadn't heard that before. 
 I stopped womennas they approached the barricades,to lay their tributes,and asked to make their picture.,Most women cried when I photographed them.,On the first day,nmy fixer, Emine, and I cried,with almost every womannwho visited our studio.,There had been such a noticeablenabsence of women,up until that point.,And the color of their pastel coats,,their shiny handbags,,and the bunches of red carnations,,white tulips and yellow rosesnthat they carried,jarred with the blackened square,and the blackened mennwho were encamped there. 
 It is clear to menthat these two sets of pictures,don't make much sense without the other.,They are about men and womennand the way we are --,not the way we look,nbut the way we are.,They speak about differentngender roles in conflict,,not only in Maidan,nand not only in Ukraine.,Men fight most wars and women mourn them.,If the men showednthe ideal of the warrior,,then the women showednthe implications of such violence. 
 When I made these pictures,,I believed that I was documentingnthe end of violent events in Ukraine.,But now I understandnthat it is a record of the beginning.,Today, the death toll stands around 3,000,,while hundreds of thousandsnhave been displaced.,I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.,In Maidan, the barricadesnhave been dismantled,,and the paving stones which were usednas weapons during the protests replaced,,so that traffic flows freelynthrough the center of the square.,The fighters, the womennand the flowers are gone.,A huge billboard depicting geesenflying over a wheat field,covers the burned-out shellnof the trade union's building,and proclaims,,"Glory to Ukraine.,Glory to heroes.",Thank you.,(Applause).The shocking police crackdownnon protestors in Ferguson, Missouri,,in the wake of the police nshooting of Michael Brown,,underscored the extent to which advancednmilitary weapons and equipment,,designed for the battlefield,,are making their way,to small-town police departmentsnacross the United States.,Although much tougher to observe,,this same thing is happening nwith surveillance equipment. 
 NSA-style mass nsurveillance is enabling,local police departments nto gather vast quantities,of sensitive informationnabout each and every one of us,in a way that wasnnever previously possible. 
 Location information can nbe very sensitive.,If you drive your car aroundnthe United States,,it can reveal if you go nto a therapist,,attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,,if you go to church nor if you don't go to church.,And when that ninformation about you,is combined with the same informationnabout everyone else,,the government can gain na detailed portrait,of how private citizens interact. 
 This information used to be private.,Thanks to modern technology,,the government knows far too muchnabout what happens behind closed doors.,And local police departments makendecisions about who they think you are,based on this information. 
 One of the key technologies ndriving mass location tracking,is the innocuous-soundingnAutomatic License Plate Reader.,If you haven't seen one,,it's probably because you didn'tnknow what to look for --,they're everywhere.,Mounted on roads or non police cars,,Automatic License Plate Readersncapture images of every passing car,and convert the license plateninto machine-readable text,so that they can be checkednagainst hot lists,of cars potentially wantednfor wrongdoing. 
 But more than that, increasingly,,local police departments nare keeping records,not just of people wanted for wrongdoing,,but of every plate that npasses them by,,resulting in the collectionnof mass quantities of data,about where Americans have gone.,Did you know thisnwas happening? 
 When Mike Katz-Lacabe askednhis local police department,for information about the platenreader data they had on him,,this is what they got:,in addition to the date, ntime and location,,the police department had nphotographs that captured,where he was going and noften who he was with.,The second photo from the topnis a picture of Mike and his two daughters,getting out of their carnin their own driveway.,The government has nhundreds of photos like this,about Mike going about his daily life.,And if you drive a car nin the United States,,I would bet money nthat they have photographs,like this of you goingnabout your daily life. 
 Mike hasn't done anything wrong.,Why is it okay that the governmentnis keeping all of this information?,The reason it's happening is because,,as the cost of storingnthis data has plummeted,,the police departmentsnsimply hang on to it,,just in case it could be useful someday.,The issue is not just thatnone police department,is gathering this information in isolation,or even that multiple police ndepartments are doing it.,At the same time, the federal government,is collecting all of thesenindividual pots of data,,and pooling them together ninto one vast database,with hundreds of millions of hits,,showing where Americans have traveled.,This document from the nFederal Drug Enforcement Administration,,which is one of the agenciesnprimarily interested in this,,is one of several that reveal nthe existence of this database.,Meanwhile, in New York City,,the NYPD has driven police carsnequipped with license plate readers,past mosques in order tonfigure out who is attending. 
 The uses and abuses of this technologynaren't limited to the United States.,In the U.K., the police department,put 80-year-old John Katnon a plate reader watch list,after he had attended dozens ofnlawful political demonstrations,where he liked to sit on a benchnand sketch the attendees. 
 License plate readers aren't thenonly mass location tracking technology,available to law enforcement agents today.,Through a technique known asna cell tower dump,,law enforcement agents cannuncover who was using,one or more cell towersnat a particular time,,a technique which has been known to reveal,the location of tens of thousandsnand even hundreds of thousands of people.,Also, using a device known as a StingRay,,law enforcement agentsncan send tracking signals,inside people's housesnto identify the cell phones located there.,And if they don't knownwhich house to target,,they've been known nto drive this technology,around through whole neighborhoods. 
 Just as the police in Ferguson possessnhigh-tech military weapons and equipment,,so too do police departments acrossnthe United States,possess high-tech surveillance gear.,Just because you don't see it,,doesn't mean it's not there. 
 The question is, what shouldnwe do about this?,I think this poses a seriousncivil liberties threat.,History has shown that once the police nhave massive quantities of data,,tracking the movements of innocent people,,it gets abused, maybe for blackmail,nmaybe for political advantage,,or maybe for simple voyeurism. 
 Fortunately, there are steps we can take.,Local police departments can nbe governed by the city councils,,which can pass laws requiring the police,to dispose of the data nabout innocent people,while allowing the legitimatenuses of the technology to go forward.,Thank you.,(Applause).I want you guys to imagine nthat you're a soldier,running through the battlefield.,Now, you're shot in the leg with a bullet,,which severs your femoral artery.,Now, this bleed is extremely traumatic,and can kill you in less nthan three minutes.,Unfortunately, by the time that a medic,actually gets to you,,what the medic has on his or her belt,can take five minutes or more,,with the application of pressure,nto stop that type of bleed. 
 Now, this problem is nnot only a huge problem,for the military, but it's nalso a huge problem,that's epidemic throughout nthe entire medical field,,which is how do we actually look at wounds,and how do we stop them quickly,in a way that can work with the body? 
 So now, what I've been workingnon for the last four years,is to develop smart biomaterials,,which are actually materials that will work,with the body, helping it to heal,and helping it to allow the nwounds to heal normally. 
 So now, before we do this, we nhave to take a much closer look,at actually how does the body work.,So now, everybody here knows,that the body is made up of cells.,So the cell is the most basic unit of life.,But not many people know what else.,But it actually turns out that your cells,sit in this mesh of complicated fibers,,proteins and sugars,known as the extracellular matrix.,So now, the ECM,is actually this mesh that nholds the cells in place,,provides structure for your tissues,,but it also gives the cells a home.,It allows them to feel what they're doing,,where they are, and tells them,how to act and how to behave. 
 And it actually turns out that nthe extracellular matrix,is different from every nsingle part of the body.,So the ECM in my skin,is different than the ECM in my liver,,and the ECM in different nparts of the same organ,actually vary, so it's very difficult,to be able to have a product,that will react to the nlocal extracellular matrix,,which is exactly what we're trying to do.,So now, for example, nthink of the rainforest.,You have the canopy, nyou have the understory,,and you have the forest floor.,Now, all of these parts of the forest,are made up of different plants,,and different animals call them home.,So just like that, the extracellular matrix,is incredibly diverse in three dimensions.,On top of that, the extracellular matrix,is responsible for all wound healing,,so if you imagine cutting the body,,you actually have to rebuild,this very complex ECM,in order to get it to form again,,and a scar, in fact, is actually,poorly formed extracellular matrix. 
 So now, behind me is an animation,of the extracellular matrix.,So as you see, your cells sit nin this complicated mesh,and as you move throughout the tissue,,the extracellular matrix changes.,So now every other piece nof technology on the market,can only manage a two-ndimensional approximation,of the extracellular matrix,,which means that it doesn't fit in,with the tissue itself. 
 So when I was a freshman at NYU,,what I discovered was nyou could actually take,small pieces of plant-derived polymers,and reassemble them onto the wound.,So if you have a bleeding nwound like the one behind me,,you can actually put nour material onto this,,and just like Lego blocks,,it'll reassemble into the local tissue.,So that means if you put it onto liver,,it turns into something nthat looks like liver,,and if you put it onto skin,,it turns into something nthat looks just like skin.,So when you put the gel on,,it actually reassembles ninto this local tissue.,So now, this has a whole nbunch of applications,,but basically the idea is,nwherever you put this product,,you're able to reassemble ninto it immediately. 
 Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed —,blood warning —,at twice human artery pressure.,So now, this type of bleed nis incredibly traumatic,,and like I said before, nwould actually take,five minutes or more with pressure,to be able to stop.,Now, in the time that it takesnme to introduce the bleed itself,,our material is able to stop that bleed,,and it's because it actually ngoes on and works,with the body to heal,,so it reassembles into this piece of meat,,and then the blood actually recognizes,that that's happening, nand produces fibrin,,producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds. 
 So now this technology — Thank you.,(Applause) 
 So now this technology, by January,nwill be in the hands of veterinarians,,and we're working very diligently to ntry to get it into the hands of doctors,,hopefully within the next year. 
 But really, once again, I nwant you guys to imagine,that you are a soldier running nthrough a battlefield.,Now, you get hit in the leg with a bullet,,and instead of bleeding nout in three minutes,,you pull a small pack nof gel out of your belt,,and with the press of a button,,you're able to stop your own bleed,and you're on your way to recovery. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)As an Arab female photographer,,I have always found ample inspirationnfor my projects in personal experiences.,The passion I developed for knowledge,,which allowed me to break barriersntowards a better life,was the motivation nfor my project I Read I Write. 
 Pushed by my own experience,,as I was not allowed initiallynto pursue my higher education,,I decided to explore and documentnstories of other women,who changed their lives through education,,while exposing and questioningnthe barriers they face.,I covered a range of topicsnthat concern women's education,,keeping in mind the differencesnamong Arab countries,due to economic and social factors.,These issues include female illiteracy,nwhich is quite high in the region;,educational reforms;nprograms for dropout students;,and political activismnamong university students.,As I started this work,,it was not always easy nto convince the women to participate.,Only after explaining to them,how their storiesnmight influence other women's lives,,how they would become role modelsnfor their own community, did some agree.,Seeking a collaborativenand reflexive approach,,I asked them to writentheir own words and ideas,on prints of their own images.,Those images were then sharednin some of the classrooms,,and worked to inspirenand motivate other women,going through similar educations nand situations.,Aisha, a teacher from Yemen, wrote,,"I sought education in ordernto be independent,and to not count on men with everything." 
 One of my first subjectsnwas Umm El-Saad from Egypt.,When we first met, she wasnbarely able to write her name.,She was attendingna nine-month literacy program,run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs.,Months later, she was jokingnthat her husband,had threatened to pull hernout of the classes,,as he found out that his now literate wife,was going through his phone text messages.,(Laughter),Naughty Umm El-Saad.,Of course, that's not whynUmm El-Saad joined the program.,I saw how she was longing to gainncontrol over her simple daily routines,,small details that we take for granted,,from counting money at the marketnto helping her kids in homework.,Despite her povertynand her community's mindset,,which belittles women's education,,Umm El-Saad, along withnher Egyptian classmates,,was eager to learn how to read and write. 
 In Tunisia, I met Asma,,one of the four activist womennI interviewed.,The secular bioengineering studentnis quite active on social media.,Regarding her country, which treasurednwhat has been called the Arab Spring,,she said, "I've always dreamtnof discovering a new bacteria.,Now, after the revolution,nwe have a new one every single day.",Asma was referring to the risenof religious fundamentalism in the region,,which is another obstaclento women in particular. 
 Out of all the women I met,nFayza from Yemen affected me the most.,Fayza was forced to drop out of schoolnat the age of eight when she was married.,That marriage lasted for a year.,At 14, she became the third wifenof a 60-year-old man,,and by the time she was 18,nshe was a divorced mother of three.,Despite her poverty,,despite her social status as a divorcéenin an ultra-conservative society,,and despite the opposition of her parentsnto her going back to school,,Fayza knew that her only waynto control her life was through education.,She is now 26.,She received a grant from a local NGO,to fund her business studiesnat the university.,Her goal is to find a job,nrent a place to live in,,and bring her kids back with her. 
 The Arab states are going throughntremendous change,,and the struggles women facenare overwhelming.,Just like the women I photographed,,I had to overcome many barriersnto becoming the photographer I am today,,many people along the wayntelling me what I can and cannot do.,Umm El-Saad, Asma and Fayza,nand many women across the Arab world,,show that it is possiblento overcome barriers to education,,which they know is the best meansnto a better future.,And here I would like to endnwith a quote by Yasmine,,one of the four activist womennI interviewed in Tunisia.,Yasmine wrote,,"Question your convictions.,Be who you to want to be,nnot who they want you to be.,Don't accept their enslavement,nfor your mother birthed you free." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I would like to start,with the story of Mary,,a woman from an African village.,Her first memories,are of her family fleeing violent riots,orchestrated by nthe ruling political party.,Her brother was murderednby the state-sponsored militia,,and she was raped more than once,just because she belongednto the wrong party. 
 One morning, a month before the election,,Mary's village was called nto another intimidation meeting.,In this meeting, there is a mannstanding in front of them,,telling them, "We know who you are,,we know who you will vote for,,and if you're not goingnto drop the right paper,,we're going to take revenge.",But for Mary, this meeting is different.,She feels different.,This time, she's waiting for this meeting,,because this time, she's carryingna small hidden camera in her dress,,a camera that nobody else can see.,Nobody is allowed to filmnin these meetings.,You risk your life if you do.,Mary knows that, but she also knowsnthat the only way to stop them,and to protect herself and her community,is to expose their intimidation,,to make sure they understandnsomebody is following them,,to break the impunity they feel.,Mary and her friends were filmingnfor months, undercover,,the intimidation ofnthe ruling political party. 
 (Video) ["Filmed with hidden cameras"] 
 Man: We are now going to speaknabout the upcoming elections.,Nothing can stop us nfrom doing what we want.,If we hear you are with [The Opposition],we will not forgive you. 
 ["Militia intimidation rally"] 
 [The Party] can torture you at any time.,The youth can beat you. 
 ["Disruption of political meeting"] 
 For those who lie, saying they nare back with [The Party],,your time is running out. 
 ["Party youth militia"] 
 Some have died because they rebelled.,Some have lost their homes.,If you don't work together nwith [The Party],,you will lead a very bad life. 
 Oren Yakobovich: These imagesnwere broadcast all over the world,,but more importantly,,they have been broadcastnback to the community.,The perpetrators saw them too.,They understood somebodynis following them.,They got scared. Impunity was broken.,Mary and her friends forcednthe ruling political party,not to use violence during the election,,and saved hundreds of lives.,Mary is just one of hundreds of people,that my organization had helped nto document human rights violations,using cameras. 
 My background should havenled me to a different direction.,I was born in Israelnto a right-wing family,,and as long as I remember myself,,I wanted to join the Israeli armynto serve my country,and prove what I believed nwas our right for the whole land.,I joined the Israeli army njust after the first intifada,,the first Palestinian uprising,,and I served in one of the hard-minded,,toughest, aggressive infantry units,,and I got the biggest gun in my platoon.,Quite fast, I became an officer,and got soldiers under my command,,and as time passed, I startednserving in the West Bank,,and I saw these images.,I didn't like what I saw.,It took me a while,,but eventually I refusednto serve in the West Bank,and had to spend time in jail.,It was a bit —,(Applause) —,It was not that bad, I have to say.,It was a bit like being in a hotel,nbut with very shitty food.,(Laughter) 
 In jail, I kept thinking nthat I need people to know.,I need people to understand,what the realitynin the West Bank looks like.,I need them to hear what I heard,,I need them to see what I saw,,but I also understood, we need nthe Palestinians themselves,,the people that are suffering,,to be able to tell their own stories,,not journalists or filmmakersnthat are coming outside of the situation. 
 I joined a human rights organization,,an Israeli human rights norganization called B'Tselem.,Together, we analyzed the West Bank,and picked 100 families thatnare living in the most risky places:,close to checkpoints, near army bases,,side by side with settlers.,We gave them cameras and training.,Quite fast, we started gettingnvery disturbing images,about how the settlers nand the soldiers are abusing them. 
 I would like to share with yountwo clips from this project.,Both of them were broadcast in Israel,nand it created a massive debate.,And I have to warn you,,some of you might nfind them quite explicit.,The masked men you nwill see in the first clips,are Jewish settlers.,Minutes before the camera was turned on,,they approached a Palestinian family,that was working their land,and told them that theynhave to leave the land,,because this land belongsnto the Jewish settlers.,The Palestinians refused.,Let's see what happened.,The masked men that are approachingnare Jewish settlers.,They are approachingnthe Palestinian family.,This is a demonstration in the West Bank.,The guy in green is Palestinian.,He will be arrested in a second.,Here you see himnblindfolded and handcuffed.,In a few seconds, he regrets nhe came to this demonstration.,He's been shot in the footnwith a rubber bullet.,He is okay. 
 Not all the settlers and the soldiersnare acting this way.,We're talking about a tiny minority,nbut they have to be brought to justice.,These clips, and others like them,,forced the army and the policento start investigations.,They've been shown in Israel, of course,,and the Israeli publicnwas exposed to them also.,This project redefinednthe struggle for human rights,in the occupied territories,,and we managed to reduce the number nof violent attacks in the West Bank. 
 The success of this projectngot me thinking,how I can take the same methodologynto other places in the world.,Now, we tend to believe that today,,with all of the technology,,the smartphones and the Internet,,we are able to see and understandnmost of what's happening in the world,,and people are able to tell their story —,but it's only partly true.,Still today, with allnthe technology we have,,less than half of the world's population,has access to the Internet,,and more than three billion people —,I'm repeating the number —,three billion people are consuming newsnthat is censored by those in power.,More or less around the same time,,I'm approached by a great guynnamed Uri Fruchtmann.,He's a filmmaker and an activist.,We understood we werenthinking along the same lines,,and we decided to establish Videre,nour organization, together.,While building the organization in London,,we've been traveling undercover to places,where a community nwas suffering from abuses,,where mass atrocities were happening,,and there was a lack of reporting.,We tried to understand how we can help. 
 There were four things that I learned.,The first thing is that we have to engage,with communities that arenliving in rural areas,,where violations are happeningnfar from the public eye.,We need to partner with them,,and we need to understand which imagesnare not making it out there,and help them to document them. 
 The second thing I learned,is that we have to enable them nto film in a safe way.,Security has to be the priority.,Where I used to work before,nin the West Bank,,one can take a camera out,,most likely not going to get shot,,but in places we wanted to work,,just try to pull a phone out,nand you're dead — literally dead.,This is why we decided,to take the operation undercover,when necessary,,and use mostly hidden cameras.,Unfortunately, I can't show younthe hidden cameras we're using today —,for obvious reasons —,but these are cameras we used before.,You can buy them off the shelf.,Today, we're building na custom-made hidden camera,,like the one that Mary was wearing,in her dress to filmnthe intimidation meeting,of the ruling political party.,It's a camera that nobody can see,,that blends into the environment,,into the surroundings.,Now, filming securities go beyondnusing hidden cameras.,Being secure starts way beforenthe activist is turning the camera on.,To keep our partners safe,,we work to understandnthe risk of every location,and of every shot before it's happened,,building a backup plannif something goes wrong,,and making sure nwe have everything in place,before our operations start. 
 The third thing I learnednis the importance of verification.,You can have an amazing shot of atrocity,,but if you can't verify it,nit's worth nothing.,Recently, like in the ongoing war nin Syria or the war in Gaza,,we've seen images that are staged nor brought from a different conflict.,This misinformation destroyednthe credibility of the source,,and it's harmed the credibility of othernreliable and trustworthy sources.,We use a variety of ways to make surenwe can verify the information,and we can trust the material.,It starts with vetting the partners,,understanding who they are,nand working with them very intensively.,How do you film a location?,You film road signs, you film watches,,you film newspapers.,We are checking maps, looking at maps,,double-checking the information,,and looking also at nthe metadata of the material. 
 Now, the fourth and the mostnimportant thing I learned,is how you use images nto create a positive change.,To have an effect,,the key thing is how you use the material. 
 Today, we're workingnwith hundreds of activists,filming undercover.,We work with them both to understand nthe situation on the ground,and which images nare missing to describe it,,who are the ones that are ninfluencing the situation,,and when to release the materialnto advance the struggle.,Sometimes, it's aboutnputting it in the media,,mostly local ones, to create awareness.,Sometimes it's workingnwith decision makers,,to change laws.,Sometimes, it's working with lawyersnto use as evidence in court.,But more than often,,the most effective waynto create a social change,is to work within the community. 
 I want to give you one example.,Fatuma is part of a network of womennthat are fighting abuses in Kenya.,Women in her communitynhave been harassed constantly,on their way to schoolnand on their way to work.,They are trying to change nthe behavior of the community from inside.,In the next clip,,Fatuma is taking us with hernon her journey to work.,Her voice is superimposednon images that she filmed herself,using hidden cameras. 
 (Video) Fatuma Chiusiku: nMy name is Fatuma Chiusiku.,I'm 32 years old, a mother,,And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home.,Each morning, I ride the mini-bus,Number 11.,But instead of a peaceful journey to work,,each day begins with fear.,Come with me now,and use my eyes,to feel what I feel.,As I walk, I think to myself:,Will I be touched?,Grabbed?,Violated by this conductor again?,Even the men inside,the way they look at me,touch my body, rub against me,,grab me,,and now, as I sit in my seat,I only wish my mind was fullnof thoughts for my day,,my dreams, my children at school,,but instead I worry aboutnthe moment when we will arrive,and I will be violated again. 
 OY: Today, there is a new frontnin the fight for human rights.,I used to carry a big gun.,Now, I am carrying this.,This is a much more powerfulnand much, much more effective weapon.,But we have to use its power wisely.,By putting the right imagesnin the right hands at the right time,,we can truly create an impact. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What has the War on Drugs ndone to the world?,Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico,,Central America, so many nother parts of the planet,,the global black market estimated,at 300 billion dollars a year,,prisons packed in the nUnited States and elsewhere,,police and military drawn ninto an unwinnable war,that violates basic rights, nand ordinary citizens,just hope they don't get ncaught in the crossfire,,and meanwhile, more people using,more drugs than ever.,It's my country's history nwith alcohol prohibition,and Al Capone, times 50. 
 Which is why it's nparticularly galling to me,as an American that we've nbeen the driving force,behind this global drug war.,Ask why so many countries criminalize,drugs they'd never heard of,,why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize,criminalization over health,,even why most of the money worldwide,for dealing with drug abuse goes not,to helping agencies but those that punish,,and you'll find the good old U.S. of A. 
 Why did we do this?,Some people, especially in Latin America,,think it's not really about drugs.,It's just a subterfuge for advancing,the realpolitik interests of the U.S.,But by and large, that's not it.,We don't want gangsters and guerrillas,funded with illegal drug money,terrorizing and taking over other nations.,No, the fact is, America really is crazy,when it comes to drugs.,I mean, don't forget, we're nthe ones who thought,that we could prohibit alcohol.,So think about our global drug war,not as any sort of rational policy,,but as the international projection,of a domestic psychosis.,(Applause) 
 But here's the good news.,Now it's the Russians leadingnthe Drug War and not us.,Most politicians in my country,want to roll back the Drug War now,,put fewer people behind bars, not more,,and I'm proud to say as an American,that we now lead the world,in reforming marijuana policies.,It's now legal for medical purposes,in almost half our 50 states,,millions of people can npurchase their marijuana,,their medicine, in government-nlicensed dispensaries,,and over half my fellow ncitizens now say it's time,to legally regulate and tax marijuana,more or less like alcohol.,That's what Colorado and nWashington are doing,,and Uruguay, and others nare sure to follow. 
 So that's what I do:,work to end the Drug War.,I think it all started growing up,in a fairly religious, moral family,,eldest son of a rabbi,,going off to university where I,smoked some marijuana,and I liked it. (Laughter),And I liked drinking too, but it was obvious,that alcohol was really thenmore dangerous of the two,,but my friends and I could get busted,for smoking a joint. 
 Now, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,,so I wrote my Ph.D dissertationnon international drug control.,I talked my way into the State Department.,I got a security clearance.,I interviewed hundreds of DEAnand other law enforcement agents,all around Europe and the Americas,,and I'd ask them,,"What do you think the answer is?",Well, in Latin America, they'd say to me,,"You can't really cut off the supply.,The answer lies back in the U.S.,,in cutting off the demand.",So then I go back home and I talk to people,involved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,,"You know, Ethan, you can't nreally cut off the demand.,The answer lies over there.nYou've got to cut off the supply.",Then I'd go and talk nto the guys in customs,trying to stop drugs at the borders,,and they'd say, "You're nnot going to stop it here.,The answer lies over there,,in cutting off supply and demand.",And it hit me:,Everybody involved in this,thought the answer lay in that area,about which they knew the least. 
 So that's when I started nreading everything I could,about psychoactive drugs: nthe history, the science,,the politics, all of it,,and the more one read,,the more it hit you how a thoughtful,,enlightened, intelligent napproach took you over here,,whereas the politics and laws of my country,were taking you over here.,And that disparity struck me as this incredible,intellectual and moral puzzle. 
 There's probably never been,a drug-free society.,Virtually every society,has ingested psychoactive substances,to deal with pain, increase nour energy, socialize,,even commune with God.,Our desire to alter our consciousness,may be as fundamental as our desires,for food, companionship and sex.,So our true challenge,is to learn how to live with drugs,so they cause the least possible harm,and in some cases the ngreatest possible benefit. 
 I'll tell you something else I learned,,that the reason some drugs nare legal and others not,has almost nothing to do nwith science or health,or the relative risk of drugs,,and almost everything to do with who uses,and who is perceived nto use particular drugs.,In the late 19th century,,when most of the drugs thatnare now illegal were legal,,the principal consumers nof opiates in my country,and others were middle-aged white women,,using them to alleviate aches and pains,when few other analgesics were available.,And nobody thought about ncriminalizing it back then,because nobody wanted to nput Grandma behind bars.,But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese,started showing up in my country,,working hard on the railroads and the mines,and then kicking back in the evening,just like they had in the old country,with a few puffs on that opium pipe,,that's when you saw the nfirst drug prohibition laws,in California and Nevada,,driven by racist fears of Chinese,transforming white women,into opium-addicted sex slaves.,The first cocaine prohibition nlaws, similarly prompted,by racist fears of black men nsniffing that white powder,and forgetting their proper place,in Southern society.,And the first marijuana prohibition laws,,all about fears of Mexican migrants,in the West and the Southwest.,And what was true in my country,,is true in so many others as well,,with both the origins of these laws,and their implementation.,Put it this way,,and I exaggerate only slightly:,If the principal smokers of cocaine,were affluent older white men,and the principal consumers of Viagra,were poor young black men,,then smokable cocaine would be easy tonget with a prescription from your doctor,and selling Viagra would get you nfive to 10 years behind bars.,(Applause) 
 I used to be a professor teaching about this.,Now I'm an activist, a human rights activist,,and what drives me is my shame,at living in an otherwise great nation,that has less than five percentnof the world's population,but almost 25 percent of thenworld's incarcerated population.,It's the people I meet nwho have lost someone,they love to drug-related nviolence or prison,or overdose or AIDS,because our drug policies emphasize,criminalization over health.,It's good people who have lost their jobs,,their homes, their freedom, neven their children,to the state, not because they hurt anyone,but solely because they chose to use one drug,instead of another. 
 So is legalization the answer?,On that, I'm torn:,three days a week I think yes,nthree days a week I think no,,and on Sundays I'm agnostic.,But since today is Tuesday,,let me just say that legally nregulating and taxing,most of the drugs that nare now criminalized,would radically reduce nthe crime, violence,,corruption and black markets,,and the problems of adulteratednand unregulated drugs,,and improve public safety,,and allow taxpayer resources to be developed,to more useful purposes.,I mean, look, the markets nin marijuana, cocaine,,heroin and methamphetamine,are global commodities markets,just like the global markets nin alcohol, tobacco,,coffee, sugar, and so many other things.,Where there is a demand,,there will be a supply.,Knock out one source and another,inevitably emerges.,People tend to think of prohibition,as the ultimate form of regulation,when in fact it represents nthe abdication of regulation,with criminals filling the void.,Which is why putting criminal laws and police,front and center in trying to control,a dynamic global commodities market,is a recipe for disaster.,And what we really need to do,is to bring the underground drug markets,as much as possible aboveground,and regulate them as nintelligently as we can,to minimize both the harms of drugs,and the harms of prohibitionist policies. 
 Now, with marijuana, that obviously means,legally regulating and ntaxing it like alcohol.,The benefits of doing so arenenormous, the risks minimal.,Will more people use marijuana?,Maybe, but it's not ngoing to be young people,,because it's not going to nbe legalized for them,,and quite frankly, they already have,the best access to marijuana.,I think it's going to be older people.,It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s,and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana,to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill,or that it helps with ntheir arthritis or diabetes,or maybe helps spice up a nlong-term marriage. (Laughter),And that just might be a nnet public health benefit. 
 As for the other drugs,,look at Portugal, where nnobody goes to jail,for possessing drugs,,and the government's made na serious commitment,to treating addiction as a health issue.,Look at Switzerland, nGermany, the Netherlands,,Denmark, England, where people who have,been addicted to heroin for many years,and repeatedly tried to quit and failed,can get pharmaceutical nheroin and helping services,in medical clinics, and nthe results are in:,Illegal drug abuse and disease,and overdoses and crime nand arrests all go down,,health and well-being improve,,taxpayers benefit,,and many drug users evennput their addictions behind them. 
 Look at New Zealand, which nrecently enacted a law,allowing certain recreational ndrugs to be sold legally,provided their safety had been established.,Look here in Brazil, and some other countries,,where a remarkable psychoactive substance,,ayahuasca, can be legally nbought and consumed,provided it's done so nwithin a religious context.,Look in Bolivia and Peru,,where all sorts of products nmade from the coca leaf,,the source of cocaine,,are sold legally over the counter,with no apparent harm to people's public health.,I mean, don't forget, Coca-Colanhad cocaine in it until 1900,,and so far as we know was no more addictive,than Coca-Cola is today. 
 Conversely, think about cigarettes:,Nothing can both hook you nand kill you like cigarettes.,When researchers ask heroin addicts,what's the toughest drug to nquit, most say cigarettes.,Yet in my country and many others,,half of all the people who nwere ever addicted,to cigarettes have quit,without anyone being narrested or put in jail,or sent to a "treatment program",by a prosecutor or a judge.,What did it were higher taxes,and time and place nrestrictions on sale and use,and effective anti-smoking campaigns.,Now, could we reduce smoking even more,by making it totally illegal? Probably.,But just imagine the drug war nightmare,that would result. 
 So the challenges we face today,are twofold.,The first is the policy challenge,of designing and implementing alternatives,to ineffective prohibitionist policies,,even as we need to get nbetter at regulating,and living with the drugs nthat are now legal.,But the second challenge is tougher,,because it's about us.,The obstacles to reform nlie not just out there,in the power of the nprison industrial complex,or other vested interests nthat want to keep things,the way they are,,but within each and every one of us.,It's our fears and our lack of knowledge,and imagination that stands nin the way of real reform.,And ultimately, I think that nboils down to the kids,,and to every parent's desirento put our baby in a bubble,,and the fear that somehowndrugs will pierce that bubble,and put our young ones at risk.,In fact, sometimes it nseems like the entire,War on Drugs gets justified,as one great big child protection act,,which any young person ncan tell you it's not. 
 So here's what I say to teenagers.,First, don't do drugs.,Second, don't do drugs.,Third, if you do do drugs,,there's some things I want you to know,,because my bottom line as your parent is,,come home safely at the end of the night,and grow up and lead a nhealthy and good adulthood.,That's my drug education nmantra: Safety first. 
 So this is what I've dedicated my life to,,to building an organization and a movement,of people who believe we nneed to turn our backs,on the failed prohibitions of the past,and embrace new drug npolicies grounded in science,,compassion, health and human rights,,where people who come fromnacross the political spectrum,and every other spectrum as well,,where people who love our drugs,,people who hate drugs,,and people who don't give na damn about drugs,,but every one of us believes nthat this War on Drugs,,this backward, heartless, ndisastrous War on Drugs,,has got to end. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Ethan,,congrats — quite the reaction.,That was a powerful talk.,Not quite a complete standing O, though,,and I'm guessing that some people here,and maybe a few watching online,,maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend,or whatever who got sick,,maybe died from some drug overdose.,I'm sure you've had thesenpeople approach you before.,What do you say to them? 
 Ethan Nadelmann: Chris, the mostnamazing thing that's happened of late,is that I've met a growing number of people,who have actually nlost a sibling or a child,to a drug overdose,,and 10 years ago, those npeople just wanted to say,,let's line up all the drug ndealers and shoot them,and that will solve it.,And what they've come to understand,is that the Drug War did nnothing to protect their kids.,If anything, it made it more likely,that those kids were put at risk.,And so they're now becoming part of this,drug policy reform movement.,There's other people who have kids,,one's addicted to alcohol, the othernone's addicted to cocaine or heroin,,and they ask themselves the question:,Why does this kid get to ntake one step at a time,and try to get better,and that one's got to deal with jail,and police and criminals all the time?,So everybody's understanding,,the Drug War's not protecting anybody. 
 CA: Certainly in the U.S., nyou've got political gridlock,on most issues.,Is there any realistic chance of anything,actually shifting on this nissue in the next five years? 
 EN: I'd say it's quite remarkable. nI'm getting all these calls,from journalists now who are saying to me,,"Ethan, it seems like the only two issues,advancing politically in America right now,are marijuana law reform and gay marriage.,What are you doing right?",And then you're looking at nbipartisanship breaking out,with, actually, Republicans in the Congress,and state legislatures nallowing bills to be enacted,with majority Democratic support,,so we've gone from being sort of the third rail,,the most fearful issue of American politics,,to becoming one of the most successful. 
 CA: Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal.nEN: Chris, thanks so much. 
 CA: Thank you.nEN: Thank you. (Applause)While preparing for my talk,I was reflecting on my lifenand trying to figure out,where exactly was that momentnwhen my journey began.,A long time passed by,nand I simply couldn't figure out,the beginning or the middlenor the end of my story.,I always used to think that my beginning,was one afternoon in my communitynwhen my mother had told me,that I had escaped threenarranged marriages by the time I was two.,Or one evening when electricity had failednfor eight hours in our community,,and my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,,telling us stories of when he wasna little kid struggling to go to school,while his father, who was a farmer,nwanted him to work in the fields with him.,Or that dark night when I was 16,when three little kids had come to menand they whispered in my ear,that my friend was murderednin something called the honor killings. 
 But then I realized that,,as much as I know that these momentsnhave contributed on my journey,,they have influenced my journey,but they have not beennthe beginning of it,,but the true beginning of my journeynwas in front of a mud house,in upper Sindh of Pakistan,,where my father held the handnof my 14-year-old mother,and they decidednto walk out of the village,to go to a town where they couldnsend their kids to school.,In a way, I feel like my life,is kind of a result of some wise choicesnand decisions they've made. 
 And just like that,nanother of their decisions,was to keep me and my siblingsnconnected to our roots.,While we were living in a communitynI fondly remember as called Ribabad,,which means community of the poor,,my dad made sure that we alsonhad a house in our rural homeland.,I come from an indigenous tribenin the mountains of Balochistan,called Brahui.,Brahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller,nand it is also my language.,Thanks to my father's very strict rulesnabout connecting to our customs,,I had to live a beautiful life of songs, ncultures, traditions, stories, mountains,,and a lot of sheep.,But then, living in two extremes,between the traditions nof my culture, of my village,,and then modern educationnin my school wasn't easy.,I was aware that I was the only girlnwho got to have such freedom,,and I was guilty of it.,While going to schoolnin Karachi and Hyderabad,,a lot of my cousins and childhood friendsnwere getting married off,,some to older men, some in exchange,,some even as second wives.,I got to see the beautiful traditionnand its magic fade in front of me,when I saw that the birth of a girl childnwas celebrated with sadness,,when women were toldnto have patience as their main virtue. 
 Up until I was 16,,I healed my sadness by crying,,mostly at nights nwhen everyone would sleep,and I would sob in my pillow,,until that one night nwhen I found out my friend was killed,in the name of honor. 
 Honor killings is a custom,where men and womennare suspected of having relationships,before or outside of the marriage,,and they're killed by their family for it.,Usually the killer is the brothernor father or the uncle in the family.,The U.N. reports there are about 1,000nhonor murders every year in Pakistan,,and these are only the reported cases. 
 A custom that killsndid not make any sense to me,,and I knew I had to donsomething about it this time.,I was not going to cry myself to sleep.,I was going to do something,nanything, to stop it.,I was 16 -- I started writing poetry,and going door to doorntelling everybody about honor killings,and why it happens,nwhy it should be stopped,,and raising awareness about it,until I actually found a much, much nbetter way to handle this issue. 
 In those days, we were living inna very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.,Every year, during the monsoon seasons,nour house would flood up with water --,rainwater and sewage --,and my mom and dadnwould be taking the water out.,In those days, my dad brought homena huge machine, a computer.,It was so big it looked as if it was goingnto take up half of the only room we had,,and had so many pieces and wiresnthat needed to be connected.,But it was still the most exciting thing,that has ever happenednto me and my sisters.,My oldest brother Ali got to be in chargenof taking care of the computer,,and all of us were givenn10 to 15 minutes every day to use it.,Being the oldest of eight kids,,I got to use it the last,,and that was afternI had washed the dishes,,cleaned the house,nmade dinner with my mom,,and put blankets on the floornfor everyone to sleep,,and after that, nI would run to the computer,,connect it to the Internet,,and have pure joy and wondernfor 10 to 15 minutes. 
 In those days, I had discoveredna website called Joogle.,[Google] (Laughter),In my frantic wishnto do something about this custom,,I made use of Googlenand discovered Facebook,,a website where people can connectnto anyone around the world,,and so, from my very tiny,ncement-roofed room in Karachi,,I connected with people in the U.K.,nthe U.S., Australia and Canada,,and created a campaign called,WAKE UP Campaignnagainst Honor Killings.,It became enormousnin just a few months.,I got a lot of supportnfrom all around the world.,Media was connecting to us.,A lot of people were reaching outntrying to raise awareness with us.,It became so big that it went from onlinento the streets of my hometown,,where we would do rallies and strikes,trying to change the policies nin Pakistan for women's support.,And while I thoughtneverything was perfect,,my team -- which was basicallynmy friends and neighbors at that time --,thought everything was going so well,,we had no idea a big oppositionnwas coming to us. 
 My community stood up against us,,saying we were spreadingnun-Islamic behavior.,We were challenging centuries-oldncustoms in those communities.,I remember my father receivingnanonymous letters,saying, "Your daughter nis spreading Western culture,in the honorable societies.",Our car was stoned at one point.,One day I went to the officenand found our metal signboard,wrinkled and broken as if a lot of peoplenhad been hitting it with something heavy.,Things got so bad that I hadnto hide myself in many ways.,I would put up the windows of the car,,veil my face, not speaknwhile I was in public,,but eventually situations got worsenwhen my life was threatened,,and I had to leave, back to Karachi,nand our actions stopped. 
 Back in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,,I thought this was the biggestnfailure of my entire life.,I was devastated.,As a teenager, I was blamingnmyself for everything that happened.,And it turns out,nwhen we started reflecting,,we did realize that it was actuallynme and my team's fault. 
 There were two big reasonsnwhy our campaign had failed big time.,One of those, the first reason,,is we were standingnagainst core values of people.,We were saying no to somethingnthat was very important to them,,challenging their code of honor,,and hurting them deeply in the process.,And number two, which was verynimportant for me to learn,,and amazing, and surprisingnfor me to learn,,was that we were not includingnthe true heroes,who should be fighting for themselves.,The women in the villages had no ideanwe were fighting for them in the streets.,Every time I would go back,,I would find my cousins and friendsnwith scarves on their faces,,and I would ask, "What happened?",And they'd be like, n"Our husbands beat us.",But we are working in the streets for you!,We are changing the policies.,How is that not impacting their life? 
 So then we found out somethingnwhich was very amazing for us.,The policies of a country,do not necessarily always affectnthe tribal and rural communities.,It was devastating -- like, oh,nwe can't actually do something about this?,And we found out there's a huge gap,when it comes to official policiesnand the real truth on the ground. 
 So this time, we were like,nwe are going to do something different.,We are going to use strategy,,and we are going to go back and apologize.,Yes, apologize.,We went back to the communities,and we said we are nvery ashamed of what we did.,We are here to apologize, and in fact,nwe are here to make it up to you.,How do we do that?,We are going to promotenthree of your main cultures.,We know that it's music,nlanguage, and embroidery. 
 Nobody believed us.,Nobody wanted to work with us.,It took a lot of convincingnand discussions with these communities,until they agreed that we are goingnto promote their language,by making a booklet of their stories,nfables and old tales in the tribe,,and we would promote their music,by making a CD of the songsnfrom the tribe, and some drumbeating.,And the third, which was my favorite,,was we would promote their embroiderynby making a center in the village,where women would come every daynto make embroidery. 
 And so it began.,We worked with one village,nand we started our first center.,It was a beautiful day.,We started the center.,Women were coming to make embroidery,,and going through a life-changingnprocess of education,,learning about their rights,nwhat Islam says about their rights,,and enterprise development,nhow they can create money,,and then how they can createnmoney from money,,how they can fight the customsnthat have been destroying their lives,from so many centuries,,because in Islam, in reality,,women are supposed to benshoulder to shoulder with men.,Women have so much statusnthat we have not been hearing,,that they have not been hearing,,and we needed to tell themnthat they need to know,where their rights arenand how to take them by themselves,,because they can do it and we can't. 
 So this was the model which actuallyncame out -- very amazing.,Through embroiderynwe were promoting their traditions.,We went into the village.nWe would mobilize the community.,We would make a center insidenwhere 30 women will come,for six months to learn aboutnvalue addition of traditional embroidery,,enterprise development,nlife skills and basic education,,and about their rightsnand how to say no to those customs,and how to stand as leadersnfor themselves and the society.,After six months, we would connectnthese women to loans and to markets,where they can becomenlocal entrepreneurs in their communities. 
 We soon called this project Sughar.,Sughar is a local word usednin many, many languages in Pakistan.,It means skilled and confident women.,I truly believe, to create women leaders,nthere's only one thing you have to do:,Just let them know that they havenwhat it takes to be a leader.,These women you see here,,they have strong skillsnand potential to be leaders.,All we had to do was removenthe barriers that surrounded them,,and that's what we decided to do. 
 But then while we were thinkingneverything was going well,,once again everything was fantastic,,we found our next setback:,A lot of men started seeingnthe visible changes in their wife.,She's speaking more,nshe's making decisions --,oh my gosh, she's handling neverything in the house.,They stopped themnfrom coming to the centers,,and this time, we were like,nokay, time for strategy two.,We went to the fashion nindustry in Pakistan,and decided to do researchnabout what happens there.,Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistannis very strong and growing day by day,,but there is less contributionnfrom the tribal areas,and to the tribal areas, especially women. 
 So we decided to launch our first everntribal women's very own fashion brand,,which is now called Nomads.,And so women started earning more,,they started contributing morenfinancially to the house,,and men had to think againnbefore saying no to them,when they were coming to the centers. 
 (Applause),Thank you, thank you. 
 In 2013, we launched our firstnSughar Hub instead of a center.,We partnered with TripAdvisor,and created a cement hallnin the middle of a village,and invited so many other organizationsnto work over there.,We created this platformnfor the nonprofits,so they can touch and worknon the other issues,that Sughar is not working on,,which would be an easy place nfor them to give trainings,,use it as a farmer school,neven as a marketplace,,and anything they want to use it for,,and they have been doing really amazingly.,And so far, we have been ablento support 900 women,in 24 villages around Pakistan.,(Applause) 
 But that's actually not what I want.,My dream is to reach outnto one million women in the next 10 years,,and to make sure that happens,,this year we launchednSughar Foundation in the U.S.,It is not just going to fund Sugharnbut many other organizations in Pakistan,to replicate the idea,and to find even more innovative ways,to unleash the rural women'snpotential in Pakistan. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause),Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Khalida, you arenquite the force of nature.,I mean, this story, in many ways,njust seems beyond belief.,It's incredible that someonenso young could do achieve this much,through so much force and ingenuity.,So I guess one question:,This is a spectacular dream to reach outnand empower a million women --,how much of the current nsuccess depends on you,,the force of this magnetic personality?,How does it scale? 
 Khalida Brohi: I think my jobnis to give the inspiration out,,give my dream out.,I can't teach how to do it, becausenthere are so many different ways.,We have been experimentingnwith three ways only.,There are a hundred different waysnto unleash potential in women.,I would just give the inspirationnand that's my job.,I will keep doing it.nSughar will still be growing.,We are planning to reach outnto two more villages,,and soon I believe nwe will be scaling out of Pakistan,into South Asia and beyond. 
 CA: I love that when you talkednabout your team in the talk,,I mean, you were all 18 at the time.,What did this team look like?,This was school friends, right? 
 KB: Do people herenbelieve that I'm at an age,where I'm supposednto be a grandmother in my village?,My mom was married at nine,nand I am the oldest woman not married,and not doing anythingnin my life in my village. 
 CA: Wait, wait, wait, not doing anything? 
 KB: No.nCA: You're right. 
 KB: People feel sorry for me,na lot of times. 
 CA: But how much time are you spendingnnow actually back in Balochistan?,KB: I live over there.,We live between, still,nKarachi and Balochistan.,My siblings are all going to school.,I am still the oldest of eight siblings. 
 CA: But what you're doing is definitelynthreatening to some people there.,How do you handle safety?nDo you feel safe?,Are there issues there? 
 KB: This question has come to mena lot of times before,,and I feel like the word "fear"njust comes to me and then drops,,but there is one fear that I haventhat is different from that.,The fear is that if I get killed,nwhat would happen to the people,who love me so much?,My mom waits for me till late at nightnthat I should come home.,My sisters want to learn so much from me,,and there are many, many girlsnin my community who want to talk to me,and ask me different things,,and I recently got engaged. (Laughs),(Applause) 
 CA: Is he here? You've got to stand up.,(Applause) 
 KB: Escaping arranged marriages,nI chose my own husband,across the world in L.A.,na really different world.,I had to fight for a whole year.nThat's totally a different story.,But I think that'snthe only thing that I'm afraid of,,and I don't want my mom to not see anyonenwhen she waits in the night. 
 CA: So people who wantnto help you on their way,,they can go on, they can maybenbuy some of these clothes,that you're bringing over,that are actually made, the embroiderynis done back in Balochistan? 
 KB: Yeah. 
 CA: Or they can get involvednin the foundation. 
 KB: Definitely. We are lookingnfor as many people as we can,,because now that the foundation'snin the beginning process,,I am trying to learn a lotnabout how to operate,,how to get fundingnor reach out to more organizations,,and especially in the e-commerce,nwhich is very new for me.,I mean, I am notna fashion person, believe me. 
 CA: Well, it's been incrediblento have you here.,Please go on being courageous,ngo on being smart, and please stay safe. 
 KB: Thank you so much.nCA: Thank you, Khalida. (Applause)On June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33,in a balmy winter afternoonnin São Paulo, Brazil,,a typical South American winter afternoon,,this kid, this young man nthat you see celebrating here,like he had scored a goal,,Juliano Pinto, 29 years old,naccomplished a magnificent deed.,Despite being paralyzed,and not having any sensationnfrom mid-chest to the tip of his toes,as the result of a car crash six years agonthat killed his brother,and produced a complete spinal cord lesionnthat left Juliano in a wheelchair,,Juliano rose to the occasion,nand on this day did something,that pretty much everybody that saw him nin the six years deemed impossible.,Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick,of the 2014 Brazilian nWorld Soccer Cup here,just by thinking.,He could not move his body,,but he could imagine the movementsnneeded to kick a ball.,He was an athlete before the lesion.nHe's a para-athlete right now.,He's going to be in the Paralympic Games,nI hope, in a couple years.,But what the spinal cord lesion ndid not rob from Juliano,was his ability to dream.,And dream he did that afternoon,nfor a stadium of about 75,000 people,and an audience of close to a billionnwatching on TV. 
 And that kick crowned, basically,n30 years of basic research,studying how the brain,,how this amazing universenthat we have between our ears,that is only comparable to universenthat we have above our head,because it has about 100 billion elements,talking to each othernthrough electrical brainstorms,,what Juliano accomplishedntook 30 years to imagine in laboratories,and about 15 years to plan. 
 When John Chapin and I,n15 years ago, proposed in a paper,that we would build somethingnthat we called a brain-machine interface,,meaning connecting a brain to devices,so that animals and humansncould just move these devices,,no matter how far they arenfrom their own bodies,,just by imagining what they want to do,,our colleagues told us thatnwe actually needed professional help,,of the psychiatry variety.,And despite that,na Scot and a Brazilian persevered,,because that's how we were raisednin our respective countries,,and for 12, 15 years,,we made demonstration after demonstrationnsuggesting that this was possible. 
 And a brain-machine interfacenis not rocket science,,it's just brain research.,It's nothing but using sensors,to read the electrical brainstormsnthat a brain is producing,to generate the motor commands,that have to be downloadednto the spinal cord,,so we projected sensors that can read,hundreds and now thousandsnof these brain cells simultaneously,,and extract from these electrical signals,the motor planningnthat the brain is generating,to actually make us move into space.,And by doing that, we convertednthese signals into digital commands,that any mechanical, electronic,nor even a virtual device can understand,so that the subject can imaginenwhat he, she or it wants to make move,,and the device obeys that brain command.,By sensorizing these devicesnwith lots of different types of sensors,,as you are going to see in a moment,,we actually sent messagesnback to the brain to confirm,that that voluntary motor willnwas being enacted, no matter where --,next to the subject, next door,nor across the planet.,And as this message gave feedbacknback to the brain,,the brain realized its goal:nto make us move.,So this is just one experimentnthat we published a few years ago,,where a monkey, without moving its body,,learned to control the movementsnof an avatar arm,,a virtual arm that doesn't exist.,What you're listening tonis the sound of the brain of this monkey,as it explores three differentnvisually identical spheres,in virtual space.,And to get a reward,na drop of orange juice that monkeys love,,this animal has to detect,nselect one of these objects,by touching,,not by seeing it, by touching it,,because every time this virtual handntouches one of the objects,,an electrical pulse goes backnto the brain of the animal,describing the fine texturenof the surface of this object,,so the animal can judge what is nthe correct object that he has to grab,,and if he does that, he gets a rewardnwithout moving a muscle.,The perfect Brazilian lunch:,not moving a musclenand getting your orange juice. 
 So as we saw this happening,,we actually came and proposed the ideanthat we had published 15 years ago.,We reenacted this paper.,We got it out of the drawers,,and we proposed that perhaps we could getna human being that is paralyzed,to actually use the brain-machineninterface to regain mobility.,The idea was that if you suffered --,and that can happen to any one of us.,Let me tell you, it's very sudden.,It's a millisecond of a collision,,a car accident thatntransforms your life completely.,If you have a complete lesionnof the spinal cord,,you cannot move because your brainstormsncannot reach your muscles.,However, your brainstormsncontinue to be generated in your head.,Paraplegic, quadriplegic patientsndream about moving every night.,They have that inside their head.,The problem is hownto get that code out of it,and make the movement be created again. 
 So what we proposed was,nlet's create a new body.,Let's create a robotic vest.,And that's exactly why Juliano couldnkick that ball just by thinking,,because he was wearingnthe first brain-controlled robotic vest,that can be used by paraplegic,nquadriplegic patients to move,and to regain feedback. 
 That was the original idea, 15 years ago.,What I'm going to show you is hown156 people from 25 countries,all over the five continentsnof this beautiful Earth,,dropped their lives,ndropped their patents,,dropped their dogs, wives,nkids, school, jobs,,and congregated to come to Brazilnfor 18 months to actually get this done.,Because a couple years after Brazilnwas awarded the World Cup,,we heard that the Brazilian governmentnwanted to do something meaningful,in the opening ceremony,in the country that reinventednand perfected soccer,until we met the Germans, of course.,(Laughter),But that's a different talk,,and a different neuroscientistnneeds to talk about that.,But what Brazil wanted to donis to showcase,a completely different country,,a country that values sciencenand technology,,and can give a gift to millions,n25 million people around the world,that cannot move any longernbecause of a spinal cord injury.,Well, we went to the Brazilian governmentnand to FIFA and proposed,,well, let's have the kickoffnof the 2014 World Cup,be given by a Brazilian paraplegic,using a brain-controlled exoskeletonnthat allows him to kick the ball,and to feel the contact of the ball.,They looked at us,nthought that we were completely nuts,,and said, "Okay, let's try.",We had 18 months to do everythingnfrom zero, from scratch.,We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,,we had nothing done.,These people came all together,and in 18 months, we got eight patientsnin a routine of training,and basically built from nothing this guy,,that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.,The first brain-controllednexoskeleton to be built,was named after the most famousnBrazilian scientist ever,,Alberto Santos Dumont,,who, on October 19, 1901,ncreated and flew himself,the first controlled airship on airnin Paris for a million people to see.,Sorry, my American friends,,I live in North Carolina,,but it was two yearsnbefore the Wright Brothers flew,on the coast of North Carolina.,(Applause),Flight control is Brazilian.n(Laughter) 
 So we went together with these guys,and we basically putnthis exoskeleton together,,15 degrees of freedom,nhydraulic machine,that can be commanded by brain signals,recorded by a non-invasive technologyncalled electroencephalography,that can basically allow the patientnto imagine the movements,and send his commandsnto the controls, the motors,,and get it done.,This exoskeleton was coverednwith an artificial skin,invented by Gordon Cheng,none of my greatest friends, in Munich,,to allow sensation from the joints movingnand the foot touching the ground,to be delivered back to the patientnthrough a vest, a shirt.,It is a smart shirtnwith micro-vibrating elements,that basically delivers the feedbacknand fools the patient's brain,by creating a sensation that it is notna machine that is carrying him,,but it is he who is walking again. 
 So we got this going,nand what you'll see here,is the first time one of our patients,nBruno, actually walked.,And he takes a few secondsnbecause we are setting everything,,and you are going to see a blue lightncutting in front of the helmet,because Bruno is going to imaginenthe movement that needs to be performed,,the computer is going to analyze it,nBruno is going to certify it,,and when it is certified,,the device starts movingnunder the command of Bruno's brain.,And he just got it right,nand now he starts walking.,After nine years withoutnbeing able to move,,he is walking by himself.,And more than that --,(Applause) --,more than just walking,,he is feeling the ground,,and if the speed of the exo goes up,,he tells us that he is walking againnon the sand of Santos,,the beach resort where he used to gonbefore he had the accident.,That's why the brain is creatingna new sensation in Bruno's head. 
 So he walks, and at the end of the walk --nI am running out of time already --,he says, "You know, guys,,I need to borrow this thing from younwhen I get married,,because I wanted to walk to the priest,and see my bride and actuallynbe there by myself.,Of course, he will have itnwhenever he wants. 
 And this is what we wanted to shownduring the World Cup, and couldn't,,because for some mysterious reason,nFIFA cut its broadcast in half.,What you are going to see very quicklynis Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick,a few minutes before we went to the pitch,and did the real thingnin front of the entire crowd,,and the lights you are going to seenjust describe the operation.,Basically, the blue lights pulsatingnindicate that the exo is ready to go.,It can receive thoughtsnand it can deliver feedback,,and when Julianonmakes the decision to kick the ball,,you are going to seentwo streams of green and yellow light,coming from the helmetnand going to the legs,,representing the mental commandsnthat were taken by the exo,to actually make that happen.,And in basically 13 seconds,,Juliano actually did.,You can see the commands.,He gets ready, nthe ball is set, and he kicks.,And the most amazing thing is,,10 seconds after he did that,nand looked at us on the pitch,,he told us, celebrating as you saw,,"I felt the ball.",And that's priceless.,(Applause) 
 So where is this going to go?,I have two minutes to tell you,that it's going to the limitsnof your imagination.,Brain-actuating technology is here.,This is the latest: We justnpublished this a year ago,,the first brain-to-brain interface,that allows two animalsnto exchange mental messages,so that one animal that sees somethingncoming from the environment,can send a mental SMS,na torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,,to the second animal,,and the second animal performsnthe act that he needed to perform,without ever knowing whatnthe environment was sending as a message,,because the message camenfrom the first animal's brain. 
 So this is the first demo.,I'm going to be very quicknbecause I want to show you the latest.,But what you see herenis the first rat getting informed,by a light that is going to show upnon the left of the cage,that he has to press the left cagento basically get a reward.,He goes there and does it.,And the same time,nhe is sending a mental message,to the second ratnthat didn't see any light,,and the second rat,nin 70 percent of the times,is going to press the left levernand get a reward,without ever experiencingnthe light in the retina. 
 Well, we took thisnto a little higher limit,by getting monkeys to collaborate nmentally in a brain net,,basically to donate their brain activity,and combine them to moventhe virtual arm that I showed you before,,and what you see here is the first timenthe two monkeys combine their brains,,synchronize their brains perfectlynto get this virtual arm to move.,One monkey is controlling the x dimension,,the other monkeynis controlling the y dimension.,But it gets a little more interestingnwhen you get three monkeys in there,and you ask one monkey to control x and y,,the other monkey to control y and z,,and the third one to control x and z,,and you make them allnplay the game together,,moving the arm in 3D into a targetnto get the famous Brazilian orange juice.,And they actually do.,The black dot is the averagenof all these brains working,in parallel, in real time.,That is the definitionnof a biological computer,,interacting by brain activitynand achieving a motor goal. 
 Where is this going?,We have no idea.,We're just scientists.,(Laughter),We are paid to be children,,to basically go to the edgenand discover what is out there.,But one thing I know:,One day, in a few decades,,when our grandchildrennsurf the Net just by thinking,,or a mother donates her eyesightnto an autistic kid who cannot see,,or somebody speaks becausenof a brain-to-brain bypass,,some of you will remembernthat it all started on a winter afternoon,in a Brazilian soccer fieldnwith an impossible kick. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Bruno Giussani: Miguel,nthank you for sticking to your time.,I actually would have given youna couple more minutes,,because there are a couple of pointsnwe want to develop, and, of course,,clearly it seems that we need connected nbrains to figure out where this is going.,So let's connect all this together.,So if I'm understanding correctly,,one of the monkeysnis actually getting a signal,and the other monkeynis reacting to that signal,just because the first one is receiving itnand transmitting the neurological impulse. 
 Miguel Nicolelis: nNo, it's a little different.,No monkey knows of the existencenof the other two monkeys.,They are getting a visual feedback in 2D,,but the task they havento accomplish is 3D.,They have to move an armnin three dimensions.,But each monkey is only gettingnthe two dimensions on the video screen,that the monkey controls.,And to get that thing done,,you need at least two monkeysnto synchronize their brains,,but the ideal is three.,So what we found out is thatnwhen one monkey starts slacking down,,the other two monkeysnenhance their performance,to get the guy to come back,,so this adjusts dynamically,,but the global synchrony remains the same.,Now, if you flipnwithout telling the monkey,the dimensions that each brainnhas to control,,like this guy is controlling x and y,,but he should be controlling now y and z,,instantaneously, that animal's brainnforgets about the old dimensions,and it starts concentratingnon the new dimensions.,So what I need to say isnthat no Turing machine,,no computer can predictnwhat a brain net will do.,So we will absorb technologynas part of us.,Technology will never absorb us.,It's simply impossible. 
 BG: How many times have you tested this?,And how many timesnhave you succeeded versus failed? 
 MN: Oh, tens of times.,With the three monkeys?nOh, several times.,I wouldn't be able to talk about this herenunless I had done it a few times.,And I forgot to mention, because of time,,that just three weeks ago,na European group,just demonstrated the firstnman-to-man brain-to-brain connection.,BG: And how does that play?,MN: There was one bit of information --nbig ideas start in a humble way --,but basically the brain activitynof one subject,was transmitted to a second object,nall non-invasive technology.,So the first subject got a message,nlike our rats, a visual message,,and transmitted it to the second subject.,The second subject receivedna magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,,or a different pulse,ntwo different pulses.,In one pulse, the subject saw something.,On the other pulse,nhe saw something different.,And he was able to verbally indicate,what was the messagenthe first subject was sending,through the Internet across continents. 
 Moderator: Wow.nOkay, that's where we are going.,That's the next TED Talknat the next conference.,Miguel Nicolelis, thank you.nMN: Thank you, Bruno. Thank you.As a software developer and technologist,,I've worked on a numbernof civic technology projects,over the years.,Civic tech is sometimesnreferred to as tech for good,,using technology to solvenhumanitarian problems. 
 This is in 2010 in Uganda,,working on a solutionnthat allowed local populations,to avoid government surveillancenon their mobile phones,for expressing dissent.,That same technology was deployednlater in North Africa,for similar purposesnto help activists stay connected,when governments werendeliberately shutting off connectivity,as a means of population control. 
 But over the years, as I have thoughtnabout these technologies,and the things that I work on,,a question kind of nagsnin the back of my mind, which is,,what if we're wrong aboutnthe virtues of technology,,and if it sometimes actively hurts,the communitiesnthat we're intending to help?,The tech industry around the worldntends to operate under similar assumptions,that if we build great things,,it will positively affect everyone.,Eventually, these innovationsnwill get out and find everyone.,But that's not always the case.,I like to call this blind championingnof technology "trickle-down techonomics,",to borrow a phrase. (Laughter),We tend to think that ifnwe design things for the select few,,eventually those technologiesnwill reach everyone,,and that's not always the case.,Technology and innovationnbehaves a lot like wealth and capital.,They tend to consolidatenin the hands of the few,,and sometimes they find their way outninto the hands of the many. 
 And so most of you aren't tacklingnoppressive regimes on the weekends,,so I wanted to think of a few examplesnthat might be a little bit more relatable. 
 In the world of wearablesnand smartphones and apps,,there's a big movementnto track people's personal health,with applications that tracknthe number of calories that you burn,or whether you're sitting too muchnor walking enough.,These technologies make patient intakenin medical facilities much more efficient,,and in turn, these medical facilities,are starting to expectnthese types of efficiencies.,As these digital toolsnfind their way into medical rooms,,and they become digitally ready,,what happens to the digitally invisible?,What does the medical experience look like,for someone who doesn't haventhe $400 phone or watch,tracking their every movement?,Do they now become a burdennon the medical system?,Is their experience changed? 
 In the world of finance,nBitcoin and crypto-currencies,are revolutionizing the waynwe move money around the world,,but the challenge with these technologies,is the barrier to entrynis incredibly high, right?,You need access to the samenphones, devices, connectivity,,and even where you don't,nwhere you can find a proxy agent,,usually they require a certain amountnof capital to participate.,And so the question that I ask myselfnis, what happens to the last community,using paper notes when the restnof the world moves to digital currency? 
 Another example from my hometownnin Philadelphia:,I recently wentnto the public library there,,and they are facing an existential crisis.,Public funding is dwindling,,they have to reduce their footprintnto stay open and stay relevant,,and so one of the waysnthey're going about this,is digitizing a number of the booksnand moving them to the cloud.,This is great for most kids. Right?,You can check out books from home,,you can research on the waynto school or from school,,but these are really two big assumptions,,that one, you have access at home,,and two, that you have accessnto a mobile phone,,and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.,So what does theirneducation experience look like,in the wake of a completelyncloud-based library,,what used to be considerednsuch a basic part of education?,How do they stay competitive? 
 A final example fromnacross the world in East Africa:,there's been a huge movementnto digitize land ownership rights,,for a number of reasons.,Migrant communities,nolder generations dying off,,and ultimately poor record-keeping,have led to conflicts over who owns what.,And so there was a big movementnto put all this information online,,to track all the ownershipnof these plots of land,,put them in the cloud,nand give them to the communities.,But actually, the unintendednconsequence of this,has been that venture capitalists,ninvestors, real estate developers,,have swooped in and they've begunnbuying up these plots of land,right out from under these communities,,because they have accessnto the technologies,and the connectivitynthat makes that possible. 
 So that's the common threadnthat connects these examples,,the unintended consequences of the toolsnand the technologies that we make.,As engineers, as technologists,,we sometimes prefernefficiency over efficacy.,We think more about doing thingsnthan the outcomes of what we are doing.,This needs to change.,We have a responsibility to think aboutnthe outcomes of the technologies we build,,especially as they increasinglyncontrol the world in which we live.,In the late '90s,,there was a big push for ethicsnin the world of investment and banking.,I think in 2014, we're long overduenfor a similar movement,in the area of tech and technology. 
 So, I just encourage you, as you are allnthinking about the next big thing,,as entrepreneurs, as CEOs,nas engineers, as makers,,that you think aboutnthe unintended consequences,of the things that you're building,,because the real innovationnis in finding ways to include everyone. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)On Mondays and Thursdays,nI learn how to die.,I call them my terminal days.,My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,,but a lot of people in my family diednof melanoma cancer,and my parents and grandparents had it.,And I kept thinking, one day I couldnbe sitting in front of a doctor,who looks at my exams and says,,"Ricardo, things don't look very good.,You have six months or a year to live." 
 And you start thinking aboutnwhat you would do with this time.,And you say, "I'm going to spend nmore time with the kids.,I'm going to visit these places,,I'm going to go up and downnmountains and places,and I'm going to do all the thingsnI didn't do when I had the time.",But of course, we all know,these are very bittersweet memories nwe're going to have.,It's very difficult to do.,You spend a good part of the timencrying, probably.,So I said, I'm going to do something else. 
 Every Monday and Thursday,nI'm going use my terminal days.,And I will do, during those days,,whatever it is I was going to donif I had received that piece of news.,(Laughter) 
 When you think about --,(Applause),when you think about the opposite of work,,we, many times, think it's leisure.,And you say, ah, I need nsome leisure time, and so forth.,But the fact is that,nleisure is a very busy thing.,You go play golf and tennis,nand you meet people,,and you're going for lunch,nand you're late for the movies.,It's a very crowded thing that we do.,The opposite of work is idleness.,But very few of us knownwhat to do with idleness.,When you look at the waynthat we distribute our lives in general,,you realize that in the periodsnin which we have a lot of money,,we have very little time.,And then when we finally have time,nwe have neither the money nor the health. 
 So we started thinking about thatnas a company for the last 30 years.,This is a complicated companynwith thousands of employees,,hundreds of millionsnof dollars of business,that makes rocket fuel propellent systems,nruns 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,,does income tax preparationnfor dozens of thousands.,So this is not a simple business. 
 We looked at it and we said,,let's devolve to these people,nlet's give these people a company,where we take awaynall the boarding school aspects,of, this is when you arrive,nthis is how you dress,,this is how you go to meetings,nthis is what you say,,this is what you don't say,,and let's see what's left.,So we started this about 30 years ago,,and we started dealingnwith this very issue.,And so we said, look, the retirement,,the whole issue of how nwe distribute our graph of life.,Instead of going mountain climbingnwhen you're 82,,why don't you do it next week?,And we'll do it like this,,we'll sell you back your Wednesdaysnfor 10 percent of your salary.,So now, if you were going to be na violinist, which you probably weren't,,you go and do this on Wednesday. 
 And what we found --,we thought, these are the older people,who are going to be really interestednin this program.,And the average agenof the first people who adhered,were 29, of course.,And so we started looking,,and we said, we have to do thingsnin a different way.,So we started saying things like,,why do we want to knownwhat time you came to work,,what time you left, etc.?,Can't we exchange this for a contract,for buying something from you,nsome kind of work?,Why are we building these headquarters?,Is it not an ego issuenthat we want to look solid,and big and important?,But we're dragging you two hoursnacross town because of it? 
 So we started asking questions one by one.,We'd say it like this:,One: How do we find people?,We'd go out and trynand recruit people and we'd say,,look, when you come to us,,we're not going to haventwo or three interviews,and then you're going to benmarried to us for life.,That's not how we do nthe rest of our lives.,So, come have your interviews.,Anyone who's interestednin interviewing, you will show up.,And then we'll see what happensnout of the intuition that rises from that,,instead of just filling out the little nitems of whether you're the right person.,And then, come back.,Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day,ntalk to anybody you want.,Make sure we are the bride nyou thought we were,and not all the bullshitnwe put into our own ads.,(Laughter) 
 Slowly we went to a process nwhere we'd say things like,,we don't want anyone to bena leader in the company,if they haven't been ninterviewed and approved,by their future subordinates.,Every six months, everyone gets nevaluated, anonymously, as a leader.,And this determines whether they shouldncontinue in that leadership position,,which is many timesnsituational, as you know.,And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent nof a grade, they don't stay,,which is probably the reason whynI haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.,And over time, we started askingnother questions. 
 We said things like,,why can't people set their own salaries?,What do they need to know?,There's only three things nyou need to know:,how much people make inside the company,,how much people make somewherenelse in a similar business,and how much we make in generalnto see whether we can afford it.,So let's give people these threenpieces of information.,So we started having, in the cafeteria,,a computer where you could go in nand you could ask,what someone spent, nhow much someone makes,,what they make in benefits, nwhat the company makes,,what the margins are, and so forth.,And this is 25 years ago. 
 As this information started ncoming to people,,we said things like, we don't want nto see your expense report,,we don't want to know how many nholidays you're taking,,we don't want to know where you work.,We had, at one point,n14 different offices around town,,and we'd say, go to the one nthat's closest to your house,,to the customer that nyou're going to visit today.,Don't tell us where you are.,And more, even when we hadnthousands of people, 5,000 people,,we had two people in the H.R. department,,and thankfully one of them has retired.,(Laughter) 
 And so, the question we were asking was,nhow can we be taking care of people?,People are the only thing we have.,We can't have a department that runsnafter people and looks after people.,So as we started finding that this worked,nand we'd say, we're looking for --,and this is, I think,nthe main thing I was looking for,in the terminal days and in the company,,which is, how do you set up for wisdom?,We've come from an age of revolution,nindustrial revolution,,an age of information,nan age of knowledge,,but we're not any closernto the age of wisdom.,How we design, how do we organize,nfor more wisdom?,So for example, many times,,what's the smartest or the intelligentndecision doesn't jive.,So we'd say things like,,let's agree that you're going to selln57 widgets per week.,If you sell them by Wednesday, nplease go to the beach.,Don't create a problem for us, nfor manufacturing, for application,,then we have to buy new companies,nwe have to buy our competitors,,we have to do all kinds of thingsnbecause you sold too many widgets.,So go to the beachnand start again on Monday.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 So the process is looking for wisdom.,And in the process, of course, nwe wanted people to know everything,,and we wanted to be truly democraticnabout the way we ran things.,So our board had two seats open nwith the same voting rights,,for the first two people who showed up.,(Laughter),And so we had cleaning ladies votingnon a board meeting,,which had a lot of other very importantnpeople in suits and ties.,And the fact is that they kept us honest. 
 This process, as we started lookingnat the people who came to us,,we'd say, now wait a second,,people come to us and they say,nwhere am I supposed to sit?,How am I supposed to work?nWhere am I going to be in 5 years' time?,And we looked at that and we said,nwe have to start much earlier.,Where do we start?,We said, oh, kindergarten nseems like a good place. 
 So we set up a foundation, which now has, nfor 11 years, three schools,,where we started askingnthe same questions,,how do you redesign school for wisdom?,It is one thing to say,nwe need to recycle the teachers,,we need the directors to do more.,But the fact is that what we donwith education is entirely obsolete.,The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.,Going from a math class, to biology,nto 14th-century France is very silly.,(Applause),So we started thinking, nwhat could it look like?,And we put together people, nincluding people who like education,,people like Paulo Freire, nand two ministers of education in Brazil,and we said, if we were to designna school from scratch,,what would it look like? 
 And so we created this school,nwhich is called Lumiar,,and Lumiar, one of themnis a public school,,and Lumiar says the following:,Let's divide this rolenof the teacher into two.,One guy, we'll call a tutor.,A tutor, in the old sense of the Greekn"paideia": Look after the kid.,What's happening at home,nwhat's their moment in life, etc..,But please don't teach,,because the little you know compared nto Google, we don't want to know.,Keep that to yourself.,(Laughter),Now, we'll bring in peoplenwho have two things:,passion and expertise, and it could bentheir profession or not.,And we use the senior citizens,,who are 25 percent of the populationnwith wisdom that nobody wants anymore.,So we bring them to school and we say,,teach these kids whatevernyou really believe in.,So we have violinists teaching math.,We have all kinds of things where we say,,don't worry about nthe course material anymore.,We have approximately 10 great threadsnthat go from 2 to 17.,Things like, how do we measurenourselves as humans?,So there's a place for math and physicsnand all that there.,How do we express ourselves?,So there's a placenfor music and literature, etc.,,but also for grammar. 
 And then we have thingsnthat everyone has forgotten,,which are probably the most nimportant things in life.,The very important things in life,nwe know nothing about.,We know nothing about love,,we know nothing about death,,we know nothing about why we're here.,So we need a thread in school thatntalks about everything we don't know.,So that's a big part of what we do.,(Applause),So over the years, we started goingninto other things.,We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids,and say, sit down and come here nand do that, and so forth.,We said, let's get the kids to do nsomething we call a circle,,which meets once a week.,And we'd say, you put the rules together,and then you decidenwhat you want to do with it.,So can you all hit yourself on the head?,Sure, for a week, try.,They came up with the very samenrules that we had,,except they're theirs.,And then, they have the power,,which means, they can and donsuspend and expel kids,so that we're not playing school,nthey really decide. 
 And then, in this same vein,,we keep a digital mosaic,,because this is not constructivistnor Montessori or something.,It's something where we keepnthe Brazilian curriculum,with 600 tiles of a mosaic,,which we want to expose these kidsnto by the time they're 17.,And follow this all the timenand we know how they're doing,and we say, you're not interested nin this now, let's wait a year.,And the kids are in groupsnthat don't have an age category,,so the six-year-old kidnwho is ready for that with an 11-year-old,,that eliminates all of the gangsnand the groups,and this stuff that we have nin the schools, in general.,And they have a zero nto 100 percent grading,,which they do themselves with an appnevery couple of hours.,Until we know they're 37 percent of thenway we'd like them to be on this issue,,so that we can send them out in the worldnwith them knowing enough about it.,And so the courses are World Cup Soccer,nor building a bicycle.,And people will sign up for na 45-day course on building a bicycle.,Now, try to build a bicycle without nknowing that pi is 3.1416.,You can't.,And try, any one of you, nusing 3.1416 for something.,You don't know anymore.,So this is lost and that's what nwe try to do there,,which is looking nfor wisdom in that school. 
 And that brings us back to this graphnand this distribution of our life.,I accumulated a lot of money nwhen I think about it.,When you think and you say,nnow is the time to give back --,well, if you're giving back, nyou took too much.,(Laughter) (Applause),I keep thinking of Warren Buffetnwaking up one day,and finding out he has 30 billion dollarsnmore than he thought he had.,And he looks and he says,nwhat am I going to do with this?,And he says, I'll give it to someonenwho really needs this.,I'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter),And my guy, who's my financialnadvisor in New York,,he says, look, you're a silly guy,because you would have 4.1 times nmore money today,if you had made money with moneyninstead of sharing as you go.,But I like sharing as you go better.,(Applause) 
 I taught MBAs at MIT for a time,and I ended up, one day,nat the Mount Auburn Cemetery.,It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.,And I was walking around.nIt was my birthday and I was thinking.,And the first time around, nI saw these tombstones,and these wonderful people nwho'd done great things,and I thought, what do I want nto be remembered for?,And I did another stroll around,,and the second time,nanother question came to me,,which did me better, which was,,why do I want to be remembered at all?,(Laughter),And that, I think, ntook me different places.,When I was 50, my wife Fernanda and Insat for a whole afternoon,,we had a big pit with fire,,and I threw everything I had ever ndone into that fire.,This is a book in 38 languages,,hundreds and hundreds of articlesnand DVDs, everything there was.,And that did two things.,One, it freed our five kidsnfrom following in our steps, our shadow --,They don't know what I do.,(Laughter),Which is good.,And I'm not going to take them somewhere,and say, one day nall of this will be yours.,(Laughter),The five kids know nothing, which is good. 
 And the second thing is,,I freed myself from this anchornof past achievement or whatever.,I'm free to start something new every timenand to decide things from scratch,in part of those terminal days.,And some people would say,,oh, so now you have this time,nthese terminal days,,and so you go out and do everything.,No, we've been to the beaches,,so we've been to Samoa and Maldivesnand Mozambique,,so that's done.,I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.,I've gone down 60 meters to see nhammerhead sharks.,I've spent 59 days on the back of a camelnfrom Chad to Timbuktu.,I've gone to the magnetic nNorth Pole on a dog sled.,So, we've been busy.,It's what I'd like to call nmy empty bucket list.,(Laughter) 
 And with this rationale,nI look at these days and I think,,I'm not retired. nI don't feel retired at all.,And so I'm writing a new book.,We started three new companiesnin the last two years.,I'm now working on getting this nschool system for free out into the world,,and I've found, very interestingly enough,nthat nobody wants it for free.,And so I've been trying for 10 years,to get the public systemnto take over this school rationale,,much as the public schools we have,,which has instead of 43 out of 100,nas their rating, as their grades,,has 91 out of 100.,But for free, nobody wants it.,So maybe we'll start charging for it nand then it will go somewhere.,But getting this out is onenof the things we want to do. 
 And I think what this leaves usnas a message for all of you,,I think is a little bit like this:,We've all learnednhow to go on Sunday night,to email and work from home.,But very few of us have learned,how to go to the moviesnon Monday afternoon.,And if we're looking for wisdom,nwe need to learn to do that as well.,And so, what we've done allnof these years is very simple,,is use the little tool,nwhich is ask three whys in a row.,Because the first whynyou always have a good answer for.,The second why,nit starts getting difficult.,By the third why, you don't really knownwhy you're doing what you're doing.,What I want to leave you with is the seednand the thought that maybe if you do this,,you will come to the question, what for?,What am I doing this for?,And hopefully, as a result of that,nand over time,,I hope that with this,nand that's what I'm wishing you,,you'll have a much wiser future.,Thank you very much.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So Ricardo, nyou're kind of crazy.,(Laughter),To many people, this seems crazy.,And yet so deeply wise, also.,The pieces I'm tryingnto put together are this:,Your ideas are so radical.,How, in business, for example,nthese ideas have been out for a while,,probably the percentage of businesses nthat have taken some of them,is still quite low.,Are there any times you've seen nsome big company,take on one of your ideas nand you've gone, "Yes!"? 
 Ricardo Semler: It happens.nIt happened about two weeks ago,with Richard Branson,nwith his people saying,,oh, I don't want to controlnyour holidays anymore,,or Netflix does a little bitnof this and that,,but I don't think it's very important.,I'd like to see it happen maybe a littlenbit in a bit of a missionary zeal,,but that's a very personal one.,But the fact is that it takes a leap nof faith about losing control.,And almost nobody who is in controlnis ready to take leaps of faith.,It will have to come from kids nand other people,who are starting companies nin a different way. 
 CA: So that's the key thing?,From your point of viewnthe evidence is there,,in the business point of view this works,,but people just don't haventhe courage to -- (Whoosh) 
 RS: They don't even have the incentive.,You're running a companynwith a 90-day mandate.,It's a quarterly report.,If you're not good in 90 days, you're out.,So you say, "Here's a great program that,nin less than one generation --",And the guy says, "Get out of here.",So this is the problem.,(Laughter) 
 CA: What you're trying to do in educationnseems to me incredibly profound.,Everyone is bothered aboutntheir country's education system.,No one thinks thatnwe've caught up yet to a world,where there's Google and all these ntechnological options.,So you've got actual evidence now that nthe kids so far going through your system,,there's a dramatic increase nin performance.,How do we help you moventhese ideas forward? 
 RS: I think it's that problemnof ideas whose time has come.,And I've never been very evangelicalnabout these things.,We put it out there.,Suddenly, you find people --,there's a group in Japan, nwhich scares me very much,,which is called the Semlerists,nand they have 120 companies.,They've invited me.nI've always been scared to go.,And there is a group in Hollandnthat has 600 small, Dutch companies.,It's something thatnwill flourish on its own.,Part of it will be wrong, nand it doesn't matter.,This will find its own place.,And I'm afraidnof the other one, which says,,this is so good you've got to do this.,Let's set up a system nand put lots of money into it,and then people will do it no matter what. 
 CA: So you have asked nextraordinary questions your whole life.,It seems to me that's the fuel nthat's driven a lot of this.,Do you have any other questions for us,nfor TED, for this group here? 
 RS: I always come back nto variations of the question,that my son asked me when he was three.,We were sitting in a jacuzzi,nand he said, "Dad, why do we exist?",There is no other question.,Nobody has any other question.,We have variations of this one question,nfrom three onwards.,So when you spend time in a company,nin a bureaucracy, in an organization,and you're saying, boy --,how many people do you knownwho on their death beds said,,boy, I wish I had spentnmore time at the office?,So there's a whole thing nof having the courage now --,not in a week, not in two months,,not when you find out nyou have something --,to say, no, what am I doing this for?,Stop everything. Let me do something else.,And it will be okay,,it will be much betternthan what you're doing,,if you're stuck in a process. 
 CA: So that strikes me as a profoundnand quite beautiful way to end,this penultimate day of TED.,Ricardo Semler, thank you so much.,RS: Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)I want to speak about na forgotten conflict.,It's a conflict that rarelynhits the headlines.,It happens right here,nin the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
 Now, most people outside of Africandon't know much about the war in Congo,,so let me give you a couple of key facts.,The Congolese conflict is the deadliest nconflict since World War II.,It has caused almost four million deaths.,It has destabilized most of Central Africanfor the past 18 years.,It is the largest ongoingnhumanitarian crisis in the world. 
 That's why I first went to Congo in 2001.,I was a young humanitarian aid worker,nand I met this woman who was my age.,She was called Isabelle.,Local militiasnhad attacked Isabelle's village.,They had killed many men,nraped many women.,They had looted everything.,And then they wanted to take Isabelle,,but her husband stepped in,,and he said, "No,nplease don't take Isabelle.,Take me instead.",So he had gone to the forestnwith the militias,,and Isabelle had never seen him again. 
 Well, it's because of peoplenlike Isabelle and her husband,that I have devoted my careernto studying this war,that we know so little about. 
 Although there is one storynabout Congo that you may have heard.,It's a story about minerals and rape.,Policy statements and media reports,both usually focus on a primary causenof violence in Congo --,the illegal exploitation and traffickingnof natural resources --,and on a main consequence --,sexual abuse of women and girlsnas a weapon of war. 
 So, not that these two issuesnaren't important and tragic. They are.,But today I want to tell you na different story.,I want to tell you a storynthat emphasizes a core cause,of the ongoing conflict.,Violence in Congo is in large part drivennby local bottom-up conflicts,that international peace effortsnhave failed to help address. 
 The story starts from the factnthat not only is Congo notable,for being the world's worstnongoing humanitarian crisis,,but it is also home to some of the largest,international peacebuildingnefforts in the world.,Congo hosts the largest,and most expensive United Nationsnpeacekeeping mission in the world.,It was also the site of the firstnEuropean-led peacekeeping mission,,and for its first cases ever,,the International Criminal Courtnchose to prosecute Congolese warlords.,In 2006, when Congo held the first nfree national elections in its history,,many observers thought that an end to nviolence in the region had finally come.,The international community lauded the nsuccessful organization of these elections,as finally an examplenof successful international intervention,in a failed state. 
 But the eastern provinces,have continued to facenmassive population displacements,and horrific human rights violations.,Shortly before I wentnback there last summer,,there was a horrible massacrenin the province of South Kivu.,Thirty-three people were killed.,They were mostly women and children,,and many of them were hacked to death.,During the past eight years,,fighting in the eastern provincesnhas regularly reignited,full-scale civil and international war.,So basically, every time we feelnthat we are on the brink of peace,,the conflict explodes again. 
 Why?,Why have the massive international efforts,failed to help Congo nachieve lasting peace and security?,Well, my answer to this questionnrevolves around two central observations.,First, one of the main reasonsnfor the continuation of violence in Congo,is fundamentally local --,and when I say local,,I really mean at the levelnof the individual, the family,,the clan, the municipality,nthe community, the district,,sometimes the ethnic group.,For instance, you remember the storynof Isabelle that I told you.,Well, the reason why militiasnhad attacked Isabelle's village,was because they wanted to take the land,that the villagers needednto cultivate food and to survive. 
 The second central observationnis that international peace efforts,have failed to helpnaddress local conflicts,because of the presencenof a dominant peacebuilding culture.,So what I mean is that,Western and African diplomats,,United Nations peacekeepers, donors,,the staff of mostnnongovernmental organizations,that work with the resolution of conflict,,they all share a specific waynof seeing the world.,And I was one of these people,nand I shared this culture,,so I know all too well how powerful it is.,Throughout the world,nand throughout conflict zones,,this common culture shapesnthe intervener's understanding,of the causes of violence,as something that is primarily locatednin the national and international spheres.,It shapes our understandingnof the path toward peace,as something again that requiresntop-down intervention,to address nationalnand international tensions.,And it shapes our understandingnof the roles of foreign actors,as engaging in nationalnand international peace processes.,Even more importantly,nthis common culture,enables international peacebuildersnto ignore the micro-level tensions,that often jeopardizenthe macro-level settlements. 
 So for instance, in Congo,,because of how they arensocialized and trained,,United Nations officials,ndonors, diplomats,,the staff of mostnnongovernmental organizations,,they interpret continued fightingnand massacres as a top-down problem.,To them, the violence they see,is the consequence of tensionsnbetween President Kabila,and various national opponents,,and tensions between Congo,nRwanda and Uganda.,In addition, these international npeacebuilders view local conflicts,as simply the resultnof national and international tensions,,insufficient state authority,,and what they call the Congolese people'snso-called inherent penchant for violence. 
 The dominant culturenalso constructs intervention,at the national and international levels,as the only natural and legitimate tasknfor United Nations staffers and diplomats.,And it elevates the organizationnof general elections,,which is now a sort of cure-all,,as the most crucial statenreconstruction mechanism,over more effectivenstate-building approaches.,And that happens not only in Congonbut also in many other conflict zones. 
 But let's dig deeper,,into the other main sources of violence.,In Congo, continuing violence,is motivated not only by the nationalnand international causes,but also by longstandingnbottom-up agendas,whose main instigatorsnare villagers, traditional chiefs,,community chiefs or ethnic leaders.,Many conflicts revolve around political,nsocial and economic stakes,that are distinctively local.,For instance, there isna lot of competition,at the village or district level,over who can be chief of villagenor chief of territory,according to traditional law,,and who can controlnthe distribution of land,and the exploitationnof local mining sites.,This competition often resultsnin localized fighting,,for instance in one village or territory,,and quite frequently,nit escalates into generalized fighting,,so across a whole province,,and even at timesninto neighboring countries. 
 Take the conflict between Congolese nof Rwandan descent,and the so-called indigenous ncommunities of the Kivus.,This conflict started in the 1930snduring Belgian colonization,,when both communities competednover access to land and to local power.,Then, in 1960,nafter Congolese independence,,it escalated because each campntried to align with national politicians,,but still to advance their local agendas.,And then, at the timenof the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,,these local actors alliednwith Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,,but still to advance their local agendasnin the provinces of the Kivus.,And since then, these local disputesnover land and local power,have fueled violence,,and they have regularly jeopardized,the national andninternational settlements. 
 So we can wonder whynin these circumstances,the international peacebuildersnhave failed to help implement,local peacebuilding programs.,And the answer is thatninternational interveners,deem the resolution of grassroots conflict,an unimportant, unfamiliar,nand illegitimate task.,The very idea of becoming involvednat the local level clashes fundamentally,with existing cultural norms,,and it threatensnkey organizational interests.,For instance, the very identitynof the United Nations,as this macro-levelndiplomatic organization,would be upendednif it were to refocus on local conflicts.,And the result is thatnneither the internal resistance,to the dominant ways of working,nor the external shocks,have managed to convince internationalnactors that they should reevaluate,their understandingnof violence and intervention.,And so far, there have beennonly very few exceptions.,There have been exceptions,nbut only very few exceptions,,to this broad pattern. 
 So to wrap up,nthe story I just told you,is a story about howna dominant peacebuilding culture,shapes the intervener's understandingnof what the causes of violence are,,how peace is made,,and what interventions should accomplish.,These understandings enableninternational peacebuilders,to ignore the micro-level foundations,that are so necessarynfor sustainable peace.,The resulting inattentionnto local conflicts,leads to inadequate peacebuildingnin the short term,and potential war resumptionnin the long term.,And what's fascinatingnis that this analysis,helps us to better understandnmany cases of lasting conflict,and international intervention failures,nin Africa and elsewhere.,Local conflicts fuel violencenin most war and post-war environments,,from Afghanistan to Sudannto Timor-Leste,,and in the rare casesnwhere there have been comprehensive,,bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,,these attempts have been successfulnat making peace sustainable.,One of the best examples is the contrast,between the relatively peacefulnsituation in Somaliland,,which benefited from sustainedngrassroots peacebuilding initiatives,,and the violence prevalentnin the rest of Somalia,,where peacebuildingnhas been mostly top-down.,And there are several other cases,in which local, grassrootsnconflict resolution,has made a crucial difference. 
 So if we want internationalnpeacebuilding to work,,in addition to any top-down intervention,,conflicts must be resolvednfrom the bottom up.,And again, it's not that nationalnand international tensions don't matter.,They do.,And it's not that nationalnand international peacebuilding,isn't necessary.,It is.,Instead, it is that both macro-levelnand micro-level peacebuilding are needed,to make peace sustainable,,and local nongovernmental organizations,,local authorities and ncivil society representatives,should be the main actorsnin the bottom-up process. 
 So of course, there are obstacles.,Local actors often lack the funding,and sometimes the logistical meansnand the technical capacity,to implement effective,nlocal peacebuilding programs.,So international actorsnshould expand their funding and support,for local conflict resolution. 
 As for Congo, what can be done?,After two decades of conflictnand the deaths of millions,,it's clear that we neednto change our approach.,Based on my field research,,I believe that internationalnand Congolese actors,should pay more attentionnto the resolution of land conflict,and the promotionnof inter-community reconciliation.,So for instance,nin the province of the Kivus,,the Life and Peace Institutenand its Congolese partners,have set up inter-community forums,to discuss the specificsnof local conflicts over land,,and these forums have found solutionsnto help manage the violence.,That's the kind of programnthat is sorely needed,throughout eastern Congo.,It's with programs like this,that we can help peoplenlike Isabelle and her husband. 
 So these will not be magic wands,,but because they take into accountndeeply rooted causes of the violence,,they could definitely be game-changers. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When the Portuguese arrivednin Latin America about 500 years ago,,they obviously foundnthis amazing tropical forest.,And among all this biodiversitynthat they had never seen before,,they found one species that caughtntheir attention very quickly.,This species, when you cut the bark,nyou find a very dark red resin,that was very good to paintnand dye fabric to make clothes.,The indigenous people callednthis species pau brasil,,and that's the reason why this land becamen"land of Brasil," and later on, Brazil.,That's the only country in the worldnthat has the name of a tree.,So you can imagine that it's very coolnto be a forester in Brazil,,among other reasons. 
 Forest products are all around us.,Apart from all those products,,the forest is very importantnfor climate regulation.,In Brazil, almost 70 percentnof the evaporation that makes rain,actually comes from the forest.,Just the Amazon pumps to the atmospheren20 billion tons of water every day.,This is more than what the Amazon River,nwhich is the largest river in the world,,puts in the sea per day,nwhich is 17 billion tons.,If we had to boil water to getnthe same effect as evapotranspiration,,we would need six months of the entirenpower generation capacity of the world.,So it's a hell of a service for all of us. 
 We have in the worldnabout four billion hectares of forests.,This is more or less China, U.S.,nCanada and Brazil all together,,in terms of size, to have an idea.,Three quarters of thatnis in the temperate zone,,and just one quarter is in the tropics,,but this one quarter, one billionnhectares, holds most of the biodiversity,,and very importantly, 50 percentnof the living biomass, the carbon.,Now, we used to havensix billion hectares of forest --,50 percent more thannwhat we have -- 2,000 years ago.,We've actually lost two billion hectaresnin the last 2,000 years.,But in the last 100 years,nwe lost half of that.,That was when we shiftednfrom deforestation of temperate forests,to deforestation of tropical forests. 
 So think of this: In 100 years,,we lost the same amountnof forest in the tropics,that we lost in 2,000 yearsnin temperate forests.,That's the speed of the destructionnthat we are having. 
 Now, Brazil is an importantnpiece of this puzzle.,We have the second largestnforest in the world, just after Russia.,It means 12 percent of allnthe world's forests are in Brazil,,most of that in the Amazon.,It's the largest piece of forest we have.nIt's a very big, large area.,You can see that you could fitnmany of the European countries there.,We still have 80 percentnof the forest cover.,That's the good news.,But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years.,So if you go with that speed,,very soon, we will loose this powerfulnpump that we have in the Amazon,that regulates our climate. 
 Deforestation was growingnfast and accelerating,at the end of the '90snand the beginning of the 2000s.,(Chainsaw sound),(Sound of falling tree),Twenty-seven thousandnsquare kilometers in one year.,This is 2.7 million hectares.,It's almost like halfnof Costa Rica every year. 
 So at this moment -- this is 2003, 2004 --,I happened to be coming to worknin the government.,And together with other teammatesnin the National Forest Department,,we were assigned a task to join a teamnand find out the causes of deforestation,,and make a plan to combat thatnat a national level,,involving the local governments,nthe civil society,,business, local communities,,in an effort that couldntackle those causes. 
 So we came up with this plannwith 144 actions in different areas.,Now I will go throughnall of them one by one --,no, just giving some examplesnof what we had done in the next few years.,So the first thing, we set up a systemnwith the national space agency,that could actually seenwhere deforestation is happening,,almost in real time.,So now in Brazil, nwe have this system, DETER,,where every month,nor every two months,,we get information onnwhere deforestation is happening,so we can actually actnwhen it's happening.,And all the informationnis fully transparent,so others can replicate thatnin independent systems.,This allows us, among other things,,to apprehend 1.4 million cubic metersnof logs that were illegally taken.,Part of that we saw and sell,nand all the revenue becomes a fund,that now funds conservation projectsnof local communities as an endowment fund.,This also allows usnto make a big operation,to seize corruption and illegal activities,that ended up having 700 people in prison,nincluding a lot of public servants.,Then we made the connectionnthat areas that have been doing,illegal deforestation should not getnany kind of credit or finance.,So we cut this through the bank systemnand then linked this to the end users.,So supermarkets,nthe slaughterhouses, and so on,that buy productsnfrom illegal clear-cut areas,,they also can be liablenfor the deforestation.,So making all these connections to helpnto push the problem down.,And also we work a lotnon land tenure issues.,It's very important for conflicts.,Fifty million hectaresnof protected areas were created,,which is an area the size of Spain.,And of those, eight millionnwere indigenous lands. 
 Now we start to see results.,So in the last 10 years,,deforestation came downnin Brazil 75 percent. 
 (Applause) 
 So if we compare itnwith the average deforestation,that we had in the last decade,,we saved 8.7 million hectares,nwhich is the size of Austria.,But more importantly,nit avoided the emission,of three billion tonsnof CO2 in the atmosphere.,This is by far the largest contributionnto reduce greenhouse gas emissions,,until today, as a positive action.,One may think that when you donthese kinds of actions,to decrease, to push down deforestation,,you will have an economic impact,because you will not haveneconomic activity or something like that.,But it's interesting to knownthat it's quite the opposite.,In fact, in the period when we haventhe deepest decline of deforestation,,the economy grew, on average,ndouble from the previous decade,,when deforestation was actually going up.,So it's a good lesson for us.,Maybe this is completely disconnected,,as we just learned by havingndeforestation come down. 
 Now this is all good news,nand it's quite an achievement,,and we obviously should benvery proud about that.,But it's not even close to sufficient.,In fact, if you think aboutnthe deforestation in the Amazon in 2013,,that was over half a million hectares,,which means that every minute,,an area the size of two soccer fields,is being cut in the Amazonnlast year, just last year.,If we sum up the deforestation we havenin the other biomes in Brazil,,we are talking about still the largestndeforestation rate in the world.,It's more or less likenwe are forest heroes,,but still deforestation champions.,So we can't be satisfied,nnot even close to satisfied.,So the next step, I think,,is to fight to have zero lossnof forest cover in Brazil,and to have that as a goal for 2020.,That's our next step. 
 Now I've always been interestednin the relationship,between climate change and forests.,First, because 15 percent of greenhousengas emissions come from deforestation,,so it's a big part of the problem.,But also, forests can bena big part of the solution,since that's the best way we knownto sink, capture and store carbon.,Now, there is another relationshipnof climate and forests,that really stuck me in 2008nand made me change my career,from forests to workingnwith climate change.,I went to visit Canada,nin British Columbia,,together with the chiefs ofnthe forest services of other countries,that we have a kind of alliance of them,nlike Canada, Russia, India, China, U.S.,And when we were therenwe learned about this pine beetle,that is literally eatingnthe forests in Canada.,What we see here, those brown trees,nthese are really dead trees.,They are standing dead treesnbecause of the larvae of the beetle.,What happens is that this beetle,is controlled bynthe cold weather in the winter.,For many years now, they don't haventhe sufficient cold weather,to actually controlnthe population of this beetle.,And it became a diseasenthat is really killing billions of trees.,So I came back with this notionnthat the forest is actually,one of the earliest and most affectednvictims of climate change. 
 So I was thinking,,if I succeed in workingnwith all my colleagues,to actually help to stop deforestation,,maybe we will lose the battlenlater on for climate change,by floods, heat, fires and so on.,So I decided to leave the forest service,and start to work directlynon climate change,,find a way to think and understandnthe challenge, and go from there. 
 Now, the challenge of climate changenis pretty straightforward.,The goal is very clear.,We want to limit the increasenof the average temperature,of the planet to two degrees.,There are several reasons for that.,I will not get into that now.,But in order to getnto this limit of two degrees,,which is possible for us to survive,,the IPCC, the IntergovernmentalnPanel on Climate Change,,defines that we have a budget of emissionsnof 1,000 billion tons of CO2,from now until the end of the century.,So if we divide thisnby the number of years,,what we have is an average budgetnof 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.,Now what is one ton of CO2?,It's more or less what one small car,nrunning 20 kilometers a day,,will emit in one year.,Or it's one flight, one way,,from São Paulo to Johannesburgnor to London, one way.,Two ways, two tons.,So 11 billion tons is twice that. 
 Now the emissions todaynare 50 billion tons, and it's growing.,It's growing and maybenit will be 61 by 2020.,Now we need to go down to 10 by 2050.,And while this happens,,the population will grownfrom seven to nine billion people,,the economy will grownfrom 60 trillion dollars in 2010,to 200 trillion dollars.,And so what we need to donis to be much more efficient,in a way that we can gonfrom seven tons of carbon per capita,per person, per year,ninto something like one.,You have to choose.nYou take the airplane or you have a car. 
 So the question is, can we make it?,And that's the exactly the same question,I got when I was developingna plan to combat deforestation.,It's such a big problem, so complex.nCan we really do it?,I think so. Think of this:,Deforestation means 60 percentnof the greenhouse gas emissions,in Brazil in the last decade.,Now it's a little bitnless than 30 percent.,In the world, 60 percent is energy.,So if we can tackle directly the energy,,the same way we couldntackle deforestation,,maybe we can have a chance. 
 So there are five thingsnthat I think we should do.,First, we need to disconnect developmentnfrom carbon emissions.,We don't need to clear-cut all the forestsnto actually get more jobs,and agriculture and have more economy.,That's what we provednwhen we decreased deforestation,and the economy continued to grow.,Same thing could happennin the energy sector.,Second, we have to moventhe incentives to the right place.,Today, 500 billion dollars a yearngoes into subsidies for fossil fuels.,Why don't we put a price on carbonnand transfer this to the renewable energy?,Third, we need to measurenand make it transparent,where, when and whonis emitting greenhouse gases,so we can have actions specificallynfor each one of those opportunities.,Fourth, we need to leapfrognthe routes of development,,which means, you don't neednto go to the landline telephone,before you get to the mobile phones.,Same way we don't neednto go to fossil fuels,to the one billion peoplenwho don't have access to energy,before we get to the clean energy.,And fifth and last,,we need to share responsibilitynbetween governments,,business and civil society.,There is work to do for everybody,nand we need to have everybody on board. 
 So to finalize,,I think the future is not like a fate,that you have to just gonas business as usual goes.,We need to have the couragento actually change the route,,invest in something new,,think that we can actuallynchange the route.,I think we are doing thisnwith deforestation in Brazil,,and I hope we can do it alsonwith climate change in the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So we humans have an extraordinarynpotential for goodness,,but also an immense power to do harm.,Any tool can be used to buildnor to destroy.,That all depends on our motivation.,Therefore, it is all the more important,to foster an altruistic motivationnrather than a selfish one. 
 So now we indeed are facing nmany challenges in our times.,Those could be personal challenges.,Our own mind can be our best friendnor our worst enemy.,There's also societal challenges:,poverty in the midst of plenty,ninequalities, conflict, injustice.,And then there are the new challenges,nwhich we don't expect.,Ten thousand years ago, there werenabout five million human beings on Earth.,Whatever they could do,,the Earth's resilience nwould soon heal human activities.,After the Industrialnand Technological Revolutions,,that's not the same anymore.,We are now the major agentnof impact on our Earth.,We enter the Anthropocene,nthe era of human beings.,So in a way, if we were to saynwe need to continue this endless growth,,endless use of material resources,,it's like if this man was saying --,and I heard a former head of state,nI won't mention who, saying --,"Five years ago, we were atnthe edge of the precipice.,Today we made a big step forward.",So this edge is the samenthat has been defined by scientists,as the planetary boundaries.,And within those boundaries,nthey can carry a number of factors.,We can still prosper, humanity can stillnprosper for 150,000 years,if we keep the same stability of climate,as in the Holocenenfor the last 10,000 years.,But this depends on choosingna voluntary simplicity,,growing qualitatively, not quantitatively. 
 So in 1900, as you can see,nwe were well within the limits of safety.,Now, in 1950 came the great acceleration.,Now hold your breath, not too long,nto imagine what comes next.,Now we have vastly overrunnsome of the planetary boundaries.,Just to take biodiversity, nat the current rate,,by 2050, 30 percent of all species non Earth will have disappeared.,Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge,nthat's not going to be reversible.,So here I am sitting,in front of a 7,000-meter-high, n21,000-foot glacier in Bhutan.,At the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciersnare melting fast, faster than the Arctic. 
 So what can we do in that situation?,Well, however complexnpolitically, economically, scientifically,the question of the environment is,,it simply boils down to a questionnof altruism versus selfishness.,I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.,(Laughter),Groucho Marx said, "Why should I carenabout future generations?,What have they ever done for me?",(Laughter),Unfortunately, I heardnthe billionaire Steve Forbes,,on Fox News, saying exactly nthe same thing, but seriously.,He was told about the rise of the ocean,,and he said, "I find it absurdnto change my behavior today,for something that will happen nin a hundred years.",So if you don't carenfor future generations,,just go for it. 
 So one of the main challenges of our times,is to reconcile three time scales:,the short term of the economy,,the ups and downs of the stock market,nthe end-of-the-year accounts;,the midterm of the quality of life --,what is the quality every moment of our nlife, over 10 years and 20 years? --,and the long term of the environment.,When the environmentalistsnspeak with economists,,it's like a schizophrenic dialogue,ncompletely incoherent.,They don't speak the same language.,Now, for the last 10 years,nI went around the world,meeting economists, scientists,nneuroscientists, environmentalists,,philosophers, thinkers nin the Himalayas, all over the place.,It seems to me, there's only one concept,that can reconcilenthose three time scales.,It is simply having morenconsideration for others.,If you have more consideration for others,nyou will have a caring economics,,where finance is at the service of society,and not society at the service of finance.,You will not play at the casino,with the resources that peoplenhave entrusted you with.,If you have more consideration for others,,you will make surenthat you remedy inequality,,that you bring some kind nof well-being within society,,in education, at the workplace.,Otherwise, a nation that isnthe most powerful and the richest,but everyone is miserable,nwhat's the point?,And if you have morenconsideration for others,,you are not going to ransacknthat planet that we have,and at the current rate, we don'tnhave three planets to continue that way. 
 So the question is,,okay, altruism is the answer,nit's not just a novel ideal,,but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?,And first of all, does it exist,,true altruism, or are we so selfish?,So some philosophers thoughtnwe were irredeemably selfish.,But are we really all just like rascals?,That's good news, isn't it?,Many philosophers, nlike Hobbes, have said so.,But not everyone looks like a rascal.,Or is man a wolf for man?,But this guy doesn't seem too bad.,He's one of my friends in Tibet.,He's very kind.,So now, we love cooperation.,There's no better joy nthan working together, is there?,And then not only humans.,Then, of course, there'snthe struggle for life,,the survival of the fittest,nsocial Darwinism.,But in evolution, cooperation --nthough competition exists, of course --,cooperation has to be much more creativento go to increased levels of complexity.,We are super-cooperators nand we should even go further. 
 So now, on top of that,nthe quality of human relationships.,The OECD did a survey among 10 factors,nincluding income, everything.,The first one that people said,nthat's the main thing for my happiness,,is quality of social relationships.,Not only in humans.,And look at those great-grandmothers.,So now, this idea nthat if we go deep within,,we are irredeemably selfish,,this is armchair science.,There is not a single sociological study,,psychological study,nthat's ever shown that.,Rather, the opposite.,My friend, Daniel Batson, nspent a whole life,putting people in the labnin very complex situations.,And of course we are sometimes selfish,nand some people more than others.,But he found that systematically,nno matter what,,there's a significant number of people,who do behave altruistically,nno matter what.,If you see someonendeeply wounded, great suffering,,you might just helpnout of empathic distress --,you can't stand it, so it's better to helpnthan to keep on looking at that person.,So we tested all that, and in the end, nhe said, clearly people can be altruistic.,So that's good news.,And even further, we should looknat the banality of goodness.,Now look at here.,When we come out, we aren't ngoing to say, "That's so nice.,There was no fistfight while this mob nwas thinking about altruism.",No, that's expected, isn't it?,If there was a fistfight,nwe would speak of that for months.,So the banality of goodness is somethingnthat doesn't attract your attention,,but it exists. 
 Now, look at this.,So some psychologists said,,when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian nprojects in the Himalayas,that give me so much joy,,they said, "Oh, I see,nyou work for the warm glow.,That is not altruistic.nYou just feel good.",You think this guy,nwhen he jumped in front of the train,,he thought, "I'm going to feelnso good when this is over?",(Laughter),But that's not the end of it.,They say, well, but whennyou interviewed him, he said,,"I had no choice.nI had to jump, of course.",He has no choice. Automatic behavior.nIt's neither selfish nor altruistic.,No choice?,Well of course, this guy'snnot going to think for half an hour,,"Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?",He does it. There is a choice,nbut it's obvious, it's immediate.,And then, also, there he had a choice.,(Laughter) 
 There are people who had choice,nlike Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,,and the whole villagenof Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.,For the whole Second World War,nthey saved 3,500 Jews,,gave them shelter,nbrought them to Switzerland,,against all odds, at the risknof their lives and those of their family.,So altruism does exist. 
 So what is altruism?,It is the wish: May others be happynand find the cause of happiness.,Now, empathy is the affective resonancenor cognitive resonance that tells you,,this person is joyful,nthis person suffers.,But empathy alone is not sufficient.,If you keep on beingnconfronted with suffering,,you might have empathic distress, burnout,,so you need the greater spherenof loving-kindness.,With Tania Singer at the Max Planck nInstitute of Leipzig,,we showed that the brain networks fornempathy and loving-kindness are different.,Now, that's all well done,,so we got that from evolution,nfrom maternal care, parental love,,but we need to extend that.,It can be extended even to other species. 
 Now, if we want a more altruistic society,nwe need two things:,individual change and societal change.,So is individual change possible?,Two thousand yearsnof contemplative study said yes, it is.,Now, 15 years of collaborationnwith neuroscience and epigenetics,said yes, our brains changenwhen you train in altruism.,So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.,This is the first time I wentnafter two and a half hours.,And then the result has been publishednin many scientific papers.,It shows without ambiguitynthat there is structural change,and functional change in the brainnwhen you train the altruistic love.,Just to give you an idea:,this is the meditator at rest on the left,,meditator in compassion meditation,nyou see all the activity,,and then the control group at rest,nnothing happened,,in meditation, nothing happened.,They have not been trained. 
 So do you need 50,000 hours nof meditation? No, you don't.,Four weeks, 20 minutes a day,nof caring, mindfulness meditation,already brings a structural changenin the brain compared to a control group.,That's only 20 minutes a daynfor four weeks. 
 Even with preschoolers --nRichard Davidson did that in Madison.,An eight-week program: gratitude, loving-nkindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.,You would say, n"Oh, they're just preschoolers.",Look after eight weeks,,the pro-social behavior,nthat's the blue line.,And then comes the ultimatenscientific test, the stickers test.,Before, you determine for each childnwho is their best friend in the class,,their least favorite child,nan unknown child, and the sick child,,and they have to give stickers away.,So before the intervention,nthey give most of it to their best friend.,Four, five years old, n20 minutes three times a week.,After the intervention,nno more discrimination:,the same amount of stickers to their nbest friend and the least favorite child.,That's something we should donin all the schools in the world. 
 Now where do we go from there? 
 (Applause) 
 When the Dalai Lama heard that,nhe told Richard Davidson,,"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools,nthe U.N., the whole world." 
 So now where do we go from there?,Individual change is possible.,Now do we have to wait for an altruistic ngene to be in the human race?,That will take 50,000 years,ntoo much for the environment.,Fortunately, there isnthe evolution of culture.,Cultures, as specialists have shown,nchange faster than genes.,That's the good news.,Look, attitude towards warnhas dramatically changed over the years.,So now individual change and cultural nchange mutually fashion each other,,and yes, we can achievena more altruistic society. 
 So where do we go from there?,Myself, I will go back to the East.,Now we treat 100,000 patientsna year in our projects.,We have 25,000 kids in school,nfour percent overhead.,Some people say, "Well,nyour stuff works in practice,,but does it work in theory?",There's always positive deviance.,So I will also go back to my hermitage,to find the inner resourcesnto better serve others. 
 But on the more global level,nwhat can we do?,We need three things.,Enhancing cooperation:,Cooperative learning in the schoolninstead of competitive learning,,Unconditional cooperationnwithin corporations --,there can be some competitionnbetween corporations, but not within.,We need sustainable harmony.nI love this term.,Not sustainable growth anymore.,Sustainable harmony means nownwe will reduce inequality.,In the future, we do more with less,,and we continue to grow qualitatively,nnot quantitatively.,We need caring economics.,The Homo economicus cannot dealnwith poverty in the midst of plenty,,cannot deal with the problemnof the common goods,of the atmosphere, of the oceans.,We need a caring economics.,If you say economicsnshould be compassionate,,they say, "That's not our job.",But if you say they don't care,nthat looks bad.,We need local commitment,nglobal responsibility.,We need to extend altruismnto the other 1.6 million species.,Sentient beings nare co-citizens in this world.,and we need to dare altruism. 
 So, long live the altruistic revolution.,Viva la revolución de altruismo. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to tell you a storynabout death and architecture. 
 A hundred years ago, we tended to dienof infectious diseases like pneumonia,,that, if they took hold,nwould take us away quite quickly.,We tended to die at home,nin our own beds, looked after by family,,although that was the default option,because a lot of peoplenlacked access to medical care. 
 And then in the 20th centuryna lot of things changed.,We developed new medicines like penicillin,so we could treatnthose infectious diseases.,New medical technologiesnlike x-ray machines were invented.,And because they werenso big and expensive,,we needed large, centralizednbuildings to keep them in,,and they became our modern hospitals. 
 After the Second World War,,a lot of countries set up nuniversal healthcare systems,so that everyone who neededntreatment could get it.,The result was that lifespans extendednfrom about 45 at the start of the century,to almost double that today.,The 20th century was this time of huge noptimism about what science could offer,,but with all of the focus on life,ndeath was forgotten,,even as our approach to deathnchanged dramatically. 
 Now, I'm an architect,,and for the past year and a halfnI've been looking at these changes,and at what they mean for architecturenrelated to death and dying.,We now tend to dienof cancer and heart disease,,and what that means is that many of usnwill have a long period of chronic illness,at the end of our lives.,During that period,,we'll likely spend a lot of time nin hospitals and hospices and care homes. 
 Now, we've all been in a modern hospital.,You know those fluorescent lightsnand the endless corridors,and those rows of uncomfortable chairs.,Hospital architecturenhas earned its bad reputation.,But the surprising thing is,nit wasn't always like this. 
 This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti,nbuilt in 1419 by Brunelleschi,,who was one of the most famousnand influential architects of his time.,And when I look at this buildingnand then think about hospitals today,,what amazes me isnthis building's ambition.,It's just a really great building.,It has these courtyards in the middle,so that all of the roomsnhave daylight and fresh air,,and the rooms are bignand they have high ceilings,,so they just feelnmore comfortable to be in.,And it's also beautiful.,Somehow, we've forgottennthat that's even possible for a hospital. 
 Now, if we want better buildingsnfor dying, then we have to talk about it,,but because we find the subjectnof death uncomfortable,,we don't talk about it,,and we don't question how wenas a society approach death.,One of the things that surprised menmost in my research, though,,is how changeable attitudes actually are.,This is the first crematorium in the U.K.,,which was built in Woking in the 1870s.,And when this was first built,nthere were protests in the local village.,Cremation wasn't socially acceptable,nand 99.8 percent of people got buried.,And yet, only a hundred years later,nthree quarters of us get cremated.,People are actually really opennto changing things,if they're given the chancento talk about them. 
 So this conversationnabout death and architecture,was what I wanted to startnwhen I did my first exhibition on it,in Venice in June,nwhich was called "Death in Venice.",It was designed to be quite playful,so that people wouldnliterally engage with it.,This is one of our exhibits,nwhich is an interactive map of London,that shows just how muchnof the real estate in the city,is given over to death and dying,,and as you wave your hand across the map,,the name of that piece of real estate,nthe building or cemetery, is revealed.,Another of our exhibitsnwas a series of postcards,that people could take away with them.,And they showed people's homesnand hospitals,and cemeteries and mortuaries,,and they tell the storynof the different spaces,that we pass throughnon either side of death.,We wanted to shownthat where we die,is a key part of how we die. 
 Now, the strangest thing was the waynthat visitors reacted to the exhibition,,especially the audio-visual works.,We had people dancingnand running and jumping,as they tried to activatenthe exhibits in different ways,,and at a certain pointnthey would kind of stop,and remember that they were innan exhibition about death,,and that maybe that's notnhow you're supposed to act.,But actually, I would questionnwhether there is one way,that you're supposed to act around death,,and if there's not, I'd ask you to thinknabout what you think a good death is,,and what you think that architecturenthat supports a good death might be like,,and mightn't it be a little less like thisnand a little more like this? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)People back home call me a heckler,,a troublemaker, an irritant,,a rebel, an activist,,the voice of the people.,But that wasn't always me. 
 Growing up, I had a nickname.,They used to call me Softy,,meaning the soft, harmless boy.,Like every other human being,nI avoided trouble.,In my childhood, they taught me silence.,Don't argue, do as you're told.,In Sunday school, they taught mendon't confront, don't argue,,even if you're right,nturn the other cheek. 
 This was reinforcednby the political climate of the time.,(Laughter),Kenya is a countrynwhere you are guilty,until proven rich.,(Laughter),Kenya's poor are five times more likely,to be shot dead by the policenwho are meant to protect them,than by criminals.,This was reinforcednby the political climate of the day.,We had a president,nMoi, who was a dictator.,He ruled the country with an iron fist,,and anyone who darednquestion his authority,was arrested, tortured,njailed or even killed.,That meant that people were taughtnto be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.,Being a coward was not an insult.,Being a coward was a compliment.,We used to be told that a cowardngoes home to his mother.,What that meant: that if you stayednout of trouble you're going to stay alive. 
 I used to question this advice,,and eight years agonwe had an election in Kenya,,and the results were violently disputed.,What followed that electionnwas terrible violence, rape,,and the killing of over 1,000 people.,My work was to document the violence.,As a photographer,nI took thousands of images,,and after two months,,the two politicians came together,nhad a cup of tea,,signed a peace agreement,nand the country moved on. 
 I was a very disturbed mannbecause I saw the violence firsthand.,I saw the killings.nI saw the displacement.,I met women who had been raped,nand it disturbed me,,but the country never spoke about it.,We pretended. We all became smart cowards.,We decided to stay out of troublenand not talk about it. 
 Ten months later, I quit my job.nI said I could not stand it anymore.,After quitting my job,nI decided to organize my friends,to speak aboutnthe violence in the country,,to speak about the state of the nation,,and June 1, 2009 was the daynthat we were meant to go to the stadium,and try and get the president's attention.,It's a national holiday,,it's broadcast across the country,,and I showed up at the stadium.,My friends did not show up.,I found myself alone,,and I didn't know what to do.,I was scared,,but I knew very wellnthat that particular day,,I had to make a decision.,Was I able to live as a coward,nlike everyone else,,or was I going to make a stand?,And when the president stood up to speak,,I found myself on my feetnshouting at the president,,telling him to remembernthe post-election violence victims,,to stop the corruption.,And suddenly, out of nowhere,,the police pounced on menlike hungry lions.,They held my mouth,and dragged me out of the stadium,,where they thoroughly beat me upnand locked me up in jail.,I spent that night inna cold cement floor in the jail,,and that got me thinking.,What was making me feel this way?,My friends and family thoughtnI was crazy because of what I did,,and the images that I tooknwere disturbing my life.,The images that I tooknwere just a number to many Kenyans.,Most Kenyans did not see the violence.,It was a story to them. 
 And so I decided to actuallynstart a street exhibition,to show the images of the violencenacross the country,and get people talking about it.,We traveled the countrynand showed the images,,and this was a journey that has started mento the activist path,,where I decided to become silent no more,,to talk about those things.,We traveled, and our general sitenfrom our street exhibit,became for political graffitinabout the situation in the country,,talking about corruption, bad leadership.,We have even done symbolic burials.,We have delivered live pigsnto Kenya's parliament,as a symbol of our politicians' greed.,It has been done in Ugandanand other countries,,and what is most powerful is thatnthe images have been picked by the media,and amplified across the country,nacross the continent. 
 Where I used to stand up alonenseven years ago,,now I belong to a communitynof many people who stand up with me.,I am no longer alone when I stand upnto speak about these things.,I belong to a group of young peoplenwho are passionate about the country,,who want to bring about change,,and they're no longer afraid,nand they're no longer smart cowards.,So that was my story.,That day in the stadium,,I stood up as a smart coward.,By that one action, I said goodbyento the 24 years living as a coward. 
 There are two most powerfulndays in your life:,the day you're born,nand the day you discover why.,That day standing up in that stadiumnshouting at the President,,I discovered why I was truly born,,that I would no longer be silentnin the face of injustice.,Do you know why you were born?,Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Tom Rielly: It's an amazing story.,I just want to ask youna couple quick questions.,So PAWA254:,you've created a studio, a placenwhere young people can go,and harness the power of digital media,to do some of this action.,What's happening now with PAWA? 
 Boniface Mwangi: So we have nthis community of filmmakers,,graffiti artists, musicians,nand when there's an issue in the country,,we come together, we brainstorm,nand take up on that issue.,So our most powerful tool is art,,because we live in a very busy worldnwhere people are so busy in their life,,and they don't have time to read.,So we package our activismnand we package our message in art.,So from the music, the graffiti, nthe art, that's what we do.,Can I say one more thing? 
 TR: Yeah, of course. (Applause) 
 BM: In spite of being arrested,nbeaten up, threatened,,the moment I discovered my voice,,that I could actually stand upnfor what I really believed in,,I'm no longer afraid.,I used to be called softy,nbut I'm no longer softy,,because I discovered who I really am,nas in, that's what I want to do,,and there's such beauty in doing that.,There's nothing as powerful as that,nknowing that I'm meant to do this,,because you don't get scared,nyou just continue living your life. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)2014 is a very special year for me:,20 years as a consultant,,20 years of marriage,,and I'm turning 50 in one month.,That means I was born in 1964nin a small town in Germany. 
 It was a gray November day,,and I was overdue.,The hospital's maternity wardnwas really stressed out,because a lot of babies were bornnon this gray November day.,As a matter of fact,,1964 was the year with the highestnbirth rate ever in Germany:,more than 1.3 million.,Last year, we just hit over 600,000,,so half of my number. 
 What you can see herenis the German age pyramid,,and there, the small black pointnat the top, that's me.,(Laughter) (Applause),In red, you can see the potentialnworking-age population,,so people over 15 and under 65,,and I'm actually only interestednin this red area. 
 Now, let's do a simple simulation,of how this age structure will developnover the next couple of years.,As you can see,,the peak is moving to the right,,and I, with many other baby boomers,nwill retire in 2030.,By the way, I don't need any forecasts,of birth rates for predictingnthis red area.,The red area,,so the potentialnworking-age population in 2030,,is already set in stone today,,except for much higher migration rates.,And if you compare this red area in 2030nwith the red area in 2014,,it is much, much smaller. 
 So before I show younthe rest of the world,,what does this mean for Germany?,So what we know fromnthis picture is that the labor supply,,so people who provide labor,,will go down in Germany,nand will go down significantly.,Now, what about labor demand?,That's where it gets tricky.,As you might know, the consultant'snfavorite answer to any question is,,"It depends.",So I would say it depends.,We didn't want to forecast the future.,Highly speculative.,We did something else.,We looked at the GDPnand productivity growth of Germany,over the last 20 years,,and calculated the following scenario:,if Germany wants to continuenthis GDP and productivity growth,,we could directly calculate,how many people Germany would neednto support this growth.,And this is the green line: labor demand.,So Germany will run intona major talent shortage very quickly.,Eight million people are missing,,which is more than 20 percentnof our current workforce,,so big numbers, really big numbers.,And we calculated several scenarios,,and the picture always looked like this. 
 Now, to close the gap,,Germany has to significantlynincrease migration,,get many more women in the workforce,,increase retirement age —,by the way, we justnlowered it this year —,and all these measures at once.,If Germany fails here,nGermany will stagnate.,We won't grow anymore. Why?,Because the workers are not therenwho can generate this growth.,And companies will looknfor talents somewhere else.,But where? 
 Now, we simulated labor supplynand labor demand,for the largest 15 economies in the world,,representing more than 70 percentnof world GDP,,and the overall picturenlooks like this by 2020.,Blue indicates a labor surplus,,red indicates a labor shortfall,,and gray are those countriesnwhich are borderline.,So by 2020, we still see a labor surplusnin some countries,,like Italy, France, the U.S.,,but this picture will changendramatically by 2030.,By 2030, we will facena global workforce crisis,in most of our largest economies,,including threenout of the four BRIC countries.,China, with its formernone-child policy, will be hit,,as well as Brazil and Russia. 
 Now, to tell the truth,,in reality, the situationnwill be even more challenging.,What you can see here are average numbers.,We de-averaged them,and broke them downninto different skill levels,,and what we found,were even higher shortfallsnfor high-skilled people,and a partial surplusnfor low-skilled workers.,So on top of an overall labor shortage,,we will face a bignskill mismatch in the future,,and this means huge challenges,in terms of education, qualification,,upskilling for governments and companies. 
 Now, the next thing we looked intonwas robots, automation, technology.,Will technology change this picturenand boost productivity?,Now, the short answer would be,that our numbers already includena significant growth in productivity,driven by technology.,A long answer would go like this.,Let's take Germany again.,The Germans havena certain reputation in the world,when it comes to productivity.,In the '90s, I worked in our Boston officenfor almost two years,,and when I left, an old senior partnerntold me, literally,,"Send me more of these Germans,nthey work like machines.",(Laughter),That was 1998.,Sixteen years later,nyou'd probably say the opposite.,"Send me more of these machines.nThey work like Germans.",(Laughter) (Applause) 
 Technology will replacena lot of jobs, regular jobs.,Not only in the production industry,,but even office workers are in jeopardy,and might be replaced by robots,,artificial intelligence,nbig data, or automation.,So the key question is notnif technology replaces some of these jobs,,but when, how fast, and to what extent?,Or in other words,,will technology help usnto solve this global workforce crisis?,Yes and no.,This is a more sophisticatednversion of "it depends.",(Laughter) 
 Let's take the automotive industrynas an example,,because there, more than 40 percentnof industrial robots are already working,and automation has already taken place.,In 1980, less than 10 percentnof the production cost of a car,was caused by electronic parts.,Today, this number is more than 30 percent,and it will grownto more than 50 percent by 2030.,And these new electronic partsnand applications,require new skillsnand have created a lot of new jobs,,like the cognitive systems engineer,who optimizes the interactionnbetween driver and electronic system.,In 1980, no one had the slightest cluenthat such a job would ever exist.,As a matter of fact,,the overall number of peopleninvolved in the production of a car,has only changed slightlynin the last decades,,in spite of robots and automation. 
 So what does this mean?,Yes, technologynwill replace a lot of jobs,,but we will also see a lot of new jobsnand new skills on the horizon,,and that means technology will worsennour overall skill mismatch.,And this kind of de-averaging,reveals the crucial challengenfor governments and businesses. 
 So people, high-skilled people,,talents, will be the big thingnin the next decade.,If they are the scarce resource,nwe have to understand them much better.,Are they actually willing to work abroad?,What are their job preferences? 
 To find out, this year we conductedna global survey,among more than 200,000 job seekersnfrom 189 countries.,Migration is certainlynone key measure to close a gap,,at least in the short term,,so we asked about mobility.,More than 60 percentnof these 200,000 job seekers,are willing to work abroad.,For me, a surprisingly high number.,If you look at the employeesnaged 21 to 30,,this number is even higher.,If you split this number up by country,,yes, the world is mobile, but only partly.,The least mobile countriesnare Russia, Germany and the U.S.,Now where would these people like to move?,Number seven is Australia,nwhere 28 percent could imagine moving.,Then France, Switzerland,nGermany, Canada, U.K.,,and the top choicenworldwide is the U.S. 
 Now, what are the job preferencesnof these 200,000 people?,So, what are they looking for?,Out of a list of 26 topics,nsalary is only number eight.,The top four topicsnare all around culture.,Number four,,having a great relationship with the boss;,three, enjoying a great work-life balance;,two, having a great relationshipnwith colleagues;,and the top priority worldwide,is being appreciated for your work.,So, do I get a thank you?,Not only once a yearnwith the annual bonus payment,,but every day.,And now, our global workforce crisisnbecomes very personal.,People are looking for recognition.,Aren't we all lookingnfor recognition in our jobs? 
 Now, let me connect the dots.,We will face a global workforce crisis,which consistsnof an overall labor shortage,plus a huge skill mismatch,,plus a big cultural challenge.,And this global workforce crisisnis approaching very fast.,Right now, we arenjust at the turning point.,So what can we, what can governments,nwhat can companies do?,Every company,,but also every country,,needs a people strategy,,and to act on it immediately,,and such a people strategynconsists of four parts.,Number one, a plan,for how to forecast supply and demandnfor different jobs and different skills.,Workforce planning will become nmore important than financial planning.,Two, a plan fornhow to attract great people:,generation Y, women, but also retirees.,Three, a plan for how to educatenand upskill them.,There's a hugenupskilling challenge ahead of us.,And four,,for how to retain the best people,,or in other words,,how to realize an appreciationnand relationship culture. 
 However, one crucial underlying factornis to change our attitudes.,Employees are resources, are assets,,not costs, not head counts,,not machines,,not even the Germans. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 (Applause)It is very fashionable and proper nto speak about food,in all its forms, all its colors, naromas and tastes.,But after the food goes through nthe digestive system,,when it is thrown out as crap,,it is no longer fashionablento speak about it.,It is rather revolting. 
 I'm a guy who has graduated nfrom bullshit to full-shit.,(Laughter),My organization, Gram Vikas, which meansn"village development organization,",was working in the area nof renewable energy.,On the most part, we were nproducing biogas,,biogas for rural kitchens.,We produce biogas in India nby using animal manure,,which usually, in India, nis called cow dung.,But as the gender-sensitive nperson that I am,,I would like to call it bullshit.,But realizing later on,how important were sanitationnand the disposal of crap in a proper way,,we went into the arena of sanitation.,Eighty percent of all diseases nin India and most developing countries,are because of poor quality water.,And when we look at the reason nfor poor quality water,,you find that it is our abysmal attitude nto the disposal of human waste. 
 Human waste, in its rawest form,,finds its way back to drinking water,nbathing water, washing water,,irrigation water, whatever water you see.,And this is the cause for 80 percent nof the diseases in rural areas.,In India, it is unfortunately only thenwomen who carry water.,So for all domestic needs,nwomen have to carry water.,So that is a pitiable state of affairs. 
 Open defecation is rampant.,Seventy percent of Indiandefecates in the open.,They sit there out in the open,,with the wind on their sails,,hiding their faces, exposing their bases,,and sitting there in pristine glory --,70 percent of India.,And if you look at the world total,,60 percent of all the crap that is thrownninto the open is by Indians.,A fantastic distinction.,I don't know if we Indians can be proudnof such a distinction.,(Laughter) 
 So we, together with a lot of villages,,we began to talk about how to really naddress this situation of sanitation.,And we came together and formed na project called MANTRA.,MANTRA stands for Movement and ActionnNetwork for Transformation of Rural Areas.,So we are speaking about transformation,ntransformation in rural areas.,Villages that agree nto implement this project,,they organize a legal society,where the general body nconsists of all members,who elect a group of men and womennwho implement the project,and, later on, who look afternthe operation and maintenance.,They decide to build a toilet nand a shower room.,And from a protected water source,,water will be brought to an elevated waternreservoir and piped to all households,through three taps:,one in the toilet, one in the shower, none in the kitchen, 24 hours a day.,The pity is that our cities,nlike New Delhi and Bombay,,do not have a 24-hour water supply.,But in these villages, we want to have it. 
 There is a distinct difference nin the quality.,Well in India, we have a theory,nwhich is very much accepted,by the government bureaucracynand all those who matter,,that poor people deserve poor solutions,and absolutely poor people deservenpathetic solutions.,This, combined with na Nobel Prize-worthy theory that,the cheapest is the most economic,,is the heady cocktail that the poornare forced to drink.,We are fighting against this.,We feel that the poor have beennhumiliated for centuries.,And even in sanitation,,they should not be humiliated.,Sanitation is more about dignity,than about human disposal of waste.,And so you build these toilets nand very often,,we have to hear that the toilets arenbetter than their houses.,And you can see that in front are nthe attached houses,and the others are the toilets. 
 So these people, without a singlenexception of a family in a village,,decide to build a toilet, a bathing room.,And for that, they come together,ncollect all the local materials --,local materials like rubble, nsand, aggregates,,usually a government subsidy is available,to meet at least part of the cost nof external materials,like cement, steel, toilet commode.,And they build a toilet nand a bathing room.,Also, all the unskilled laborers, that is ndaily wage earners, mostly landless,,are given an opportunity to be ntrained as masons and plumbers.,So while these people are being trained, nothers are collecting the materials.,And when both are ready,nthey build a toilet, a shower room,,and of course also a water tower, nan elevated water reservoir.,We use a system of two leach pits nto treat the waste.,From the toilet, the muck comesninto the first leach pit.,And when it is full, it is blocked nand it can go to the next.,But we discovered that if you plantnbanana trees, papaya trees,on the periphery of these leach pits,,they grow very wellnbecause they suck up all the nutrients,and you get very tasty bananas, papayas.,If any of you come to my place,,I would be happy to sharenthese bananas and papayas with you.,So there you can see nthe completed toilets, the water towers. 
 This is in a village where nmost of the people are even illiterate.,It is always a 24-hour water supply,because water gets pollutednvery often when you store it --,a child dips his or her hand into it,nsomething falls into it.,So no water is stored. It's always on tap.,This is how an elevated nwater reservoir is constructed.,And that is the end product.,Because it has to go high,nand there is some space available,,two or three rooms are madenunder the water tower,,which are used by the village for ndifferent committee meetings. 
 We have had clear evidencenof the great impact of this program.,Before we started, there were, as usual,,more than 80 percent of people sufferingnfrom waterborne diseases.,But after this, we have empirical evidencenthat 82 percent, on average,,among all these villages --n1,200 villages have completed it --,waterborne diseases nhave come down 82 percent.,(Applause),Women usually used to spend, nespecially in the summer months,,about six to seven hours na day carrying water.,And when they went to carry water,,because, as I said earlier,nit's only women who carry water,,they used to take their little children,ngirl children, also to carry water,,or else to be back at homento look after the siblings.,So there were less than nine percentnof girl children attending school,,even if there was a school.,And boys, about 30 percent.,But girls, it has gone to about 90 percentnand boys, almost to 100 percent.,(Applause),The most vulnerable section in a village,are the landless laborers who arenthe daily wage-earners.,Because they have gone nthrough this training,to be masons and plumbers and bar benders,,now their ability to earn has nincreased 300 to 400 percent. 
 So this is a democracy in action,because there is a general body, na governing board, the committee.,People are questioning, npeople are governing themselves,,people are learning to managentheir own affairs,,they are taking their own futuresninto their hands.,And that is democracy atnthe grassroots level in action.,More than 1,200 villages nhave so far done this.,It benefits over 400,000 peoplenand it's still going on.,And I hope it continues to move ahead. 
 For India and such developing countries,,armies and armaments,,software companies and spaceships,may not be as importantnas taps and toilets. 
 Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),Thank you.I experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.,Because of the coup d'état,,my family had to leave my native home of Ghana,and move to the Gambia.,As luck would have it,,six months after we arrived,,they too had a military coup.,I vividly remember being wokennup in the middle of the night,and gathering the few belongings we could,and walking for about two hours,to a safe house.,For a week, we slept under our beds,because we were worried that bulletsnmight fly through the window. 
 Then, at the age of eight,,we moved to Botswana.,This time, it was different.,There were no coups.,Everything worked. Great education.,They had such good infrastructurenthat even at the time they had,a fiber-optic telephone system,,long before it had reached Western countries. 
 The only thing they didn't have,is that they didn't have,their own national television station,,and so I remember watching,TV from neighboring South Africa,,and watching Nelson Mandela in jail,being offered a chance to come out,if he would give up the apartheid struggle.,But he didn't. He refused to do that,until he actually achieved his objective,of freeing South Africa from apartheid.,And I remember feeling how just one good leader,could make such a big difference in Africa. 
 Then at the age of 12,,my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.,Initially, this too was amazing:,growing economy, excellent infrastructure,,and it seemed like it was a model,for economic development in Africa.,I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe,and I went off to college. 
 Six years later, I returned to the country.,Everything was different.,It had shattered into pieces.,Millions of people had emigrated,,the economy was in a shambles,,and it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years,of development had been wiped out.,How could a country go so bad so fast?,Most people would agree,that it's all because of leadership.,One man, President Robert Mugabe,,is almost single-handedly responsible,for having destroyed this country. 
 Now, all these experiences of living in different,parts of Africa growing up,did two things to me.,The first is it made me fall in love with Africa.,Everywhere I went,,I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent,and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people,,and at the time, I realized that I wanted to dedicate,the rest of my life to making this continent great.,But I also realized that making Africa great,would require addressing this issue of leadership.,You see, all these countries I lived in,,the coups d'état,and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia,and in Zimbabwe,,contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen,in Botswana and in South nAfrica of good leadership.,It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall,because of the quality of our leaders. 
 Now, one might think, of course,,leadership matters everywhere.,But if there's one thing you takenaway from my talk today, it is this:,In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,,the difference that just one good leader can make,is much greater than anywhere nelse, and here's why.,It's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,,like the judiciary, the constitution,,civil society and so forth.,So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:,When societies have strong institutions,,the difference that one goodnleader can make is limited,,but when you have weak institutions,,then just one good leader,can make or break that country. 
 Let me make it a bit more concrete.,You become the president of the United States.,You think, "Wow, I've arrived.,I'm the most powerful man in the world.",So you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.,All of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder,and says, "No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that.",You say, "Let me try this way.",The Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh,,we don't think you can do that.",You say, perhaps, "Let me print some money.,I think the economy needs a stimulus.",The central bank governor will think you're crazy.,You might get impeached for that.,But if you become the president of Zimbabwe,,and you say, "You know, I really like this job.,I think I'd like to stay in it forever."n(Laughter),Well, you just can.,You decide you want to print money.,You call the central bank governor and you say,,"Please double the money supply.",He'll say, "Okay, yes, sir,,is there anything else I can do for you?",This is the power that African leaders have,,and this is why they make the most difference,on the continent. 
 The good news is that,the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving.,We've had three generations nof leaders, in my mind.,Generation one are those who appeared,in the '50s and '60s.,These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana,and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.,The legacy they left is that theynbrought independence to Africa.,They freed us from colonialism,,and let's give them credit for that.,They were followed by generation two.,These are people that brought nothing,but havoc to Africa.,Think warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.,This is the stereotype of nthe typical African leader,that we typically think of:,Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,,Sani Abacha from Nigeria.,The good news is that most ofnthese leaders have moved on,,and they were replaced by generation three.,These are people like the late Nelson Mandela,and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,,like Paul Kagame and so forth.,Now these leaders are by no means perfect,,but the one thing they have done is that they have,cleaned up much of the mess of generation two.,They've stopped the fighting,,and I call them the stabilizer generation.,They're much more accountable to their people,,they've improved macroeconomic policies,,and we are seeing for the first time,Africa's growing, and in nfact it's the second fastest,growing economic region in the world.,So these leaders are by no means perfect,,but they are by and large,the best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years. 
 So where to from here?,I believe that the next generation,to come after this, generation four,,has a unique opportunity,to transform the continent.,Specifically, they can do two things,that previous generations have not done.,The first thing they need to do,is they need to create prosperity for the continent.,Why is prosperity so important?,Because none of the previous generations,have been able to tackle this issue of poverty.,Africa today,has the fastest growing population in the world,,but also is the poorest.,By 2030, Africa will have anlarger workforce than China,,and by 2050, it will have thenlargest workforce in the world.,One billion people will need jobs in Africa,,so if we don't grow our economies fast enough,,we're sitting on a ticking time bomb,,not just for Africa but for the entire world. 
 Let me show you an example,of one person who is living up to this legacy,of creating prosperity: Laetitia.,Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya,who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school,because her family couldn't nafford to pay fees for her.,So she started her own business rearing rabbits,,which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya,that she's from.,This business did so well that within a year,,she was employing 15 women,and was able to generate enough income,that she was able to send herself to school,,and through these women,fund another 65 children to go to school.,The profits that she generated,,she used that to build a school,,and today she educates,400 children in her community.,And she's just turned 18.,(Applause) 
 Another example is Erick Rajaonary.,Erick comes from the island of Madagascar.,Now, Erick realized that agriculture,would be the key to creating jobs,in the rural areas of Madagascar,,but he also realized that fertilizer was a very,expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar.,Madagascar has these very special bats,that produce these droppings,that are very high in nutrients.,In 2006, Erick quit his job nas a chartered accountant,and started a company to manufacture,fertilizer from the bat droppings.,Today, Erick has built a business,that generates several million dollars of revenue,,and he employs 70 people full time,and another 800 people during the season,when the bats drop their droppings the most.,Now, what I like about this story,is that it shows that opportunities nto create prosperity,can be found almost anywhere.,Erick is known as the Batman.,(Laughter),And who would have thought that you would have,been able to build a multimillion-dollar business,employing so many people just from bat poo?,The second thing that this generation needs to do,is to create our institutions.,They need to build these institutions such that we,are never held to ransom again,by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe. 
 Now, all of this sounds great,,but where are we going tonget this generation four from?,Do we just sit and hope that they emerge,by chance, or that God gives them to us?,No, I don't think so.,It's too important an issue nfor us to leave it to chance.,I believe that we need to create African institutions,,home-grown, that will identify and develop,these leaders in a systematic, practical way.,We've been doing this for the last 10 years,through the African Leadership Academy.,Laetitia is one of our young leaders.,Today, we have 700 of them nthat are being groomed,for the African continent,,and over the next 50 years,,we expect to create 6,000 of them. 
 But one thing has been troubling me.,We would get about 4,000 applications a year,for 100 young leaders that we could take,into this academy,,and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed,for this leadership training that we're offering.,But we couldn't satisfy it.,So today, I'm announcing for the first time in public,an extension to this vision fornthe African Leadership Academy.,We're building 25 brand new universities in Africa,that are going to cultivate this next generation,of African leaders.,Each campus will have 10,000 leaders at a time,so we'll be educating and developing,250,000 leaders at any given time.,(Applause) 
 Over the next 50 years, this institution,will create three million transformative leaders,for the continent. 
 My hope is that half of them,will become the entrepreneurs that we need,,who will create these jobs that we need,,and the other half,will go into government,and the nonprofit sector,,and they will build the institutions that we need.,But they won't just learn academics.,They will also learn how to become leaders,,and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.,So think of this as Africa's Ivy League,,but instead of getting admittednbecause of your SAT scores,or because of how much money you have,or which family you come from,,the main criteria for getting into this university,will be what is the potential that you have,for transforming Africa? 
 But what we're doing is njust one group of institutions.,We cannot transform Africa by ourselves.,My hope,is that many, many other home-grown,African institutions will blossom,,and these institutions will all come together,with a common vision of developing,this next generation of African leaders,,generation four,,and they will teach them this common message:,create jobs, build our institutions. 
 Nelson Mandela once said,,"Every now and then,,a generation is called upon to be great.,You can be that great generation.",I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate,the next generation of African leaders,,then this generation four that is coming up,will be the greatest generation that Africa,and indeed the entire world has ever seen. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You know, it's a big privilege for me,to be working in one of thenbiodiversity hotspots in the world:,the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.,These islands — Mauritius,nRodrigues, and Réunion —,along with the island of Madagascar,,they are blessed with unique plants,found nowhere else in the world.,And today I will tell you nabout five of them,and their particular features,and why these plants are so unique. 
 Take a look at this plant.,I call it benjoin in the local vernacular,,and the botanical name nis Terminalia bentzoe,,subspecies bentzoe.,This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,,and its particular feature,is its heterophylly.,What do I mean by heterophylly?,It's that the same plant,has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.,Now, these plants have evolved,very far away from the mainland,,and within specific ecosystems.,Often, these particular features,have evolved as a response to the threat,presented by the local fauna,,in this case, grazing tortoises.,Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight,,and as such, they tend to avoid the plants,they don't recognize.,So this evolutionary nfoil safeguards the plant,against these rather cute animals,,and protects it and of course nensures its survival. 
 Now the question you're nprobably asking yourself is,,why is she telling us all these stories?,The reason for that is that we tend to overlook,the diversity and the variety of the natural world.,These particular habitats are unique,and they are host to a whole lot of plants.,We don't realize how valuable,and how precious these resources are,,and yet, through our insouciance,,we keep on destroying them.,We're all familiar,with the macro impact of urbanization,,climate change, resource exploitation,,but when that one last plant —,or animal for that matter —,when that very last specimen,has disappeared from the face of this Earth,,we would have lost,an entire subset of the Earth's biology,,and with it, important plants nwith medicinal potential,or which could have ingredients,that would speak to the cosmetic,,nutrition, pharma,,and even the ethno-veterinary sectors,,be gone forever.,And here we have a very prime example,of the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,,and, of course, we know is nnow a symbol of extinction. 
 We know plants have a nfundamental role to play.,Well, first of all, they feed us,and they also give us nthe oxygen we breathe,,but plants are also the source,of important, biologically active ingredients,that we should be studying very carefully,,because human societies over the millennia,,they have developed important knowledge,,cultural traditions,,and important plant-based medicinal resources.,Here's a data point:,1.4 percent of the entire land surface,is home to 40 percent ofnthe species of higher plants,,35 percent of the species of vertebrates,,and this 1.4 percent,represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,,and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface,already provides for 35 percent,of the ecosystem services,that vulnerable people depend on.,And as you can see,,the island of Mauritius,where I work and where I live,,belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,,and I study the unique plants,on the island for their nbiomedical applications. 
 Now, let's go back again,to that first plant I showed you,,the one, of course, with ndifferent-shaped leaves,and different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,,subspecies bentzoe,,a plant only found in Mauritius.,Now, the local people,,they used a decoction of the leaves,against infectious diseases.,Now our work, that is,,the scientific validation of nthis traditional information,,has shown that precisely,that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,,against a wide range of bacteria,that could be pathogenic to humans.,Now, could this plant be the answer,to antibiotic resistance?,You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be,a big challenge globally.,While we may not be sure, one thing is certain:,we will not want this plant to disappear.,But the harsh reality is that,this particular plant is in fact,considered to be vulnerable,in its natural habitat. 
 This brings me to another example.,This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate,in the local vernacular.,The botanical name is Psiadia arguta.,It's a plant which is rare,,which is endemic to Mauritius.,It used to grow on the mainland,,but through the sheer npressures of urbanization,has been pushed out of the mainland,,and we've managed to bring it back,from the brink of extinction,by developing in vitro plants,which are now growing in the wild.,Now, one thing I must npoint out straightaway,is that not all plants,can be developed in vitro.,While we humans, we are nhappy in our comfort zone,,these plants also need,their ecosystem to be preserved,,and they don't react — endemic plants,don't react to very harsh nchanges in their ecosystem,,and yet we know what are the challenges,that climate change, for example,,is posing to these plants.,Now, the local people again use the leaves,in traditional medicine,against respiratory problems.,Now, our preliminary labwork,on the leaf extract has shown,that precisely these nleaves contain ingredients,that are very close, nin terms of structures,,chemical structures, to those medicines,which are sold in the chemist's shop,against asthma.,So who knows,what humanity will benefit from,should this plant decide nto reveal all its secrets. 
 Now, I come from the developing world,where we are forever being nchallenged with this issue,of population explosion.,Africa is the continent nwhich is getting younger,,and whenever one talks nabout population explosion,,one talks about the issue of food security,as being the other side of the same coin.,Now this plant here, the baobab,,could be part of the answer.,It's an underutilized, neglected food plant.,It defines the landscape of West Africa,,where it is known as the tree of life,,and later on I will tell you why,the Africans consider it to be the tree of life.,Now interestingly, there are many legends,which are associated with this plant.,Because of its sheer size,,it was meant to be lording over lesser plants,,so God didn't like this arrogance,,uprooted it, and planted it upside down,,hence its particular shape.,And if you look at this tree again,within the African context,,in West Africa, it's known nas the palaver tree,,because it performs great social functions.,Now if you have a problem in the community,,meeting under the palaver tree,with the chiefs or the tribesmen,would be synonymous to trying to find a solution,to that particular problem,,and also to reinforce trust and respect,among members of the community.,From the scientific point of view,,there are eight species of baobab in the world.,There's one from Africa,,one from Australia,,and six are endemic,to the island of Madagascar.,The one I have showed you,is the one from Africa,,Adansonia digitata.,Now, the flower, this nbeautiful white flower,,it opens at night, is pollinated by bats,,and it gives rise to the fruit,which is curiously known,as the monkey apple.,The monkeys are not stupid animals.,They know what's good for them.,Now, if you open the fruit of the baobab,,you'll see a white, floury pulp,,which is very rich in nutrients,and has got protein,,more protein than in human milk.,Yes, you heard right:,more protein than in human milk.,And this is one of the reasons why,the nutrition companies of this world,,they are looking for this fruit to provide,what we know as reinforced food.,The seeds give an oil, a very stable oil,which is sought after nby the cosmetic industry,to give to produce body lotions, for example.,And if you look at the trunk,,the trunk, of course, safeguards water,,which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,,and the leaves are used in traditional medicine,against infectious disease.,Now, you can see now why the Africans consider it,to be the tree of life.,It's a complete plant,,and in fact, the sheer size of these trees,is hiding a massive potential,,not only for the pharma, nutrition,nand the cosmetic industry.,What I have showed you here,is only the species from Africa,,Adansonia digitata.,We have six species yet in Madagascar,,and we don't know what nis the potential of this plant,,but one thing we know is that the flora,is considered to be nthreatened with extinction. 
 Let me take you to Africa again,,and introduce you to one of my very favorite,,the resurrection plant.,Now here you'll find,that even Jesus has competition.,(Laughter),Now, this plant here has developed,remarkable tolerance to drought,,which enables it to withstand,up to 98 percent dehydration nover the period of a year,without damage,,and yet it can regenerate nitself almost completely,overnight, over 24 hours, and flower.,Now, us human beings,,we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth.,We don't want to get old, and rightly so.,Why should we, especially if you can afford it?,And this gives you an indication,of what the plant looks like before.,Now, if you are an inexperienced gardener,,the first thing you'll do nwhen you visit the garden,is to uproot this plant because it's dead.,But if you water it, this is what you get.,Absolutely amazing.,Now, if you look at our aging process,,the aging process is in fact the loss of water,from the upper epidermis, resulting in wrinkling,as we know it, especially women,,we are so conscious of this.,And this plant, in fact, is giving nthe cosmetic chemists,very important ingredients,that are actually finding ways,to slow down the aging process,and at the same time reinforce the cells,against the onslaught of environmental toxins. 
 Now, these four examples,I have just given you,are just a very tiny reminder,as to how our health,and our survival are closely linked,to the health and the resilience,of our ecosystem,,and why we should be very careful,about preserving biodiversity.,Every time a forest is cut down,,every time a marsh is filled in,,it is a potential lab that goes with it,,and which we will never, ever recover.,And I know what I'm talking about,,coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo. 
 Let me finish with just one last example.,Conservation issues are normally guided,towards rare, endemic plants,,but what we call exotic plants,,that is, the ones which grow in manyndifferent habitats across the world,,they also need to be considered.,You know why? Because the environment plays,a very important role,in modifying the composition of that plant. 
 So let's take a look at this plant here,,Centella asiatica. It's a weed.,We call it a weed.,Now, Centella asiatica ngrows across the world,in many different habitats — nin Africa, in Asia —,and this plant has been instrumental,in providing a solution nto that dreadful disease,called leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s.,Now, while Centella ngrows across the world —,in Africa, in Asia — nthe best quality Centella,comes from Madagascar,,because that Centella containsnthe three vital ingredients,which are sought after by the pharma,and the cosmetic companies.,And the cosmetic companies nare already using it,to make regenerating cream. 
 Now, there is an ancient saying,that for every disease known to mankind,,there is a plant to cure it.,Now, you may not nbelieve in ancient sayings.,You may think they're obsolete,now that our science and ntechnology are so powerful.,So you may look on Centella as being,an insignificant, humble weed,,which, if destroyed, won't be missed.,But you know, there is no such thing as a weed.,It's a plant.,It's a living biological lab,that may well have answers,to the question that we may have,,but we have to ensure,that it has the right to live. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)About 12 years ago,,I gave up my career in banking,to try to make the world a safer place.,This involved a journey intonnational and global advocacy,and meeting some of the mostnextraordinary people in the world.,In the process, I becamena civil society diplomat. 
 Civil society diplomats do three things:,They voice the concerns of the people,,are not pinned down by national interests,,and influence changenthrough citizen networks,,not only state ones.,And if you want to change the world,nwe need more of them. 
 But many people still ask,,"Can civil society reallynmake a big difference?,Can citizens influence and shapennational and global policy?",I never thought I would asknmyself these questions,,but here I am to share some lessons,about two powerful civil society nmovements that I've been involved in.,They are in issuesnthat I'm passionate about:,gun control and drug policy.,And these are issues that matter here.,Latin America is ground zeronfor both of them. 
 For example, Brazil --,this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobalnhas the world's ugliest record.,We are the number one championnin homicidal violence.,One in every 10 people killednaround the world is a Brazilian.,This translates into over 56,000 people,dying violently each year.,Most of them are young, black boysndying by guns.,Brazil is also one of the world'snlargest consumers of drugs,,and the War on Drugsnhas been especially painful here.,Around 50 percent of the homicidesnin the streets in Brazil,are related to the War on Drugs.,The same is true for aboutn25 percent of people in jail.,And it's not just Brazil that is affectednby the twin problems of guns and drugs.,Virtually every country and city acrossnCentral and South America is in trouble.,Latin America has nine percentnof the world's population,,but 25 percentnof its global violent deaths. 
 These are not problemsnwe can run away from.,I certainly could not.,So the first campaign I got involved withnstarted here in 2003,to change Brazil's gun law,and to create a programnto buy back weapons.,In just a few years,,we not only changed national legislation,that made it much more difficultnfor civilians to buy a gun,,but we collected and destroyednalmost half a million weapons.,This was one of the biggestnbuyback programs in history --,(Applause) --,but we also suffered some setbacks.,We lost a referendum to banngun sales to civilians in 2005. 
 The second initiative was also home-grown,,but is today a global movement to reformnthe international drug control regime.,I am the executive coordinator,of something callednthe Global Commission on Drug Policy.,The commission is a high-level group,of global leaders brought togethernto identify more humane,and effective approachesnto the issue of drugs.,Since we started in 2008,nthe taboo on drugs is broken.,Across the Americas, from the USnand Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,,change is in the air. 
 But rather than tell you the whole storynabout these two movements,,I just want to share with younfour key insights.,I call them lessons to change the world.,There are certainly many more,,but these are the onesnthat stand out to me. 
 So the first lesson is:,Change and control the narrative.,It may seem obvious,,but a key ingredientnto civil society diplomacy,is first changing and thenncontrolling the narrative.,This is something that veterannpoliticians understand,,but that civil society groupsngenerally do not do very well.,In the case of drug policy,,our biggest success has beennto change the discussion,away from prosecuting a War on Drugs,to putting people's healthnand safety first.,In a cutting-edge reportnwe just launched in New York,,we also showed that the groups benefitingnmost from this $320 billion market,are criminal gangs and cartels.,So in order to underminenthe power and profit of these groups,,we need to change the conversation.,We need to make illegal drugs legal.,But before I get you too excited,,I don't mean drugsnshould be a free-for-all.,What I'm talking about, and whatnthe Global Commission advocates for,is creating a highly regulated market,,where different drugs would havendifferent degrees of regulation. 
 As for gun control,nwe were successful in changing,,but not so muchnin controlling, the narrative.,And this brings me to my next lesson:,Never underestimate your opponents.,If you want to succeednin changing the world,,you need to know who you're up against.,You need to learn their motivationsnand points of view.,In the case of gun control,,we really underestimated our opponents.,After a very successfulngun-collection program,,we were elated.,We had support fromn80 percent of Brazilians,,and thought that this could help usnwin the referendum,to ban gun sales to civilians.,But we were dead wrong.,During a televised 20-day public debate,,our opponent usednour own arguments against us.,We ended up losing the popular vote.,It was really terrible.,The National Rifle Association --nyes, the American NRA --,came to Brazil.,They inundated our campaignnwith their propaganda,,that as you know,,links the right to own gunsnto ideas of freedom and democracy.,They simply threw everything at us.,They used our national flag,,our independence anthem.,They invoked women's rights,and misused images of Mandela,nTiananmen Square, and even Hitler.,They won by playing with people's fears.,In fact, guns were almost completelynignored in their campaign.,Their focus was on individual rights.,But I ask you,,which right is more important,,the right to life,or the right to have a gunnthat takes life away?,(Applause) 
 We thought people would votenin defense of life,,but in a country with a recent pastnof military dictatorship,,the anti-government messagenof our opponents resonated,,and we were not prepared to respond. 
 Lesson learned.,We've been more successfulnin the case of drug policy.,If you asked most people 10 years ago ifnan end to the War on Drugs was possible,,they would have laughed.,After all, there are hugenmilitary police prisons,and financial establishmentsnbenefiting from this war.,But today, the international drugncontrol regime is starting to crumble.,Governments and civil societiesnare experimenting with new approaches.,The Global Commission on Drug Policy,really knew its opposition,,and rather than fighting them,,our chair -- former Brazilian PresidentnFernando Henrique Cardoso --,reached out to leadersnfrom across the political spectrum,,from liberals to conservatives.,This high level groupnagreed to honestly discuss,the merits and flaws of drug policies.,It was this reasoned, informednand strategic discussion,that revealed the sad truthnabout the War on Drugs.,The War on Drugs has simply failednacross every metric.,Drugs are cheapernand more available than ever,,and consumption has risen globally.,But even worse,,it also generated massivennegative unintended consequences.,It is true that some peoplenhave made these arguments before,,but we've made a difference,by anticipating the argumentsnof our opponents,and by leveraging powerful voices,that a few years agonwould probably have resisted change. 
 Third lesson: Use datanto drive your argument.,Guns and drugs are emotive issues,,and as we've painfully learnednin the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,,sometimes it's impossiblento cut through the emotions,and get to the facts.,But this doesn't meannthat we shouldn't try.,Until quite recently,,we simply didn't knownhow many Brazilians were killed by guns.,Amazingly, it was a local soap operancalled "Mulheres Apaixonadas" --,or "Women in Love" --,that kicked off Brazil'snnational gun control campaign.,In one highly viewed episode,,a soap opera lead actressnwas killed by a stray bullet.,Brazilian granniesnand housewives were outraged,,and in a case of art imitating life,,this episode also included footagenof a real gun control march,that we had organized right here,,outside in Copacabana Beach.,The televised death and marchnhad a huge impact on public opinion.,Within weeks, our national congressnapproved the disarmament bill,that had been languishing for years.,We were then able to mobilize data,to show the successful outcomesnof the change in the law,and gun collection program.,Here is what I mean:,We could prove that in just one year,,we saved more than 5,000 lives. 
 (Applause) 
 And in the case of drugs,,in order to undermine this fearnand prejudice that surrounds the issue,,we managed to gather and present datanthat shows that today's drug policies,cause much more harm than drug use per se,,and people are starting to get it. 
 My fourth insight is:,Don't be afraid to bringntogether odd bedfellows.,What we've learned in Brazil --,and this doesn't onlynapply to my country --,is the importance of bringing diversenand eclectic folks together.,If you want to change the world,,it helps to have a good cross-sectionnof society on your side.,In both the case of guns and drugs,,we brought togetherna wonderful mix of people.,We mobilized the elitenand got huge support from the media.,We gathered the victims,nhuman rights champions, cultural icons.,We also assemblednthe professional classes --,doctors, lawyers, academia and more. 
 What I've learned over the last years,is that you need coalitions of the willingnand of the unwilling to make change.,In the case of drugs,,we needed libertarians,nanti-prohibitionists, legalizers,,and liberal politicians.,They may not agree on everything;,in fact, they disagreenon almost everything.,But the legitimacy of the campaignnis based on their diverse points of view. 
 Over a decade ago,,I had a comfortable futurenworking for an investment bank.,I was as far removed from the worldnof civil society diplomacy,as you can imagine.,But I took a chance.,I changed course,,and on the way, I helped nto create social movements,that I believe have made nsome parts of the world safer.,Each and every one of usnhas the power to change the world.,No matter what the issue,nand no matter how hard the fight,,civil society is centralnto the blueprint for change. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Six thousand miles of road,,600 miles of subway track,,400 miles of bike lanes,and a half a mile of tram track,,if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island. 
 These are the numbers that make upnthe infrastructure of New York City.,These are the statisticsnof our infrastructure.,They're the kind of numbers you can findnreleased in reports by city agencies.,For example, the Departmentnof Transportation will probably tell you,how many miles of road they maintain.,The MTA will boast how many milesnof subway track there are.,Most city agencies give us statistics.,This is from a report this year,from the Taxi and Limousine Commission,,where we learn that there's aboutn13,500 taxis here in New York City.,Pretty interesting, right?,But did you ever think aboutnwhere these numbers came from?,Because for these numbers to exist,nsomeone at the city agency,had to stop and say, hmm, here's a numbernthat somebody might want want to know.,Here's a number nthat our citizens want to know.,So they go back to their raw data,,they count, they add, they calculate,,and then they put out reports,,and those reportsnwill have numbers like this. 
 The problem is, how do they knownall of our questions?,We have lots of questions.,In fact, in some ways there's literallynan infinite number of questions,that we can ask about our city.,The agencies can never keep up.,So the paradigm isn't exactly working,nand I think our policymakers realize that,,because in 2012, Mayor Bloombergnsigned into law what he called,the most ambitious and comprehensivenopen data legislation in the country.,In a lot of ways, he's right.,In the last two years, nthe city has released 1,000 datasets,on our open data portal,,and it's pretty awesome.,So you go and look at data like this,,and instead of just countingnthe number of cabs,,we can start to ask different questions. 
 So I had a question.,When's rush hour in New York City?,It can be pretty bothersome.nWhen is rush hour exactly?,And I thought to myself,nthese cabs aren't just numbers,,these are GPS recordersndriving around in our city streets,recording each and every ride they take.,There's data there,nand I looked at that data,,and I made a plot of the average speed ofntaxis in New York City throughout the day.,You can see that from about midnightnto around 5:18 in the morning,,speed increases, and at that point,nthings turn around,,and they get slower and slower and slowernuntil about 8:35 in the morning,,when they end up at aroundn11 and a half miles per hour.,The average taxi is going 11 and a halfnmiles per hour on our city streets,,and it turns out it stays that way,for the entire day.,(Laughter),So I said to myself, I guessnthere's no rush hour in New York City.,There's just a rush day.,Makes sense. And this is importantnfor a couple of reasons.,If you're a transportation planner,nthis might be pretty interesting to know.,But if you want to get somewhere quickly,,you now know to set your alarm forn4:45 in the morning and you're all set.,New York, right? 
 But there's a story behind this data.,This data wasn'tnjust available, it turns out.,It actually came from something calledna Freedom of Information Law Request,,or a FOIL Request.,This is a form you can find on thenTaxi and Limousine Commission website.,In order to access this data,nyou need to go get this form,,fill it out, and they will notify you,,and a guy named Chris Whongndid exactly that.,Chris went down, and they told him,,"Just bring a brand new hard drive ndown to our office,,leave it here for five hours,nwe'll copy the data and you take it back.",And that's where this data came from.,Now, Chris is the kind of guynwho wants to make the data public,,and so it ended up online for all to use,nand that's where this graph came from.,And the fact that it exists is amazing.nThese GPS recorders -- really cool.,But the fact that we have citizensnwalking around with hard drives,picking up data from city agenciesnto make it public --,it was already kind of public,nyou could get to it,,but it was "public," it wasn't public.,And we can do better than that as a city.,We don't need our citizensnwalking around with hard drives. 
 Now, not every datasetnis behind a FOIL Request.,Here is a map I made with the mostndangerous intersections in New York City,based on cyclist accidents.,So the red areas are more dangerous.,And what it shows is firstnthe East side of Manhattan,,especially in the lower area of Manhattan,nhas more cyclist accidents.,That might make sense,because there are more cyclistsncoming off the bridges there.,But there's other hotspots worth studying.,There's Williamsburg.nThere's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.,And this is exactly the kind of datanwe need for Vision Zero.,This is exactly what we're looking for. 
 But there's a storynbehind this data as well.,This data didn't just appear.,How many of you guys know this logo?,Yeah, I see some shakes.,Have you ever tried to copynand paste data out of a PDF,and make sense of it?,I see more shakes.,More of you tried copying and pastingnthan knew the logo. I like that. 
 So what happened is, the datanthat you just saw was actually on a PDF.,In fact, hundreds and hundredsnand hundreds of pages of PDF,put out by our very own NYPD,,and in order to access it,nyou would either have to copy and paste,for hundreds and hundreds of hours,,or you could be John Krauss.,John Krauss was like,,I'm not going to copy and paste this data.nI'm going to write a program.,It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,,and it goes to the NYPD's websitenand it would download PDFs.,Every day it would search;nif it found a PDF, it would download it,and then it would runnsome PDF-scraping program,,and out would come the text,,and it would go on the Internet,nand then people could make maps like that.,And the fact that the data's here,nthe fact that we have access to it --,Every accident, by the way,nis a row in this table.,You can imagine how many PDFs that is.,The fact that wenhave access to that is great,,but let's not release it in PDF form,,because then we're having our citizensnwrite PDF scrapers.,It's not the best usenof our citizens' time,,and we as a city can do better than that. 
 Now, the good news is thatnthe de Blasio administration,actually recently released this datana few months ago,,and so now we cannactually have access to it,,but there's a lot of datanstill entombed in PDF.,For example, our crime datanis still only available in PDF.,And not just our crime data,nour own city budget.,Our city budget is only readablenright now in PDF form.,And it's not just usnthat can't analyze it --,our own legislatorsnwho vote for the budget,also only get it in PDF.,So our legislators cannot analyze nthe budget that they are voting for.,And I think as a city we can dona little better than that as well. 
 Now, there's a lot of datanthat's not hidden in PDFs.,This is an example of a map I made,,and this is the dirtiest waterwaysnin New York City.,Now, how do I measure dirty?,Well, it's kind of a little weird,,but I looked at the levelnof fecal coliform,,which is a measurement of fecal matternin each of our waterways.,The larger the circle,nthe dirtier the water,,so the large circles are dirty water,nthe small circles are cleaner.,What you see is inland waterways.,This is all data that was samplednby the city over the last five years.,And inland waterways are,nin general, dirtier.,That makes sense, right?,And the bigger circles are dirty.nAnd I learned a few things from this.,Number one: Never swim in anythingnthat ends in "creek" or "canal.",But number two: I also foundnthe dirtiest waterway in New York City,,by this measure, one measure.,In Coney Island Creek, which is notnthe Coney Island you swim in, luckily.,It's on the other side.,But Coney Island Creek, 94 percentnof samples taken over the last five years,have had fecal levels so high,that it would be against state lawnto swim in the water. 
 And this is not the kind of factnthat you're going to see,boasted in a city report, right?,It's not going to be nthe front page on nyc.gov.,You're not going to see it there,,but the fact that we can get nto that data is awesome.,But once again, it wasn't super easy,,because this data was notnon the open data portal.,If you were to go to the open data portal,,you'd see just a snippet of it, na year or a few months.,It was actually on the Departmentnof Environmental Protection's website.,And each one of these links is an Excel nsheet, and each Excel sheet is different.,Every heading is different:nyou copy, paste, reorganize.,When you do you can make mapsnand that's great, but once again,,we can do better than that nas a city, we can normalize things. 
 And we're getting there, becausenthere's this website that Socrata makes,called the Open Data Portal NYC.,This is where 1,100 data sets nthat don't suffer,from the things I just told you live,,and that number is growing,nand that's great.,You can download data in any format,nbe it CSV or PDF or Excel document.,Whatever you want,nyou can download the data that way.,The problem is, once you do,,you will find that each agencyncodes their addresses differently.,So one is street name, nintersection street,,street, borough, address, building,nbuilding address.,So once again, you're spending time,neven when we have this portal,,you're spending timennormalizing our address fields.,And that's not the best use nof our citizens' time.,We can do better than that as a city.,We can standardize our addresses,,and if we do, nwe can get more maps like this. 
 This is a map of fire hydrantsnin New York City,,but not just any fire hydrants.,These are the top 250 grossing firenhydrants in terms of parking tickets.,(Laughter),So I learned a few things from this map,nand I really like this map.,Number one, just don't parknon the Upper East Side.,Just don't. It doesn't matter wherenyou park, you will get a hydrant ticket.,Number two, I found the two highestngrossing hydrants in all of New York City,,and they're on the Lower East Side,,and they were bringing in overn55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets.,And that seemed a little strangento me when I noticed it,,so I did a little digging and it turns outnwhat you had is a hydrant,and then something calledna curb extension,,which is like a seven-footnspace to walk on,,and then a parking spot.,And so these cars came along,nand the hydrant --,"It's all the way over there, I'm fine,",and there was actually a parking spotnpainted there beautifully for them.,They would park there, and the NYPDndisagreed with this designation,and would ticket them.,And it wasn't just me nwho found a parking ticket.,This is the Google nStreet View car driving by,finding the same parking ticket. 
 So I wrote about this on my blog,non I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,,and they said,,"While the DOT has not receivednany complaints about this location,,we will review the roadway markingsnand make any appropriate alterations.",And I thought to myself,ntypical government response,,all right, moved on with my life. 
 But then, a few weeks later,nsomething incredible happened.,They repainted the spot,,and for a second I thought I sawnthe future of open data,,because think about what happened here.,For five years, this spot was being nticketed, and it was confusing,,and then a citizen found something,nthey told the city, and within a few weeks,the problem was fixed.,It's amazing. And a lot of peoplensee open data as being a watchdog.,It's not, it's about being a partner.,We can empower our citizensnto be better partners for government,,and it's not that hard.,All we need are a few changes.,If you're FOILing data,,if you're seeing your data nbeing FOILed over and over again,,let's release it to the public, that'sna sign that it should be made public.,And if you're a government agencynreleasing a PDF,,let's pass legislation that requires younto post it with the underlying data,,because that datanis coming from somewhere.,I don't know where, but it'sncoming from somewhere,,and you can release it with the PDF.,And let's adopt and sharensome open data standards.,Let's start with our addressesnhere in New York City.,Let's just startnnormalizing our addresses.,Because New York is a leader in open data.,Despite all this, we are absolutelyna leader in open data,,and if we start normalizing things,nand set an open data standard,,others will follow. The state will follow,nand maybe the federal government,,Other countries could follow,,and we're not that far off from a timenwhere you could write one program,and map information from 100 countries.,It's not science fiction.nWe're actually quite close. 
 And by the way, who are wenempowering with this?,Because it's not just John Kraussnand it's not just Chris Whong.,There are hundreds of meetupsngoing on in New York City right now,,active meetups.,There are thousands of peoplenattending these meetups.,These people are going after worknand on weekends,,and they're attending these meetupsnto look at open data,and make our city a better place.,Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week nreleased something called citygram.nyc,that allows you to subscribento 311 complaints,around your own home,nor around your office.,You put in your address,nyou get local complaints.,And it's not just the tech communitynthat are after these things.,It's urban planners like nthe students I teach at Pratt.,It's policy advocates, it's everyone,,it's citizens from a diversenset of backgrounds.,And with some small, incremental changes,,we can unlock the passionnand the ability of our citizens,to harness open datanand make our city even better,,whether it's one dataset,nor one parking spot at a time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Vision is the most important,and prioritized sense that we have.,We are constantly looking,at the world around us,,and quickly we identify and make sense,of what it is that we see. 
 Let's just start with an example,of that very fact.,I'm going to show youna photograph of a person,,just for a second or two,,and I'd like for you to identify,what emotion is on his face.,Ready?,Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.,Okay. What did you see?,Well, we actually surveyed,over 120 individuals,,and the results were mixed.,People did not agree,on what emotion they saw on his face.,Maybe you saw discomfort.,That was the most frequent response,that we received.,But if you asked the person on your left,,they might have said regret or skepticism,,and if you asked somebody on your right,,they might have saidnsomething entirely different,,like hope or empathy.,So we are all looking,at the very same face again.,We might see something,entirely different,,because perception is subjective.,What we think we see,is actually filtered,through our own mind's eye. 
 Of course, there are many other examples,of how we see the worldnthrough own mind's eye.,I'm going to give you just a few.,So dieters, for instance,,see apples as larger,than people who are not counting calories.,Softball players see the ball as smaller,if they've just come out of a slump,,compared to people who nhad a hot night at the plate.,And actually, our political beliefs also,can affect the way we see other people,,including politicians.,So my research team and Indecided to test this question.,In 2008, Barack Obamanwas running for president,for the very first time,,and we surveyed hundreds of Americans,one month before the election.,What we found in this survey,was that some people, some Americans,,think photographs like these,best reflect how Obama really looks.,Of these people, 75 percent,voted for Obama in the actual election.,Other people, though,nthought photographs like these,best reflect how Obama really looks.,89 percent of these people,voted for McCain.,We presented many photographs of Obama,one at a time,,so people did not realizenthat what we were changing,from one photograph to the next,was whether we had artificially lightened,or darkened his skin tone. 
 So how is that possible?,How could it be thatnwhen I look at a person,,an object, or an event,,I see something very different,than somebody else does?,Well, the reasons are many,,but one reason requires that we understand,a little bit more about how our eyes work.,So vision scientists know,that the amount of information,that we can see,at any given point in time,,what we can focus on,nis actually relatively small.,What we can see with great sharpness,and clarity and accuracy,is the equivalent,of the surface area of our thumb,on our outstretched arm.,Everything else around that is blurry,,rendering much of what is presented,to our eyes as ambiguous.,But we have to clarify,and make sense of what it is that we see,,and it's our mind thatnhelps us fill in that gap.,As a result, perceptionnis a subjective experience,,and that's how we end up seeing,through our own mind's eye. 
 So, I'm a social psychologist,,and it's questions like these,that really intrigue me.,I am fascinated by those times,when people do not see eye to eye.,Why is it that somebody might,literally see the glass as half full,,and somebody literally sees it,as half empty?,What is it about what one personnis thinking and feeling,that leads them to see the world,in an entirely different way?,And does that even matter?,So to begin to tackle these questions,,my research team and Indecided to delve deeply,into an issue that has received,international attention:,our health and fitness.,Across the world,,people are strugglingnto manage their weight,,and there is a variety of strategies,that we have to help usnkeep the pounds off.,For instance, we setnthe best of intentions,to exercise after the holidays,,but actually, the majority of Americans,find that their New Year's resolutions,are broken by Valentine's Day.,We talk to ourselves,in very encouraging ways,,telling ourselves this is our year,to get back into shape,,but that is not enough to bring us back,to our ideal weight.,So why?,Of course, there is no simple answer,,but one reason, I argue,,is that our mind's eye,might work against us.,Some people may literally see exercise,as more difficult,,and some people might literally,see exercise as easier. 
 So, as a first stepnto testing these questions,,we gathered objective measurements,of individuals' physical fitness.,We measured the ncircumference of their waist,,compared to the ncircumference of their hips.,A higher waist-to-hip ratio,is an indicator of beingnless physically fit,than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.,After gathering these measurements,,we told our participants that,they would walk to a finish line,while carrying extra weight,in a sort of race.,But before they did that,,we asked them to estimate the distance,to the finish line.,We thought that the physicalnstates of their body,might change hownthey perceived the distance.,So what did we find?,Well, waist-to-hip ratio,predicted perceptions of distance.,People who were out of shape and unfit,actually saw the distancento the finish line,as significantly greater,than people who were in better shape.,People's states of their own body,changed how theynperceived the environment.,But so too can our mind.,In fact, our bodies and our minds,work in tandem,to change how we see the world around us. 
 That led us to think that maybe people,with strong motivations,and strong goals to exercise,might actually seenthe finish line as closer,than people who have weaker motivations.,So to test whether motivations,affect our perceptualnexperiences in this way,,we conducted a second study.,Again, we gathered objective measurements,of people's physical fitness,,measuring the circumference of their waist,and the circumference of their hips,,and we had them do a nfew other tests of fitness.,Based on feedback that we gave them,,some of our participants told us,they're not motivatednto exercise any more.,They felt like they alreadynmet their fitness goals,and they weren't goingnto do anything else.,These people were not motivated.,Other people, though, nbased on our feedback,,told us they were highly nmotivated to exercise.,They had a strong goalnto make it to the finish line.,But again, before we had themnwalk to the finish line,,we had them estimate the distance.,How far away was the finish line?,And again, like the previous study,,we found that waist-to-hip ratio,predicted perceptions of distance.,Unfit individuals sawnthe distance as farther,,saw the finish line as farther away,,than people who were in better shape.,Importantly, though, this only happened,for people who were not motivated,to exercise.,On the other hand,,people who were highlynmotivated to exercise,saw the distance as short.,Even the most out of shape individuals,saw the finish line,as just as close,,if not slightly closer,,than people who were in better shape. 
 So our bodies can change,how far away that finish line looks,,but people who had committednto a manageable goal,that they could accomplishnin the near future,and who believed that they were capable,of meeting that goal,actually saw the exercise as easier.,That led us to wonder,,is there a strategy that we could use,and teach people that would help,change their perceptions of the distance,,help them make exercise look easier? 
 So we turned tonthe vision science literature,to figure out what should we do,,and based on what we read,nwe came up with a strategy,that we called, "Keep nyour eyes on the prize.",So this is not the slogan,from an inspirational poster.,It's an actual directive,for how to look around your environment.,People that we trained in this strategy,,we told them to focusntheir attention on the finish line,,to avoid looking around,,to imagine a spotlight,was shining on that goal,,and that everything around it was blurry,and perhaps difficult to see.,We thought that this strategy,would help make the exercise look easier.,We compared this group,to a baseline group.,To this group we said,,just look around the environment,as you naturally would.,You will notice the finish line,,but you might also notice,the garbage can off to the right,,or the people and the nlamp post off to the left.,We thought that peoplenwho used this strategy,would see the distance as farther. 
 So what did we find?,When we had them estimate the distance,,was this strategy successful,for changing their perceptual experience?,Yes.,People who kept their eyes on the prize,saw the finish line as 30 percent closer,than people who looked around,as they naturally would.,We thought this was great.,We were really excited because it meant,that this strategy helped make,the exercise look easier,,but the big question was,,could this help make exercise,actually better?,Could it improve the quality,of exercise as well? 
 So next, we told our participants,,you are going to walk to the finish line,while wearing extra weight.,We added weights to their ankles,that amounted to 15 percentnof their body weight.,We told them to lift their knees up high,and walk to the finish line quickly.,We designed this exercise in particular,to be moderately challenging,but not impossible,,like most exercises,that actually improve our fitness. 
 So the big question, then:,Did keeping your eyes on the prize,and narrowly focusing on the finish line,change their experience of the exercise?,It did.,People who kept their eyes on the prize,told us afterward that it required,17 percent less exertion,for them to do this exercise,than people who looked around naturally.,It changed their subjective experience,of the exercise.,It also changed the objective nature,of their exercise.,People who kept their eyes on the prize,actually moved 23 percent faster,than people who looked around naturally.,To put that in perspective,,a 23 percent increase,is like trading in yourn1980 Chevy Citation,for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette. 
 We were so excited by this,,because this meant that a strategy,that costs nothing,,that is easy for people to use,,regardless of whether they're in shape,or struggling to get there,,had a big effect.,Keeping your eyes on the prize,made the exercise look and feel easier,even when people were working harder,because they were moving faster.,Now, I know there's more to good health,than walking a little bit faster,,but keeping your eyes on the prize,might be one additional strategy,that you can use to help promote,a healthy lifestyle. 
 If you're not convinced yet,that we all see the worldnthrough our own mind's eye,,let me leave you with one final example.,Here's a photograph of a beautiful nstreet in Stockholm, with two cars.,The car in the back looks much larger,than the car in the front.,However, in reality,,these cars are the same size,,but that's not how we see it.,So does this mean that,our eyes have gone haywire,and that our brains are a mess?,No, it doesn't mean that at all.,It's just how our eyes work.,We might see the world in a different way,,and sometimes that might not,line up with reality,,but it doesn't meannthat one of us is right,and one of us is wrong.,We all see the worldnthrough our mind's eye,,but we can teach ourselvesnto see it differently. 
 So I can think of days,that have gone horribly wrong for me.,I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,,and I'm so behind,,and there's a big black cloud,hanging over my head,,and on days like these,,it looks like everyone around me,is down in the dumps too.,My colleague at work looks annoyed,when I ask for an extension on a deadline,,and my friend looks frustrated,when I show up late for lunchnbecause a meeting ran long,,and at the end of the day,,my husband looks disappointed,because I'd rather go to nbed than go to the movies.,And on days like these,nwhen everybody looks,upset and angry to me,,I try to remind myself that therenare other ways of seeing them.,Perhaps my colleague was confused,,perhaps my friend was concerned,,and perhaps my husband was nfeeling empathy instead.,So we all see the world,through our own mind's eye,,and on some days, it might look,like the world is a dangerous,and challenging and insurmountable place,,but it doesn't have to looknthat way all the time.,We can teach ourselvesnto see it differently,,and when we find a way to make the world,look nicer and easier,,it might actually become so. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We need to change the culturenin our jails and prisons,,especially for young inmates.,New York state is onenof only two in the U.S.,that automatically arrests and triesn16- to 17-year-olds as adults.,This culture of violencentakes these young people,and puts them in a hostile environment,,and the correctional officers pretty muchnallow any and everything to go on.,There's not really muchnfor these young people to do,to actually enhance their talentnand actually rehabilitate them.,Until we can raise the agenof criminal responsibility to 18,,we need to focus on changingnthe daily lives of these young people. 
 I know firsthand.,Before I ever turned 18,,I spent approximatelyn400 days on Rikers Island,,and to add to that,I spent almost 300 daysnin solitary confinement,,and let me tell you this:,Screaming at the top of your lungsnall day on your cell door,or screaming at the topnof your lungs out the window,,it gets tiring.,Since there's not much for you to donwhile you're in there,,you start pacingnback and forth in your cell,,you start talking to yourself,,your thoughts start running wild,,and then your thoughtsnbecome your own worst enemy.,Jails are actually supposednto rehabilitate a person,,not cause him or hernto become more angry,,frustrated, and feel more hopeless.,Since there's not a discharge plannput in place for these young people,,they pretty much nreenter society with nothing.,And there's not really much for them to donto keep them from recidivating. 
 But it all starts with the C.O.s.,It's very easy for some people,to look at these correctional officersnas the good guys,and the inmates as the bad guys,,or vice versa for some,,but it's a little more than that.,See, these C.O.s are normal,neveryday people.,They come from the same neighborhoodsnas the population they "serve.",They're just normal people.,They're not robots, and there's nnothing special about them.,They do pretty much everythingnanybody else in society does.,The male C.O.s want to talknand flirt with the female C.O.s.,They play the little high schoolnkid games with each other.,They politic with one another.,And the female C.O.s gossip to each other. 
 So I spent numerous amounts of timenwith numerous amounts of C.O.s,,and let me tell you aboutnthis one in particular named Monroe.,One day he pulled menin between the A and B doors,which separate the northnand south sides of our housing unit.,He pulled me there because I hadna physical altercation,with another young man in my housing unit,,and he felt, since there wasna female officer working on the floor,,that I violated his shift.,So he punched me in my chest.,He kind of knocked the wind out of me.,I wasn't impulsive,nI didn't react right away,,because I know this is their house.,I have no wins.,All he has to do is pull his pinnand backup will come immediately.,So I just gave him a look in his eyes,and I guess he saw the angernand frustration just burning,,and he said to me,,"Your eyes are going to get younin a lot of trouble,,because you're lookingnlike you want to fight.",So he commencednto taking off his utility belt,,he took off his shirt and his badge,,and he said, "We could fight." 
 So I asked him, "You gonna hold it down?",Now, that's a term that'sncommonly used on Rikers Island,meaning that you're notngoing to say anything to anybody,,and you're not going to report it.,He said, "Yeah, I'm gonna hold it down.nYou gonna hold it down?",I didn't even respond.,I just punched him right in his face,,and we began fightingnright then and there. 
 Towards the end of the fight,nhe slammed me up against the wall,,so while we were tussled up,nhe said to me, "You good?",as if he got the best of me,,but in my mind, I knownI got the best of him,,so I replied very cocky,,"Oh, I'm good, you good?",He said, "Yeah, I'm good, nI'm good.",We let go, he shook my hand,nsaid he gave me my respect,,gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way. 
 Believe it or not, you come acrossnsome C.O.s on Rikers Island,that'll fight you one-on-one.,They feel that they understand how it is,,and they feel that I'm goingnto meet you where you're at.,Since this is how you commonlynhandle your disputes,,we can handle it in that manner.,I walk away from it like a man,nyou walk away from it like a man,,and that's it.,Some C.O.s feel thatnthey're jailing with you.,This is why they have that mentalitynand that attitude,and they go by that concept.,In some instances, we're in itntogether with the C.O.s.,However, institutions need to giventhese correctional officers,proper trainings on how to properly dealnwith the adolescent population,,and they also neednto give them proper trainings,on how to deal with nthe mental health population as well.,These C.O.s play a big factornin these young people's lives,for x amount of time until a dispositionnis reached on their case.,So why not try to mentornthese young people while they're there?,Why not try to give them some typenof insight to make a change,,so once they reenter back into society,,they're doing something positive? 
 A second big thing to help our teensnin jails is better programming.,When I was on Rikers Island,nthe huge thing was solitary confinement.,Solitary confinementnwas originally designed,to break a person mentally,nphysically and emotionally.,That's what it was designed for.,The U.S. Attorney Generalnrecently released a report,stating that they're goingnto ban solitary confinement,in New York state for teens. 
 One thing that kept me sane while Inwas in solitary confinement was reading.,I tried to educate myselfnas much as possible.,I read any and everythingnI could get my hands on.,And aside from that,nI wrote music and short stories.,Some programs that I feelnwould benefit our young people,are art therapy programs,for the kids that like to drawnand have that talent,,and what about the young individualsnthat are musically inclined?,How about a music program for themnthat actually teaches them,how to write and make music?,Just a thought. 
 When adolescents come to Rikers Island,,C74, RNDC is the buildingnthat they're housed in.,That's nicknamed "gladiator school,",because you have a young individualncoming in from the street,thinking that they're tough,,being surrounded by a bunchnof other young individuals,from all of the five boroughs,nand everybody feels that they're tough.,So now you have a bunch of young gentlemennpoking their chests out,feeling that I have to provenI'm equally as tough as you,or I'm tougher than you, you and you.,But let's be honest:,That culture is very dangerousnand damaging to our young people.,We need to help institutionsnand these teens realize,that they don't have to leadnthe previous lifestyle that they led,when they were on the street,nthat they can actually make a change. 
 It's sad to reportnthat while I was in prison,,I used to hear dudes talking aboutnwhen they get released from prison,,what type of crimesnthey're going to commit,when they get back in the street.,The conversations used to soundnsomething like this:,"Oh, when I hit the street,nmy brother got this connection,for this, that and the third,",or, "My man over herengot this connection for the low price.,Let's exchange information,",and, "When we hit the town,nwe're going to do it real big.",I used to hear these conversationsnand think to myself, "Wow,,these dudes are really talking aboutngoing back in the street,and committing future crimes.",So I came up with a name for that:,I called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme,because really, how longnis that going to last?,You get a retirement plan with that?,Nice little pension? 401(k)? 403(b)?,You get health insurance? Dental?,(Laughter) 
 But I will tell you this:,Being in jail and being in prison,,I came across some of the mostnintelligent, brilliant,,and talented peoplenthat I would ever meet.,I've seen individualsntake a potato chip bag,and turn it into the mostnbeautiful picture frame.,I've seen individuals takenthe state soap that's provided for free,and turn them intonthe most beautiful sculptures,that would make Michelangelonlook like a kindergartner made it. 
 At the age of 21, I was inna maximum-security prison,called Elmira Correctional Facility.,I just came out of the weight shacknfrom working out,,and I saw an older gentleman that I knewnstanding in the middle of the yard,just looking up at the sky.,Mind you, this older gentlemen was servingna 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence,in which he already had servedn20 years of that sentence. 
 So I walk up to him and I said,,"O.G., what's going on, man, you good?" 
 He looked at me, and he said,n"Yeah, I'm good, young blood." 
 I'm like, "So what are you lookingnup at the sky for, man?,What's so fascinating up there?" 
 He said, "You look upnand you tell me what you see." 
 "Clouds." (Laughter) 
 He said, "All right.nWhat else do you see?",At that time, it was a plane passing by. 
 I said, "All right, I see an airplane." 
 He said, "Exactly, and what's non that airplane?" "People.","Exactly. Now where's that planenand those people going?" 
 "I don't know. You know?,Please let me know if you do.nThen let me get some lottery numbers." 
 He said, "You're missingnthe big picture, young blood.,That plane with those peoplenis going somewhere,,while we're here stuck.,The big picture is this:,That plane with those peoplengoing somewhere,,that's life passing us bynwhile we behind these walls, stuck." 
 Ever since that day,,that sparked something in my mindnand made me know I had to make a change.,Growing up, I was alwaysna good, smart kid.,Some people would saynI was a little too smart for my own good.,I had dreams of becomingnan architect or an archaeologist. 
 Currently, I'm workingnat the Fortune Society,,which is a reentry program,,and I work with people as a case managernthat are at high risk for recidivism.,So I connect themnwith the services that they need,once they're released from jail and prison,so they can make a positive transitionnback into society.,If I was to see my 15-year-old self today,,I would sit down and talk to himnand try to educate him,and I would let him know,n"Listen, this is me. I'm you.,This is us. We are one.,Everything that you're about to do,nI know what you're gonna do,before you do it because I already did it,,and I would encourage himnnot to hang out with x, y and z people.,I would tell him not to benin such-and-such place.,I would tell him,nkeep your behind in school, man,,because that's where you need to be,,because that's what's goingnto get you somewhere in life.,This is the messagenthat we should be sharing,with our young men and young women.,We shouldn't be treating them as adultsnand putting them in cultures of violence,that are nearly impossiblenfor them to escape. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm an artist and I cut books.,This is one of my first book works.,It's called "AlternatenRoute to Knowledge.",I wanted to create a stack of books sonthat somebody could come into the gallery,and think they're just lookingnat a regular stack of books,,but then as they got closer they wouldnsee this rough hole carved into it,,and wonder what was happening,nwonder why,,and think about the material of the book.,So I'm interested in the texture,,but I'm more interested in the textnand the images that we find within books. 
 In most of my work, what I do is I sealnthe edges of a book with a thick varnish,so it's creating sort of a skinnon the outside of the book,so it becomes a solid material,nbut then the pages inside are still loose,,and then I carveninto the surface of the book,,and I'm not moving or adding anything.,I'm just carving aroundnwhatever I find interesting.,So everything you seenwithin the finished piece,is exactly where it wasnin the book before I began. 
 I think of my work as sort ofna remix, in a way,,because I'm working withnsomebody else's material,in the same way that a D.J. might benworking with somebody else's music.,This was a book of Raphael paintings,nthe Renaissance artist,,and by taking his worknand remixing it, carving into it,,I'm sort of making it into somethingnthat's more new and more contemporary.,I'm thinking also about breaking outnof the box of the traditional book,and pushing that linear format,,and try to push the structurenof the book itself,so that the book can becomenfully sculptural. 
 I'm using clamps and ropesnand all sorts of materials, weights,,in order to hold things nin place before I varnish,so that I can push the form nbefore I begin,,so that something like thisncan become a piece like this,,which is just madenfrom a single dictionary.,Or something like thisncan become a piece like this.,Or something like this,,which who knows what that's going to benor why that's in my studio,,will become a piece like this. 
 So I think one of the reasonsnpeople are disturbed by destroying books,,people don't want to rip books,and nobody really wantsnto throw away a book,,is that we think about booksnas living things,,we think about them as a body,,and they're creatednto relate to our body, as far as scale,,but they also have the potentialnto continue to grow,and to continue to become new things.,So books really are alive.,So I think of the book as a body,,and I think of the book as a technology.,I think of the book as a tool.,And I also think of the book as a machine.,I also think of the book as a landscape.,This is a full set of encyclopediasnthat's been connected and sanded together,,and as I carve through it,,I'm deciding what I want to choose.,So with encyclopedias,nI could have chosen anything,,but I specifically chosenimages of landscapes.,And with the material itself,nI'm using sandpaper,and sanding the edgesnso not only the images suggest landscape,,but the material itselfnsuggests a landscape as well. 
 So one of the things I donis when I'm carving through the book,,I'm thinking about images,nbut I'm also thinking about text,,and I think about themnin a very similar way,,because what's interestingnis that when we're reading text,,when we're reading a book,,it puts images in our head,,so we're sort of filling that piece.,We're sort of creating imagesnwhen we're reading text,,and when we're looking at an image,nwe actually use language,in order to understandnwhat we're looking at.,So there's sort ofna yin-yang that happens,,sort of a flip flop.,So I'm creating a piecenthat the viewer is completing themselves. 
 And I think of my worknas almost an archaeology.,I'm excavating and I'm tryingnto maximize the potential,and discover as much as I possibly can,and exposing it within my own work.,But at the same time,,I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,,and what's happening now that mostnof our information is intangible,,and this idea of loss,,and this idea that not only is the formatnconstantly shifting within computers,,but the information itself,,now that we don't have a physical backup,,has to be constantly updatednin order to not lose it.,And I have several dictionariesnin my own studio,,and I do use a computer every day,,and if I need to look up a word,nI'll go on the computer,,because I can go directlynand instantly to what I'm looking up.,I think that the book was never really,the right formatnfor nonlinear information,,which is why we're seeing reference books,becoming the first to be nendangered or extinct. 
 So I don't think that the booknwill ever really die.,People think that now that we havendigital technology,,the book is going to die,,and we are seeing things shiftingnand things evolving.,I think that the book will evolve,,and just like people saidnpainting would die,when photography and printmakingnbecame everyday materials,,but what it really allowed painting to do,was it allowed paintingnto quit its day job.,It allowed painting to not have to haventhat everyday chore of telling the story,,and painting became freenand was allowed to tell its own story,,and that's when we saw Modernism emerge,,and we saw paintingngo into different branches.,And I think that's what'snhappening with books now,,now that most of our technology,nmost of our information,,most of our personal and cultural nrecords are in digital form,,I think it's really allowing the booknto become something new.,So I think it's a very exciting timenfor an artist like me,,and it's very exciting to see whatnwill happen with the book in the future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You've heard of your I.Q.,nyour general intelligence,,but what's your Psy-Q?,How much do you knownabout what makes you tick,,and how good are younat predicting other people's behavior,or even your own?,And how much of what you think you knownabout psychology is wrong?,Let's find out by counting downnthe top 10 myths of psychology. 
 You've probably heard it saidnthat when it comes to their psychology,,it's almost as if men are from Marsnand women are from Venus.,But how differentnare men and women really?,To find out, let's startnby looking at something,on which men and women really do differ,and plotting some psychologicalngender differences on the same scale.,One thing men and womenndo really differ on,is how far they can throw a ball.,So if we look at the data for men here,,we see what is calledna normal distribution curve.,A few men can throw a ball really far,nand a few men not far at all,,but most a kind of average distance.,And women sharenthe same distribution as well,,but actually there'snquite a big difference.,In fact, the average manncan throw a ball further,than about 98 percent of all women.,So now let's look at whatnsome psychological gender differences,look like on the same standardized scale.,Any psychologist will tell you,that men are betternat spatial awareness than women --,so things like map-reading, nfor example -- and it's true,,but let's have a looknat the size of this difference.,It's tiny; the lines are so closentogether they almost overlap.,In fact, the average woman is betternthan 33 percent of all men,,and of course, if that was 50 percent,,then the two gendersnwould be exactly equal.,It's worth bearing in mind that thisndifference and the next one I'll show you,are pretty much the biggestnpsychological gender differences,ever discovered in psychology.,So here's the next one.,Any psychologist will tell younthat women are better,with language and grammar than men.,So here's performancenon the standardized grammar test.,There go the women. There go the men.,Again, yes, women are better on average,nbut the lines are so close,that 33 percent of mennare better than the average woman,,and again, if it was 50 percent,,that would representncomplete gender equality.,So it's not reallyna case of Mars and Venus.,It's more a case of, if anything,nMars and Snickers:,basically the same, but one's maybe nslightly nuttier than the other.,I won't say which. 
 Now we've got you warmed up.,Let's psychoanalyze you usingnthe famous Rorschach inkblot test.,So you can probably see two, I dunno,ntwo bears or two people or something.,But what do you think they're doing?,Put your hand up if you thinknthey're saying hello.,Not many people. Okay.,Put your hands up if you thinknthey are high-fiving.,Okay. What if you think they're fighting?,Only a few people there.,Okay, so if you think they'rensaying hello or high-fiving,,then that means you're a friendly person.,If you think they're fighting,,you're a bit more of a nnasty, aggressive person.,Are you a lover or a fighter, basically.,What about this one?,This isn't really a voting one, so on nthree everyone shout out what you see.,One, two, three.n(Audience shouting),I heard hamster. Who said hamster?,That was very worrying.,A guy there said hamster.,Well, you should seensome kind of two-legged animal here,,and then the mirror image of them there.,If you didn't, then this meansnthat you have difficulty,processing complex situationsnwhere there's a lot going on. 
 Except, of course,nit doesn't mean that at all.,Rorschach inkblot testsnhave basically no validity,when it comes to diagnosingnpeople's personality,and are not usednby modern-day psychologists.,In fact, one recent study foundnthat when you do try,to diagnose people's personalitiesnusing Rorschach inkblot tests,,schizophrenia was diagnosed,in about one sixth of apparentlynperfectly normal participants. 
 So if you didn't do that well on this,,maybe you are notna very visual type of person.,So let's do anothernquick quiz to find out.,When making a cake, do you prefer to --nso hands up for each one again --,do you prefer to usena recipe book with pictures?,Yeah, a few people.,Have a friend talk you through?,Or have a go, making it upnas you go along?,Quite a few people there.,Okay, so if you said A,,then this means that younare a visual learner,and you learn best when informationnis presented in a visual style.,If you said B, it meansnyou're an auditory learner,,that you learn best when informationnis presented to you in an auditory format.,And if you said C, it meansnthat you're a kinesthetic learner,,that you learn best when you get stuck innand do things with your hands. 
 Except, of course,nas you've probably guessed,,that it doesn't, becausenthe whole thing is a complete myth.,Learning styles are made up and are nnot supported by scientific evidence.,So we know this because inntightly controlled experimental studies,,when learners are given material to learn,either in their preferred stylenor an opposite style,,it makes no difference at all to thenamount of information that they retain.,And if you think about itnfor just a second,,it's just obviousnthat this has to be true.,It's obvious thatnthe best presentation format,depends not on you,nbut on what you're trying to learn.,Could you learn to drive a car,nfor example,,just by listening to someonentelling you what to do,with no kinesthetic experience?,Could you solve simultaneous equations,by talking them through in your headnand without writing them down?,Could you revise nfor your architecture exams,using interpretive dancenif you're a kinesthetic learner?,No. What you need to do nis match the material to be learned,to the presentation format, not you. 
 I know many of you are A-level students,that will have recently gottennyour GCSE results.,And if you didn't quite getnwhat you were hoping for,,then you can't really blamenyour learning style,,but one thing that you might wantnto think about blaming is your genes.,So what this is all about is anrecent study at University College London,found that 58 percent of the variation,between different studentsnand their GCSE results,was down to genetic factors.,That sounds like a very precise figure,nso how can we tell?,Well, when we want to unpacknthe relative contributions,of genes and the environment,,what we can do is do a twin study.,So identical twins sharen100 percent of their environment,and 100 percent of their genes,,whereas non-identical twinsnshare 100 percent of their environment,,but just like any brother and sister,nshare only 50 percent of their genes.,So by comparing how similarnGCSE results are in identical twins,versus non-identical twins,,and doing some clever math,,we can an idea of how much variationnand performance is due to the environment,and how much is due to genes.,And it turns out that it'snabout 58 percent due to genes.,So this isn't to undermine the hard worknthat you and your teachers here put in.,If you didn't quite get the GCSE resultsnthat you were hoping for,,then you can always try blamingnyour parents, or at least their genes. 
 One thing that you shouldn't blame,is being a left-brainednor right-brained learner,,because again, this is a myth.,So the myth here is thatnthe left brain is logical,,it's good with equations like this,,and the right brain is more creative,nso the right brain is better at music.,But again, this is a mythnbecause nearly everything that you do,involves nearly all partsnof your brain talking together,,even just the most mundane thingnlike having a normal conversation.,However, perhaps one reasonnwhy this myth has survived,is that there isna slight grain of truth to it.,So a related version of the myth,is that left-handed people arenmore creative than right-handed people,,which kind of makes sense becausenyour brain controls the opposite hands,,so left-handed people,,the right side of the brainnis slightly more active,than the left-hand side of the brain,,and the idea is the right-hand sidenis more creative.,Now, it isn't true per se,that left-handed people are more creativenthan right-handed people.,What is true that ambidextrous people,,or people who use both handsnfor different tasks,,are more creative thinkersnthan one-handed people,,because being ambidextrous involves,having both sides of the brainntalk to each other a lot,,which seems to be involvednin creating flexible thinking.,The myth of the creative left-hander,arises from the factnthat being ambidextrous,is more common amongst nleft-handers than right-handers,,so a grain of truth in the ideanof the creative left-hander,,but not much. 
 A related myth that you'venprobably heard of,is that we only usen10 percent of our brains.,This is, again, a complete myth.,Nearly everything that we do,neven the most mundane thing,,uses nearly all of our brains. 
 That said, it is of course true,that most of us don't use our brainpowernquite as well as we could.,So what could we donto boost our brainpower?,Maybe we could listennto a nice bit of Mozart.,Have you heard of the ideanof the Mozart effect?,So the idea is that listening nto Mozart makes you smarter,and improves your nperformance on I.Q. tests.,Now again, what's interestingnabout this myth,is that although it's basically a myth,nthere is a grain of truth to it.,So the original study found that,participants who were playednMozart music for a few minutes,did better on a subsequent I.Q. test,than participants who simplynsat in silence.,But a follow-up study recruitednsome people who liked Mozart music,and then another group of people,who were fans of nthe horror stories of Stephen King.,And they played the peoplenthe music or the stories.,The people who preferrednMozart music to the stories,got a bigger I.Q. boostnfrom the Mozart than the stories,,but the people who preferrednthe stories to the Mozart music,got a bigger I.Q. boostnfrom listening to the Stephen King stories,than the Mozart music.,So the truth is that listeningnto something that you enjoy,perks you up a bitnand gives you a temporary I.Q. boost,on a narrow range of tasks.,There's no suggestion thatnlistening to Mozart,,or indeed Stephen King stories,,is going to make you any smarternin the long run. 
 Another version of the Mozart myth,is that listening to Mozart can make younnot only cleverer but healthier, too.,Unfortunately, this doesn'tnseem to be true,of someone who listenednto the music of Mozart almost every day,,Mozart himself,,who suffered from gonorrhea,nsmallpox, arthritis,,and, what most people think eventuallynkilled him in the end, syphilis.,This suggests that Mozartnshould have bit more careful, perhaps,,when choosing his sexual partners.,But how do we choose a partner? 
 So a myth that I have to saynis sometimes spread a bit by sociologists,is that our preferences in a romantic npartner are a product of our culture,,that they're very culturally specific.,But in fact, the data don't back this up.,A famous study surveyed people fromn[37] different cultures across the globe,,from Americans to Zulus,,on what they look for in a partner.,And in every single culturenacross the globe,,men placed more valuenon physical attractiveness in a partner,than did women,,and in every single culture, too,,women placed more importance than did mennon ambition and high earning power.,In every culture, too,,men preferred womennwho were younger than themselves,,an average of, I think it was 2.66 years,,and in every culture, too,,women preferred mennwho were older than them,,so an average of 3.42 years,,which is why we've got heren"Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy." 
 So moving on from tryingnto score with a partner,to trying to score in basketballnor football or whatever your sport is.,The myth here is that sportsmen go throughnhot-hand streaks, Americans call them,,or purple patches,nwe sometimes say in England,,where they just can't miss,nlike this guy here.,But in fact, what happens is thatnif you analyze the pattern,of hits and misses statistically,,it turns out that it'snnearly always at random.,Your brain creates patternsnfrom the randomness.,If you toss a coin,,a streak of heads or tails is going nto come out somewhere in the randomness,,and because the brain likes to seenpatterns where there are none,,we look at these streaksnand attribute meanings to them,and say, "Yeah he's really on form today,",whereas actually you wouldnget the same pattern,if you were just gettingnhits and misses at random. 
 So an exception to this, however,nis penalty shootouts.,A recent study lookingnat penalty shootouts in football,shows that players who represent countries,with a very bad recordnin penalty shootouts,,like, for example, England,,tend to be quicker to take their shotsnthan countries with a better record,,and presumably as a result,nthey're more likely to miss. 
 Which raises the question,of if there's any way that wencould improve people's performance.,And one thing you might think about doing,is punishing people for their missesnand seeing if that improves them.,This idea, the effect that punishmentncan improve performance,,is what participantsnthought they were testing,in Milgram's famous learningnand punishment experiment,that you've probably heard aboutnif you're a psychology student.,The story goes that participantsnwere prepared to give,what they believed to be fatalnelectric shocks to a fellow participant,when they got a question wrong,,just because someonenin a white coat told them to. 
 But this story is a mythnfor three reasons.,Firstly and most crucially, the lab coatnwasn't white, it was in fact grey.,Secondly, the participantsnwere told before the study,and reminded any timenthey raised a concern,,that although the shocks were painful,nthey were not fatal,and indeed causednno permanent damage whatsoever.,And thirdly, participantsndidn't give the shocks,just because someonenin the coat told them to.,When they were interviewednafter the study,,all the participants saidnthat they firmly believed,that the learning and punishment studynserved a worthy scientific purpose,which would havenenduring gains for science,as opposed to the momentary nonfatalndiscomfort caused to the participants. 
 Okay, so I've been talkingnfor about 12 minutes now,,and you've probably been nsitting there listening to me,,analyzing my speech patterns nand body language,and trying to work out if you shouldntake any notice of what I'm saying,,whether I'm telling the truthnor whether I'm lying,,but if so you'venprobably completely failed,,because although we all thinknwe can catch a liar,from their body languagenand speech patterns,,hundreds of psychological testsnover the years have shown,that all of us, includingnpolice officers and detectives,,are basically at chance when it comesnto detecting lies from body language,and verbal patterns.,Interestingly, there is one exception:,TV appeals for missing relatives.,It's quite easy to predictnwhen the relatives are missing,and when the appealers have in factnmurdered the relatives themselves.,So hoax appealers are more likelynto shake their heads, to look away,,and to make errors in their speech,,whereas genuine appealers are more likely,to express hope that the personnwill return safely,and to avoid brutal language.,So, for example, they might sayn"taken from us" rather than "killed." 
 Speaking of which,nit's about time I killed this talk,,but before I do, I just want nto give you in 30 seconds,the overarching myth of psychology.,So the myth is that psychology is justna collection of interesting theories,,all of which say something usefulnand all of which have something to offer.,What I hope to have shown younin the past few minutes,is that this isn't true.,What we need to do is assessnpsychological theories,by seeing what predictions they make,,whether that is that listening to Mozartnmakes you smarter,,that you learn better when information isnpresented in your preferred learning style,or whatever it is, all of thesenare testable empirical predictions,,and the only way we can make progress,is to test these predictionsnagainst the data,in tightly controllednexperimental studies.,And it's only by doing sonthat we can hope to discover,which of these theoriesnare well supported,,and which, like all the onesnI've told you about today, are myths. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I grew up with my identical twin,,who was an incredibly loving brother.,Now, one thing about being a twin is,,it makes you an expertnat spotting favoritism.,If his cookie was evennslightly bigger than my cookie,,I had questions.,And clearly, I wasn't starving. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I became a psychologist,nI began to notice favoritism,of a different kind;,and that is, how much more we valuenthe body than we do the mind.,I spent nine years at universitynearning my doctorate in psychology,,and I can't tell you how many peoplenlook at my business card and say,,"Oh -- a psychologist.nSo, not a real doctor,",as if it should say that on my card. 
 [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologistn(Not a Real Doctor)] 
 (Laughter) 
 This favoritism we show the bodynover the mind --,I see it everywhere. 
 I recently was at a friend's house,,and their five-year-oldnwas getting ready for bed.,He was standing on a stoolnby the sink, brushing his teeth,,when he slipped and scratched his legnon the stool when he fell.,He cried for a minute,nbut then he got back up,,got back on the stool, and reached outnfor a box of Band-Aids,to put one on his cut.,Now, this kid could barelyntie his shoelaces,,but he knew you have to cover a cutnso it doesn't become infected,,and you have to care for your teethnby brushing twice a day.,We all know how to maintainnour physical health,and how to practice dental hygiene, right?,We've known it sincenwe were five years old.,But what do we know about maintainingnour psychological health?,Well, nothing.,What do we teach our childrennabout emotional hygiene?,Nothing.,How is it that we spend more timentaking care of our teeth,than we do our minds?,Why is it that our physical healthnis so much more important to us,than our psychological health? 
 We sustain psychological injuriesneven more often than we do physical ones,,injuries like failurenor rejection or loneliness.,And they can also get worsenif we ignore them,,and they can impact our livesnin dramatic ways.,And yet, even though there arenscientifically proven techniques,we could use to treat thesenkinds of psychological injuries,,we don't.,It doesn't even occur to usnthat we should.,"Oh, you're feeling depressed?nJust shake it off; it's all in your head.",Can you imagine saying thatnto somebody with a broken leg:,"Oh, just walk it off;nit's all in your leg." 
 (Laughter) 
 It is time we closed the gap,between our physicalnand our psychological health.,It's time we made them more equal,,more like twins. 
 Speaking of which,nmy brother is also a psychologist.,So he's not a real doctor, either. 
 (Laughter) 
 We didn't study together, though.,In fact, the hardest thingnI've ever done in my life,is move across the Atlanticnto New York City,to get my doctorate in psychology.,We were apart thennfor the first time in our lives,,and the separation was brutalnfor both of us.,But while he remainednamong family and friends,,I was alone in a new country.,We missed each other terribly,,but international phone callsnwere really expensive then,,and we could only afford to speaknfor five minutes a week.,When our birthday rolled around,,it was the firstnwe wouldn't be spending together.,We decided to splurge,,and that week,nwe would talk for 10 minutes. 
 (Laughter) 
 I spent the morning pacing around my room,nwaiting for him to call --,and waiting ...,and waiting.,But the phone didn't ring.,Given the time difference, I assumed,,"OK, he's out with friends,nhe'll call later.",There were no cell phones then.,But he didn't.,And I began to realizenthat after being away for over 10 months,,he no longer missed menthe way I missed him.,I knew he would call in the morning,,but that night was one of the saddestnand longest nights of my life.,I woke up the next morning.,I glanced down at the phone,,and I realizednI had kicked it off the hook,when pacing the day before.,I stumbled out of bed,,I put the phone back on the receiver,nand it rang a second later.,And it was my brother,,and boy, was he pissed. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was the saddest and longestnnight of his life as well.,Now, I tried to explainnwhat happened, but he said,,"I don't understand.,If you saw I wasn't calling you,,why didn't you just pick upnthe phone and call me?",He was right.,Why didn't I call him?,I didn't have an answer then.,But I do today,,and it's a simple one:,loneliness. 
 Loneliness creates a deepnpsychological wound,,one that distorts our perceptionsnand scrambles our thinking.,It makes us believe that those around usncare much less than they actually do.,It make us really afraid to reach out,,because why set yourself upnfor rejection and heartache,when your heart is already achingnmore than you can stand?,I was in the gripsnof real loneliness back then,,but I was surrounded by people all day,nso it never occurred to me.,But loneliness is definednpurely subjectively.,It depends solely on whether you feelnemotionally or socially disconnected,from those around you.,And I did.,There is a lot of research on loneliness,nand all of it is horrifying.,Loneliness won't just make you miserable;,it will kill you.,I'm not kidding.,Chronic loneliness increasesnyour likelihood of an early death,by 14 percent.,Fourteen percent!,Loneliness causes high blood pressure,,high cholesterol.,It even suppress the functioningnof your immune system,,making you vulnerable to all kindsnof illnesses and diseases.,In fact, scientists have concludednthat taken together,,chronic lonelinessnposes as significant a risk,for your long-term health and longevity,as cigarette smoking.,Now, cigarette packs come with warningsnsaying, "This could kill you.",But loneliness doesn't.,And that's why it's so important,that we prioritizenour psychological health,,that we practice emotional hygiene.,Because you can't treatna psychological wound,if you don't even know you're injured.,Loneliness isn't the onlynpsychological wound,that distorts our perceptionsnand misleads us. 
 Failure does that as well.,I once visited a day care center,,where I saw three toddlersnplay with identical plastic toys.,You had to slide the red button,nand a cute doggie would pop out.,One little girl tried pullingnthe purple button, then pushing it,,and then she just sat backnand looked at the box,with her lower lip trembling.,The little boy next to hernwatched this happen,,then turned to his box and burstninto tears without even touching it.,Meanwhile, another little girlntried everything she could think of,until she slid the red button,,the cute doggie popped out,nand she squealed with delight.,So: three toddlersnwith identical plastic toys,,but with very differentnreactions to failure.,The first two toddlers were perfectlyncapable of sliding a red button.,The only thing that preventednthem from succeeding,was that their mind tricked themninto believing they could not.,Now, adults get tricked this waynas well, all the time.,In fact, we all have a default setnof feelings and beliefs,that gets triggered whenevernwe encounter frustrations and setbacks. 
 Are you aware of hownyour mind reacts to failure?,You need to be.,Because if your mind tries to convince younyou're incapable of something,,and you believe it,,then like those two toddlers,nyou'll begin to feel helpless,and you'll stop trying too soon,nor you won't even try at all.,And then you'll be even morenconvinced you can't succeed.,You see, that's why so many peoplenfunction below their actual potential.,Because somewhere along the way,nsometimes a single failure,convinced them that they couldn'tnsucceed, and they believed it. 
 Once we become convinced of something,nit's very difficult to change our mind.,I learned that lesson the hard waynwhen I was a teenager with my brother.,We were driving with friendsndown a dark road at night,,when a police car stopped us.,There had been a robbery in the areanand they were looking for suspects.,The officer approached the car,nand shined his flashlight on the driver,,then on my brother in the front seat,,and then on me.,And his eyes opened wide and he said,,"Where have I seen your face before?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I said,,"In the front seat." 
 (Laughter) 
 But that made no sense to him whatsoever,,so now he thought I was on drugs. 
 (Laughter) 
 So he drags me out of the car,nhe searches me,,he marches me over to the police car,,and only when he verifiednI didn't have a police record,,could I show himnI had a twin in the front seat.,But even as we were driving away,,you could see by the looknon his face he was convinced,that I was getting away with something. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our mind is hard to changenonce we become convinced.,So it might be very naturalnto feel demoralized,and defeated after you fail.,But you cannot allow yourselfnto become convinced you can't succeed.,You have to fightnfeelings of helplessness.,You have to gain controlnover the situation.,And you have to breaknthis kind of negative cycle,before it begins. 
 [Stop Emotional Bleeding] 
 Our minds and our feelings --,they're not the trustworthy friendsnwe thought they were.,They're more like a really moody friend,,who can be totally supportive one minute,nand really unpleasant the next.,I once worked with this womannwho, after 20 years marriage,and an extremely ugly divorce,,was finally ready for her first date.,She had met this guy online,,and he seemed nicenand he seemed successful,,and most importantly,nhe seemed really into her.,So she was very excited,nshe bought a new dress,,and they met at an upscalenNew York City bar for a drink.,Ten minutes into the date,nthe man stands up and says,,"I'm not interested," and walks out.,Rejection is extremely painful.,The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.,All she could do was call a friend.,Here's what the friend said:n"Well, what do you expect?,You have big hips,nyou have nothing interesting to say.,Why would a handsome,nsuccessful man like that,ever go out with a loser like you?",Shocking, right, that a friendncould be so cruel?,But it would be much less shocking,if I told you it wasn'tnthe friend who said that.,It's what the woman said to herself.,And that's something we all do,,especially after a rejection.,We all start thinking of all our faultsnand all our shortcomings,,what we wish we were,nwhat we wish we weren't.,We call ourselves names.,Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.,And it's interesting that we do,,because our self-esteemnis already hurting.,Why would we want to gonand damage it even further?,We wouldn't make a physical injurynworse on purpose.,You wouldn't get a cut on your armnand decide, "Oh! I know --,I'm going to take a knife and seenhow much deeper I can make it." 
 But we do that with psychologicalninjuries all the time.,Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.,Because we don't prioritizenour psychological health.,We know from dozens of studiesnthat when your self-esteem is lower,,you are more vulnerablento stress and to anxiety;,that failures and rejections hurt more,,and it takes longer to recover from them.,So when you get rejected,nthe first thing you should be doing,is to revive your self-esteem,,not join Fight Clubnand beat it into a pulp.,When you're in emotional pain,,treat yourself with the same compassion,you would expect from a truly good friend. 
 [Protect Your Self-Esteem] 
 We have to catch our unhealthynpsychological habits and change them.,And one of unhealthiest and most commonnis called rumination.,To ruminate means to chew over.,It's when your boss yells at you,or your professornmakes you feel stupid in class,,or you have big fight with a friend,and you just can't stop replayingnthe scene in your head for days,,sometimes for weeks on end.,Now, ruminating about upsetting eventsnin this way can easily become a habit,,and it's a very costly one,,because by spending so much time focusednon upsetting and negative thoughts,,you are actually putting yourselfnat significant risk,for developing clinical depression,,alcoholism,,eating disorders,,and even cardiovascular disease. 
 The problem is,,the urge to ruminate can feelnreally strong and really important,,so it's a difficult habit to stop.,I know this for a fact,,because a little over a year ago,nI developed the habit myself.,You see, my twin brother was diagnosednwith stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,His cancer was extremely aggressive.,He had visible tumors all over his body.,And he had to start a harsh coursenof chemotherapy.,And I couldn't stop thinkingnabout what he was going through.,I couldn't stop thinkingnabout how much he was suffering,,even though he never complained, not once.,He had this incredibly positive attitude.,His psychological health was amazing.,I was physically healthy,nbut psychologically, I was a mess.,But I knew what to do.,Studies tell us that even a two-minutendistraction is sufficient,to break the urge to ruminatenin that moment.,And so each time I had a worrying,nupsetting, negative thought,,I forced myself to concentratenon something else until the urge passed.,And within one week,nmy whole outlook changed,and became more positive and more hopeful. 
 [Battle Negative Thinking] 
 Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,nmy brother had a CAT scan,,and I was by his sidenwhen he got the results.,All the tumors were gone.,He still had three more roundsnof chemotherapy to go,,but we knew he would recover.,This picture was taken two weeks ago. 
 By taking action when you're lonely,,by changing your responses to failure,,by protecting your self-esteem,,by battling negative thinking,,you won't just healnyour psychological wounds,,you will build emotional resilience,,you will thrive.,A hundred years ago, people begannpracticing personal hygiene,,and life expectancy ratesnrose by over 50 percent,in just a matter of decades.,I believe our quality of lifencould rise just as dramatically,if we all began practicingnemotional hygiene. 
 Can you imaginenwhat the world would be like,if everyone was psychologically healthier?,If there were less lonelinessnand less depression?,If people knew how to overcome failure?,If they felt better about themselvesnand more empowered?,If they were happier and more fulfilled?,I can, because that's the worldnI want to live in.,And that's the worldnmy brother wants to live in as well.,And if you just become informednand change a few simple habits, well --,that's the world we can all live in. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)An 18-year-old, African-American malenjoined the United States Air Force,and was assigned to Mountain Home nAir Force Base,and was a part of the air police squadron.,Upon first arriving there,nthe first goal that I had,was for me to identify an apartment,,so I could bring my wife nand my new baby, Melanie,,out to join me in Idaho. 
 I immediately went to nthe personnel office,,and talking with the guys in personnel,,they said, "Hey, no problem finding nan apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho.,The people down there love us nbecause they know if they have an airman,who is coming in to rent none of their apartments,,they'll always get their money.",And that was a really important thing.,He said, "So here is a list nof people that you can call,,and then they will then allow you nto select the apartment that you want.",So I got the list; I made the call.,The lady answered on the other endnand I told her what I wanted.,She said, "Oh, great you called.,We have four or five apartmentsnavailable right now.",She said, "Do you want na one-bedroom or two-bedroom?",Then she said, "Let's not talk about that.,Just come on down, nselect the apartment that you want.,We'll sign the contract,and you'll have keys in your handnto get your family out here right away." 
 So I was excited.,I jumped in my car. I went downtownnand knocked on the door.,When I knocked on the door, nthe woman came to the door,,and she looked at me, and she said,n"Can I help you?",I said, "Yes, I'm the person nwho called about the apartments.,I was just coming down nto make my selection.",She said, "You know what? nI'm really sorry,,but my husband rented those apartmentsnand didn't tell me about them.",I said, "You mean he rented nall five of them in one hour?",She didn't give me a response,nand what she said was this:,She said, "Why don't younleave your number,,and if we have some openings, nI'll give you a call?",Needless to say,nI did not get a call from her.,Nor did I get any responses nfrom the other people,that they gave me on the listnwhere I could get apartments. 
 So as a result of that,nand feeling rejected,,I went back to the base, and I talkednto the squadron commander.,His name was McDow, Major McDow.,I said, "Major McDow, I need your help.",I told him what happened, nand here's what he said to me:,He said, "James, I would love to help you.,But you know the problem:,We can't make people rent to folks nthat they don't want to rent to.,And besides, we have a great relationshipnwith people in the community,and we really don't want to damage that.",He said, "So maybe this is nwhat you should do.,Why don't you let your family stay home,,because you do know nthat you get a 30-day leave.,So once a year,,you can go home to your family,nspend 30 days and then come on back." 
 Needless to say, that didn'tnresonate for me.,So after leaving him, nI went back to personnel,,and talking to the clerk,,he said, "Jim, I think I have a nsolution for you.,There's an airman who is leavingnand he has a trailer.,If you noticed, in Mountain Home,,there are trailer parks and trailersnall over the place.,You can buy his trailer,nand you'd probably get a really good deal,because he wants to get out of townnas soon as possible.,And that would take care of your problem,,and that would provide nthe solution for you.",So I immediately jumped in my car,nwent downtown, saw the trailer --,it was a small trailer,,but under the circumstances,,I figured that was the nbest thing that I could do.,So I bought the trailer.,And then I asked him, n"Can I just leave the trailer here,,and that would take care nof all my problems,,I wouldn't have to findnanother trailer park?",He said, "Before I say yes to that, nI need to check with management.",So I get back to the base,,he called me back and management said,,"No, you can't leave the trailer here,because we had promised that slotnto some other people.",And that was strange to me,because there were several nother slots that were open,,but it just so happened that he nhad promised that slot to someone else. 
 So, what I did --,and he said, "You shouldn't worry, Jim,nbecause there are a lot of trailer parks.",So I put out another exhaustive listnof going to trailer parks.,I went to one after another, nafter another.,And I got the same kind of rejection there,that I received when I was looking nfor the apartment.,And as a result, the kind of commentsnthat they made to me,,in addition to saying that theyndidn't have any slots open,,one person said, "Jim, the reasonnwhy we can't rent to you,,we already have a Negro familynin the trailer park.",He said, "And it's not me, nbecause I like you people.",(Laughs),And that's what I did, too.nI chuckled, too.,He said, "But here's the problem:,If I let you in, the other tenants nwill move out,and I can't afford to takenthat kind of a hit.",He said, "I just can't rent to you." 
 Even though that was discouraging,nit didn't stop me.,I kept looking,,and I looked at the far end nof the town in Mountain Home,,and there was a small trailer park.,I mean, a really small trailer park.,It didn't have any paved roads in it,,it didn't have the concrete slabs,,it didn't have fencing,to portion off your trailer slot nfrom other trailer slots.,It didn't have a laundry facility.,But the conclusion I reached nat that moment,was that I didn't have na lot of other options.,So I called my wife, and I said,n"We're going to make this one work.",And we moved into it,and we became homeownersnin Mountain Home, Idaho.,And of course, eventuallynthings settled down. 
 Four years after that, I received papersnto move from Mountain Home, Idaho,to a place called Goose Bay, Labrador.,We won't even talk about that.nIt was another great location. (Laughter),So my challenge then was to get my family nfrom Mountain Home, Idaho,to Sharon, Pennsylvania.,That wasn't a problem because wenhad just purchased a brand-new automobile.,My mother called nand said she'll fly out.,She'll be with us as we drive,nshe'll help us manage the children.,So she came out, her and Alice nput a lot of food together for the trip. 
 That morning, we left at about 5 a.m.,Great trip, having a great time, ngood conversation.,Somewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock,nwe got a little bit tired,,and we said, "Why don't we getna motel so that we can rest,and then have an early startnin the morning?",So we were looking at a number nof the motels as we drove down the road,,and we saw one, it was a greatnbig, bright flashing light that said,,"Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies.",So we stopped in.,They were in the parking lot, nI went inside.,When I walked inside,,the lady was just finishing up none contract with some folks,,some other people nwere coming in behind me.,And so I walked to the counter,,and she said, "How can I help you?",I said, "I would like to get a motel nfor the evening for my family.",She said, "You know, I'm really sorry,nI just rented the last one.,We will not have any more nuntil the morning.",She said, "But if you go down the roadnabout an hour, 45 minutes,,there's another trailer park down there.",I said, "Yeah, but you still have the n'Vacancies' light on, and it's flashing.",She said, "Oh, I forgot.",And she reached over nand turned the light off.,She looked at me and I looked at her.,There were other people in the room.,She kind of looked at them.nNo one said anything.,So I just got the hint and I left,nand went outside to the parking lot.,And I told my mother and I told my wifenand also Melanie, and I said,,"It looks like we're going to have tondrive a little bit further down the road,to be able to sleep tonight.",And we did drive down the road,,but just before we took off nand pulled out of the parking lot,,guess what happened?,The light came back on.,And it said, "Vacancies, nVacancies, Vacancies.",We were able to find a nice place.,It wasn't our preference,nbut it was secure and it was clean.,And so we had a great sleep that night. 
 The piece that's important about that,is that we had similarnkinds of experiences,from Idaho all the way through nto Pennsylvania,,where we were rejected from hotels, nmotels and restaurants.,But we made it to Pennsylvania.,We got the family settled.nEveryone was glad to see the kids.,I jumped on a plane and shot offnto Goose Bay, Labrador,,which is another story, right?,(Laughter) 
 Here it is, 53 years later,,I now have nine grandchildren, ntwo great-grandchildren.,Five of the grandchildren are boys.,I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad,none in medical school.,I have a couple that are trending.,They're almost there but not quite.n(Laughter),I have one who has been nin college now for eight years.,(Laughter),He doesn't have a degree yet, nbut he wants to be a comedian.,So we're just trying to get himnto stay in school.,Because you never know,,just because you're funny at home,ndoes not make you a comedian, right?,(Laughter),But the thing about it, nthey're all good kids --,no drugs, no babies nin high school, no crime. 
 So with that being the backdrop,,I was sitting in my TV room watching TV,,and they were talking about Fergusonnand all the hullabaloo that was going on.,And all of a sudden, one of the news ncommentators got on the air and she said,,"In the last three months,,eight unarmed African-American males,have been killed by police,nwhite homeowners, or white citizens.",For some reason, at that momentnit just all hit me.,I said, "What is it? It is so insane.,What is the hatred that's causing people nto do these kinds of things?" 
 Just then, one of my grandsons called.,He said, "Granddad, did you hearnwhat they said on TV?",I said, "Yes, I did.",He said, "I'm just so confused.,We do everything we do,nbut it seems that driving while black,,walking while black, talking while black,nit's just dangerous.,What can we do? We do everythingnthat you told us to do.,When stopped by the police,,we place both hands on the steering wheelnat the 12 o'clock position.,If asked to get identification,,we tell them, 'I am slowly reaching over ninto the glove compartment to get my I.D.',When pulled out of the car to be searched,,when laid on the ground to be searched,,when our trunks are opened to be searched,,we don't push back, we don't challengenbecause we know, you've told us,,'Don't you challenge the police.,After it's over, call us and we'llnbe the ones to challenge." 
 He said, "And this is the piece nthat really bugs me:,Our white friends, our buddies,nwe kind of hang together.,When they hear about these kindsnof things happening to us, they say,,'Why do you take it?,You need to push back.nYou need to challenge.,You need to ask them nfor their identification.'",And here's what the boys have beenntaught to tell them:,"We know that you can do that,nbut please do not do that,while we're in the car,because the consequences for younare significantly different,than the consequences for us." 
 And so as a grandparent, nwhat do I tell my grandsons?,How do I keep them safe?nHow do I keep them alive?,As a result of this, people havencome to me and said,,"Jim, are you angry?",And my response to that is this:,"I don't have the luxury of being angry,,and I also know the consequences nof being enraged." 
 So therefore, the only thing that I can do,is take my collective intellect and mynenergy and my ideas and my experiences,and dedicate myself to challenge, nat any point in time,,anything that looks nlike it might be racist.,So the first thing I have nto do is to educate,,the second thing I have to do nis to unveil racism,,and the last thing I need to donis do everything within my power,to eradicate racism in my lifetimenby any means necessary. 
 The second thing I do is this:,I want to appeal to Americans.,I want to appeal to their humanity,nto their dignity,,to their civic pride and ownership,to be able to not react to these nheinous crimes in an adverse manner.,But instead, to elevate your levelnof societal knowledge,,your level of societal awarenessnand societal consciousness,to then collectively come together,nall of us come together,,to make sure that we speak out againstnand we challenge any kind of insanity,,any kind of insanity that makes it nokay to kill unarmed people,,regardless of their ethnicity,,regardless of their race,,regardless of their diversity makeup. 
 We have to challenge that.nIt doesn't make any sense.,The only way I think we can do thatnis through a collective.,We need to have black and white nand Asian and Hispanic,just to step forward and say,,"We are not going to accept nthat kind of behavior anymore."I have a confession to make.,As a scientist and engineer,nI've focused on efficiency for many years.,But efficiency can be a cult,,and today I'd like to tell younabout a journey,that moved me out of the cultnand back to a far richer reality. 
 A few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. nin London, I moved to Boston.,I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.,I bought a racing bicycle that summer,,and I bicycled every day to work.,To find my way, I used my phone.,It sent me over Mass. Ave.,nMassachusetts Avenue,,the shortest route fromnBoston to Cambridge.,But after a month,that I was cycling every daynon the car-packed Mass. Ave.,,I took a different route one day.,I'm not entirely sure why I tookna different route that day, a detour.,I just remember a feeling of surprise;,surprise at finding a street with no cars,,as opposed to the nearbynMass. Ave. full of cars;,surprise at finding a street ndraped by leaves and surrounded by trees.,But after the feeling nof surprise, I felt shame.,How could I have been so blind?,For an entire month,,I was so trapped in my mobile app,that a journey to worknbecame one thing only:,the shortest path.,In this single journey,nthere was no thought,of enjoying the road,,no pleasure in connecting with nature,,no possibility of lookingnpeople in the eyes.,And why?,Because I was saving a minutenout of my commute. 
 Now let me ask you: Am I alone here?,How many of you have never usedna mapping app for finding directions?,Most of you, if not all, have.,And don't get me wrong -- mapping appsnare the greatest game-changer,for encouraging peoplento explore the city.,You take your phone outnand you know immediately where to go.,However, the app also assumes,there are only a handfulnof directions to the destination.,It has the power to makenthose handful of directions,the definitive directionnto that destination. 
 After that experience, I changed.,I changed my researchnfrom traditional data-mining,to understanding how peoplenexperience the city.,I used computer science tools,to replicate social sciencenexperiments at scale, at web scale.,I became captivatednby the beauty and genius,of traditional social science experiments,done by Jane Jacobs,nStanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch.,The result of that researchnhas been the creation of new maps,,maps where you don't only findnthe shortest path, the blue one,,but also the most enjoyable path,,the red one.,How was that possible? 
 Einstein once said,,"Logic will get you from A to B.,Imagination will take you everywhere.",So with a bit of imagination,,we needed to understand,which parts of the citynpeople find beautiful.,At the University of Cambridge,nwith colleagues,,we thought about this simple experiment.,If I were to show younthese two urban scenes,,and I were to ask younwhich one is more beautiful,,which one would you say?,Don't be shy.,Who says A? Who says B?,Brilliant.,Based on that idea,,we built a crowdsourcing platform,,a web game.,Players are shown pairs of urban scenes,,and they're asked to choose which one nis more beautiful, quiet and happy.,Based on thousands of user votes,,then we are able to seenwhere consensus emerges.,We are able to see whichnare the urban scenes,that make people happy. 
 After that work, I joined Yahoo Labs,,and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano,,and together, we aggregatednthose winning locations in London,to build a new map of the city,,a cartography weighted for human emotions.,On this cartography, you're not onlynable to see and connect,from point A to point B nthe shortest segments,,but you're also ablento see the happy segment,,the beautiful path, the quiet path.,In tests, participants found the happy,nthe beautiful, the quiet path,far more enjoyable than the shortest one,,and that just by addingna few minutes to travel time.,Participants also love to attachnmemories to places.,Shared memories --nthat's where the old BBC building was;,and personal memories --nthat's where I gave my first kiss.,They also recalled how some pathsnsmelled and sounded.,So what if we had a mapping tool,that would returnnthe most enjoyable routes,based not only on aesthetics,but also based on smell, sound, nand memories?,That's where our researchnis going right now.,More generally, my research,,what it tries to do is avoidnthe danger of the single path,,to avoid robbing people of fullynexperiencing the city in which they live.,Walk the path through the park,nnot through the car park,,and you have an entirely different path.,Walk the path full of people you love,and not full of cars,,and you have an entirely different path.,It's that simple. 
 I would like to end with this thought:,do you remember "The Truman Show?",It's a media satire in which a real person,doesn't know he's livingnin a fabricated world.,Perhaps we live in a worldnfabricated for efficiency.,Look at some of your daily habits,,and as Truman did in the movie,nescape the fabricated world.,Why?,Well, if you think that adventurenis dangerous, try routine. It's deadly. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The power of yet. 
 I heard about a high school in Chicago,where students had to passna certain number of courses to graduate,,and if they didn't pass a course,nthey got the grade "Not Yet.",And I thought that was fantastic,,because if you get a failing grade,nyou think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.,But if you get the grade "Not Yet",,you understand thatnyou're on a learning curve.,It gives you a path into the future. 
 "Not Yet" also gave me insight,into a critical event early in my career,,a real turning point.,I wanted to see,how children copednwith challenge and difficulty,,so I gave 10-year-olds,problems that werenslightly too hard for them.,Some of them reactednin a shockingly positive way.,They said things like,n"I love a challenge,",or, "You know, I was hopingnthis would be informative.",They understood that their abilitiesncould be developed.,They had what I call a growth mindset.,But other students feltnit was tragic, catastrophic.,From their more fixed mindset perspective,,their intelligencenhad been up for judgment,,and they failed.,Instead of luxuriatingnin the power of yet,,they were gripped in the tyranny of now. 
 So what do they do next?,I'll tell you what they do next.,In one study, they told usnthey would probably cheat the next time,instead of studying morenif they failed a test.,In another study, after a failure,,they looked for someonenwho did worse than they did,so they could feel reallyngood about themselves.,And in study after study,nthey have run from difficulty.,Scientists measurednthe electrical activity from the brain,as students confronted an error.,On the left, you seenthe fixed-mindset students.,There's hardly any activity.,They run from the error.,They don't engage with it.,But on the right, you have the studentsnwith the growth mindset,,the idea that abilities can be developed.,They engage deeply.,Their brain is on fire with yet.,They engage deeply.,They process the error.,They learn from it and they correct it. 
 How are we raising our children?,Are we raising themnfor now instead of yet?,Are we raising kidsnwho are obsessed with getting As?,Are we raising kids who don't knownhow to dream big dreams?,Their biggest goal is getting the next A,nor the next test score?,And are they carrying this neednfor constant validation with them,into their future lives?,Maybe, because employersnare coming to me and saying,,"We have already raised a generation,of young workersnwho can't get through the day,without an award." 
 So what can we do?,How can we build that bridge to yet? 
 Here are some things we can do.,First of all, we can praise wisely,,not praising intelligence or talent.,That has failed.,Don't do that anymore.,But praising the processnthat kids engage in,,their effort, their strategies,ntheir focus, their perseverance,,their improvement.,This process praise creates kidsnwho are hardy and resilient. 
 There are other ways to reward yet.,We recently teamed up with game scientists,from the University of Washington,to create a new online math gamenthat rewarded yet.,In this game, students were rewardednfor effort, strategy and progress.,The usual math game,rewards you for getting answersnright, right now,,but this game rewarded process.,And we got more effort,,more strategies,,more engagementnover longer periods of time,,and more perseverance when they hitnreally, really hard problems. 
 Just the words "yet"nor "not yet," we're finding,,give kids greater confidence,,give them a path into the futurenthat creates greater persistence.,And we can actuallynchange students' mindsets.,In one study, we taught them,that every time they push outnof their comfort zone,to learn something new and difficult,,the neurons in their brainncan form new, stronger connections,,and over time, they can get smarter. 
 Look what happened: In this study,,students who were not taughtnthis growth mindset,continued to show declining gradesnover this difficult school transition,,but those who were taught this lessonnshowed a sharp rebound in their grades.,We have shown this now,nthis kind of improvement,,with thousands and thousands of kids,nespecially struggling students. 
 So let's talk about equality.,In our country,nthere are groups of students,who chronically underperform,,for example, children in inner cities,,or children on Native Americannreservations.,And they've done so poorly for so long,that many people think it's inevitable.,But when educators createngrowth mindset classrooms,steeped in yet,,equality happens.,And here are just a few examples.,In one year, a kindergarten classnin Harlem, New York,scored in the 95th percentile,on the national achievement test.,Many of those kids could not hold a pencil,when they arrived at school.,In one year,,fourth-grade studentsnin the South Bronx, way behind,,became the number one fourth-grade classnin the state of New York,on the state math test.,In a year, to a year and a half,,Native American studentsnin a school on a reservation,went from the bottomnof their district to the top,,and that district includednaffluent sections of Seattle.,So the Native kidsnoutdid the Microsoft kids. 
 This happened because the meaningnof effort and difficulty were transformed.,Before, effort and difficulty,made them feel dumb,nmade them feel like giving up,,but now, effort and difficulty,,that's when their neuronsnare making new connections,,stronger connections.,That's when they're getting smarter. 
 I received a letter recentlynfrom a 13-year-old boy.,He said, "Dear Professor Dweck,,I appreciate that your writingnis based on solid scientific research,,and that's why I decidednto put it into practice.,I put more effort into my schoolwork,,into my relationship with my family,,and into my relationshipnwith kids at school,,and I experienced great improvementnin all of those areas.,I now realize I've wastednmost of my life." 
 Let's not waste any more lives,,because once we know,that abilities are capable of such growth,,it becomes a basic human rightnfor children, all children,,to live in places that create that growth,,to live in places filled with "yet". 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So over the past few centuries,nmicroscopes have revolutionized our world.,They revealed to us a tiny worldnof objects, life and structures,that are too small for usnto see with our naked eyes.,They are a tremendous contributionnto science and technology.,Today I'd like to introduce younto a new type of microscope,,a microscope for changes.,It doesn't use opticsnlike a regular microscope,to make small objects bigger,,but instead it uses a video cameranand image processing,to reveal to us the tiniest motionsnand color changes in objects and people,,changes that are impossiblenfor us to see with our naked eyes.,And it lets us look at our worldnin a completely new way. 
 So what do I mean by color changes?,Our skin, for example,nchanges its color very slightly,when the blood flows under it.,That change is incredibly subtle,,which is why, when younlook at other people,,when you look at the personnsitting next to you,,you don't see their skinnor their face changing color.,When we look at this video of Steve here,nit appears to us like a static picture,,but once we look at this videonthrough our new, special microscope,,suddenly we seena completely different image.,What you see here are small changesnin the color of Steve's skin,,magnified 100 timesnso that they become visible.,We can actually see a human pulse.,We can see how fastnSteve's heart is beating,,but we can also see the actual waynthat the blood flows in his face.,And we can do that not justnto visualize the pulse,,but also to actually nrecover our heart rates,,and measure our heart rates.,And we can do it with regular camerasnand without touching the patients.,So here you see the pulse and heart ratenwe extracted from a neonatal baby,from a video we tooknwith a regular DSLR camera,,and the heart rate measurement we get,is as accurate as the one you'd getnwith a standard monitor in a hospital.,And it doesn't even have to bena video we recorded.,We can do it essentiallynwith other videos as well.,So I just took a short clipnfrom "Batman Begins" here,just to show Christian Bale's pulse.,(Laughter),And you know, presumablynhe's wearing makeup,,the lighting here is kind of challenging,,but still, just from the video,nwe're able to extract his pulse,and show it quite well. 
 So how do we do all that?,We basically analyze the changesnin the light that are recorded,at every pixel in the video over time,,and then we crank up those changes.,We make them biggernso that we can see them.,The tricky part is that those signals,,those changes that we're after,nare extremely subtle,,so we have to be very carefulnwhen you try to separate them,from noise that always exists in videos.,So we use some clevernimage processing techniques,to get a very accurate measurementnof the color at each pixel in the video,,and then the way the colornchanges over time,,and then we amplify those changes.,We make them bigger to create those typesnof enhanced videos, or magnified videos,,that actually show us those changes. 
 But it turns out we can do thatnnot just to show tiny changes in color,,but also tiny motions,,and that's because the lightnthat gets recorded in our cameras,will change not only if the colornof the object changes,,but also if the object moves.,So this is my daughternwhen she was about two months old.,It's a video I recordednabout three years ago.,And as new parents, we all wantnto make sure our babies are healthy,,that they're breathing,nthat they're alive, of course.,So I too got one of those baby monitors,so that I could see my daughternwhen she was asleep.,And this is pretty much what you'll seenwith a standard baby monitor.,You can see the baby's sleeping, but nthere's not too much information there.,There's not too much we can see.,Wouldn't it be better,nor more informative, or more useful,,if instead we could looknat the view like this.,So here I took the motionsnand I magnified them 30 times,,and then I could clearly see that myndaughter was indeed alive and breathing.,(Laughter),Here is a side-by-side comparison.,So again, in the source video,nin the original video,,there's not too much we can see,,but once we magnify the motions,nthe breathing becomes much more visible.,And it turns out, there'sna lot of phenomena,we can reveal and magnifynwith our new motion microscope.,We can see how our veins and arteriesnare pulsing in our bodies.,We can see that our eyesnare constantly moving,in this wobbly motion.,And that's actually my eye,,and again this video was takennright after my daughter was born,,so you can see I wasn't gettingntoo much sleep. (Laughter),Even when a person is sitting still,,there's a lot of informationnwe can extract,about their breathing patterns,nsmall facial expressions.,Maybe we could use those motions,to tell us something aboutnour thoughts or our emotions.,We can also magnify smallnmechanical movements,,like vibrations in engines,,that can help engineers detectnand diagnose machinery problems,,or see how our buildings and structuresnsway in the wind and react to forces.,Those are all things that our societynknows how to measure in various ways,,but measuring those motions is one thing,,and actually seeing thosenmotions as they happen,is a whole different thing. 
 And ever since we discoverednthis new technology,,we made our code available online so that nothers could use and experiment with it.,It's very simple to use.,It can work on your own videos.,Our collaborators at Quanta Researchneven created this nice website,where you can upload your videosnand process them online,,so even if you don't have any experiencenin computer science or programming,,you can still very easily experimentnwith this new microscope.,And I'd like to show younjust a couple of examples,of what others have done with it. 
 So this video was made byna YouTube user called Tamez85.,I don't know who that user is,,but he, or she, used our code,to magnify small bellynmovements during pregnancy.,It's kind of creepy.,(Laughter),People have used it to magnifynpulsing veins in their hands.,And you know it's not real sciencenunless you use guinea pigs,,and apparently this guinea pignis called Tiffany,,and this YouTube user claimsnit is the first rodent on Earth,that was motion-magnified. 
 You can also do some art with it.,So this video was sent to menby a design student at Yale.,She wanted to seenif there's any difference,in the way her classmates move.,She made them all stand still,nand then magnified their motions.,It's like seeing nstill pictures come to life.,And the nice thing with nall those examples,is that we had nothing to do with them.,We just provided this new tool,na new way to look at the world,,and then people find other interesting,nnew and creative ways of using it. 
 But we didn't stop there.,This tool not only allows usnto look at the world in a new way,,it also redefines what we can do,and pushes the limits of whatnwe can do with our cameras.,So as scientists, we started wondering,,what other types of physical phenomenanproduce tiny motions,that we could now usenour cameras to measure?,And one such phenomenonnthat we focused on recently is sound.,Sound, as we all know,nis basically changes,in air pressure thatntravel through the air.,Those pressure waves hit objectsnand they create small vibrations in them,,which is how we hearnand how we record sound.,But it turns out that soundnalso produces visual motions.,Those are motionsnthat are not visible to us,but are visible to a cameranwith the right processing.,So here are two examples.,This is me demonstratingnmy great singing skills.,(Singing),(Laughter),And I took a high-speed videonof my throat while I was humming.,Again, if you stare at that video,,there's not too muchnyou'll be able to see,,but once we magnify the motions 100 times,nwe can see all the motions and ripples,in the neck that are involvednin producing the sound.,That signal is there in that video. 
 We also know that singersncan break a wine glass,if they hit the correct note.,So here, we're going to play a note,that's in the resonancenfrequency of that glass,through a loudspeaker that's next to it.,Once we play that notenand magnify the motions 250 times,,we can very clearly see nhow the glass vibrates,and resonates in response to the sound.,It's not something you're usednto seeing every day.,But this made us think.nIt gave us this crazy idea.,Can we actually invert this processnand recover sound from video,by analyzing the tiny vibrationsnthat sound waves create in objects,,and essentially convert thosenback into the sounds that produced them.,In this way, we can turnneveryday objects into microphones. 
 So that's exactly what we did.,So here's an empty bag of chipsnthat was lying on a table,,and we're going to turn that nbag of chips into a microphone,by filming it with a video camera,and analyzing the tiny motionsnthat sound waves create in it.,So here's the soundnthat we played in the room. 
 (Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb") 
 And this is a high-speed videonwe recorded of that bag of chips.,Again it's playing.,There's no chance you'll be ablento see anything going on in that video,just by looking at it,,but here's the sound we were ablento recover just by analyzing,the tiny motions in that video. 
 (Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb") 
 I call it -- Thank you.,(Applause),I call it the visual microphone.,We actually extract audio signalsnfrom video signals.,And just to give you a sensenof the scale of the motions here,,a pretty loud sound will cause that bagnof chips to move less than a micrometer.,That's one thousandth of a millimeter.,That's how tiny the motions arenthat we are now able to pull out,just by observing how lightnbounces off objects,and gets recorded by our cameras. 
 We can recover soundsnfrom other objects, like plants. 
 (Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb") 
 And we can recover speech as well.,So here's a person speaking in a room. 
 Voice: Mary had a little lambnwhose fleece was white as snow,,and everywhere that Mary went,nthat lamb was sure to go. 
 Michael Rubinstein: And here'snthat speech again recovered,just from this videonof that same bag of chips. 
 Voice: Mary had a little lambnwhose fleece was white as snow,,and everywhere that Mary went,nthat lamb was sure to go. 
 MR: We used "Mary Had a Little Lamb",because those are said to benthe first words,that Thomas Edison spoke ninto his phonograph in 1877.,It was one of the first soundnrecording devices in history.,It basically directed the soundsnonto a diaphragm,that vibrated a needle that essentiallynengraved the sound on tinfoil,that was wrapped around the cylinder. 
 Here's a demonstration of recording and nreplaying sound with Edison's phonograph. 
 (Video) Voice: Testing,ntesting, one two three.,Mary had a little lambnwhose fleece was white as snow,,and everywhere that Mary went,nthe lamb was sure to go.,Testing, testing, one two three.,Mary had a little lambnwhose fleece was white as snow,,and everywhere that Mary went,nthe lamb was sure to go. 
 MR: And now, 137 years later,,we're able to get soundnin pretty much similar quality,but by just watching objectsnvibrate to sound with cameras,,and we can even do that when the camera,is 15 feet away from the object,nbehind soundproof glass. 
 So this is the sound that we were nable to recover in that case. 
 Voice: Mary had a little lambnwhose fleece was white as snow,,and everywhere that Mary went,nthe lamb was sure to go. 
 MR: And of course, surveillance isnthe first application that comes to mind.,(Laughter),But it might actually be usefulnfor other things as well.,Maybe in the future, we'll be ablento use it, for example,,to recover sound across space,,because sound can't travelnin space, but light can. 
 We've only just begun exploring,other possible usesnfor this new technology.,It lets us see physical processesnthat we know are there,but that we've never been ablento see with our own eyes until now. 
 This is our team.,Everything I showed you todaynis a result of a collaboration,with this great groupnof people you see here,,and I encourage you and welcome younto check out our website,,try it out yourself,,and join us in exploringnthis world of tiny motions. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a lexicographer.,I make dictionaries.,And my job as a lexicographer,is to try to put all the words possible ninto the dictionary.,My job is not to decide what a word is;nthat is your job. 
 Everybody who speaks English ndecides together,what's a word and what's not a word.,Every language is just a group of peoplenwho agree to understand each other.,Now, sometimes when people are trying nto decide whether a word is good or bad,,they don't really have a good reason.,So they say something like,n"Because grammar!",(Laughter),I don't actually really care about grammarntoo much -- don't tell anybody. 
 But the word "grammar," actually,nthere are two kinds of grammar.,There's the kind of grammarnthat lives inside your brain,,and if you're a native nspeaker of a language,or a good speaker of a language,,it's the unconscious rules that you follownwhen you speak that language.,And this is what you learn whennyou learn a language as a child.,And here's an example:,This is a wug, right?,It's a wug.,Now there is another one.,There are two of these.,There are two ...,Audience: Wugs.,Erin McKean: Exactly! You know nhow to make the plural of wug.,That rule lives in your brain.,You never had to be taught this rule, nyou just understand it.,This is an experiment that was inventednby a professor at [Boston University],named Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.,So we've been talking about this nfor a long time. 
 Now, these kinds of natural rules nthat exist in your brain,,they're not like traffic laws,nthey're more like laws of nature.,And nobody has to remind you to obey na law of nature, right?,When you leave the house in the morning, nyour mom doesn't say,,"Hey, honey, I thinknit's going to be cold, take a hoodie,,don't forget to obey the law of gravity.",Nobody says this.,Now, there are other rules that are morenabout manners than they are about nature.,So you can think of a word as like a hat.,Once you know how hats work,,nobody has to tell you, n"Don't wear hats on your feet.",What they have to tell you is, n"Can you wear hats inside?,Who gets to wear a hat?,What are the kinds of hatsnyou get to wear?",Those are more of the second kind nof grammar,,which linguists often call usage, nas opposed to grammar. 
 Now, sometimes people use this kind of nrules-based grammar,to discourage people from making up words.,And I think that is, well, stupid.,So, for example, npeople are always telling you,,"Be creative, make new music, do art, ninvent things, science and technology.",But when it comes to nwords, they're like,,"Don't! No. Creativity stops right here,nwhippersnappers. Give it a rest.",(Laughter),But that makes no sense to me.,Words are great.nWe should have more of them.,I want you to makenas many new words as possible.,And I'm going to tell you six ways thatnyou can use to make new words in English. 
 The first way is the simplest way.,Basically, steal them from other nlanguages.,["Go rob other people"]n(Laughter),Linguists call this borrowing,,but we never give the words back ,nso I'm just going to be honest,and call it stealing.,We usually take words for things nthat we like, like delicious food.,We took "kumquat" from Chinese,nwe took "caramel" from French.,We also take words nfor cool things like "ninja," right?,We took that from Japanese,,which is kind of a cool trick because nninjas are hard to steal from.,(Laughter) 
 So another way that you ncan make words in English,is by squishing two nother English words together.,This is called compounding.,Words in English are like Lego:,If you use enough force, nyou can put any two of them together.,(Laughter),We do this all the time in English:,Words like "heartbroken," "bookworm," n"sandcastle" all are compounds.,So go ahead and make words liken"duckface," just don't make duckface.,(Laughter) 
 Another way that you can make words nin English is kind of like compounding,,but instead you use so much forcenwhen you squish the words together,that some parts fall off.,So these are blend words,,like "brunch" is a blend nof "breakfast" and "lunch.","Motel" is a blend of "motor" and "hotel.",Who here knew that "motel" nwas a blend word?,Yeah, that word is so old in English,that lots of people don't know that nthere are parts missing.,"Edutainment" is a blend nof "education" and "entertainment.",And of course, "electrocute" is anblend of "electric" and "execute.",(Laughter) 
 You can also make wordsnby changing how they operate.,This is called functional shift.,You take a word that acts nas one part of speech,,and you change it into another npart of speech.,Okay, who here knew that "friend"nhasn't always been a verb?,"Friend" used to be noun nand then we verbed it.,Almost any word in English can be verbed.,You can also take adjectives nand make them into nouns.,"Commercial" used to be an adjective nand now it's a noun.,And of course, you can "green" things. 
 Another way to make wordsnin English is back-formation.,You can take a word and you cannkind of squish it down a little bit.,So for example, in English we had the wordn"editor" before we had the word "edit.","Edit" was formed from "editor.",Sometimes these back-formations nsound a little silly:,Bulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle nand burglers burgle.,(Laughter) 
 Another way to make words in English,is to take the first letters of somethingnand squish them together.,So National Aeronautics and Space nAdministration becomes NASA.,And of course you can do this nwith anything, OMG! 
 So it doesn't matter how silly nthe words are.,They can be really good words of English.,"Absquatulate" is a perfectly ngood word of English.,"Mugwump" is a perfectly ngood word of English.,So the words don't have have to sound nnormal, they can sound really silly. 
 Why should you make words?,You should make words because every word,is a chance to express your idea and get nyour meaning across.,And new words grab people's attention.,They get people to focus on what nyou're saying,and that gives you a better chance to get nyour meaning across.,A lot of people non this stage today have said,,"In the future, you can do this,,you can help with this, you can nhelp us explore, you can help us invent.",You can make a new word right now.,English has no age limit.,Go ahead, start making words today,,send them to me, and I will put them nin my online dictionary, Wordnik.,Thank you so much.,(Applause)Guatemala is recovering fromna 36-year armed conflict.,A conflict that was foughtnduring the Cold War.,It was really just na small leftist insurgency,and a devastating response by the state.,What we have as a resultnis 200,000 civilian victims,,160,000 of thosenkilled in the communities:,small children, men, women, nthe elderly even.,And then we have nabout 40,000 others, the missing,,the ones we're still looking for today.,We call them the Desaparecidos. 
 Now, 83 percent of the victims nare Mayan victims,,victims that are the descendants,of the original inhabitants of nCentral America.,And only about 17 percent are of nEuropean descent.,But the most important thing here is that,the very people who are supposed to ndefend us, the police, the military,,are the ones that committednmost of the crimes. 
 Now the families,nthey want information.,They want to know what happened.,They want the bodies of their loved ones.,But most of all,nwhat they want is they want you,,they want everyone to knownthat their loved ones did nothing wrong. 
 Now, my case was that my fathernreceived death threats in 1980.,And we left.,We left Guatemala and we came here.,So I grew up in New York,,I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact,nand I went to New Utrecht High School,and I graduated from Brooklyn College.,The only thing was that,I really didn't know what nwas happening in Guatemala.,I didn't care for it; it was too painful.,But it wasn't till 1995 that I decidednto do something about it.,So I went back.,I went back to Guatemala, nto look for the bodies,,to understand what happenednand to look for part of myself as well. 
 The way we work is thatnwe give people information.,We talk to the family membersnand we let them choose.,We let them decide to tellnus the stories,,to tell us what they saw,,to tell us about their loved ones.,And even more important,,we let them choose tongive us a piece of themselves.,A piece, an essence, of who they are.,And that DNA is what we're ngoing to compare,to the DNA that comesnfrom the skeletons. 
 While we're doing that, though,nwe're looking for the bodies.,And these are skeletons by now,,most of these crimes nhappened 32 years ago.,When we find the grave,,we take out the dirt and eventually clean nthe body, document it, and exhume it.,We literally bring the nskeleton out of the ground. 
 Once we have those bodies, though,nwe take them back to the city, to our lab,,and we begin a process of tryingnto understand mainly two things:,One is how people died.,So here you see a gunshotnwound to the back of the head,or a machete wound, for example.,The other thing we want to understandnis who they are.,Whether it's a baby,,or an adult.,Whether it's a woman or a man.,But when we're donenwith that analysis,what we'll do is we'll take a small nfragment of the bone,and we'll extract DNA from it.,We'll take that DNA,and then we'll compare it with thenDNA of the families, of course. 
 The best way to explain this to younis by showing you two cases.,The first is the case nof the military diary.,Now this is a document that was smugglednout of somewhere in 1999.,And what you see therenis the state following individuals,,people that, like you, nwanted to change their country,,and they jotted everything down.,And one of the things that they wrote ndown is when they executed them.,Inside that yellow rectangle, nyou see a code,,it's a secret code: 300.,And then you see a date.,The 300 means "executed" and the date nmeans when they were executed.,Now that's going to comeninto play in a second.,What we did is we conductednan exhumation in 2003,,where we exhumed 220 bodiesnfrom 53 graves in a military base.,Grave 9, though, matched the familynof Sergio Saul Linares.,Now Sergio was a professornat the university.,He graduted from Iowa State University,and went back to Guatemalanto change his country.,And he was captured on nFebruary 23, 1984.,And if you can see there, he was nexecuted on March 29, 1984,,which was incredible.,We had the body, we had the family's ninformation and their DNA,,and now we have documentsnthat told us exactly what happened. 
 But most important is aboutntwo weeks later,,we go another hit, another match,from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro.,The DNA of that bodynalso matched the DNA of that family.,And then we noticednthat he was also in the diary.,But it was amazing to see that he was nalso executed on March 29, 1984.,So that led us to think, hmm, nhow many bodies were in the grave?,Six.,So then we said, how many peoplenwere executed on March 29, 1984?,That's right, six as well.,So we have Juan de Dios, Hugo,nMoises and Zoilo.,All of them executed on the same date, nall captured at different locations,and at different moments.,All put in that grave.,The only thing we needed nownwas the DNA of those four families,So we went and we looked for themnand we found them.,And we identified those six bodiesnand gave them back to the families. 
 The other case I want to tell you about,is that of a military base ncalled CREOMPAZ.,It actually means, "to believe in peace,"nbut the acronym really means,Regional Command Centernfor Peacekeeping Operations.,And this is where the Guatemalan militaryntrains peacekeepers from other countries,,the ones that serve with the U.N.,and go to countriesnlike Haiti and the Congo.,Well, we have testimony that said thatnwithin this military base,,there were bodies, there were graves.,So we went in there with a search warrantnand about two hours after we went in,,we found the first of 84 graves, na total of 533 bodies.,Now, if you think about that,,peacekeepers being trainednon top of bodies.,It's very ironic. 
 But the bodies -- face down, most of them,nhands tied behind their backs,,blindfolded, all types of trauma --,these were people who were defenselessnwho were being executed.,People that 533 families are looking for.,So we're going to focus on Grave 15.,Grave 15, what we noticed,nwas a grave full of women and children,,63 of them.,And that immediately made us think,,my goodness, where is therena case like this?,When I got to Guatemala in 1995,,I heard of a case of a massacrenthat happened on May 14, 1982,,where the army came in, killed the men,,and took the women and children nin helicopters to an unknown location.,Well, guess what?,The clothing from this grave matched the nclothing from the region,where these people were taken from,,where these women and children nwere taken from. 
 So we conducted some DNA analysis,nand guess what?,We identified Martina Rojas nand Manuel Chen.,Both of them disappeared in that case,nand now we could prove it.,We have physical evidence thatnproves that this happened,and that those people nwere taken to this base.,Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.,His mother went to the river to wash nclothes, and she left him with a neighbor.,That's when the army came,and that's when he was taken away in na helicopter and never seen again,until we found him in Grave 15. 
 So now with science, with archaeology, nwith anthropology, with genetics,,what we're doing is, we'rengiving a voice to the voiceless.,But we're doing more than that.,We're actually providing nevidence for trials,,like the genocide trial that happened nlast year in Guatemala,where General Ríos Montt was found guiltynof genocide and sentenced to 80 years. 
 So I came here to tell you todaynthat this is happening everywhere --,it's happening in Mexiconright in front of us today --,and we can't let it go on anymore.,We have to now come together and decide,that we're not going to have nany more missing.,So no more missing, guys.,Okay? No more missing. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So infectious diseases, right?,Infectious diseases nare still the main cause,of human suffering and death naround the world.,Every year, millions of people dienof diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,,around the world nand even in the United States.,Every year, thousands of Americansndie of seasonal flu. 
 Now of course, humans,nwe are creative. Right?,We have come up with ways to protectnourselves against these diseases.,We have drugs and vaccines.,And we're conscious --nwe learn from our experiences,and come up with creative solutions.,We used to think we're alone in this,nbut now we know we're not.,We're not the only medical doctors.,Now we know that there's a lot of animalsnout there that can do it too.,Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.,Not so much different from us,,they can use plantsnto treat their intestinal parasites.,But the last few decades have shown usnthat other animals can do it too:,elephants, porcupines,nsheep, goats, you name it.,And even more interesting than thatnis that recent discoveries are telling us,that insects and other little animals withnsmaller brains can use medication too. 
 The problem with infectious diseases,nas we all know,,is that pathogens continue to evolve,,and a lot of the drugsnthat we have developed,are losing their efficacy.,And therefore, there is this great neednto find new ways to discover drugs,that we can use against our diseases. 
 Now, I think that wenshould look at these animals,,and we can learn from themnhow to treat our own diseases.,As a biologist, I have been studyingnmonarch butterflies for the last 10 years.,Now, monarchs are extremely famousnfor their spectacular migrations,from the U.S. and Canadandown to Mexico every year,,where millions of them come together,,but it's not why I started studying them.,I study monarchs because they get sick.,They get sick like you.nThey get sick like me.,And I think what they doncan tell us a lot about drugs,that we can develop for humans. 
 Now, the parasitesnthat monarchs get infected with,are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha --na mouthful.,What they do is they produce spores,,millions of sporesnon the outside of the butterfly,that are shown as little specksnin between the scales of the butterfly.,And this is really detrimentalnto the monarch.,It shortens their lifespan,,it reduces their ability to fly,,it can even kill themnbefore they're even adults.,Very detrimental parasite. 
 As part of my job, I spend a lot of timenin the greenhouse growing plants,,and the reason for this is that monarchsnare extremely picky eaters.,They only eat milkweed as larvae.,Luckily, there are severalnspecies of milkweed that they can use,,and all these milkweedsnhave cardenolides in them.,These are chemicals that are toxic.,They're toxic to most animals,nbut not to monarchs.,In fact, monarchsncan take up the chemicals,,put it in their own bodies,nand it makes them toxic,against their predators, such as birds.,And what they do, then,nis advertise this toxicity,through their beautifulnwarning colorations,with this orange, black and white. 
 So what I did during my jobnis grow plants in the greenhouse,,different ones, different milkweeds.,Some were toxic, includingnthe tropical milkweed,,with very high concentrationsnof these cardenolides.,And some were not toxic.,And then I fed them to monarchs.,Some of the monarchs were healthy.nThey had no disease.,But some of the monarchs were sick,,and what I found is thatnsome of these milkweeds are medicinal,,meaning they reduce the disease symptomsnin the monarch butterflies,,meaning these monarchs can live longernwhen they are infected,when feeding on these medicinal plants. 
 And when I found this, I had this idea,,and a lot of people saidnit was a crazy idea,,but I thought, nwhat if monarchs can use this?,What if they can use these plantsnas their own form of medicine?,What if they can act as medical doctors? 
 So my team and Instarted doing experiments.,In the first types of experiments,,we had caterpillars,nand gave them a choice:,medicinal milkweed versusnnon-medicinal milkweed.,And then we measured how much they atenof each species over their lifetime.,And the result, as so often nin science, was boring:,Fifty percent of their food was medicinal.nFifty percent was not.,These caterpillars didn't donanything for their own welfare. 
 So then we moved on to adult butterflies,,and we started asking the question,whether it's the mothersnthat can medicate their offspring.,Can the mothers lay their eggsnon medicinal milkweed,that will make theirnfuture offspring less sick?,We have done these experiments nownover several years,,and always get the same results.,What we do is we putna monarch in a big cage,,a medicinal plant on one side,na non-medicinal plant on the other side,,and then we measure the number of eggsnthat the monarchs lay on each plant.,And what we find when we do thatnis always the same.,What we find is that the monarchsnstrongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.,In other words,nwhat these females are doing,is they're laying 68 percentnof their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.,Intriguingly, what they donis they actually transmit the parasites,when they're laying the eggs.,They cannot prevent this.,They can also not medicate themselves.,But what these experiments tell us,is that these monarchs, these mothers,ncan lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed,that will make theirnfuture offspring less sick. 
 Now, this is a reallynimportant discovery, I think,,not just because it tells usnsomething cool about nature,,but also because it may tell us somethingnmore about how we should find drugs.,Now, these are animals that are very small,and we tend to think of themnas very simple.,They have tiny little brains,,yet they can do thisnvery sophisticated medication.,Now, we know that even today,nmost of our drugs,derive from natural products,nincluding plants,,and in indigenous cultures,,traditional healers often looknat animals to find new drugs.,In this way, elephants have told usnhow to treat stomach upset,,and porcupines have told peoplenhow to treat bloody diarrhea.,What I think is important, nthough, is to move beyond,these large-brained mammalsnand give these guys more credit,,these simple animals, these insectsnthat we tend to think of,as very, very simplenwith tiny little brains.,The discovery that these animalsncan also use medication,opens up completely new avenues,,and I think that maybe one day,nwe will be treating human diseases,with drugs that were firstndiscovered by butterflies,,and I think that is an amazing opportunitynworth pursuing. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)What's the fastest growing threatnto Americans' health?,Cancer? Heart attacks? Diabetes?,The answer is actually none of these;,it's Alzheimer's disease.,Every 67 seconds,,someone in the United Statesnis diagnosed with Alzheimer's.,As the number of Alzheimer's patientsntriples by the year 2050,,caring for them, as well asnthe rest of the aging population,,will become an overwhelmingnsocietal challenge. 
 My family has experienced firsthand,the struggles of caringnfor an Alzheimer's patient.,Growing up in a familynwith three generations,,I've always been very closento my grandfather.,When I was four years old,,my grandfather and I nwere walking in a park in Japan,when he suddenly got lost.,It was one of the scariest momentsnI've ever experienced in my life,,and it was also the firstninstance that informed us,that my grandfathernhad Alzheimer's disease.,Over the past 12 years,nhis condition got worse and worse,,and his wandering in particularncaused my family a lot of stress.,My aunt, his primary caregiver,,really struggled to stay awake at nightnto keep an eye on him,,and even then often failednto catch him leaving the bed.,I became really concernednabout my aunt's well-being,as well as my grandfather's safety.,I searched extensively for a solutionnthat could help my family's problems,,but couldn't find one. 
 Then, one night about two years ago,,I was looking after my grandfathernand I saw him stepping out of the bed.,The moment his foot landed on the floor,,I thought, why don't I putna pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?,Once he stepped onto the floornand out of the bed,,the pressure sensor would detect annincrease in pressure caused by body weight,and then wirelessly send an audible alertnto the caregiver's smartphone.,That way, my aunt could sleepnmuch better at night,without having to worrynabout my grandfather's wandering. 
 So now I'd like to performna demonstration of this sock.,Could I please havenmy sock model on the stage?,Great.,So once the patientnsteps onto the floor --,(Ringing) --,an alert is sentnto the caregiver's smartphone. 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 Thank you, sock model. 
 So this is a drawingnof my preliminary design. 
 My desire to createna sensor-based technology,perhaps stemmed from my lifelong lovenfor sensors and technology.,When I was six years old,,an elderly family friendnfell down in the bathroom,and suffered severe injuries.,I became concernednabout my own grandparents,and decided to inventna smart bathroom system.,Motion sensors would be installedninside the tiles of bathroom floors,to detect the falls of elderly patientsnwhenever they fell down in the bathroom.,Since I was only six years old at the time,and I hadn't graduatednfrom kindergarten yet,,I didn't have the necessary resources and ntools to translate my idea into reality,,but nonetheless, my research experience,really implanted in me a firm desirento use sensors to help the elderly people.,I really believe that sensors can improventhe quality of life of the elderly. 
 When I laid out my plan, I realizednthat I faced three main challenges:,first, creating a sensor;,second, designing a circuit;,and third, coding a smartphone app.,This made me realize that my projectnwas actually much harder to realize,than I initially had thought it to be. 
 First, I had to create a wearable sensornthat was thin and flexible enough,to be worn comfortablynon the bottom of the patient's foot.,After extensive research and testingnof different materials like rubber,,which I realized was too thick to be wornnsnugly on the bottom of the foot,,I decided to print a film sensor,with electrically conductivenpressure-sensitive ink particles.,Once pressure is applied, the connectivitynbetween the particles increases.,Therefore, I could design a circuitnthat would measure pressure,by measuring electrical resistance. 
 Next, I had to designna wearable wireless circuit,,but wireless signal transmissionnconsumes lots of power,and requires heavy, bulky batteries.,Thankfully, I was able to find outnabout the Bluetooth low energy technology,,which consumes very little powernand can be driven by a coin-sized battery.,This prevented the systemnfrom dying in the middle of the night. 
 Lastly, I had to code a smartphone appnthat would essentially transform,the care-giver's smartphoneninto a remote monitor.,For this, I had to expand uponnmy knowledge of coding with Java and XCode,and I also had to learn about how to codenfor Bluetooth low energy devices,by watching YouTube tutorialsnand reading various textbooks. 
 Integrating these components, I was ablento successfully create two prototypes,,one in which the sensornis embedded inside a sock,,and another that'sna re-attachable sensor assembly,that can be adhered anywherenthat makes contact,with the bottom of the patient's foot.,I've tested the device on my grandfathernfor about a year now,,and it's had a 100 percent success rate,in detecting the over 900 nknown cases of his wandering.,Last summer, I was ablento beta test my device,at several residentialncare facilities in California,,and I'm currently incorporatingnthe feedback,to further improve the device ninto a marketable product.,Testing the device on a number of patients,made me realize that I needednto invent solutions,for people who didn't wantnto wear socks to sleep at night. 
 So sensor data, collectednon a vast number of patients,,can be useful for improving patient care,and also leading to a curenfor the disease, possibly.,For example, I'm currently examining,correlations between the frequencynof a patient's nightly wandering,and his or her daily activities and diet. 
 One thing I'll never forgetnis when my device first caught,my grandfather's wanderingnout of bed at night.,At that moment, I was really strucknby the power of technology,to change lives for the better.,People living happily and healthfully --,that's the world that I imagine. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)These dragons from deep timenare incredible creatures.,They're bizzarre,,they're beautiful,,and there's very littlenwe know about them. 
 These thoughts were goingnthrough my head,when I looked at the pages ofnmy first dinosaur book.,I was about five years old at the time,,and I decided there and then,that I would become a paleontologist.,Paleontology allowed me nto combine my love for animals,with my desire to travel to nfar-flung corners of the world. 
 And now, a few years later,nI've led several expeditions,to the ultimate far-flung corner non this planet, the Sahara.,I've worked in the Sahara becausenI've been on a quest,to uncover new remains ofna bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur,called Spinosaurus. 
 A few bones of this animalnhave been found,in the deserts of Egypt,and were described about 100 years agonby a German paleontologist.,Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bonesnwere destroyed in World War II.,So all we're left with are justna few drawings and notes. 
 From these drawings,,we know that this creature, which lived nabout 100 million years ago,,was very big,,it had tall spines on its back,nforming a magnificent sail,,and it had long, slender jaws, na bit like a crocodile,,with conical teeth,,that may have been used nto catch slippery prey, like fish.,But that was pretty much nall we knew,about this animal for the next 100 years. 
 My fieldwork took me to the border regionnbetween Morocco and Algeria,,a place called the Kem Kem.,It's a difficult place to work in.,You have to deal with sandstormsnand snakes and scorpions,,and it's very difficult to findngood fossils there.,But our hard work paid off.,We discovered many incredible specimens.,There's the largest dinosaur bone,that had ever been foundnin this part of the Sahara.,We found remains of giantnpredatory dinosaurs,,medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,,and seven or eight different kindsnof crocodile-like hunters. 
 These fossils were depositednin a river system.,The river system was also home nto a giant, car-sized coelacanth,,a monster sawfish,,and the skies over the river systemnwere filled with pterosaurs,,flying reptiles.,It was a pretty dangerous place,,not the kind of place where you'd wantnto travel to if you had a time machine. 
 So we're finding all these nincredible fossils of animals,that lived alongside Spinosaurus,,but Spinosaurus itself provednto be very elusive.,We were just finding bits and pieces,and I was hoping that we'd findna partial skeleton at some point. 
 Finally, very recently,,we were able to track down a dig site,where a local fossil hunter foundnseveral bones of Spinosaurus.,We returned to the site,nwe collected more bones.,And so after 100 years we finallynhad another partial skeleton,of this bizarre creature.,And we were able to reconstruct it. 
 We now know that nSpinosaurus had a head,a little bit like a crocodile,,very different from other npredatory dinosaurs,,very different from the T. rex.,But the really interesting informationncame from the rest of the skeleton.,We had long spines,,the spines forming the big sail.,We had leg bones, we had skull bones,,we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --,again, very unusual, no otherndinosaur has feet like this --,and we think they may have beennused to walk on soft sediment,,or maybe for paddling in the water.,We also looked at the finenmicrostructure of the bone,,the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,,and it turns out that they'renvery dense and compact.,Again, this is something we see in animalsnthat spend a lot of time in the water,,it's useful for buoyancy ncontrol in the water. 
 We C.T.-scanned all of our bonesnand built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.,And when we looked nat the digital skeleton,,we realized that yes, this wasna dinosaur unlike any other.,It's bigger than a T. rex,,and yes, the head has "fish-eating"nwritten all over it,,but really the entire skeleton hasn"water-loving" written all over it --,dense bone, paddle-like feet,nand the hind limbs are reduced in size,,and again, this is somethingnwe see in animals,that spend a substantial amount nof time in the water. 
 So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --,I'm looking at muscle attachmentsnand wrapping our dinosaur in skin --,we realize that we're dealingnwith a river monster,,a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,,the ruler of this ancient river of giants,,feeding on the many aquatic animalsnI showed you earlier on. 
 So that's really what makes thisnan incredible discovery.,It's a dinosaur like no other.,And some people told me, "Wow,nthis is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.,There are not many things leftnto discover in the world.",Well, I think nothing could be nfurther from the truth.,I think the Sahara's nstill full of treasures,,and when people tell me there arenno places left to explore,,I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter,nRoy Chapman Andrews,,and he said, "Always, there has beennan adventure just around the corner --,and the world is still full of corners.",That was true many decades ago,when Roy Chapman Andrewsnwrote these lines.,And it is still true today. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My students and Inwork on very tiny robots.,Now, you can think of thesenas robotic versions,of something that you're allnvery familiar with: an ant.,We all know that antsnand other insects at this size scale,can do some pretty incredible things.,We've all seen a group of ants,nor some version of that,,carting off your potato chipnat a picnic, for example. 
 But what are the real challengesnof engineering these ants?,Well, first of all, how do we getnthe capabilities of an ant,in a robot at the same size scale?,Well, first we need to figure outnhow to make them move,when they're so small.,We need mechanisms like legsnand efficient motors,in order to support that locomotion,,and we need the sensors,npower and control,in order to pull everything togethernin a semi-intelligent ant robot.,And finally, to makenthese things really functional,,we want a lot of them working togethernin order to do bigger things. 
 So I'll start with mobility.,Insects move around amazingly well.,This video is from UC Berkeley.,It shows a cockroach movingnover incredibly rough terrain,without tipping over,,and it's able to do this because its legsnare a combination of rigid materials,,which is what we traditionallynuse to make robots,,and soft materials.,Jumping is another really interesting waynto get around when you're very small.,So these insects store energy in a springnand release that really quickly,to get the high power they neednto jump out of water, for example. 
 So one of the bigncontributions from my lab,has been to combinenrigid and soft materials,in very, very small mechanisms.,So this jumping mechanismnis about four millimeters on a side,,so really tiny.,The hard material here is silicon,nand the soft material is silicone rubber.,And the basic idea is thatnwe're going to compress this,,store energy in the springs,nand then release it to jump.,So there's no motorsnon board this right now, no power.,This is actuated with a methodnthat we call in my lab,"graduate student with tweezers."n(Laughter),So what you'll see in the next video,is this guy doingnamazingly well for its jumps.,So this is Aaron, the graduate studentnin question, with the tweezers,,and what you see is this nfour-millimeter-sized mechanism,jumping almost 40 centimeters high.,That's almost 100 times its own length.,And it survives, bounces on the table,,it's incredibly robust, and of coursensurvives quite well until we lose it,because it's very tiny. 
 Ultimately, though, we wantnto add motors to this too,,and we have students in the labnworking on millimeter-sized motors,to eventually integrate ontonsmall, autonomous robots.,But in order to look at mobility andnlocomotion at this size scale to start,,we're cheating and using magnets.,So this shows what would eventuallynbe part of a micro-robot leg,,and you can see the silicone rubber joints,and there's an embedded magnetnthat's being moved around,by an external magnetic field. 
 So this leads to the robotnthat I showed you earlier.,The really interesting thingnthat this robot can help us figure out,is how insects move at this scale.,We have a really good modelnfor how everything,from a cockroach up to an elephant moves.,We all move in this nkind of bouncy way when we run.,But when I'm really small, nthe forces between my feet and the ground,are going to affect my locomotionna lot more than my mass,,which is what causes that bouncy motion.,So this guy doesn't work quite yet,,but we do have slightly larger versionsnthat do run around.,So this is about a centimeter cubed,na centimeter on a side, so very tiny,,and we've gotten this to runnabout 10 body lengths per second,,so 10 centimeters per second.,It's pretty quick for a little, small guy,,and that's really only limited nby our test setup.,But this gives you some ideanof how it works right now.,We can also make 3D-printed versions nof this that can climb over obstacles,,a lot like the cockroachnthat you saw earlier. 
 But ultimately we want to addneverything onboard the robot.,We want sensing, power, control,nactuation all together,,and not everythingnneeds to be bio-inspired.,So this robot's aboutnthe size of a Tic Tac.,And in this case, instead of magnetsnor muscles to move this around,,we use rockets.,So this is a micro-fabricatednenergetic material,,and we can create tiny pixels of this,,and we can put one of these pixelsnon the belly of this robot,,and this robot, then, is going to jumpnwhen it senses an increase in light. 
 So the next video is one of my favorites.,So you have this 300-milligram robot,jumping about eightncentimeters in the air.,It's only four by fournby seven millimeters in size.,And you'll see a big flashnat the beginning,when the energetic is set off,,and the robot tumbling through the air.,So there was that big flash,,and you can see the robotnjumping up through the air.,So there's no tethers on this,nno wires connecting to this.,Everything is onboard,nand it jumped in response,to the student just flicking onna desk lamp next to it. 
 So I think you can imaginenall the cool things that we could do,with robots that can run and crawlnand jump and roll at this size scale.,Imagine the rubble that you get after na natural disaster like an earthquake.,Imagine these small robotsnrunning through that rubble,to look for survivors.,Or imagine a lot of small robotsnrunning around a bridge,in order to inspect itnand make sure it's safe,so you don't get collapses like this,,which happened outside of nMinneapolis in 2007.,Or just imagine what you could do,if you had robots that couldnswim through your blood.,Right? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov.,Or they could operate without havingnto cut you open in the first place.,Or we could radically changenthe way we build things,if we have our tiny robotsnwork the same way that termites do,,and they build these incredibleneight-meter-high mounds,,effectively well ventilatednapartment buildings for other termites,in Africa and Australia. 
 So I think I've given younsome of the possibilities,of what we can do with these small robots.,And we've made some advances so far,nbut there's still a long way to go,,and hopefully some of youncan contribute to that destination. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.,I was working at the ACLUnas the organization's science advisor.,I really, really loved my job,,but I was having one of those days,where I was feelingnjust a little bit discouraged. 
 So I wandered down the hallwaynto my colleague Chris Hansen's office.,Chris had been at the ACLUnfor more than 30 years,,so he had deep institutionalnknowledge and insights. 
 I explained to Chrisnthat I was feeling a little bit stuck.,I had been investigatingna number of issues,at the intersection of sciencenand civil liberties -- super interesting.,But I wanted the ACLU to engagenthese issues in a much bigger way,,in a way that could reallynmake a difference. 
 So Chris cut rightnto the chase, and he says,,"Well, of all the issues you've beennlooking at, what are the top five?" 
 "Well, there's genetic discrimination,,and reproductive technologies,,and biobanking, and ...,oh, there's this really cool issue,,functional MRI and using itnfor lie detection, and ...,oh, and of course, there's gene patents." 
 "Gene patents?" 
 "Yes, you know, patents on human genes." 
 "No!,You're telling me that the US government,has been issuing patentsnon part of the human body?,That can't be right." 
 I went back to my officenand sent Chris three articles.,And 20 minutes later,nhe came bursting in my office.,"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,,but he knew almost nothingnabout patent law,and certainly nothing about genetics.,I knew something about genetics,nbut I wasn't even a lawyer,,let alone a patent lawyer.,So clearly we had a lot to learnnbefore we could file a lawsuit. 
 First, we needed to understandnexactly what was patented,when someone patented a gene.,Gene patents typically containndozens of claims,,but the most controversial of thesenare to so-called "isolated DNA" --,namely, a piece of DNAnthat has been removed from a cell. 
 Gene patent proponents say,,"See? We didn't patentnthe gene in your body,,we patented an isolated gene.",And that's true,,but the problem is that any usenof the gene requires that it be isolated.,And the patents weren't justnto a particular gene that they isolated,,but on every possiblenversion of that gene. 
 So what does that mean? 
 That means that you can't givenyour gene to your doctor,and ask him or her to look at it,,say, to see if it has any mutations,,without permission of the patent holder.,It also means that the patent holdernhas the right to stop anyone,from using that genenin research or clinical testing.,Allowing patent holders,,often private companies,,to lock up stretches of the human genomenwas harming patients. 
 Consider Abigail,,a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,,a serious heart condition that,nif left untreated,,can result in sudden death.,The company that obtained a patent on twongenes associated with this condition,developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.,But then they went bankruptnand they never offered it.,So another lab tried to offer the test,,but the company that held the patentsnthreatened to sue the lab,for patent infringement.,So as a result,,for 2 years, no test was available.,During that time,,Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT. 
 Gene patents clearly were a problemnand were harming patients.,But was there a waynwe could challenge them? 
 Turns out that the Supreme Court,has made clearnthrough a long line of cases,,that certain thingsnare not patent eligible.,You can't patent products of nature --,the air, the water, minerals,nelements of the periodic table.,And you can't patent laws of nature --,the law of gravity, E = mc2.,These things are just too fundamentalnand must remain free to all,and reserved exclusively to none. 
 It seemed to us that DNA,,the most fundamental structure of life,,that codes for the productionnof all of our proteins,,is both a product of naturenand a law of nature,,regardless of whether it's in our bodies,or sitting in the bottom of a test tube. 
 As we delved into this issue,,we traveled all over the countrynto speak with many different experts --,scientists, medical professionals,nlawyers, patent lawyers.,Most of them agreed that we were rightnas a matter of policy,,and, at least in theory,nas a matter of law.,All of them thought,our chances of winningna gene-patent challenge,were about zero. 
 Why is that?,Well, the patent officenhad been issuing these patents,for more than 20 years.,There were literally thousandsnof patents on human genes.,The patent bar was deeplynentrenched in the status quo,,the biotech industry had grown upnaround this practice,,and legislation to ban gene patentsnhad been introduced,year after year in Congress,,and had gone absolutely nowhere.,So the bottom line:,courts just weren't going to be willingnto overturn these patents. 
 Now, neither Chris nor I were the typento shy away from a challenge,,and hearing, "Being rightnjust isn't enough,",seemed all the more reasonnto take on this fight.,So we set out to build our case. 
 Now, patent cases tend to be:nCompany A sues Company B,over some really narrow,nobscure technical issue.,We weren't really interestednin that kind of case,,and we thought this casenwas much bigger than that.,This was about scientific freedom,nmedical progress,,the rights of patients.,So we decided we were goingnto develop a case,that was not likenyour typical patent case --,more like a civil rights case. 
 We set out to identifyna gene-patent holder,that was vigorously enforcing its patents,and then to organize a broad coalitionnof plaintiffs and experts,that could tell the court,about all the ways that these patentsnwere harming patients and innovation. 
 We found the prime candidatento sue in Myriad Genetics,,a company that's basednin Salt Lake City, Utah.,Myriad held patents on two genes,,the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.,Women with certain mutationsnalong these genes,are considered to benat a significantly increased risk,of developing breast and ovarian cancer.,Myriad had used its patents to maintain,a complete monopoly on BRCA testingnin the United States.,It had forced multiple labsnthat were offering BRCA testing to stop.,It charged a lot of money for its test --,over 3,000 dollars.,It had stopped sharing its clinical data,with the internationalnscientific community.,And perhaps worst of all,,for a period of several years,,Myriad refused to update its testnto include additional mutations,that had been identifiednby a team of researchers in France. 
 It has been estimatednthat during that period,,for several years,,as many as 12 percent of womennundergoing testing,received the wrong answer --,a negative test resultnthat should have been positive. 
 This is Kathleen Maxian.,Kathleen's sister Eileenndeveloped breast cancer at age 40,and she was tested by Myriad.,The test was negative.,The family was relieved.,That meant that Eileen's cancernmost likely didn't run in the family,,and that other members of her familyndidn't need to be tested.,But two years later,,Kathleen was diagnosednwith advanced-stage ovarian cancer.,It turned out that Kathleen's sisternwas among the 12 percent,who received a false-negative test result.,Had Eileen received the proper result,,Kathleen would have then been tested,,and her ovarian cancerncould have been prevented. 
 Once we settled on Myriad,,we then had to form a coalitionnof plaintiffs and experts,that could illuminate these problems.,We ended up with 20nhighly committed plaintiffs:,genetic counselors,,geneticists who had receivedncease and desist letters,,advocacy organizations,,four major scientific organizationsnthat collectively represented,more than 150,000 scientistsnand medical professionals,,and individual women who eitherncouldn't afford Myriad's test,,or who wanted to obtainna second opinion but could not,,as a result of the patents. 
 One of the major challengesnwe had in preparing the case,was figuring out how bestnto communicate the science.,So in order to argue that what Myriad didnwas not an invention,,and that isolated BRCA genesnwere products of nature,,we had to explain a couplenof basic concepts, like:,What's a gene? What's DNA?,How is DNA isolated,nand why isn't that an invention? 
 We spent hours and hoursnwith our plaintiffs and experts,,trying to come up with waysnof explaining these concepts,simply yet accurately.,And we ended up relying heavilynon the use of metaphors,,like gold. 
 So isolating DNA --,it's like extracting gold from a mountain,or taking it out of a stream bed.,You might be able to patentnthe process for mining the gold,,but you can't patent the gold itself.,It might've taken a lotnof hard work and effort,to dig the gold out of the mountain;,you still can't patent it,nit's still gold.,And the gold, once it's extracted,,can clearly be usednfor all sorts of things,that it couldn't be usednfor when it was in the mountain;,you can make jewelrynout of it for example --,still can't patent the gold,nit's still gold. 
 So now it's 2009,nand we're ready to file our case.,We filed in federal courtnin the Southern District of New York,,and the case was randomly assignednto Judge Robert Sweet.,In March 2010, Judge Sweetnissued his opinion --,152 pages --,and a complete victory for our side. 
 In reading the opinion,,we could not get over how eloquentlynhe described the science in the case.,I mean, our brief --nit was pretty good,,but not this good.,How did he develop such a deepnunderstanding of this issue,in such a short time?,We just could not comprehendnhow this had happened.,So it turned out,,Judge Sweet's clerknworking for him at the time,,was not just a lawyer --,he was a scientist.,He was not just a scientist --,he had a PhD in molecular biology. 
 (Laughter) 
 What an incredible stroke of luck! 
 Myriad then appealed,to the US Court of Appealsnfor the Federal Circuit.,And here things got really interesting. 
 First, in a pivotal moment of this case,,the US government switched sides. 
 So in the district court the governmentnsubmitted a brief on Myriad's side.,But now in direct oppositionnto its own patent office,,the US government files a briefnthat states that is has,reconsidered this issuenin light of the district court's opinion,,and has concluded that isolated DNAnis not patent eligible.,This was a really big deal,,totally unexpected. 
 The Court of Appealsnfor the Federal Circuit,hears all patent cases,,and it has a reputation for beingnvery, very pro-patent.,So even with this remarkable development,,we expected to lose.,And we did.,Sort of.,Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.,But the two judges who ruled against us,,did so for completely different reasons.,The first one, Judge Lourie,,made up his own novel,nbiological theory --,totally wrong. 
 (Laughter) 
 He decided Myriad had createdna new chemical --,made absolutely no sense.,Myriad didn't even argue this,nso it came out of the blue.,The other, Judge Moore,,said she basically agreed with usnthat isolated DNA is a product of nature.,But she's like, "I don't wantnto shake up the biotech industry.",The third, Judge Bryson,,agreed with us. 
 So now we sought reviewnby the Supreme Court.,And when you petition the Supreme Court,,you have to present a questionnthat you want the Court to answer.,Usually these questions take the formnof a super-long paragraph,,like a whole page longnwith lots and lots of clauses,,"wherein this" and "therefore that.",We submitted perhapsnthe shortest question presented ever.,Four words:,Are human genes patentable? 
 Now when Chris first asked menwhat I thought of these words,,I said, "Well, I don't know.,I think you have to say,n'Is isolated DNA patentable?'" 
 "Nope.,I want the justices to haventhe very same reaction that I had,when you brought this issuento me seven years ago." 
 Well, I certainly couldn'tnargue with that. 
 The Supreme Court only hearsnabout one percent,of the cases that it receives,,and it agreed to hear ours.,The day of the oral argument arrives,nand it was really, really exciting --,long line of people outside,,people had been standing in linensince 2:30 in the morning,to try to get into the courthouse.,Two breast cancer organizations,,Breast Cancer Action and FORCE,,had organized a demonstrationnon the courthouse steps. 
 Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway,,moments before he was to walk in and argue,the most important case of his career.,I was clearly more nervous than he was.,But any remaining panic subsidednas I walked into the courtroom,and looked aroundnat a sea of friendly faces:,our individual women clients,who had shared theirndeeply personal stories,,the geneticists who had taken huge chunksnof time out of their busy careers,to dedicate themselves to this fight,and representatives from a diverse array,of medical, patient advocacy,,environmental and religious organizations,,who had submitted friend of the courtnbriefs in the case. 
 Also in the room were three leadersnof the Human Genome Project,,including the co-discoverernof DNA himself,,James Watson,,who had submitted a brief to the court,,where he referrednto gene patenting as "lunacy." 
 (Laughter) 
 The diversity of the communitiesnrepresented in this room,and the contributions each had madento make this day a reality,spoke volumes to what was at stake. 
 The argument itself was riveting.,Chris argued brilliantly.,But for me,,the most thrilling aspect was watchingnthe Supreme Court justices grapple,with isolated DNA,,through a series of colorful analogiesnand feisty exchanges,,very much the same waynas our legal team had done,for the past seven years.,Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA,to extracting a medicinal plantnfrom the Amazon.,Justice Roberts distinguished itnfrom carving a baseball bat from a tree.,And in one of my absolutelynfavorite moments,,Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNAnto be "just nature sitting there." 
 (Laughter) 
 We felt pretty confidentnleaving the courtroom that day,,but I could never havenanticipated the outcome:,nine to zero. 
 "A naturally occurring DNA segmentnis a product of nature,,and not patent-eligible merely becausenit has been isolated.,And furthermore,,Myriad did not create anything." 
 Within 24 hours of the decision,,five labs had announced,that they would begin to offer testingnfor the BRCA genes.,Some of them promised to offer the testsnat a lower price than Myriad's.,Some promised to providena more comprehensive test,than the one Myriad was offering. 
 But of course the decisionngoes far beyond Myriad.,It ends a 25-year practicenof allowing patents on human genes,in the United States.,It clears a significant barriernto biomedical discovery and innovation.,And it helps to ensure that patientsnlike Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen,have access to the tests that they need. 
 A few weeks after the courtnissued its decision,,I received a small package in the mail.,It was from Bob Cook-Deegan,,a professor at Duke University,and one the very first peoplenChris and I went to visit,when we started to considernwhether to bring this case.,I opened it up to findna small stuffed animal. 
 (Laughter) 
 We took a big risk in taking this case.,Part of what gave us the couragento take that risk,was knowing that we were doingnthe right thing.,The process took nearly eight yearsnfrom the start to finish,,with many twists and turns along the way.,A little luck certainly helped,,but it was the communitiesnthat we bridged,,the alliances that we created,,that made pigs fly. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was on a long road trip this summer,,and I was havingna wonderful time listening,to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson'sn"The Warmth of Other Suns.",It documents six million black folksnfleeing the South from 1915 to 1970,looking for a respitenfrom all the brutality,and trying to get to a betternopportunity up North,,and it was filled with storiesnof the resilience and the brilliance,of African-Americans,,and it was also really hard to hearnall the stories of the horrors,and the humility,nand all the humiliations.,It was especially hard to hearnabout the beatings and the burnings,and the lynchings of black men.,And I said, "You know,nthis is a little deep.,I need a break. I'm goingnto turn on the radio.",I turned it on, and there it was:,Ferguson, Missouri,,Michael Brown,,18-year-old black man,,unarmed, shot by a white police officer,nlaid on the ground dead,,blood running for four hours,while his grandmother and little childrennand his neighbors watched in horror,,and I thought,,here it is again.,This violence, this brutalitynagainst black men,has been going on for centuries.,I mean, it's the same story.nIt's just different names.,It could have been Amadou Diallo.,It could have been Sean Bell.,It could have been Oscar Grant.,It could have been Trayvon Martin. 
 This violence, this brutality,,is really something that's partnof our national psyche.,It's part of our collective history.,What are we going to do about it?,You know that part of us that stillncrosses the street,,locks the doors,,clutches the purses,,when we see young black men?,That part. 
 I mean, I know we're notnshooting people down in the street,,but I'm saying that the samenstereotypes and prejudices,that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents,are in us.,We've been schooled in them as well.,I believe that we can stopnthese types of incidents,,these Fergusons from happening,,by looking withinnand being willing to change ourselves. 
 So I have a call to action for you.,There are three things that I wantnto offer us today to think about,as ways to stop Fergusonnfrom happening again;,three things that I think will help us,reform our images of young black men;,three things that I'm hopingnwill not only protect them,but will open the worldnso that they can thrive.,Can you imagine that?,Can you imagine our countrynembracing young black men,,seeing them as part of our future,ngiving them that kind of openness,,that kind of grace we givento people we love?,How much better would our lives be?nHow much better would our country be? 
 Let me just start with number one.,We gotta get out of denial.,Stop trying to be good people.,We need real people.,You know, I do a lot of diversity work,,and people will come up to menat the beginning of the workshop.,They're like, "Oh, Ms. Diversity Lady,nwe're so glad you're here" --,(Laughter) --,"but we don't have a biased bone nin our body.",And I'm like, "Really?,Because I do this work every day,nand I see all my biases." 
 I mean, not too long ago, I was on a plane,and I heard the voice of a womannpilot coming over the P.A. system,,and I was just so excited, so thrilled.,I was like, "Yes, women,nwe are rocking it.,We are now in the stratosphere.",It was all good, and then it startedngetting turbulent and bumpy,,and I was like,,"I hope she can drive.",(Laughter),I know. Right.,But it's not even likenI knew that was a bias,until I was coming back on the other legnand there's always a guy driving,and it's often turbulent and bumpy,,and I've never questionednthe confidence of the male driver.,The pilot is good.,Now, here's the problem.,If you ask me explicitly,nI would say, "Female pilot: awesome.",But it appears that when things get funkynand a little troublesome, a little risky,,I lean on a bias that I didn'tneven know that I had.,You know, fast-moving planes in the sky,,I want a guy.,That's my default.,Men are my default.,Who is your default?,Who do you trust?,Who are you afraid of?,Who do you implicitly feel connected to?,Who do you run away from? 
 I'm going to tell younwhat we have learned.,The implicit association test,nwhich measures unconscious bias,,you can go online and take it.,Five million people have taken it.,Turns out, our default is white.nWe like white people.,We prefer white. What do I mean by that?,When people are shown images nof black men and white men,,we are more quickly able to associate,that picture with a positive word,nthat white person with a positive word,,than we are when we are ntrying to associate,positive with a black face,nand vice versa.,When we see a black face,,it is easier for us to connectnblack with negative,than it is white with negative.,Seventy percent of white peoplentaking that test prefer white.,Fifty percent of black peoplentaking that test prefer white.,You see, we were all outsidenwhen the contamination came down. 
 What do we do about the factnthat our brain automatically associates?,You know, one of the thingsnthat you probably are thinking about,,and you're probably like, you know what,,I'm just going to double downnon my color blindness.,Yes, I'm going to recommit to that.,I'm going to suggest to you, no.,We've gone about as far as we can gontrying to make a difference,trying to not see color.,The problem was never that we saw color.nIt was what we did when we saw the color.,It's a false ideal.,And while we're busy npretending not to see,,we are not being aware of the waysnin which racial difference,is changing people's possibilities,nthat's keeping them from thriving,,and sometimes it's causing themnan early death. 
 So in fact, what the scientistsnare telling us is, no way.,Don't even think about color blindness.,In fact, what they're suggesting is,,stare at awesome black people.,(Laughter),Look at them directly in their facesnand memorize them,,because when we looknat awesome folks who are black,,it helps to dissociate,the association that happensnautomatically in our brain.,Why do you think I'm showing younthese beautiful black men behind me?,There were so many, I had to cut them.,Okay, so here's the thing:,I'm trying to reset your automaticnassociations about who black men are.,I'm trying to remind you,that young black menngrow up to be amazing human beings,who have changed our livesnand made them better. 
 So here's the thing.,The other possibility in science,,and it's only temporarily changingnour automatic assumptions,,but one thing we know,is that if you take a white personnwho is odious that you know,,and stick it up next to a person of color,,a black person, who is fabulous,,then that sometimes actuallyncauses us to disassociate too.,So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell.,Just stare at them, right? (Laughter),But these are the things.nSo go looking for your bias.,Please, please, just get out of denialnand go looking for disconfirming data,that will prove that in factnyour old stereotypes are wrong. 
 Okay, so that's number one: number two,,what I'm going to say is move towardnyoung black men instead of away from them.,It's not the hardest thing to do,,but it's also one of these things,where you have to be conscious nand intentional about it.,You know, I was in a Wall Street area none time several years ago,when I was with a colleague of mine,nand she's really wonderful,and she does diversity work with menand she's a woman of color, she's Korean.,And we were outside,nit was late at night,,and we were sort of wondering wherenwe were going, we were lost.,And I saw this person across the street,nand I was thinking, "Oh great, black guy.",I was going toward himnwithout even thinking about it.,And she was like,n"Oh, that's interesting.",The guy across the street,nhe was a black guy.,I think black guys generallynknow where they're going.,I don't know why exactly I think that,nbut that's what I think.,So she was saying, "Oh, younwere going, 'Yay, a black guy'?",She said, "I was going,n'Ooh, a black guy.'",Other direction. Same need,nsame guy, same clothes,,same time, same street,ndifferent reaction.,And she said, "I feel so bad.nI'm a diversity consultant.,I did the black guy thing.nI'm a woman of color. Oh my God!",And I said, "You know what? Please.nWe really need to relax about this.",I mean, you've got to realizenI go way back with black guys.,(Laughter),My dad is a black guy.nYou see what I'm saying?,I've got a 6'5" black guy son.nI was married to a black guy.,My black guy thingnis so wide and so deep,that I can pretty much sortnand figure out who that black guy is,,and he was my black guy.,He said, "Yes, ladies, I knownwhere you're going. I'll take you there." 
 You know, biases are the storiesnwe make up about people,before we know who they actually are.,But how are we going to know who they are,when we've been told to avoidnand be afraid of them?,So I'm going to tell younto walk toward your discomfort.,And I'm not asking younto take any crazy risks.,I'm saying, just do an inventory,,expand your socialnand professional circles.,Who's in your circle?,Who's missing?,How many authentic relationships,do you have with young black people,nfolks, men, women?,Or any other major differencenfrom who you are,and how you roll, so to speak?,Because, you know what?nJust look around your periphery.,There may be somebody at work,nin your classroom,,in your house of worship, somewhere,nthere's some black young guy there.,And you're nice. You say hi.,I'm saying go deeper, closer, further,nand build the kinds of relationships,,the kinds of friendships that actuallyncause you to see the holistic person,and to really go against the stereotypes.,I know some of you are out there, 
 I know because I have some whitenfriends in particular that will say,,"You have no idea how awkward I am.,Like, I don't think thisnis going to work for me.,I'm sure I'm going to blow this.",Okay, maybe, but this thing is not nabout perfection. It's about connection.,And you're not going to get comfortablenbefore you get uncomfortable.,I mean, you just have to do it.,And young black men, what I'm saying is,if someone comes your way, genuinelynand authentically, take the invitation.,Not everyone is out to get you.,Go looking for those peoplenwho can see your humanity.,You know, it's the empathynand the compassion,that comes out of having relationshipsnwith people who are different from you.,Something really powerfulnand beautiful happens:,you start to realize that they are you,,that they are part of you,nthat they are you in your family,,and then we cease to be bystanders,and we become actors,nwe become advocates,,and we become allies.,So go away from your comfortninto a bigger, brighter thing,,because that is how we will stopnanother Ferguson from happening.,That's how we create a community,where everybody, especiallynyoung black men, can thrive. 
 So this last thing is going to be harder,,and I know it, but I'm just goingnto put it out there anyway.,When we see something, we have to haventhe courage to say something,,even to the people we love.,You know, it's holidaysnand it's going to be a time,when we're sitting around the tablenand having a good time.,Many of us, anyways, will be in holidays,,and you've got to listen tonthe conversations around the table.,You start to say things like,n"Grandma's a bigot.",(Laughter),"Uncle Joe is racist.",And you know, we love Grandmanand we love Uncle Joe. We do.,We know they're good people,nbut what they're saying is wrong.,And we need to be able to say something,nbecause you know who else is at the table?,The children are at the table.,And we wonder why these biases don't die,nand move from generation to generation?,Because we're not saying anything.,We've got to be willing to say, "Grandma,nwe don't call people that anymore.","Uncle Joe, it isn't truenthat he deserved that.,No one deserves that.",And we've got to be willing,to not shelter our childrennfrom the ugliness of racism,when black parents don'tnhave the luxury to do so,,especially those who have nyoung black sons.,We've got to take nour lovely darlings, our future,,and we've got to tell them we have nan amazing country with incredible ideals,,we have worked incredibly hard,nand we have made some progress,,but we are not done.,We still have in us this old stuff,about superiority and it is causing us,to embed those furtherninto our institutions,and our society and generations,,and it is making for despair,and disparities and a devastatingndevaluing of young black men.,We still struggle, you have to tell them,,with seeing both the color,and the character of young black men,,but that you, and you expect them,,to be part of the forces of changenin this society,that will stand against injusticenand is willing, above all other things,,to make a society where young black men ncan be seen for all of who they are. 
 So many amazing black men,,those who are the most amazingnstatesmen that have ever lived,,brave soldiers,,awesome, hardworking laborers.,These are people whonare powerful preachers.,They are incredible scientistsnand artists and writers.,They are dynamic comedians.,They are doting grandpas,,caring sons.,They are strong fathers,,and they are young mennwith dreams of their own. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How many people here have heard of PMS?,Everybody, right?,Everyone knows that womenngo a little crazy,right before they get their period,,that the menstrual cycle throws themnonto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster,of irrationality and irritability.,There's a general assumption,that fluctuations in reproductive hormonesncause extreme emotions,and that the great majority of womennare affected by this.,Well, I am here to tell younthat scientific evidence says,neither of those assumptions is true.,I'm here to give you nthe good news about PMS. 
 But first, let's take a looknat how firmly the idea of PMS,is entrenched in American culture.,If you examine newspapernor magazine articles,,you'll see how widely assumed it isnthat everyone gets PMS.,In an article in the magazine Redbookntitled "You: PMS Free,",readers were informed that between 80 nto 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.,L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers,that 40 to 50 percent of womennsuffer from PMS,,and that it plays a major rolenin women's mental and physical health,,and a couple of years ago,neven the Wall Street Journal,ran an article on calciumnas a treatment for PMS,,asking its female readers,,"Do you turn into a witch every month?" 
 From all these articles, you would thinknthere must be a mountain of research,verifying the widespread nature of PMS.,However, after five decades of research,,there's no strong consensusnon the definition, the cause,,the treatment, or even nthe existence of PMS.,As most commonly defined by psychologists,,PMS involves negative behavioral,ncognitive and physical symptoms,from the time of ovulationnto menstruation.,But here's where it gets tricky.,Over 150 different symptomsnhave been used to diagnose PMS,,and here are just a few of those. 
 Now, I want to be clear here.,I'm not saying women don't getnsome of these symptoms.,What I'm saying is thatngetting some of these symptoms,doesn't amount to a mental disorder,,and when psychologistsncome up with a disorder,that's so vaguely defined,,the label eventually becomes meaningless.,With a list of symptomsnthis long and wide,,I could have PMS, you could have PMS,,the guy in the third row herencould have PMS,,my dog could have PMS.n(Laughter),Some researchers saidnyou had to have five symptoms.,Some said three.,Other researchers said that symptomsnwere only meaningful,if they were highly disturbing to you,,but others said minor symptomsnwere just as important.,For many years, becausenthere was no standardization,in the definition of PMS,,when psychologists triednto report prevalence rates,,their estimates rangednfrom five percent of women,to 97 percent of women,,so at the same time almost no onenand almost everyone had PMS. 
 Overall, the weaknesses in the methodsnof research on PMS have been considerable.,First, many studies asked womennto report their symptoms retrospectively,,looking to the past and relying on memory,,which is known to inflate reporting of PMS,compared to what's callednprospective reporting,,which involves keepingna daily log of symptoms,for at least two months in a row.,Many studies also exclusively focusednon white, middle-class women,,which makes it problematicnto apply study findings to all women.,We know there's a strongncultural component to the belief in PMS,because it's nearly unheard ofnoutside of Western nations.,Third, many studies failednto use control groups.,If we want to understandnthe specific characteristics,of women who have PMS,,we need to be able to compare themnto women who don't have PMS.,And finally, many different typesnof questionnaires were used,to diagnose PMS, focusingnon different symptoms,,symptom duration and severity.,To do reliable research on any condition,,scientists must agreenon the specific characteristics,that make up that condition,so they're all talkingnabout the same thing,,and with PMS, this has not been the case. 
 However, in 1994,,the Diagnostic and Statistical Manualnof Mental Disorders,,known as the DSM, thankfully --,it's also the manualnfor mental health professionals --,they redefined PMS as PMDD,,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.,And dysphoria refers tona feeling of agitation or unease.,And according to these new DSM guidelines,,in most menstrual cycles in the last year,,at least five of 11 possible symptoms,must appear in the weeknbefore menstruation starts;,the symptoms must improvenonce menstruation has begun;,and the symptoms must be absentnthe week after menstruation has ended.,One of these symptoms must comenfrom this list of four:,marked mood swings, irritability,nanxiety, or depression.,The other symptoms could comenfrom the first slide,or from those on the second slide,,including symptoms likenfeeling out of control,and changes in sleep or appetite.,The DSM also required nownthat the symptoms,should be associated withnclinically significant distress --,there should be some kindnof disturbance in work,or school or social relationships --,and that symptoms and symptom severitynshould now be documented,by keeping a daily lognfor at least two cycles in a row.,And finally, the DSM required thatnthe emotional disturbance,should be more than simply an exacerbationnof an already existing disorder.,So scientifically speaking,nthis is an improvement.,We now have a limited number of symptoms,,and a high impact on functioningnthat's required,,and the reporting and timing of symptomsnhave both become very specific.,Well, using this criteria,and looking at most recent studies,,we see that on average,,three to eight percent of womennsuffer from PMDD.,Not all women, not most women,,not the majority of women,nnot even a lot of women:,three to eight percent.,For everyone else, variablesnlike stressful events or happy occasions,or even day of the week,are more powerful predictors of moodnthan time of the month,,and this is the informationnthe scientific community has had,since the 1990s.,In 2002, my colleagues and Inpublished an article,describing the PMS and PMDD research,,and several similar articles have appearednin psychology journals.,The questions is, why hasn't thisninformation trickled down to the public?,Why do these myths persist? 
 Well, certainly the onslaughtnof messages that women receive,from books, TV, movies, the Internet,nthat everyone gets PMS,go a long way in convincing themnit must be true.,Research tells us that the morena woman believes that everyone gets PMS,,the more likely she isnto erroneously report that she has it.,Let me tell you what I meannby "erroneously.",You might ask her, "Do you have PMS?",and she says yes,,but then, when you have her nkeep a daily log,of psychological symptoms for two months,,no correlation is foundnbetween her symptoms,and time of the month. 
 Another reason fornthe persistence of the PMS myth,has to do with the narrow boundariesnof the feminine role.,Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler,have suggested thatntaking on the label of PMS,allows women to express emotions thatnwould otherwise be considered unladylike.,The near universal definitionnof a good woman,is one who is happy, loving,ncaring for others,,and taking great satisfactionnfrom that role.,Well, PMS has become a permission slipnto be angry, complain, be irritated,,without losing the title of good woman.,We know that the variablesnin a woman's environment,are much more likely to cause hernto be angry than her hormones,,but when she attributes anger to hormones,,she's absolvednof responsibility or criticism.,"Oh, that's not who she is.nIt's out of her control.",And while this can be a useful tool,nit serves to invalidate women's emotions.,When people respond to a woman's anger,with the thought, "Oh,nit's just that time of the month,",her ability to be taken seriouslynor effect change is severely limited. 
 So who else benefits from the myth of PMS?,Well, I can tell you that treating PMS,has become a profitable, nthriving industry.,Amazon.com currently offersnover 1,900 books on PMS treatment.,A quick Google searchnwill bring up a cornucopia,of clinics, workshops and seminars.,Reputable Internet sourcesnof medical information,like WebMD or the Mayo Clinicnlist PMS as a known disorder.,It's not a known disorder,nbut they list it.,And they also list the medications thatnphysicians have prescribed to treat it,,like anti-depressants or hormones.,Interestingly, though, both websitesnsay that the success of medication,in treating PMS symptomsnvary from woman to woman.,Well, that doesn't make sense.,If you've got a distinct disordernwith a distinct cause,,which PMS is supposed to be,,then the treatment should bringnimprovement for a great number of women.,This has not been the casenwith these treatments,,and FDA regulations say thatnfor a drug to be deemed effective,,a large portion of the target population,should see clinicallynsignificant improvement.,So we have not had that at allnwith these so-called treatments.,However, the financial gainnof perpetuating the myth,that PMS is a common mental disorder,and is treatable is quite substantial.,When women are prescribedndrugs like anti-depressants or hormones,,medical protocol requires that they havenphysician follow-up every three months.,That's a lot of doctor visits.,Pharmaceutical companiesnreap untold profits,when women are convincednthey should take a prescribed medication,for all of their child-bearing lives.,Over-the-counter drugs like Midol,even claim to treat PMS symptomsnlike tension and irritability,,even though they only containna diuretic, a pain reliever,and caffeine.,Now, far be it from me to arguenwith the magical powers of caffeine,,but I don't think reducing tensionnis one of them.,Since 2002, Midol has marketedna Teen Midol to adolescents.,They are aiming at young girls early,,to convince them that everyone gets PMSnand that it will make you a monster,,but wait, there's somethingnyou can do about it:,Take Midol and you will bena human being again.,In 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollarsnin sales revenue. 
 So while perpetuating the myth of PMSnhas been lucrative for some,,it comes with some seriousnadverse consequences for women.,First, it contributesnto the medicalization,of women's reproductive health.,The medical field has a long historynof conceptualizing,women's reproductive processesnas illnesses that require treatment,,and this has come at many costs,nincluding excessive Cesarean deliveries,,hysterectomies and prescribednhormone treatments,that have harmed rather than enhancednwomen's health.,Second, the PMS myth also contributesnto the stereotype of women,as irrational and overemotional.,When the menstrual cycle is describednas a hormonal roller coaster,that turns women into angry beasts,,it becomes easy to question nthe competence of all women.,Women have made tremendous stridesnin the workforce,,but still there's a minuscule numbernof women at the highest echelons,of fields like government or business,,and when we think aboutnwho makes for a good CEO or senator,,someone who has qualities like nrationality, steadiness, competence,come to mind,,and in our culture, that sounds morenlike a man than a woman,,and the PMS myth contributes to that. 
 Psychologists know thatnthe moods of men and women,are more similar than different.,One study followed men and womennfor four to six months,and found that the numbernof mood swings they experienced,and the severity of those mood swingsnwere no different.,And finally, the PMS mythnkeeps women from dealing,with the actual issuesncausing them emotional upset.,Individual issues likenquality of relationship or work conditions,or societal issues like racism or sexismnor the daily grind of poverty,are all strongly related to daily mood.,Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS,keeps women from understandingnthe source of their negative emotions,,but it also takes away the opportunitynto take any action to change them. 
 So the good news about PMS,is that while some women get some symptomsnbecause of the menstrual cycle,,the great majority don'tnget a mental disorder.,They go to work or school,ntake care of their families,,and function at a normal level.,We know the emotions and moodsnof men and women,are more similar than different,,so let's walk away fromnthe tired old PMS myth of women as witches,and embrace the reality of high emotionalnand professional functioning,the great majority of womennlive every day. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I have an overlookednbut potentially lucrative,investment opportunity for you.,Over the past 10 years in the UK,,the return on burial plotsnhas outperformed the UK property market,by a ratio of around three to one.,There are private cemeteries being set upnwith plots for sale to investors,,and they start at around 3,900 pounds.,And they're projected to achievenabout 40 percent growth.,The biggest advantage is that thisnis a market with continuous demand. 
 Now, this is a real proposition,,and there are companies out therenthat really are offering this investment,,but my interest in it is quite different.,I'm an architect and urban designer,,and for the past year and a half,,I've been looking at approachesnto death and dying,and at how they've shaped our citiesnand the buildings within them. 
 So in the summer,nI did my first exhibition,on death and architecture in Venice,,and it was called "Death in Venice.",And because death is a subject,that many of us find quitenuncomfortable to talk about,,the exhibition was designednto be quite playful,,so that people wouldnliterally engage with it.,So one of our exhibitsnwas an interactive map of London,which showed just how muchnof the real estate in the city,is given over to death.,As you wave your hand across the map,,the name of the piece of real estate --nthe building or the cemetery --,is revealed.,And those white shapes that you can see,,they're all of the hospitals and hospices,and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.,In fact, the majority are cemeteries.,We wanted to show that, even thoughndeath and burial are things,that we might not think about,,they're all around us, and they'renimportant parts of our cities. 
 So about half a million peoplendie in the UK each year,,and of those, around a quarternwill want to be buried.,But the UK, like manynWestern European countries,,is running out of burial space,,especially in the major cities.,And the Greater London Authoritynhas been aware of this for a while,,and the main causes are population growth,,the fact that existingncemeteries are almost full.,There's a custom in the UK that gravesnare considered to be occupied forever,,and there's also development pressure --npeople want to use that same land,to build houses or offices or shops. 
 So they came up with a few solutions.,They were like, well, maybe we cannreuse those graves after 50 years.,Or maybe we can bury people,nlike, four deep,,so that four people can be buriednin the same plot,,and we can make more efficient usenof the land that way,,and in that way, hopefully Londonnwill still have space to bury people,in the near future. 
 But, traditionally, cemeteriesnhaven't been taken care of,by the local authority.,In fact, the surprising thing is thatnthere's no legal obligation,on anyone in the UKnto provide burial space.,Traditionally, it's been donenby private and religious organizations,,like churches and mosques and synagogues.,But there's also occasionallynbeen a for-profit group,who has wanted to get in on the act.,And, you know, they look atnthe small size of a burial plot,and that high cost,,and it looks like there'snserious money to be made. 
 So, actually, if you want to go outnand start your own cemetery,,you kind of can.,There was this couple in South Wales,,and they had a farmhousenand a load of fields next to it,,and they wanted to develop the land.,They had a load of ideas.,They first thought about makingna caravan park,,but the council said no.,And then they wanted to make a fish farm,and again the council said no.,Then they hit on the ideanof making a cemetery,and they calculated that by doing this,,they could increasenthe value of their land,from about 95,000 poundsnto over one million pounds. 
 But just to come back to this ideanof making profit from cemeteries,,like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?,The thing is that the high costnof those burial plots,is actually very misleading.,They look like they're expensive,,but that cost reflects the fact thatnyou need to maintain the burial plot --,like, someone has to cut the grassnfor the next 50 years.,That means it's very difficultnto make money from cemeteries.,And it's the reason that normallynthey're run by the council,or by a not-for-profit group.,But anyway, the council grantednthese people permission,,and they're now tryingnto build their cemetery. 
 So just to explain to younkind of how this works:,If I want to build something in the UK,,like a cemetery for example,,then I have to applynfor planning permission first.,So if I want to build a newnoffice building for a client,or if I want to extend my home,or, you know, if I have a shopnand I want to convert it into an office,,I have to do a load of drawings,,and I submit themnto the council for permission.,And they'll look at things likenhow it fits in the surroundings.,So they'll look at what it looks like.,But they'll also think about thingsnlike what impact is it going to have,on the local environment?,And they'll be thinking about things like,,is this thing going to cause pollution,or is there going to be a lot of traffic,that wants to go to this thingnthat I've built?,But also good things.,Is it going to add local servicesnlike shops to the neighborhood,that local people would like to use?,And they'll weigh up the advantagesnand the disadvantages,and they'll make a decision. 
 So that's how it works if I wantnto build a large cemetery.,But what if I've got a piece of land,and I just want to buryna few people, like five or six?,Well, then -- actually, I don't neednpermission from anyone!,There's actually almost no regulationnin the UK around burial,,and the little bit that there is,nis about not polluting water courses,,like not polluting rivers or groundwater.,So actually, if you want to gonand make your own mini-cemetery,,then you can. 
 But I mean, like -- really,nwho does this? Right?,Well, if you're an aristocratic familynand you have a large estate,,then there's a chance that you'llnhave a mausoleum on it,,and you'll bury your family there.,But the really weird thing,is that you don't need to havena piece of land of a certain size,before you're allowednto start burying people on it.,And so that means that, technically,,this applies to, like, the back gardennof your house in the suburbs. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what if you wantednto try this yourself at home?,Well, there's a few councilsnthat have guidance on their website,which can help you. 
 So, the first thing that they tell you,is that you need to have a certificatenof burial before you can go ahead --,you're not allowed to just murder peoplenand put them under the patio. 
 (Laughter) 
 They also tell you that you need to keepna record of where the grave is.,But that's pretty much itnfor formal requirements.,Now, they do warn you thatnyour neighbors might not like this,,but, legally speaking, there's almostnnothing that they can do about it.,And just in case any of younstill had that profit idea in your mind,about how much those burial plots cost,and how much moneynyou might be able to make,,they also warn that it might causenthe value of your house,to drop by 20 percent.,Although, actually, it's more likely,that no one will want to buynyour house at all after that. 
 So what I find fascinating about this,is the fact that it kind of sums upnmany of our attitudes towards death.,In the UK, and I think that the figuresnacross Europe are probably similar,,only about 30 percent of peoplenhave ever talked to anyone,about their wishes around death,,and even for people over 75,,only 45 percent of peoplenhave ever talked about this.,And the reasons thatnpeople give ... you know,,they think that their death is far off,or they think that they're goingnto make people uncomfortable,by talking about it.,And you know, to a certain extent,,there are other people out therenwho are taking care of things for us.,The government has all this regulationnand bureaucracy around things,like burying a death, for example,,and there's people like funeral directors,who devote their entirenworking lives to this issue.,But when it comes to our cities,and thinking about howndeath fits in our cities,,there's much less regulationnand design and thought,than we might imagine. 
 So we're not thinking about this,,but all of the people we imaginenare thinking about it --,they're not taking care of it either. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was young,nI prided myself as a nonconformist,in the conservativenU.S. state I live in, Kansas.,I didn't follow along with the crowd.,I wasn't afraid to trynweird clothing trends or hairstyles.,I was outspoken and extremely social.,Even these pictures and postcards nof my London semester abroad 16 years ago,show that I obviously didn't carenif I was perceived as weird or different.,(Laughter) 
 But that same year nI was in London, 16 years ago,,I realized something about myselfnthat actually was somewhat unique,,and that changed everything.,I became the oppositenof who I thought I once was.,I stayed in my roomninstead of socializing.,I stopped engaging in clubsnand leadership activities.,I didn't want to stand outnin the crowd anymore.,I told myself it was becausenI was growing up and maturing,,not that I was suddenlynlooking for acceptance.,I had always assumed I was immunento needing acceptance.,After all, I was a bit unconventional.,But I realize now,that the moment I realizednsomething was different about me,was the exact same momentnthat I began conforming and hiding. 
 Hiding is a progressive habit,,and once you start hiding,,it becomes harder and hardernto step forward and speak out.,In fact, even now,,when I was talking to peoplenabout what this talk was about,,I made up a cover story,and I even hid the truthnabout my TED Talk.,So it is fitting and scary,that I have returned nto this city 16 years later,and I have chosen this stagento finally stop hiding.,What have I been hidingnfor 16 years?,I am a lesbian. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 I've struggled to say those words,,because I didn't wantnto be defined by them.,Every time I would thinknabout coming out in the past,,I would think to myself,nbut I just want to be known as Morgana,,uniquely Morgana,,but not "my lesbian friend Morgana,"nor "my gay coworker Morgana.",Just Morgana. 
 For those of you from largenmetropolitan areas,,this may not seem like a big deal to you.,It may seem strange nthat I have suppressed the truth,and hidden this for so long.,But I was paralyzed by my fearnof not being accepted.,And I'm not alone, of course.,A 2013 Deloitte study foundnthat a surprisingly large number of people,hide aspects of their identity.,Of all the employees they surveyed,,61 percent reported changing an aspectnof their behavior or their appearance,in order to fit in at work.,Of all the gay, lesbiannand bisexual employees,,83 percent admitted to changingnsome aspects of themselves,so they would not nappear at work "too gay.",The study found that even in companies,with diversity policiesnand inclusion programs,,employees strugglento be themselves at work,because they believe nconformity is critical,to their long-term career advancement.,And while I was surprisednthat so many people just like me,waste so much energyntrying to hide themselves,,I was scared when I discoverednthat my silence,has life-or-death consequencesnand long-term social repercussions. 
 Twelve years:,the length by which nlife expectancy is shortened,for gay, lesbian and bisexual peoplenin highly anti-gay communities,compared to accepting communities.,Twelve years reduced life expectancy.,When I read that in The Advocate nmagazine this year,,I realized I could no longernafford to keep silent.,The effects of personal stress andnsocial stigmas are a deadly combination.,The study found that gaysnin anti-gay communities,had higher rates of heart disease,nviolence and suicide.,What I once thoughtnwas simply a personal matter,I realized had a ripple effect,that went into the workplacenand out into the community,for every story just like mine.,My choice to hidenand not share who I really am,may have inadvertently contributednto this exact same environment,and atmosphere of discrimination. 
 I'd always told myselfnthere's no reason to share that I was gay,,but the idea that my silencenhas social consequences,was really driven home this yearnwhen I missed an opportunity,to change the atmosphere of discriminationnin my own home state of Kansas. 
 In February, the Kansas House of nRepresentatives brought up a bill for vote,that would have essentiallynallowed businesses,to use religious freedom as a reasonnto deny gays services.,A former coworker and friend of mine,has a father who servesnin the Kansas House of Representatives.,He voted in favor of the bill,,in favor of a law that would allow nbusinesses to not serve me. 
 How does my friend feel,about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,nqueer and questioning people?,How does her father feel?,I don't know, because I was never honest nwith them about who I am.,And that shakes me to the core.,What if I had told her my story years ago?,Could she have told nher father my experience?,Could I have ultimatelynhelped change his vote?,I will never know,,and that made me realizenI had done nothing,to try to make a difference. 
 How ironic that I worknin human resources,,a profession that works to welcome,,connect and encouragenthe development of employees,,a profession that advocatesnthat the diversity of society,should be reflected in the workplace,,and yet I have done nothingnto advocate for diversity.,When I came to this company one year ago,,I thought to myself, this company nhas anti-discrimination policies,that protect gay, lesbian,nbisexual and transgender people.,Their commitment to diversity is evidentnthrough their global inclusion programs.,When I walk through the doorsnof this company, I will finally come out.,But I didn't.,Instead of taking advantagenof the opportunity,,I did nothing. 
 (Applause) 
 When I was looking throughnmy London journal and scrapbook,from my London semesternabroad 16 years ago,,I came across this modified quotenfrom Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise.","There are more scary thingsninside than outside.",And then I wrote a notento myself at the bottom:,"Remember this.",I'm sure I was trying to encourage myselfnto get out and explore London,,but the message I missed was the need nto start exploring and embracing myself.,What I didn't realizenuntil all these years later,is that the biggest obstaclesnI will ever have to overcome,are my own fears and insecurities.,I believe that by facing my fears inside,nI will be able to change reality outside.,I made a choice today,to reveal a part of myselfnthat I have hidden for too long.,I hope that this meansnI will never hide again,,and I hope that by coming out today,nI can do something to change the data,and also to help others who feel differentnbe more themselves and more fulfilled,in both their professionalnand personal lives.,Thank you.,(Applause)One of the first patientsnI had to see as a pediatrician was Sol,,a beautiful month-old baby,who was admitted with signsnof a severe respiratory infection.,Until then, I had never seenna patient worsen so fast.,In just two daysnshe was connected to a respirator,and on the third day she died.,Sol had whooping cough.,After discussing the case in the roomnand after a quite distressing catharsis,,I remember my chief resident said to me,,"Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face.,And now comes the hardest part:,We have to go talk to her parents.",At that time, a thousand questionsncame to mind,,from, "How could a one-month-oldnbaby be so unfortunate?",to, "Could we have donensomething about it?" 
 Before vaccines existed,,many infectious diseasesnkilled millions of people per year.,During the 1918 flu pandemic,50 million people died.,That's greater than Argentina'sncurrent population.,Perhaps, the older ones among younremember the polio epidemic,that occurred in Argentina in 1956.,At that time, there was no vaccinenavailable against polio.,People didn't know what to do.nThey were going crazy.,They would go painting treesnwith caustic lime.,They'd put little bags of camphor,in their children's underwear,nas if that could do something.,During the polio epidemic,nthousands of people died.,And thousands of people were leftnwith very significant neurological damage.,I know this because I read about it,,because thanks to vaccines,nmy generation was lucky,to not live through an epidemicnas terrible as this. 
 Vaccines are one of the great successesnof the 20th century's public health.,After potable water,,they are the interventionsnthat have most reduced mortality,,even more than antibiotics.,Vaccines eradicated terrible diseasesnsuch as smallpox from the planet,and succeeded in significantlynreducing mortality,due to other diseases such as measles,,whooping cough, polio and many more. 
 All these diseases are considerednvaccine-preventable diseases.,What does this mean?,That they are potentially preventable,,but in order to be so,nsomething must be done.,You need to get vaccinated.,I imagine that most,nif not all of us here today,,received a vaccinenat some point in our life.,Now, I'm not so sure that many of us know,which vaccines or boostersnwe should receive after adolescence.,Have you ever wonderednwho we are protecting,when we vaccinate?,What do I mean by that?,Is there any other effectnbeyond protecting ourselves? 
 Let me show you something.,Imagine for a moment,that we are in a city,that has never had a casenof a particular disease,,such as the measles.,This would mean that no one in the citynhas ever had contact with the disease.,No one has natural defenses against,nnor been vaccinated against measles.,If one day, a person sick with the measlesnappears in this city,the disease won't find much resistance,and will begin spreadingnfrom person to person,,and in no time it will disseminatenthroughout the community.,After a certain time,a big part of the population will be ill.,This happened when there were no vaccines. 
 Now, imagine the complete opposite case.,We are in a city,where more than 90 percentnof the population,has defenses againstnthe measles, which means,that they either had the disease,nsurvived, and developed natural defenses;,or that they had beennimmunized against measles.,If one day,,a person sick with the measlesnappears in this city,,the disease will find much more resistance,and won't be transmittednthat much from person to person.,The spread will probably remain contained,and a measles outbreak won't happen. 
 I would like younto pay attention to something.,People who are vaccinated,are not only protecting themselves,,but by blocking the disseminationnof the disease,within the community,,they are indirectly protectingnthe people in this community,who are not vaccinated.,They create a kind of protective shield,which prevents them fromncoming in contact with the disease,,so that these people are protected.,This indirect protection,that the unvaccinated peoplenwithin a community receive,simply by being surroundednby vaccinated people,,is called herd immunity. 
 Many people in the community,depend almost exclusivelynon this herd immunity,to be protected against disease.,The unvaccinated people you seenin infographics are not just hypothetical.,Those people are our niecesnand nephews, our children,,who may be too youngnto receive their first shots.,They are our parents, our siblings,,our acquaintances,,who may have a disease,,or take medicationnthat lowers their defenses.,There are also people who arenallergic to a particular vaccine.,They could even be among us,,any of us who got vaccinated,,but the vaccine didn't producenthe expected effect,,because not all vaccinesnare always 100 percent effective.,All these people dependnalmost exclusively on herd immunity,to be protected against diseases. 
 To achieve this effect of herd immunity,,it is necessary that a large percentagenof the population be vaccinated.,This percentage is called the threshold.,The threshold depends on many variables:,It depends on the germ's characteristics,,and those of the immune responsenthat the vaccine generates.,But they all have something in common.,If the percentage of the populationnin a vaccinated community,is below this threshold number,,the disease will beginnto spread more freely,and may generate an outbreaknof this disease within the community.,Even diseases which were nat some point controlled may reappear. 
 This is not just a theory.,This has happened,nand is still happening.,In 1998, a British researchernpublished an article,in one of the most importantnmedical journals,,saying that the MMR vaccine,,which is given for measles,nmumps and rubella,,was associated with autism.,This generated an immediate impact.,People began to stop getting vaccinated,nand stopped vaccinating their children.,And what happened?,The number of people vaccinated,,in many communities around the world,nfell below this threshold.,And there were outbreaks of measlesnin many cities in the world --,in the U.S., in Europe.,Many people got sick.,People died of measles.,What happened? 
 This article also generated a huge stirnwithin the medical community.,Dozens of researchers began to assessnif this was actually true.,Not only could no one find,a causal association between MMRnand autism at the population level,,but it was also found that this articlenhad incorrect claims.,Even more, it was fraudulent.,It was fraudulent.,In fact, the journal publicly retractednthe article in 2010.,One of the main concerns and excusesnfor not getting vaccinated,are the adverse effects. 
 Vaccines, like other drugs,ncan have potential adverse effects.,Most are mild and temporary.,But the benefits are always greaternthan possible complications.,When we are ill,nwe want to heal fast.,Many of us who are here,take antibioticsnwhen we have an infection,,we take anti-hypertensivesnwhen we have high blood pressure,,we take cardiac medications.,Why? Because we are sicknand we want to heal fast.,And we don't question it much.,Why is it so difficultnto think of preventing diseases,,by taking care of ourselvesnwhen we are healthy?,We take care of ourselves a lotnwhen affected by an illness,,or in situations of imminent danger. 
 I imagine most of us here,,remember the influenza-A pandemic,which broke out in 2009nin Argentina and worldwide.,When the first casesnbegan to come to light,,we, here in Argentina,nwere entering the winter season.,We knew absolutely nothing.,Everything was a mess.,People wore masks on the street,nran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel.,People would line upnin pharmacies to get a vaccine,,without even knowingnif it was the right vaccine,that would protect themnagainst this new virus.,We knew absolutely nothing.,At that time, in addition to doingnmy fellowship at the Infant Foundation,,I worked as a home pediatriciannfor a prepaid medicine company.,I remember that I startednmy shift at 8 a.m.,,and by 8, I already had a listnof 50 scheduled visits.,It was chaos;npeople didn't know what to do.,I remember the types of patientsnthat I was examining.,The patients were a little older thannwhat we were used to seeing in winter,,with longer fevers. 
 And I mentioned thatnto my fellowship mentor,,and he, for his part, had heardnthe same from a colleague,,about the large numbernof pregnant women,and young adults,being hospitalized in intensive care,,with hard-to-manage clinical profiles.,At that time, we set out to understandnwhat was happening.,First thing Monday morning,nwe took the car,and went to a hospitalnin Buenos Aires Province,,that served as a referral hospitalnfor cases of the new influenza virus.,We arrived at the hospital;nit was crowded.,All health staff were dressednin NASA-like bio-safety suits.,We all had face masks in our pockets.,I, being a hypochondriac,ndidn't breathe for two hours.,But we could see what was happening.,Immediately, we startednreaching out to pediatricians,from six hospitals in the citynand in Buenos Aires Province.,Our main goal was to find out,how this new virus behavednin contact with our children,,in the shortest time possible.,A marathon work.,In less than three months,,we could see what effectnthis new H1N1 virus had,on the 251 childrennhospitalized by this virus.,We could see which childrenngot more seriously ill:,children under four, especially thosenless than one year old;,patients with neurological diseases;,and young childrennwith chronic pulmonary diseases.,Identifying these at-risk groupsnwas important,to include them as priority groups,in the recommendationsnfor getting the influenza vaccine,,not only here in Argentina,,but also in other countriesnwhich the pandemic not yet reached. 
 A year later,,when a vaccine against the pandemicnH1N1 virus became available,,we wanted to see what happened.,After a huge vaccination campaign,aimed at protecting at-risk groups,,these hospitals, with 93 percentnof the at-risk groups vaccinated,,had not hospitalized a single patient,for the pandemic H1N1 virus.,(Applause),In 2009: 251.,In 2010: zero. 
 Vaccination is an actnof individual responsibility,,but it has a huge collective impact.,If I get vaccinated,nnot only am I protecting myself,,but I am also protecting others.,Sol had whooping cough.,Sol was very young,,and she hadn't yet receivednher first vaccine against whooping cough.,I still wonder what would have happened,if everyone around Solnhad been vaccinated.,(Applause)(Music),Dannielle Hadley: Lifenin Pennsylvania means just that:,life without the possibility of parole.,For us lifers,,as we call ourselves,,our only chance for release,is through commutation,,which has only been grantednto two women since 1989,,close to 30 years ago.,Our song, "This Is Not Our Home,",it tells of our experiences,while doing life withoutnthe possibility of parole.

 (Applause)It used to be that if you wantednto get a computer to do something new,,you would have to program it.,Now, programming, for those of you herenthat haven't done it yourself,,requires laying out in excruciating detail,every single step that you wantnthe computer to do,in order to achieve your goal.,Now, if you want to do somethingnthat you don't know how to do yourself,,then this is goingnto be a great challenge. 
 So this was the challenge facednby this man, Arthur Samuel.,In 1956, he wanted to get this computer,to be able to beat him at checkers.,How can you write a program,,lay out in excruciating detail,nhow to be better than you at checkers?,So he came up with an idea:,he had the computer playnagainst itself thousands of times,and learn how to play checkers.,And indeed it worked,nand in fact, by 1962,,this computer had beatennthe Connecticut state champion. 
 So Arthur Samuel wasnthe father of machine learning,,and I have a great debt to him,,because I am a machinenlearning practitioner.,I was the president of Kaggle,,a community of over 200,000nmachine learning practictioners.,Kaggle puts up competitions,to try and get them to solvenpreviously unsolved problems,,and it's been successful nhundreds of times.,So from this vantage point,nI was able to find out,a lot about what machine learningncan do in the past, can do today,,and what it could do in the future.,Perhaps the first big success of nmachine learning commercially was Google.,Google showed that it isnpossible to find information,by using a computer algorithm,,and this algorithm is basednon machine learning.,Since that time, there have been manyncommercial successes of machine learning.,Companies like Amazon and Netflix,use machine learning to suggestnproducts that you might like to buy,,movies that you might like to watch.,Sometimes, it's almost creepy.,Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook,sometimes will tell you aboutnwho your friends might be,and you have no idea how it did it,,and this is because it's usingnthe power of machine learning.,These are algorithms that havenlearned how to do this from data,rather than being programmed by hand. 
 This is also how IBM was successful,in getting Watson to beatnthe two world champions at "Jeopardy,",answering incredibly subtlenand complex questions like this one.,["The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missingnfrom this city's national museum in 2003 n(along with a lot of other stuff)"],This is also why we are now ablento see the first self-driving cars.,If you want to be able to tellnthe difference between, say,,a tree and a pedestrian,nwell, that's pretty important.,We don't know how to writenthose programs by hand,,but with machine learning,nthis is now possible.,And in fact, this car has driven nover a million miles,without any accidents on regular roads. 
 So we now know that computers can learn,,and computers can learn to do things,that we actually sometimesndon't know how to do ourselves,,or maybe can do them better than us.,One of the most amazing examplesnI've seen of machine learning,happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle,where a team run by a guyncalled Geoffrey Hinton,from the University of Toronto,won a competition fornautomatic drug discovery.,Now, what was extraordinary herenis not just that they beat,all of the algorithms developed by Mercknor the international academic community,,but nobody on the team had any backgroundnin chemistry or biology or life sciences,,and they did it in two weeks.,How did they do this?,They used an extraordinary algorithmncalled deep learning.,So important was this that in factnthe success was covered,in The New York Times in a front pagenarticle a few weeks later.,This is Geoffrey Hintonnhere on the left-hand side.,Deep learning is an algorithmninspired by how the human brain works,,and as a result it's an algorithm,which has no theoretical limitationsnon what it can do.,The more data you give it and the morencomputation time you give it,,the better it gets. 
 The New York Times alsonshowed in this article,another extraordinarynresult of deep learning,which I'm going to show you now.,It shows that computers ncan listen and understand. 
 (Video) Richard Rashid: Now, the last step,that I want to be ablento take in this process,is to actually speak to you in Chinese.,Now the key thing there is,,we've been able to take a large amount nof information from many Chinese speakers,and produce a text-to-speech system,that takes Chinese textnand converts it into Chinese language,,and then we've takennan hour or so of my own voice,and we've used that to modulate,the standard text-to-speech systemnso that it would sound like me.,Again, the result's not perfect.,There are in fact quite a few errors.,(In Chinese),(Applause),There's much work to be done in this area.,(In Chinese),(Applause) 
 Jeremy Howard: Well, that was atna machine learning conference in China.,It's not often, actually,nat academic conferences,that you do hear spontaneous applause,,although of course sometimesnat TEDx conferences, feel free.,Everything you saw therenwas happening with deep learning.,(Applause) Thank you.,The transcription in Englishnwas deep learning.,The translation to Chinese and the textnin the top right, deep learning,,and the construction of the voicenwas deep learning as well. 
 So deep learning isnthis extraordinary thing.,It's a single algorithm thatncan seem to do almost anything,,and I discovered that a year earlier,nit had also learned to see.,In this obscure competition from Germany,called the German Traffic Sign nRecognition Benchmark,,deep learning had learnednto recognize traffic signs like this one.,Not only could itnrecognize the traffic signs,better than any other algorithm,,the leaderboard actually showednit was better than people,,about twice as good as people.,So by 2011, we had the first example,of computers that can seenbetter than people.,Since that time, a lot has happened.,In 2012, Google announced thatnthey had a deep learning algorithm,watch YouTube videos,and crunched the datanon 16,000 computers for a month,,and the computer independently learnednabout concepts such as people and cats,just by watching the videos.,This is much like the waynthat humans learn.,Humans don't learnnby being told what they see,,but by learning for themselvesnwhat these things are.,Also in 2012, Geoffrey Hinton,nwho we saw earlier,,won the very popular ImageNet competition,,looking to try to figure out nfrom one and a half million images,what they're pictures of.,As of 2014, we're now downnto a six percent error rate,in image recognition.,This is better than people, again. 
 So machines really are doingnan extraordinarily good job of this,,and it is now being used in industry.,For example, Google announced last year,that they had mapped every singlenlocation in France in two hours,,and the way they did it wasnthat they fed street view images,into a deep learning algorithmnto recognize and read street numbers.,Imagine how longnit would have taken before:,dozens of people, many years.,This is also happening in China.,Baidu is kind of nthe Chinese Google, I guess,,and what you see here in the top left,is an example of a picture that I uploadednto Baidu's deep learning system,,and underneath you can see that the systemnhas understood what that picture is,and found similar images.,The similar images actuallynhave similar backgrounds,,similar directions of the faces,,even some with their tongue out.,This is not clearly lookingnat the text of a web page.,All I uploaded was an image.,So we now have computers whichnreally understand what they see,and can therefore search databases,of hundreds of millionsnof images in real time. 
 So what does it meannnow that computers can see?,Well, it's not just nthat computers can see.,In fact, deep learningnhas done more than that.,Complex, nuanced sentences like this one,are now understandablenwith deep learning algorithms.,As you can see here,,this Stanford-based systemnshowing the red dot at the top,has figured out that this sentencenis expressing negative sentiment.,Deep learning now in factnis near human performance,at understanding what sentences are aboutnand what it is saying about those things.,Also, deep learning hasnbeen used to read Chinese,,again at about nativenChinese speaker level.,This algorithm developednout of Switzerland,by people, none of whom speaknor understand any Chinese.,As I say, using deep learning,is about the best systemnin the world for this,,even compared to nativenhuman understanding. 
 This is a system that wenput together at my company,which shows puttingnall this stuff together.,These are pictures whichnhave no text attached,,and as I'm typing in here sentences,,in real time it's understandingnthese pictures,and figuring out what they're about,and finding pictures that are similarnto the text that I'm writing.,So you can see, it's actuallynunderstanding my sentences,and actually understanding these pictures.,I know that you've seennsomething like this on Google,,where you can type in thingsnand it will show you pictures,,but actually what it's doing is it'snsearching the webpage for the text.,This is very different from actuallynunderstanding the images.,This is something that computersnhave only been able to do,for the first time in the last few months. 
 So we can see now that computersncan not only see but they can also read,,and, of course, we've shown that theyncan understand what they hear.,Perhaps not surprising now thatnI'm going to tell you they can write.,Here is some text that I generatednusing a deep learning algorithm yesterday.,And here is some text that an algorithmnout of Stanford generated.,Each of these sentences was generated,by a deep learning algorithmnto describe each of those pictures.,This algorithm before has never seenna man in a black shirt playing a guitar.,It's seen a man before,nit's seen black before,,it's seen a guitar before,,but it has independently generatednthis novel description of this picture.,We're still not quite at humannperformance here, but we're close.,In tests, humans prefernthe computer-generated caption,one out of four times.,Now this system is now only two weeks old,,so probably within the next year,,the computer algorithm will benwell past human performance,at the rate things are going.,So computers can also write. 
 So we put all this together and it leadsnto very exciting opportunities.,For example, in medicine,,a team in Boston announcednthat they had discovered,dozens of new clinically relevant features,of tumors which help doctorsnmake a prognosis of a cancer.,Very similarly, in Stanford,,a group there announced that,nlooking at tissues under magnification,,they've developed na machine learning-based system,which in fact is betternthan human pathologists,at predicting survival ratesnfor cancer sufferers.,In both of these cases, not onlynwere the predictions more accurate,,but they generated new insightful science.,In the radiology case,,they were new clinical indicatorsnthat humans can understand.,In this pathology case,,the computer system actually discoverednthat the cells around the cancer,are as important asnthe cancer cells themselves,in making a diagnosis.,This is the opposite of what pathologistsnhad been taught for decades.,In each of those two cases,nthey were systems developed,by a combination of medical expertsnand machine learning experts,,but as of last year,nwe're now beyond that too.,This is an example ofnidentifying cancerous areas,of human tissue under a microscope.,The system being shown herencan identify those areas more accurately,,or about as accurately,nas human pathologists,,but was built entirely with deep learningnusing no medical expertise,by people who havenno background in the field.,Similarly, here, this neuron segmentation.,We can now segment neuronsnabout as accurately as humans can,,but this system was developednwith deep learning,using people with no previous nbackground in medicine. 
 So myself, as somebody withnno previous background in medicine,,I seem to be entirely well qualifiednto start a new medical company,,which I did.,I was kind of terrified of doing it,,but the theory seemed to suggestnthat it ought to be possible,to do very useful medicinenusing just these data analytic techniques.,And thankfully, the feedbacknhas been fantastic,,not just from the medianbut from the medical community,,who have been very supportive.,The theory is that we can takenthe middle part of the medical process,and turn that into data analysisnas much as possible,,leaving doctors to donwhat they're best at.,I want to give you an example.,It now takes us about 15 minutesnto generate a new medical diagnostic test,and I'll show you that in real time now,,but I've compressed it down to nthree minutes by cutting some pieces out.,Rather than showing youncreating a medical diagnostic test,,I'm going to show you na diagnostic test of car images,,because that's somethingnwe can all understand. 
 So here we're starting with nabout 1.5 million car images,,and I want to create somethingnthat can split them into the angle,of the photo that's being taken.,So these images are entirely unlabeled,nso I have to start from scratch.,With our deep learning algorithm,,it can automatically identifynareas of structure in these images.,So the nice thing is that the humannand the computer can now work together.,So the human, as you can see here,,is telling the computernabout areas of interest,which it wants the computer thennto try and use to improve its algorithm.,Now, these deep learning systems actuallynare in 16,000-dimensional space,,so you can see here the computernrotating this through that space,,trying to find new areas of structure.,And when it does so successfully,,the human who is driving it can thennpoint out the areas that are interesting.,So here, the computer hasnsuccessfully found areas,,for example, angles.,So as we go through this process,,we're gradually tellingnthe computer more and more,about the kinds of structuresnwe're looking for.,You can imagine in a diagnostic test,this would be a pathologist identifyingnareas of pathosis, for example,,or a radiologist indicatingnpotentially troublesome nodules.,And sometimes it can bendifficult for the algorithm.,In this case, it got kind of confused.,The fronts and the backsnof the cars are all mixed up.,So here we have to be a bit more careful,,manually selecting these frontsnas opposed to the backs,,then telling the computernthat this is a type of group,that we're interested in. 
 So we do that for a while,nwe skip over a little bit,,and then we train thenmachine learning algorithm,based on these couple of hundred things,,and we hope that it's gotten a lot better.,You can see, it's now started to fadensome of these pictures out,,showing us that it already is recognizingnhow to understand some of these itself.,We can then use this conceptnof similar images,,and using similar images, you can now see,,the computer at this point is able tonentirely find just the fronts of cars.,So at this point, the humanncan tell the computer,,okay, yes, you've donena good job of that. 
 Sometimes, of course, even at this point,it's still difficultnto separate out groups.,In this case, even after we let thencomputer try to rotate this for a while,,we still find that the left sidesnand the right sides pictures,are all mixed up together.,So we can again giventhe computer some hints,,and we say, okay, try and findna projection that separates out,the left sides and the right sidesnas much as possible,using this deep learning algorithm.,And giving it that hint --nah, okay, it's been successful.,It's managed to find a waynof thinking about these objects,that's separated out these together. 
 So you get the idea here.,This is a case not where the humannis being replaced by a computer,,but where they're working together.,What we're doing here is we're replacingnsomething that used to take a team,of five or six people about seven years,and replacing it with somethingnthat takes 15 minutes,for one person acting alone. 
 So this process takes aboutnfour or five iterations.,You can see we now have 62 percent,of our 1.5 million images nclassified correctly.,And at this point, wencan start to quite quickly,grab whole big sections,,check through them to make surenthat there's no mistakes.,Where there are mistakes, we cannlet the computer know about them.,And using this kind of processnfor each of the different groups,,we are now up tonan 80 percent success rate,in classifying the 1.5 million images.,And at this point, it's just a case,of finding the small numbernthat aren't classified correctly,,and trying to understand why.,And using that approach,,by 15 minutes we getnto 97 percent classification rates. 
 So this kind of techniquencould allow us to fix a major problem,,which is that there's a lacknof medical expertise in the world.,The World Economic Forum saysnthat there's between a 10x and a 20x,shortage of physiciansnin the developing world,,and it would take about 300 years,to train enough peoplento fix that problem.,So imagine if we can helpnenhance their efficiency,using these deep learning approaches? 
 So I'm very excitednabout the opportunities.,I'm also concerned about the problems.,The problem here is thatnevery area in blue on this map,is somewhere where servicesnare over 80 percent of employment.,What are services?,These are services.,These are also the exact things thatncomputers have just learned how to do.,So 80 percent of the world's employmentnin the developed world,is stuff that computers nhave just learned how to do.,What does that mean?,Well, it'll be fine.nThey'll be replaced by other jobs.,For example, there will benmore jobs for data scientists.,Well, not really.,It doesn't take data scientists nvery long to build these things.,For example, these four algorithmsnwere all built by the same guy.,So if you think, oh, nit's all happened before,,we've seen the results in the pastnof when new things come along,and they get replaced by new jobs,,what are these new jobs going to be?,It's very hard for us to estimate this,,because human performancengrows at this gradual rate,,but we now have a system, deep learning,,that we know actually growsnin capability exponentially.,And we're here.,So currently, we see the things around us,and we say, "Oh, computersnare still pretty dumb." Right?,But in five years' time,ncomputers will be off this chart.,So we need to be starting to thinknabout this capability right now. 
 We have seen this once before, of course.,In the Industrial Revolution,,we saw a step changenin capability thanks to engines.,The thing is, though,nthat after a while, things flattened out.,There was social disruption,,but once engines were used nto generate power in all the situations,,things really settled down.,The Machine Learning Revolution,is going to be very differentnfrom the Industrial Revolution,,because the Machine Learning Revolution,nit never settles down.,The better computers getnat intellectual activities,,the more they can build better computersnto be better at intellectual capabilities,,so this is going to be a kind of change,that the world has actuallynnever experienced before,,so your previous understandingnof what's possible is different. 
 This is already impacting us.,In the last 25 years,nas capital productivity has increased,,labor productivity has been flat,nin fact even a little bit down. 
 So I want us to startnhaving this discussion now.,I know that when I often tell peoplenabout this situation,,people can be quite dismissive.,Well, computers can't really think,,they don't emote,nthey don't understand poetry,,we don't really understand how they work.,So what?,Computers right now can do the things,that humans spend mostnof their time being paid to do,,so now's the time to start thinking,about how we're going to adjust ournsocial structures and economic structures,to be aware of this new reality.,Thank you.,(Applause)Well, I'm an ocean chemist.,I look at the chemistrynof the ocean today.,I look at the chemistrynof the ocean in the past.,The way I look back in the past,is by using the fossilized remainsnof deepwater corals.,You can see an image of onenof these corals behind me.,It was collected from close to Antarctica,nthousands of meters below the sea,,so, very differentnthan the kinds of corals,you may have been lucky enough to seenif you've had a tropical holiday. 
 So I'm hoping that this talk will give you,a four-dimensional view of the ocean.,Two dimensions, such as thisnbeautiful two-dimensional image,of the sea surface temperature.,This was taken using satellite,nso it's got tremendous spatial resolution.,The overall features are extremelyneasy to understand.,The equatorial regions are warmnbecause there's more sunlight.,The polar regions are coldnbecause there's less sunlight.,And that allows big icecapsnto build up on Antarctica,and up in the Northern Hemisphere.,If you plunge deep into the sea,nor even put your toes in the sea,,you know it gets colder as you go down,,and that's mostly because the deep watersnthat fill the abyss of the ocean,come from the cold polar regionsnwhere the waters are dense. 
 If we travel back in timen20,000 years ago,,the earth looked very much different.,And I've just given you a cartoon versionnof one of the major differences,you would have seennif you went back that long.,The icecaps were much bigger.,They covered lots of the continent,nand they extended out over the ocean.,Sea level was 120 meters lower.,Carbon dioxide [levels] were verynmuch lower than they are today.,So the earth was probably about threento five degrees colder overall,,and much, much coldernin the polar regions. 
 What I'm trying to understand,,and what other colleagues of minenare trying to understand,,is how we moved from thatncold climate condition,to the warm climate conditionnthat we enjoy today.,We know from ice core research,that the transition from thesencold conditions to warm conditions,wasn't smooth, as you might predictnfrom the slow increase in solar radiation.,And we know this from ice cores,nbecause if you drill down into ice,,you find annual bands of ice,nand you can see this in the iceberg.,You can see those blue-white layers.,Gases are trapped in the ice cores,nso we can measure CO2 --,that's why we know CO2nwas lower in the past --,and the chemistry of the icenalso tells us about temperature,in the polar regions.,And if you move in timenfrom 20,000 years ago to the modern day,,you see that temperature increased.,It didn't increase smoothly.,Sometimes it increased very rapidly,,then there was a plateau,,then it increased rapidly.,It was different in the two polar regions,,and CO2 also increased in jumps. 
 So we're pretty sure the oceannhas a lot to do with this.,The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,,about 60 times morenthan is in the atmosphere.,It also acts to transport heatnacross the equator,,and the ocean is full of nutrientsnand it controls primary productivity. 
 So if we want to find outnwhat's going on down in the deep sea,,we really need to get down there,,see what's there,and start to explore.,This is some spectacular footagencoming from a seamount,about a kilometer deepnin international waters,in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.,You're amongst the first peoplento see this bit of the seafloor,,along with my research team.,You're probably seeing new species.,We don't know.,You'd have to collect the samplesnand do some very intense taxonomy.,You can see beautiful bubblegum corals.,There are brittle starsngrowing on these corals.,Those are things that looknlike tentacles coming out of corals.,There are corals made of different formsnof calcium carbonate,growing off the basalt of thisnmassive undersea mountain,,and the dark sort of stuff,nthose are fossilized corals,,and we're going to talkna little more about those,as we travel back in time. 
 To do that, we neednto charter a research boat.,This is the James Cook,nan ocean-class research vessel,moored up in Tenerife.,Looks beautiful, right?,Great, if you're not a great mariner.,Sometimes it looksna little more like this.,This is us trying to make surenthat we don't lose precious samples.,Everyone's scurrying around,nand I get terribly seasick,,so it's not always a lot of fun,nbut overall it is. 
 So we've got to becomena really good mapper to do this.,You don't see that kind of spectacularncoral abundance everywhere.,It is global and it is deep,,but we need to really findnthe right places.,We just saw a global map,nand overlaid was our cruise passage,from last year.,This was a seven-week cruise,,and this is us, having made our own maps,of about 75,000 square kilometersnof the seafloor in seven weeks,,but that's only a tiny fractionnof the seafloor.,We're traveling from west to east,,over part of the ocean that wouldnlook featureless on a big-scale map,,but actually some of these mountainsnare as big as Everest.,So with the maps that we make on board,,we get about 100-meter resolution,,enough to pick out areasnto deploy our equipment,,but not enough to see very much.,To do that, we need to flynremotely-operated vehicles,about five meters off the seafloor.,And if we do that, we can get mapsnthat are one-meter resolution,down thousands of meters.,Here is a remotely-operated vehicle,,a research-grade vehicle.,You can see an arraynof big lights on the top.,There are high-definition cameras,nmanipulator arms,,and lots of little boxes and thingsnto put your samples. 
 Here we are on our first divenof this particular cruise,,plunging down into the ocean.,We go pretty fast to make surenthe remotely operated vehicles,are not affected by any other ships.,And we go down,,and these are the kinds of things you see.,These are deep sea sponges, meter scale.,This is a swimming holothurian --nit's a small sea slug, basically.,This is slowed down.,Most of the footage I'm showingnyou is speeded up,,because all of this takes a lot of time.,This is a beautiful holothurian as well.,And this animal you're going to seencoming up was a big surprise.,I've never seen anything like thisnand it took us all a bit surprised.,This was after about 15 hours of worknand we were all a bit trigger-happy,,and suddenly this giantnsea monster started rolling past.,It's called a pyrosomenor colonial tunicate, if you like.,This wasn't what we were looking for.,We were looking for corals,ndeep sea corals.,You're going to see a picturenof one in a moment.,It's small, about five centimeters high.,It's made of calcium carbonate,nso you can see its tentacles there,,moving in the ocean currents.,An organism like this probably livesnfor about a hundred years.,And as it grows, it takes innchemicals from the ocean.,And the chemicals,nor the amount of chemicals,,depends on the temperature;nit depends on the pH,,it depends on the nutrients.,And if we can understand hownthese chemicals get into the skeleton,,we can then go back,ncollect fossil specimens,,and reconstruct what the oceannused to look like in the past.,And here you can see us collectingnthat coral with a vacuum system,,and we put it into a sampling container.,We can do this veryncarefully, I should add. 
 Some of these organisms live even longer.,This is a black coral called Leiopathes,nan image taken by my colleague,,Brendan Roark, about 500nmeters below Hawaii.,Four thousand years is a long time.,If you take a branch from onenof these corals and polish it up,,this is about 100 microns across.,And Brendan took some analysesnacross this coral --,you can see the marks --,and he's been able to shownthat these are actual annual bands,,so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,,corals can record seasonal changes,,which is pretty spectacular. 
 But 4,000 years is not enough to getnus back to our last glacial maximum.,So what do we do?,We go in for these fossil specimens.,This is what makes me really unpopularnwith my research team.,So going along,,there's giant sharks everywhere,,there are pyrosomes,nthere are swimming holothurians,,there's giant sponges,,but I make everyone go downnto these dead fossil areas,and spend ages kind of shovelingnaround on the seafloor.,And we pick up all these corals,nbring them back, we sort them out.,But each one of these is a different age,,and if we can find out how old they are,and then we can measurenthose chemical signals,,this helps us to find out,what's been going onnin the ocean in the past. 
 So on the left-hand image here,,I've taken a slice through a coral,npolished it very carefully,and taken an optical image.,On the right-hand side,,we've taken that same piece of coral,nput it in a nuclear reactor,,induced fission,,and every time there's some decay,,you can see that marked out in the coral,,so we can see the uranium distribution.,Why are we doing this?,Uranium is a very poorly regarded element,,but I love it.,The decay helps us find outnabout the rates and dates,of what's going on in the ocean.,And if you remember from the beginning,,that's what we want to get atnwhen we're thinking about climate.,So we use a laser to analyze uranium,and one of its daughter products,nthorium, in these corals,,and that tells us exactlynhow old the fossils are. 
 This beautiful animationnof the Southern Ocean,I'm just going to use illustratenhow we're using these corals,to get at some of the ancientnocean feedbacks.,You can see the densitynof the surface water,in this animation by Ryan Abernathey.,It's just one year of data,,but you can see how dynamicnthe Southern Ocean is.,The intense mixing,nparticularly the Drake Passage,,which is shown by the box,,is really one of the strongestncurrents in the world,coming through here,nflowing from west to east.,It's very turbulently mixed,,because it's moving over thosengreat big undersea mountains,,and this allows CO2 and heat to exchangenwith the atmosphere in and out.,And essentially, the oceans are breathingnthrough the Southern Ocean.,We've collected corals from back and forthnacross this Antarctic passage,,and we've found quite a surprising thingnfrom my uranium dating:,the corals migrated from south to north,during this transition from the glacialnto the interglacial.,We don't really know why,,but we think it's somethingnto do with the food source,and maybe the oxygen in the water. 
 So here we are.,I'm going to illustrate what I thinknwe've found about climate,from those corals in the Southern Ocean.,We went up and down sea mountains.nWe collected little fossil corals.,This is my illustration of that.,We think back in the glacial,,from the analysisnwe've made in the corals,,that the deep part of the Southern Oceannwas very rich in carbon,,and there was a low-densitynlayer sitting on top.,That stops carbon dioxidencoming out of the ocean.,We then found coralsnthat are of an intermediate age,,and they show us that the ocean mixednpartway through that climate transition.,That allows carbon to comenout of the deep ocean.,And then if we analyze coralsncloser to the modern day,,or indeed if we go down there today anyway,and measure the chemistry of the corals,,we see that we move to a positionnwhere carbon can exchange in and out.,So this is the waynwe can use fossil corals,to help us learn about the environment. 
 So I want to leave younwith this last slide.,It's just a still taken out of that firstnpiece of footage that I showed you.,This is a spectacular coral garden.,We didn't even expectnto find things this beautiful.,It's thousands of meters deep.,There are new species.,It's just a beautiful place.,There are fossils in amongst,,and now I've trained younto appreciate the fossil corals,that are down there. 
 So next time you're lucky enoughnto fly over the ocean,or sail over the ocean,,just think -- there are massivensea mountains down there,that nobody's ever seen before,,and there are beautiful corals. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What does it mean to spend our time well?,I spend a lot of my time,thinking about how to spend my time.,Probably too much --nI probably obsess over it.,My friends think I do.,But I feel like I kind of have to,nbecause these days,,it feels like little bits of my timenkind of slip away from me,,and when that happens, it feels likenparts of my life are slipping away. 
 Specifically,,it feels like little bitsnof my time get slipped away,to various things like this,,like technology -- I check things.,I'll give you an example.,If this email shows up --,how many of you have gottennan email like this, right?,I've been tagged in a photo.,When this appears,,I can't help but click on it right now.,Right? Because, like,nwhat if it's a bad photo?,So I have to click it right now.,But I'm not just goingnto click "See photo,",what I'm actually going to donis spend the next 20 minutes. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the worst part is that I knownthis is what's going to happen,,and even knowingnthat's what's going to happen,doesn't stop menfrom doing it again the next time.,Or I find myself in a situation like this,,where I check my emailnand I pull down to refresh,,But the thing is that 60 seconds later,,I'll pull down to refresh again.,Why am I doing this?,This doesn't make any sense. 
 But I'll give you a hintnwhy this is happening.,What do you think makesnmore money in the United States,than movies, game parksnand baseball combined?,Slot machines.,How can slot machines make all this money,when we play with such smallnamounts of money?,We play with coins.,How is this possible?,Well, the thing is ...,my phone is a slot machine.,Every time I check my phone,,I'm playing the slot machine to see,,what am I going to get?,What am I going to get?,Every time I check my email,,I'm playing the slot machine,,saying, "What am I going to get?",Every time I scroll a news feed,,I'm playing the slot machine to see,,what am I going to get next?,And the thing is that,,again, knowing exactlynhow this works -- and I'm a designer,,I know exactly hownthe psychology of this works,,I know exactly what's going on --,but it doesn't leave me with any choice,,I still just get sucked into it. 
 So what are we going to do?,Because it leaves usnwith this all-or-nothing relationship,with technology, right?,You're either on,,and you're connectednand distracted all the time,,or you're off,,but then you're wondering,,am I missing something important?,In other words, you're either distracted,or you have fear of missing out.,Right? 
 So we need to restore choice.,We want to havena relationship with technology,that gives us back choicenabout how we spend time with it,,and we're going to neednhelp from designers,,because knowing this stuff doesn't help.,We're going to need design help.,So what would that look like? 
 So let's take an example that we all face:,chat -- text messaging.,So let's say there's two people.,Nancy's on the leftnand she's working on a document,,and John's on the right.,And John suddenly remembers,,"I need to ask Nancynfor that document before I forget.",So when he sends her that message,,it blows away her attention. 
 That's what we're doing all the time,nbulldozing each other's attention,,left and right.,And there's serious cost to this,,because every timenwe interrupt each other,,it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,,to refocus our attention.,We actually cycle throughntwo different projects,before we come backnto the original thing we were doing.,This is Gloria Mark's researchncombined with Microsoft research,,that showed this.,And her research also showsnthat it actually trains bad habits.,The more interruptions we get externally,,it's conditioning and training usnto interrupt ourselves.,We actually self-interruptnevery three-and-a-half minutes. 
 This is crazy.,So how do we fix this?,Because Nancy and John are in thisnall-or-nothing relationship.,Nancy might want to disconnect,,but then she'd be worried:,What if I'm missing something important? 
 Design can fix this problem.,Let's say you havenNancy again on the left,,John on the right.,And John remembers,n"I need to send Nancy that document.",Except this time,,Nancy can mark that she's focused.,Let's say she drags a slider and says,,"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,",so -- bam -- she's focused.,Now when John wants to message her,,he can get the thought off of his mind --,because he has a need,nhe has this thought,,and he needs to dump it outnbefore he forgets.,Except this time,,it holds the messagesnso that Nancy can still focus,,but John can get the thoughtnoff of his mind. 
 But this only worksnif one last thing is true,,which is that Nancy needs to knownthat if something is truly important,,John can still interrupt.,But instead of having constantnaccidental or mindless interruptions,,we're now only creatingnconscious interruptions, 
 So we're doing two things here.,We're creating a new choicenfor both Nancy and John,,But there's a second, subtle thingnwe're doing here, too.,And it's that we're changingnthe question we're answering.,Instead of the goal of chat being:,"Let's design it so it's easynto send a message" --,that's the goal of chat,,it should be really easy to sendna message to someone --,we change the goal to somethingndeeper and a human value,,which is: "Let's create the highestnpossible quality communication,in a relationship between two people.,So we upgraded the goal. 
 Now, do designersnactually care about this?,Do we want to have conversationsnabout what these deeper human goals are?,Well, I'll tell you one story.,A little over a year ago,,I got to help organize a meeting,between some of technology's leadingndesigners and Thich Nhat Hanh.,Thich Nhat Hanh is an internationalnspokesperson for mindfulness meditation.,And it was the most amazing meeting.,You have to imagine -- picture a room --,on one side of the room,nyou have a bunch of tech geeks;,on the other side of the room,,you have a bunch of long brown robes,nshaved heads, Buddhist monks.,And the questions were aboutnthe deepest human values,,like what does the futurenof technology look like,when you're designingnfor the deepest questions,and the deepest human values?,And our conversation centerednon listening more deeply,to what those values might be.,He joked in our conversation,that what if, instead of a spell check,,you had a compassion check,,meaning, you might highlight a wordnthat might be accidentally abrasive --,perceived as abrasive by someone else. 
 So does this kind of conversationnhappen in the real world,,not just in these design meetings?,Well, the answer is yes,,and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.,If you didn't know,nCouchsurfing is a website,that matches peoplenwho are looking for a place to stay,with a free couch, from someonenwho's trying to offer it. 
 So, great service --,what would their design goal be?,What are you designingnfor if you work at Couchsurfing?,Well, you would thinknit's to match guests with hosts.,Right?,That's a pretty good goal.,But that would kind of be likenour goal with messaging before,,where we're just tryingnto deliver a message. 
 So what's the deeper, human goal?,Well, they set their goal,as the need to create lasting,npositive experiences and relationships,between people who've never met before.,And the most amazing thingnabout this was in 2007,,they introduced a way to measure this,,which is incredible.,I'll tell you how it works.,For every design goal you have,,you have to havena corresponding measurement,to know how you're doing --,a way of measuring success.,So what they do is,,let's say you take two people who meet up,,and they take the number of daysnthose two people spent together,,and then they estimate how manynhours were in those days --,how many hours didnthose two people spend together?,And then after they spendnthat time together,,they ask both of them:,How positive was your experience?,Did you have a good experiencenwith this person that you met?,And they subtractnfrom those positive hours,the amount of timenpeople spent on the website,,because that's a cost to people's lives.,Why should we value that as success?,And what you were left with,is something they refer to as "netnorchestrated conviviality,",or, really, just a netn"Good Times" created.,The net hours that would have nevernexisted, had Couchsurfing not existed. 
 Can you imagine how inspiring it would bento come to work every day,and measure your success,in the actual net new contributionnof hours in people's lives,that are positive,nthat would have never existed,if you didn't do what you werenabout to do at work today?,Can you imagine a whole worldnthat worked this way? 
 Can you imagine a social network that --,let's say you care about cooking,,and it measured its successnin terms of cooking nights organized,and the cooking articlesnthat you were glad you read,,and subtracted from that the articlesnyou weren't glad you read,or the time you spent scrollingnthat you didn't like?,Imagine a professional social network,that, instead of measuring its successnin terms of connections created,or messages sent,,instead measured its success in termsnof the job offers that people got,that they were excited to get.,And subtracted the amount of timenpeople spent on the website.,Or imagine dating services,,like maybe Tinder or something,,where instead of measuring the numbernof swipes left and right people did,,which is how they measure success today,,instead measured the deep, romantic,nfulfilling connections people created.,Whatever that was for them, by the way. 
 But can you imagine a whole worldnthat worked this way,,that was helping you spend your time well?,Now to do this you also need a new system,,because you're probably thinking,,today's Internet economy --,today's economy in general --,is measured in time spent.,The more users you have,,the more usage you have,,the more time people spend,,that's how we measure success. 
 But we've solved this problem before.,We solved it with organic,,when we said we neednto value things a different way.,We said this is a different kind of food.,So we can't compare itnjust based on price;,this is a different category of food.,We solved it with Leed Certification,,where we said thisnis a different kind of building,that stood for different valuesnof environmental sustainability. 
 What if we had somethingnlike that for technology?,What if we had somethingnwhose entire purpose and goal,was to help create net new positivencontributions to human life?,And what if we couldnvalue it a different way,,so it would actually work?,Imagine you gave this differentnpremium shelf space on app stores.,Imagine you had web browsersnthat helped route you,to these kinds of design products.,Can you imagine how exciting it would bento live and create that world? 
 We can create this world today.,Company leaders, all you have to do --,only you can prioritize a new metric,,which is your metric for net positivencontribution to human life.,And have an honestnconversation about that.,Maybe you're notndoing so well to start with,,but let's start that conversation. 
 Designers, you can redefine success;nyou can redefine design.,Arguably, you have more powernthan many people in your organization,to create the choicesnthat all of us live by.,Maybe like in medicine,,where we have a Hippocratic oath,to recognize the responsibilitynand this higher value,that we have to treat patients.,What if designers had something like that,,in terms of this new kind of design? 
 And users, for all of us --,we can demand technologynthat works this way.,Now it may seem hard,,but McDonald's didn't have saladsnuntil the consumer demand was there.,Walmart didn't have organic foodnuntil the consumer demand was there.,We have to demandnthis new kind of technology.,And we can do that.,And doing that,would amount to shiftingnfrom a world that's driven and run,entirely on time spent,,to world that's driven by time well spent. 
 I want to live in this world,,and I want this conversation to happen.,Let's start that conversation now. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Someone who looks like menwalks past you in the street.,Do you think they're a mother,,a refugee,or a victim of oppression?,Or do you think they're a cardiologist,,a barrister,or maybe your local politician?,Do you look me up and down,,wondering how hot I must get,or if my husband has forced mento wear this outfit?,What if I wore my scarf like this? 
 I can walk down the streetnin the exact same outfit,and what the world expects of menand the way I'm treated,depends on the arrangementnof this piece of cloth.,But this isn't going to benanother monologue about the hijab,because Lord knows, Muslim womennare so much more than the piece of cloth,they choose, or not,nto wrap their head in.,This is about looking beyond your bias. 
 What if I walked past you and later on,you'd found out that actuallynI was a race car engineer,,and that I designed my own race carnand I ran my university's race team,,because it's true.,What if I told you that I was actuallyntrained as a boxer for five years,,because that's true, too.,Would it surprise you?,Why? 
 Ladies and gentlemen, ultimately,,that surprise and the behaviorsnassociated with it,are the product of something ncalled unconscious bias,,or implicit prejudice.,And that results in thenridiculously detrimental,lack of diversity in our workforce,,particularly in areas of influence.,Hello, Australian Federal Cabinet.,(Applause) 
 Let me just set something outnfrom the outset:,Unconscious bias is not the samenas conscious discrimination.,I'm not saying that in all of you, nthere's a secret sexist or racist,or ageist lurking within, nwaiting to get out.,That's not what I'm saying.,We all have our biases.,They're the filters through whichnwe see the world around us.,I'm not accusing anyone,,bias is not an accusation.,Rather, it's something that nhas to be identified,,acknowledged and mitigated against.,Bias can be about race,,it can be about gender.,It can also be about class,neducation, disability.,The fact is, we all have biasesnagainst what's different,,what's different to our social norms. 
 The thing is, if we want nto live in a world,where the circumstances of your birth,do not dictate your future,and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,,then each and every one of usnhas a role to play,in making sure unconscious biasndoes not determine our lives. 
 There's this really famous experimentnin the space of unconscious bias,and that's in the space of gendernin the 1970s and 1980s.,So orchestras, back in the day,nwere made up mostly of dudes,,up to only five percent were female.,And apparently, that was becausenmen played it differently,,presumably better, presumably.,But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra,started an experiment.,They started blind auditions.,So rather than face-to-face auditions,nyou would have to play behind a screen.,Now funnily enough,,no immediate change was registered,until they asked the audition-ersnto take their shoes off,before they entered the room.,because the clickity-clack nof the heels,against the hardwood floors,was enough to give the ladies away.,Now get this,,there results of the audition showed,that there was a 50 percentnincreased chance,a woman would progress pastnthe preliminary stage.,And it almost tripled ntheir chances of getting in.,What does that tell us?,Well, unfortunately for the guys,nmen actually didn't play differently,,but there was the perceptionnthat they did.,And it was that bias that wasndetermining their outcome. 
 So what we're doing here nis identifying and acknowledging,that a bias exists.,And look, we all do it.,Let me give you an example.,A son and his father are in na horrible car accident.,The father dies on impact,and the son, who's severely injured,nis rushed to hospital.,The surgeon looks at the sonnwhen they arrive and is like,,"I can't operate.",Why?,"The boy is my son.",How can that be?,Ladies and gentlemen,,the surgeon is his mother.,Now hands up -- and it's okay --,but hands up if you initially assumednthe surgeon was a guy?,There's evidence thatnthat unconscious bias exists,,but we all just havento acknowledge that it's there,and then look at ways nthat we can move past it,so that we can look at solutions. 
 Now one of the interesting things,around the space of unconscious biasnis the topic of quotas.,And this something nthat's often brought up.,And of of the criticisms nis this idea of merit.,Look, I don't want to be picked nbecause I'm a chick,,I want to be picked because nI have merit,,because I'm the best person for the job.,It's a sentiment that's pretty commonnamong female engineers,that I work with and that I know.,And yeah, I get it, I've been there.,But, if the merit idea was true,,why would identical resumes, nin an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,,identical resumes sent outnfor a lab technician,,why would Jennifersnbe deemed less competent,,be less likely to be offered the job,,and be paid less than Johns.,The unconscious bias is there,,but we just have to look atnhow we can move past it. 
 And, you know, it's interesting,,there's some research that talks about,why this is the case andnit's called the merit paradox.,And in organizations --nand this is kind of ironic --,in organizations that talk about meritnbeing their primary value-driver,in terms of who they hire,,they were more likely to hire dudesnand more likely to pay the guys more,because apparently merit nis a masculine quality.,But, hey. 
 So you guys think you've got na good read on me,,you kinda think you know what's up.,Can you imagine me running one of these?,Can you imagine me walking innand being like,,"Hey boys, this is what's up.nThis is how it's done.",Well, I'm glad you can.,(Applause),Because ladies and gentlemen,nthat's my day job.,And the cool thing about it isnthat it's pretty entertaining.,Actually, in places like Malaysia,,Muslim women on rigs nisn't even comment-worthy.,There are that many of them.,But, it is entertaining. 
 I remember, I was telling one of the guys,,"Hey, mate, look, I really want nto learn how to surf.",And he's like, "Yassmin, I don'tnknow how you can surf,with all that gear you've got on,,and I don't know any women-only beaches.",And then, the guy came up nwith a brilliant idea,,he was like, "I know, you runnthat organization,Youth Without Borders, right?,Why don't you start a clothing linenfor Muslim chicks in beaches.,You can call it nYouth Without Boardshorts.",(Laughter),And I was like, "Thanks, guys.",And I remember another bloke ntelling me that,I should eat all the yogurt I could,because that was the only culture nI was going to get around there. 
 But, the problem is, it's kind of true,because there's an intense nlack of diversity in our workforce,,particularly in places of influence.,Now, in 2010,,The Australian National Universityndid an experiment,where they sent outn4,000 identical applications,to entry level jobs, essentially.,To get the same number of interviewsnas someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,,if you were Chinese, you had nto send out 68 percent more applications.,If you were Middle Eastern --nAbdel-Magied --,you had to send out 64 percent,,and if you're Italian, nyou're pretty lucky,,you only have to send out 12 percent more.,In places like Silicon Valley,nit's not that much better.,In Google, they put out nsome diversity results,and 61 percent white, 30 percent Asiannand nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,,all that kind of thing.,And the rest of the tech worldnis not that much better,and they've acknowledged it,,but I'm not really surenwhat they're doing about it. 
 The thing is, it doesn't trickle up.,In a study done by Green Park,,who are a British senior exec supplier,,they said that over halfnof the FTSE 100 companies,don't have a nonwhite leadernat their board level,,executive or non-executive.,And two out of every threendon't have an executive,who's from a minority.,And most of the minorities nthat are at that sort of level,are non-executive board directors.,So their influence isn't that great. 
 I've told you a bunch of terrible things.,You're like, "Oh my god, how bad is that?nWhat can I do about it?",Well, fortunately,,we've identified that there's a problem.,There's a lack of opportunity,nand that's due to unconscious bias.,But you might be sitting nthere thinking,,"I ain't brown. What's that gotnto do with me?",Let me offer you a solution.,And as I've said before,,we live in a world wherenwe're looking for an ideal.,And if we want to create a world,where the circumstancesnof your birth don't matter,,we all have to be part of the solution.,And interestingly, the authornof the lab resume experiment,offered some sort of a solution.,She said the one thing that broughtnthe successful women together,,the one thing that they had in common,,was the fact that they had good mentors. 
 So mentoring, we've all kind ofnheard that before,,it's in the vernacular.,Here's another challenge for you.,I challenge each and every one of younto mentor someone different.,Think about it.,Everyone wants to mentor someonenwho kind of is familiar,,who looks like us,,we have shared experiences.,If I see a Muslim chick nwho's got a bit of attitude,,I'm like, "What's up? We can hang out.",You walk into a room and there's someonenwho went to the same school,,you play the same sports,,there's a high chance that you'rengoing to want to help that person out.,But for the person in the roomnwho has no shared experiences with you,it becomes extremely difficult nto find that connection. 
 The idea of finding someone ndifferent to mentor,,someone who doesn't comenfrom the same background as you,,whatever that background is,,is about opening doors nfor people who couldn't even get,to the damn hallway. 
 Because ladies and gentlemen,nthe world is not just.,People are not born nwith equal opportunity.,I was born in one of the poorestncities in the world, Khartoum.,I was born brown, I was born female,,and I was born Muslim in a worldnthat is pretty suspicious of us,for reasons I can't control.,However, I also acknowledge the factnthat I was born with privilege.,I was born with amazing parents,,I was given an education,and had the blessingnof migrating to Australia.,But also, I've been blessednwith amazing mentors,who've opened doors for me nthat I didn't even know were there.,A mentor who said to me,,"Hey, your story's interesting.,Let's write something about itnso that I can share it with people.",A mentor who said,,"I know you're all those things that don'tnbelong on an Australian rig,,but come on anyway.",And here I am, talking to you. 
 And I'm not the only one.,There's all sorts of peoplenin my communities,that I see have beennhelped out by mentors.,A young Muslim man in Sydney,who ended up using his mentor's help,to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown,and now it's a huge thing.,And he's able to change the livesnof so many other young people.,Or a lady here in Brisbane,,an Afghan lady who's a refugee,,who could barely speak Englishnwhen she came to Australia,,her mentors helped her become a doctor,and she took our Young Queenslander nof the Year Award in 2008.,She's an inspiration.,This is so not smooth. 
 This is me.,But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,,and I'm also the woman who wasnin the abaya at the beginning.,Would you have chosen to mentor menif you had seen me,in one of those other versionsnof who I am?,Because I'm that same person.,We have to look past our unconscious bias,,find someone to mentor who's atnthe opposite end of your spectrum,because structural change takes time,,and I don't have that level of patience.,So if we're going to create a change,,if we're going to create a world,where we all haventhose kinds of opportunities,,then choose to open doors for people.,Because you might think thatndiversity has nothing to do with you,,but we are all part of this system,and we can all be part of that solution. 
 And if you don't knownwhere to find someone different,,go to the places you wouldn't usually go.,If you enroll innprivate high school tutoring,,go to your local state school,or maybe just drop into yournlocal refugee tutoring center.,Or perhaps you work at an office.,Take out that new grad who looksntotally out of place --,'cause that was me --,and open doors for them,,not in a tokenistic way,nbecause we're not victims,,but show them the opportunities,because opening up your world,will make you realize that nyou have access to doors,that they didn't even know existed,and you didn't even knownthey didn't have. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,there is a problem in our communitynwith lack of opportunity,,especially due to unconscious bias.,But each and every one one of younhas the potential to change that.,I know you've been given a lotnof challenges today,,but if you can take this one piecenand think about it a little differently,,because diversity is magic.,And I encourage you to look pastnyour initial perceptions,because I bet you,,they're probably wrong. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was invited to give this talk na couple of months ago,,we discussed a number nof titles with the organizers,,and a lot of different items were nkicked around and were discussed.,But nobody suggested this one,,and the reason for thatnwas two months ago,,Ebola was escalating exponentially,and spreading over wider geographic areasnthan we had ever seen,,and the world was terrified, nconcerned and alarmed,by this disease, in a way we've not nseen in recent history. 
 But today, I can stand here nand I can talk to you about beating Ebola,because of people nwhom you've never heard of,,people like Peter Clement, a Liberian ndoctor who's working in Lofa County,,a place that many of you have nnever heard of, probably, in Liberia.,The reason that Lofa County nis so important,is because about five months ago,,when the epidemic was njust starting to escalate,,Lofa County was right at the center, nthe epicenter of this epidemic.,At that time, MSFnand the treatment center there,,they were seeing dozens of patients nevery single day,,and these patients, these communitiesnwere becoming more and more terrified,as time went by, with this disease nand what it was doing to their families,,to their communities, nto their children, to their relatives.,And so Peter Clement was charged with ndriving that 12-hour-long rough road,from Monrovia, the capital,nup to Lofa County,,to try and help bring controlnto the escalating epidemic there. 
 And what Peter found when he arrived wasnthe terror that I just mentioned to you.,So he sat down with the local chiefs, nand he listened.,And what he heard was heartbreaking.,He heard about the devastation nand the desperation,of people affected by this disease.,He heard the heartbreaking stories,about not just the damagenthat Ebola did to people,,but what it did to families nand what it did to communities.,And he listened to the local chiefs therenand what they told him --,They said, "When our children are sick, nwhen our children are dying,,we can't hold them at a time when nwe want to be closest to them.,When our relatives die, we can't take carenof them as our tradition demands.,We are not allowed to wash nthe bodies to bury them,the way our communities and nour rituals demand.,And for this reason, they werendeeply disturbed, deeply alarmed,and the entire epidemic nwas unraveling in front of them. 
 People were turning on the healthcare nworkers who had come,,the heroes who had come to try nand help save the community,,to help work with the community,nand they were unable to access them.,And what happened then was nPeter explained to the leaders.,The leaders listened. nThey turned the tables.,And Peter explained what Ebola was.nHe explained what the disease was.,He explained what it didnto their communities.,And he explained that Ebola threatened neverything that made us human.,Ebola means you can't hold your childrennthe way you would in this situation.,You can't bury your dead nthe way that you would.,You have to trust these people nin these space suits to do that for you. 
 And ladies and gentlemen, what nhappened then was rather extraordinary:,The community and the health workers, nPeter, they sat down together,and they put together a new plan nfor controlling Ebola in Lofa County.,And the reason that this is such nan important story, ladies and gentlemen,,is because today, this county, which is nright at the center of this epidemic,you've been watching, nyou've been seeing in the newspapers,,you've been seeing on nthe television screens,,today Lofa County is nearly eight weeksnwithout seeing a single case of Ebola.,(Applause) 
 Now, this doesn't mean that nthe job is done, obviously.,There's still a huge risknthat there will be additional cases there.,But what it does teach us nis that Ebola can be beaten.,That's the key thing.,Even on this scale,,even with the rapid kind of growthnthat we saw in this environment here,,we now know Ebola can be beaten.,When communities come together nwith health care workers, work together,,that's when this disease can be stopped. 
 But how did Ebola end upnin Lofa County in the first place?,Well, for that, we have to go back n12 months, to the start of this epidemic.,And as many of you know, nthis virus went undetected,,it evaded detection for three nor four months when it began.,That's because this is not na disease of West Africa,,it's a disease of Central Africa, nhalf a continent away.,People hadn't seen the disease before;,health workers hadn't seen nthe disease before.,They didn't know what nthey were dealing with,,and to make it neven more complicated,,the virus itself was causing a symptom,na type of a presentation,that wasn't classical of the disease.,So people didn't even recognize nthe disease, people who knew Ebola.,For that reason it evaded detection nfor some time, 
 But contrary to public belief nsometimes these days,,once the virus was detected, nthere was a rapid surge in of support.,MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment ncenter, as many of you know, in the area.,The World Health Organizationnand the partners that it works with,deployed eventually hundreds of people nover the next two months,to be able to help track the virus.,The problem, ladies and gentlemen,nis by then, this virus,,well known now as Ebola, nhad spread too far.,It had already outstripped what was none of the largest responses,that had been mounted so farnto an Ebola outbreak. 
 By the middle of the year,nnot just Guinea,but now Sierra Leone and Liberianwere also infected.,As the virus was spreading geographically,nthe numbers were increasing,and at this time, not only were nhundreds of people infected,and dying of the disease,,but as importantly,nthe front line responders,,the people who had gone to try and help,,the health care workers, the other nresponders,were also sick and dying by the dozens.,The presidents of these countries nrecognized the emergencies.,They met right around that time, nthey agreed on common action,and they put together an emergency njoint operation center in Conakry,to try and work together to finish thisndisease and get it stopped,,to implement the strategiesnwe talked about. 
 But what happened then was something nwe had never seen before with Ebola.,What happened then was the virus, nor someone sick with the virus,,boarded an airplane, nflew to another country,,and for the first time,nwe saw in another distant country,the virus pop up again.,This time it was in Nigeria,nin the teeming metropolis of Lagos,,21 million people.,Now the virus was in that environment.,And as you can anticipate, nthere was international alarm,,international concern on a scale that nwe hadn't seen in recent years,caused by a disease like this.,The World Health Organization immediately ncalled together an expert panel,,looked at the situation, ndeclared an international emergency.,And in doing so, the expectation would benthat there would be a huge outpouring,of international assistancento help these countries,which were in so much troublenand concern at that time. 
 But what we saw was nsomething very different.,There was some great response.,A number of countries came to assist --nmany, many NGOs and others, as you know,,but at the same time, the opposite nhappened in many places.,Alarm escalated, and very soon nthese countries found themselves,not receiving the support they needed,nbut increasingly isolated.,What we saw was commercial airlinesn[stopped] flying into these countries,and people who hadn't even beennexposed to the virus,were no longer allowed to travel.,This caused not only problems, obviously, nfor the countries themselves,,but also for the response.,Those organizations that were ntrying to bring people in,,to try and help themnrespond to the outbreak,,they could not get npeople on airplanes,,they could not get them into the ncountries to be able to respond.,In that situation,nladies and gentleman,,a virus like Ebola takes advantage. 
 And what we saw then was something nalso we hadn't seen before.,Not only did this virus ncontinue in the places,where they'd already become infected,nbut then it started to escalate,and we saw the case numbersnthat you see here,,something we'd never seen beforenon such a scale,,an exponential increase of Ebola cases,not just in these countries or the areas nalready infected in these countries,but also spreading further and ndeeper into these countries.,Ladies and gentleman,nthis was one of the most concerning,international emergencies in public healthnwe've ever seen. 
 And what happened in these countries then,,many of you saw, again, on the television,nread about in the newspapers,,we saw the health system start to collapsenunder the weight of this epidemic.,We saw the schools begin to close, nmarkets no longer started,,no longer functioned the way nthat they should in these countries.,We saw that misinformation and nmisperceptions started to spread,even faster through the communities,nwhich became even more alarmed,about the situation.,They started to recoil from those people nthat you saw in those space suits,,as they call them, nwho had come to help them.,And then the situationndeteriorated even further.,The countries had to declarena state of emergency.,Large populations needed to be quarantinednin some areas, and then riots broke out.,It was a very, very terrifying situation. 
 Around the world,nmany people began to ask,,can we ever stop Ebola nwhen it starts to spread like this?,And they started to ask, how well ndo we really know this virus?,The reality is we don't know nEbola extremely well.,It's a relatively modern diseasenin terms of what we know about it.,We've known the disease only for 40 years,,since it first popped upnin Central Africa in 1976.,But despite that, we do know many things:,We know that this virusnprobably survives in a type of a bat.,We know that it probably enters na human population,when we come in contact with a wild animal,that has been infected with the virus nand probably sickened by it.,Then we know that the virusnspreads from person to person,through contaminated body fluids.,And as you've all seen,,we know the horrific diseasenthat it then causes in humans,,where we see this disease causensevere fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,,and then unfortunately, in 70 percentnof the cases or often more, death.,This is a very dangerous,ndebilitating, and deadly disease. 
 But despite the fact that we've not knownnthis disease for a particularly long time,,and we don't know everything about it,nwe do know how to stop this disease.,There are four thingsnthat are critical to stopping Ebola.,First and foremost, the communities nhave got to understand this disease,,they've got to understand nhow it spreads and how to stop it. 
 And then we've got to be able to have nsystems that can find every single case,,every contact of those cases,,and begin to track the transmission chainsnso that you can stop transmission.,We have to have treatment centers,nspecialized Ebola treatment centers,,where the workers can be protected,as they try to provide supportnto the people who are infected,,so that they might survive the disease.,And then for those who do die,,we have to ensure there is a safe, but atnthe same time dignified, burial process,,so that there is no spread nat that time as well. 
 So we do know how to stop Ebola, and thesenstrategies work, ladies and gentlemen.,The virus was stopped in Nigeria nby these four strategies,and the people implementing nthem, obviously.,It was stopped in Senegal, where it hadnspread, and also in the other countries,that were affected by this virus, nin this outbreak.,So there's no question that nthese strategies actually work.,The big question, ladies and gentlemen,nwas whether these strategies could work,on this scale, in this situation,nwith so many countries affected,with the kind of exponential ngrowth that you saw. 
 That was the big question that we were nfacing just two or three months ago.,Today we know the answer to that question.,And we know that answer nbecause of the extraordinary work,of an incredible group of NGOs,nof governments, of local leaders,,of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian nand other organizations,that came and joined the fightnto try and stop Ebola in West Africa. 
 But what had to be done there nwas slightly different.,These countries took those strategies nI just showed you;,the community engagement,nthe case finding, contact tracing, etc.,,and they turned them on their head.,There was so much disease,nthey approached it differently.,What they decided to do was they would nfirst try and slow down this epidemic,by rapidly building as many beds asnpossible in specialized treatment centers,so that they could prevent the diseasenfrom spreading from those were infected.,They would rapidly build outnmany, many burial teams,so that they could safelyndeal with the dead,,and with that, they would try nand slow this outbreak,to see if it could actually then nbe controlled using the classic approach,of case finding and contact tracing.,And when I went to West Africanabout three months ago,,when I was therenwhat I saw was extraordinary.,I saw presidents opening emergencynoperation centers themselves against Ebola,so that they could personally coordinate nand oversee and champion,this surge of international support nto try and stop this disease.,We saw militaries from within nthose countries and from far beyond,coming in to help build nEbola treatment centers,that could be used to isolate nthose who were sick.,We saw the Red Cross movement working withnits partner agencies on the ground there,to help train the communities so thatnthey could actually safely bury their dead,in a dignified manner themselves.,And we saw the U.N. agencies, nthe World Food Program,,build a tremendous air bridge,that could get responders to every singlencorner of these countries rapidly,to be able to implement the strategiesnthat we just talked about. 
 What we saw, ladies and gentlemen, nwhich was probably most impressive,,was this incredible worknby the governments,,by the leaders in these countries,nwith the communities,,to try to ensure people nunderstood this disease,,understood the extraordinary things they nwould have to do to try and stop Ebola.,And as a result, ladies and gentlemen,,we saw something that we did not knownonly two or three months earlier,,whether or not it would be possible.,What we saw was nwhat you see now in this graph,,when we took stock on December 1.,What we saw was we could nbend that curve, so to speak,,change this exponential growth,,and bring some hope backnto the ability to control this outbreak.,And for this reason, ladies and gentlemen,nthere's absolutely no question now,that we can catch up with this outbreak nin West Africa and we can beat Ebola. 
 The big question, though, nthat many people are asking,,even when they saw this curve, they said,,"Well, hang on a minute --nthat's great you can slow it down,,but can you actuallyndrive it down to zero?",We already answered that question nback at the beginning of this talk,,when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.,We told you the storynhow Lofa County got to a situation,where they have not seennEbola for eight weeks.,But there are similar stories from nthe other countries as well.,From Gueckedou in Guinea,,the first area where the first case wasnactually diagnosed. 
 We've seen very, very few casesnin the last couple of months,,and here in Kenema, in Sierra Leone, nanother area in the epicenter,,we have not seen the virusnfor more than a couple of weeks --,way too early to declare nvictory, obviously,,but evidence, ladies and gentlemen,,not only can the response ncatch up to the disease,,but this disease can be driven to zero. 
 The challenge now, of course, nis doing this on the scale needed,right across these three countries,nand that is a huge challenge.,Because when you've been at somethingnfor this long, on this scale,,two other big threats ncome in to join the virus.,The first of those is complacency,,the risk that as this ndisease curve starts to bend,,the media look elsewhere, nthe world looks elsewhere.,Complacency always a risk. 
 And the other risk, of course, is whennyou've been working so hard for so long,,and slept so few hours nover the past months,,people are tired, people become fatigued,,and these new risks nstart to creep into the response.,Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you todaynI've just come back from West Africa.,The people of these countries,nthe leaders of these countries,,they are not complacent.,They want to drive Ebola to zero nin their countries.,And these people, yes, they're tired, nbut they are not fatigued.,They have an energy, they have a courage,,they have the strength nto get this finished. 
 What they need, ladiesnand gentlemen, at this point,,is the unwavering support of the ninternational community,,to stand with them,,to bolster and bring even more support nat this time, to get the job finished.,Because finishing Ebola right now nmeans turning the tables on this virus,,and beginning to hunt it. 
 Remember, this virus, this whole crisis, nrather, started with one case,,and is going to finish with one case.,But it will only finish if those countriesnhave got enough epidemiologists,,enough health workers, enough logisticiansnand enough other people working with them,to be able to find every one nof those cases, track their contacts,and make sure that this disease nstops once and for all. 
 Ladies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.,Now we need you to take this story outnto tell it to the people who will listen,and educate them non what it means to beat Ebola,,and more importantly,nwe need you to advocate with the people,who can help us bring the resources wenneed to these countries,,to beat this disease.,There are a lot of people out there nwho will survive and will thrive,,in part because of what you do nto help us beat Ebola. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I cannot forget them.,Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei,,Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild,,Hans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya,,Nancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema,,and the list is longer.,For many, their existence,ntheir humanity,,has been reduced to statistics,,coldly recorded as "security incidents." 
 For me, they were colleagues,belonging to that communitynof humanitarian aid workers,that tried to bring a bit of comfort,to the victims of the warsnin Chechnya in the '90s.,They were nurses, logisticians,nshelter experts,,paralegals, interpreters.,And for this service, they were murdered,,their families torn apart,,and their story largely forgotten.,No one was ever sentencednfor these crimes. 
 I cannot forget them.,They live in me somehow,,their memories giving menmeaning every day.,But they are also hauntingnthe dark street of my mind. 
 As humanitarian aid workers,,they made the choicento be at the side of the victim,,to provide some assistance,nsome comfort, some protection,,but when they needednprotection themselves,,it wasn't there.,When you see the headlinesnof your newspaper these days,with the war in Iraq or in Syria --,aid worker abducted, hostage executed --,but who were they?,Why were they there?,What motivated them?,How did we becomenso indifferent to these crimes?,This is why I am here today with you.,We need to find better waysnto remember them.,We also need to explain the key valuesnto which they dedicated their lives.,We also need to demand justice. 
 When in '96 I was sent,by the United Nations High Commissionernfor Refugees to the North Caucasus,,I knew some of the risks.,Five colleagues had been killed,,three had been seriously injured,,seven had already been taken hostage.,So we were careful.,We were using armored nvehicles, decoy cars,,changing patterns of travel,nchanging homes,,all sorts of security measures. 
 Yet on a cold winter nightnof January '98, it was my turn.,When I entered my flatnin Vladikavkaz with a guard,,we were surrounded by armed men.,They took the guard,nthey put him on the floor,,they beat him up in front of me,,tied him, dragged him away.,I was handcuffed, blindfolded,nand forced to kneel,,as the silencer of a gunnpressed against my neck.,When it happens to you,,there is no time for thinking,nno time for praying.,My brain went on automatic,,rewinding quicklynthe life I'd just left behind.,It took me long minutes to figure out,that those masked men therenwere not there to kill me,,but that someone, somewhere,nhad ordered my kidnapping.,Then a process of dehumanizationnstarted that day.,I was no more than just a commodity. 
 I normally don't talk about this,,but I'd like to share a bit with younsome of those 317 days of captivity.,I was kept in an underground cellar,,total darkness,,for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,,and then the guards nwould come, normally two.,They would bring a big piece of bread,,a bowl of soup, and a candle.,That candle would burn for 15 minutes,,15 minutes of precious light,,and then they would take it away,nand I returned to darkness.,I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.,I could do only four small steps.,I always dreamt of the fifth one.,And no TV, no radio,nno newspaper, no one to talk to.,I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,,just two metal buckets open,none for water, for one waste.,Can you imagine that mock executionncan be a pastime for guards,when they are sadisticnor when they are just bored or drunk?,We are breaking my nerves very slowly. 
 Isolation and darknessnare particularly difficult to describe.,How do you describe nothing?,There are no words for the depthsnof loneliness I reached,in that very thin bordernbetween sanity and madness.,In the darkness, sometimesnI played imaginary games of checkers.,I would start with the black,,play with the white,,back to the blackntrying to trick the other side.,I don't play checkers anymore.,I was tormented by the thoughts of mynfamily and my colleague, the guard, Edik.,I didn't know what had happened to him.,I was trying not to think,,I tried to fill up my time,by doing all sorts of physicalnexercise on the spot.,I tried to pray, I tried all sortsnof memorization games.,But darkness also creates imagesnand thoughts that are not normal.,One part of your brain wants younto resist, to shout, to cry,,and the other part of the brainnorders you to shut up,and just go through it.,It's a constant internal debate;nthere is no one to arbitrate. 
 Once a guard came to me,nvery aggressively, and he told me,,"Today you're going to kneelnand beg for your food.",I wasn't in a good mood,nso I insulted him.,I insulted his mother,nI insulted his ancestors.,The consequence was moderate:nhe threw the food into my waste.,The day after he came backnwith the same demand.,He got the same answer,,which had the same consequence.,Four days later,nthe body was full of pain.,I didn't know hunger hurt so muchnwhen you have so little.,So when the guards came down,,I knelt.,I begged for my food.,Submission was the only way for mento make it to another candle. 
 After my kidnapping,,I was transferrednfrom North Ossetia to Chechnya,,three days of slow travelnin the trunks of different cars,,and upon arrival, I was interrogated,for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.,The routine was always the same:,a bit more light, 45 minutes.,He would come down to the cellar,,he would ask the guardsnto tie me on the chair,,and he would turn on the music loud.,And then he would yell questions.,He would scream. He would beat me.,I'll spare you the details.,There are many questionsnI could not understand,,and there are some questionsnI did not want to understand.,The length of the interrogationnwas the duration of the tape:,15 songs, 45 minutes.,I would always long for the last song. 
 On one day, one night in that cellar,nI don't know what it was,,I heard a child crying above my head,,a boy, maybe two or three years old.,Footsteps, confusion, people running.,So when Ruslan came the day after,,before he put the first question to me,,I asked him, "How is your son today?nIs he feeling better?",Ruslan was taken by surprise.,He was furious that the guardsnmay have leaked some details,about his private life.,I kept talking about NGOsnsupplying medicines to local clinics,that may help his son to get better.,And we talked about education,nwe talked about families.,He talked to me about his children.,I talked to him about my daughters.,And then he'd talk about guns,nabout cars, about women,,and I had to talk about guns,nabout cars, about women.,And we talked untilnthe last song on the tape.,Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.,He did not touch me anymore.,He did not ask any other questions.,I was no longer just a commodity. 
 Two days after, I was transferrednto another place.,There, a guard came to me,nvery close -- it was quite unusual --,and he said withna very soft voice, he said,,"I'd like to thank you,for the assistance your organizationnprovided my family,when we were displacednin nearby Dagestan.",What could I possibly reply?,It was so painful.nIt was like a blade in the belly.,It took me weeks of internal thinkingnto try to reconcile,the good reasons we hadnto assist that family,and the soldier of fortune he became.,He was young, he was shy.,I never saw his face.,He probably meant well.,But in those 15 seconds,,he made me question everything we did,,all the sacrifices. 
 He made me think also how they see us.,Until then, I had assumednthat they know why we are there,and what we are doing.,One cannot assume this.,Well, explaining why we do thisnis not that easy,,even to our closest relatives.,We are not perfect, we are not superior,,we are not the world's fire brigade,,we are not superheroes,,we don't stop wars,,we know that humanitarian response is notna substitute for political solution.,Yet we do this because one life matters.,Sometimes that's the onlyndifference you make --,one individual, one family,na small group of individuals --,and it matters.,When you have a tsunami,nan earthquake or a typhoon,,you see teams of rescuersncoming from all over the world,,searching for survivors for weeks.,Why? Nobody questions this.,Every life matters,,or every life should matter.,This is the same for usnwhen we help refugees,,people displaced within their countrynby conflict, or stateless persons, 
 I know many people,,when they are confrontednby overwhelming suffering,,they feel powerless and they stop there.,It's a pity, because there arenso many ways people can help.,We don't stop with that feeling.,We try to do whatever we cannto provide some assistance,,some protection, some comfort.,We have to.,We can't do otherwise.,It's what makes us feel,nI don't know, simply human. 
 That's a picture of menthe day of my release.,Months after my release,nI met the then-French prime minister.,The second thing he told me:,"You were totally irresponsiblento go to the North Caucasus.,You don't know how manynproblems you've created for us.",It was a short meeting.,(Laughter) 
 I think helping peoplenin danger is responsible.,In that war, that nobodynseriously wanted to stop,,and we have many of these today,,bringing some assistance to people in neednand a bit of protection,was not just an act of humanity,,it was making a real differencenfor the people.,Why could he not understand this?,We have a responsibility to try.,You've heard about that concept:nResponsibility to Protect.,Outcomes may dependnon various parameters.,We may even fail,nbut there is worse than failing --,it's not even trying when we can. 
 Well, if you are met this way,nif you sign up for this sort of job,,your life is going to be fullnof joy and sadness,,because there are a lot of peoplenwe cannot help,,a lot of people we cannot protect,na lot of people we did not save.,I call them my ghost,,and by having witnessedntheir suffering from close,,you take a bit nof that suffering on yourself.,Many young humanitarian workers,go through their first experiencenwith a lot of bitterness.,They are thrown into situationsnwhere they are witness,,but they are powerlessnto bring any change.,They have to learn to accept it,and gradually turn thisninto positive energy.,It's difficult.,Many don't succeed,,but for those who do,nthere is no other job like this.,You can see the differencenyou make every day. 
 Humanitarian aid workersnknow the risk they are taking,in conflict areas or nin post-conflict environments,,yet our life, our job, is becoming nincreasingly life-threatening,,and the sanctity of our life is fading.,Do you know that since the millennium,,the number of attacks on humanitarian naid workers has tripled?,2013 broke new records:,155 colleagues killed,,171 seriously wounded,,134 abducted.,So many broken lives.,Until the beginning of the civil warnin Somalia in the late '80s,,humanitarian aid workersnwere sometimes victims,of what we call collateral damages,,but by and large we were notnthe target of these attacks.,This has changed.,Look at this picture.,Baghdad, August 2003:,24 colleagues were killed.,Gone are the days whenna U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross,would automatically protect us. 
 Criminal groups and some political groups,have cross-fertilizednover the last 20 years,,and they've created these sort of hybrids,with whom we have no way of communicating.,Humanitarian principles are tested,nquestioned, and often ignored,,but perhaps more importantly,nwe have abandoned the search for justice.,There seems to benno consequence whatsoever,for attacks againstnhumanitarian aid workers.,After my release, I was toldnnot to seek any form of justice.,It won't do you any good,nthat's what I was told.,Plus, you're going to put in dangernthe life of other colleagues.,It took me years to see the sentencing 
 of three people associated nwith my kidnapping,,but this was the exception.,There was no justice for any nof the humanitarian aid workers,killed or abducted in Chechnyanbetween '95 and '99,,and it's the same all over the world.,This is unacceptable.,This is inexcusable.,Attacks on humanitarian aid workersnare war crimes in international law.,Those crimes should not go unpunished.,We must end this cycle of impunity.,We must consider that those attacksnagainst humanitarian aid workers,are attacks against humanity itself.,That makes me furious. 
 I know I'm very luckyncompared to the refugees I work for.,I don't know what it is to have seennmy whole town destroyed.,I don't know what it is to have seennmy relatives shot in front of me.,I don't know what it is to losenthe protection of my country.,I also know that I'm very luckyncompared to other hostages.,Four days before my eventful release,nfour hostages were beheaded,a few miles away from wherenI was kept in captivity.,Why them?,Why am I here today?,No easy answer. 
 I was received with a lot of supportnthat I got from my relatives,,from colleagues, from friends,nfrom people I didn't know.,They have helped me over the yearsnto come out of the darkness.,Not everyone was treatednwith the same attention.,How many of my colleagues,nafter a traumatic incident,,took their own life?,I can count nine that I knew personally.,How many of my colleaguesnwent through a difficult divorce,after a traumatic experience,because they could not explainnanything anymore to their spouse?,I've lost that count.,There is a price for this type of life. 
 In Russia, all war monuments haventhis beautiful inscription at the top.,It says, (In Russian),"No one is forgotten,nnothing is forgotten." 
 I do not forget my lost colleagues.,I cannot forget anything.,I call on you to remember their dedication,and demand that humanitariannaid workers around the world,be better protected.,We should not let that light of hopenthey have brought to be switched off. 
 After my ordeal, a lot of colleaguesnasked me, "But why do you continue?,Why do you do this sort of job?,Why do you have to go back to it?",My answer was very simple:,If I had quit,,that would have meantnmy kidnapper had won.,They would have taken my soul,and my humanity. 
 Thank you.
