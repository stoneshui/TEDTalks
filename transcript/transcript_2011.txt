I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh.",It's essentially a fundamental shift,in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.,And it's starting to look at --,not always and not for everything --,but in certain moments of time,,access to certain kinds of goods and service,will trump ownership of them.,And so it's the pursuit of better things,,easily shared.,And we come from a long tradition of sharing.,We've shared transportation.,We've shared wine and food,and other sorts of fabulous experiences,in coffee bars in Amsterdam.,We've also shared other sorts of entertainment --,sports arenas, public parks,,concert halls, libraries,,universities.,All these things are share-platforms,,but sharing ultimately starts and ends,with what I refer to,as the "mother of all share-platforms." 
 And as I think about the mesh,and I think about, well, what's driving it,,how come it's happening now,,I think there's a number of vectors,that I want to give you as background.,One is the recession --,that the recession has caused us,to rethink our relationship,with the things in our lives relative to the value --,so starting to align the value,with the true cost.,Secondly, population growth,and density into cities.,More people, smaller spaces,,less stuff.,Climate change:,we're trying to reduce the stress,in our personal lives and in our communities,and on the planet.,Also, there's been this recent distrust,of big brands, global big brands,,in a bunch of different industries,,and that's created an opening.,Research is showing here, in the States,,and in Canada and Western Europe,,that most of us are much more open,to local companies,,or brands that maybe we haven't heard of.,Whereas before, we went with the big brands,that we were sure we trusted.,And last is that,we're more connected now to more people on the planet,than ever before --,except for if you're sitting next to someone. 
 (Laughter) 
 The other thing that's worth considering,is that we've made a huge investment,over decades and decades,,and tens of billions of dollars,have gone into this investment,that now is our inheritance.,It's a physical infrastructure,that allows us to get from point A to point B,and move things that way.,It's also -- Web and mobile,allow us to be connected,and create all kinds of platforms and systems,,and the investment of those technologies,and that infrastructure,is really our inheritance.,It allows us to engage,in really new and interesting ways. 
 And so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company,,brings together these three things:,our ability to connect to each other --,most of us are walking around with these mobile devices,that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled --,allows us to find each other,and find things in time and space.,And third is that physical things,are readable on a map --,so restaurants, a variety of venues,,but also with GPS and other technology,like RFID,and it continues to expand beyond that,,we can also track things that are moving,,like a car, a taxicab, a transit system,,a box that's moving through time and space.,And so that sets up,for making access to get goods and services,more convenient and less costly in many cases,than owning them. 
 For example, I want to use Zipcar.,How many people here have experienced,car-sharing or bike-sharing?,Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you.,Basically Zipcar,is the largest car-sharing company in the world.,They did not invent car-sharing.,Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.,One of the founders went to Switzerland,,saw it implemented someplace,,said, "Wow, that looks really cool.,I think we can do that in Cambridge,",brought it to Cambridge,and they started -- two women --,Robin Chase being the other person who started it.,Zipcar got some really important things right.,First, they really understood,that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.,And so they were very clever,about the way that they packaged car-sharing.,They made it sexy. They made it fresh.,They made it aspirational.,If you were a member of the club,,when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.,The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars,that were hollowed out or something.,They picked these sexy cars.,They targeted to universities.,They made sure that the demographic,for who they were targeting and the car was all matching.,It was a very nice experience,,and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked. 
 And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.,But they understood fundamentally,that they are not a car company.,They understand that they are an information company.,Because when we buy a car,we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow --,usually as quickly as possible.,But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,,you might use an E.V. to commute,,you get a truck because you're doing a home project.,When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.,And you're going to the mountains to ski,,you get different accessories put on the car,for doing that sort of thing.,Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back,,collecting all sorts of data,about our behavior and how we interact with the service.,And so it's not only an option for them,,but I believe it's an imperative,for Zipcar and other mesh companies,to actually just wow us,,to be like a concierge service.,Because we give them so much information,,and they are entitled to really see,how it is that we're moving.,They're in really good shape to anticipate,what we're going to want next. 
 And so what percent of the day,do you think the average person uses a car?,What percentage of the time?,Any guesses?,Those are really very good.,I was imagining it was like,20 percent when I first started.,The number across the U.S. and Western Europe,is eight percent.,And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,,90 percent of the time,,something that costs us a lot of money --,personally, and also we organize our cities around it,and all sorts of things --,90 percent of the time it's sitting around.,So for this reason,,I think one of the other themes with the mesh,is essentially that, if we squeeze hard,on things that we've thrown away,,there's a lot of value in those things.,What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000. 
 In the last year, 2010,,two car companies started,,one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,,and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.,They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,,because the two things that really work for car-sharing,is, one, the car has to be available,,and two, it's within one or two blocks,of where you stand.,Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office,is probably your neighbor's car,,and it's probably also available.,So people have created this business.,Zipcar started a decade earlier,,in 2000.,It took them six years,to get 1,000 cars in service.,WhipCar, which started April of last year,,it took them six months,to get 1,000 cars in the service.,So, really interesting.,People are making anywhere between,200 and 700 dollars a month,letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.,So it's like vacation rentals for cars.,Since I'm here --,and I hope some people in the audience,are in the car business --,(Laughter),-- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things --,we saw cable-ready TVs,and WiFi-ready Notebooks --,it would be really great if, any minute now,,you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.,Because it just creates more flexibility.,It allows us as owners to have other options.,And I think we're going there anyway. 
 The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses --,and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix,that are full mesh businesses,,or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,,car manufacturers,,who are beginning to offer,their own car-share services,as well as a second flanker brand,,or as really a test, I think --,is to make sharing irresistible.,We have experiences in our lives, certainly,,when sharing has been irresistible.,It's just, how do we make that recurrent,and scale it?,We know also, because we're connected in social networks,,that it's easy to create delight,in one little place.,It's contagious because we're all connected to each other.,So if I have a terrific experience,and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.,The opposite, as we know, is also true,,often more true. 
 So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,,doing the things that gourmet food trucks do,,and they've gathered quite a following.,In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,,I look at things as platforms.,Platforms are invitations.,So creating Craigslist,or iTunes and the iPhone developer network,,there are all these networks -- Facebook as well.,These platforms invite all sorts of developers,and all sorts of people,to come with their ideas and their opportunity,to create and target an application,for a particular audience.,And honestly, it's full of surprises.,Because I don't think any of us in this room,could have predicted the sorts of applications,that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,,for example, two years ago,,when Mark announced,that they were going to go with a platform. 
 So in this way, I think that cities are platforms,,and certainly Detroit is a platform.,The invitation of bringing,makers and artists and entrepreneurs --,it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity,and helps a city to thrive.,It's inviting participation,,and cities have, historically,,invited all sorts of participation.,Now we're saying that there's other options as well.,So, for example, city departments,can open up transit data.,Google has made available transit data API.,And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.,that have provided the transit data,,and different developers are building applications.,So I was having a coffee in Portland,,and half-of-a-latte in,and the little board in the cafe,all of a sudden starts showing me,that the next bus is coming in three minutes,and the train is coming in 16 minutes.,And so it's reliable, real data,that's right in my face, where I am,,so I can finish the latte. 
 There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:,about 21 percent,of vacant commercial and industrial space.,That space is not vital.,The areas around it lack vitality,and vibrancy and engagement.,There's this thing -- how many people here,have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?,Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.,And this is a very mesh-y thing.,Essentially, there are all sorts,of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.,There's a pop-up general store every three weeks,,and they do a fantastic job,of making a very social event,happening for foodies.,Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.,Subsequent to that,,after it's been going for about a year now,,they actually started to lease and create and extend.,An area that was edgy-artsy,is now starting to become much cooler,and engage a lot more people.,So this is an example.,The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,,and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.,But these sorts of things are happening,in many different environments.,From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do,is create perishability and urgency.,It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:,sold out.,And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention,is a wonderful thing. 
 So a lot of what we see in the mesh,,and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built,allows us to define, refine and scale.,It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,,to go to market,,to be in conversation with people,,listen, refine something and go back.,It's very cost-effective,,and it's very mesh-y.,The infrastructure enables that. 
 In closing, and as we're moving towards the end,,I just also want to encourage --,and I'm willing to share my failures as well,,though not from the stage.,(Laughter),I would just like to say that one of the big things,,when we look at waste,and when we look at ways that we can really be generous,and contribute to each other,,but also move to create a better economic situation,and a better environmental situation,,is by sharing failures.,And one quick example,is Velib, in 2007,,came forward in Paris,with a very bold proposition,,a very big bike-sharing service.,They made a lot of mistakes.,They had some number of big successes.,But they were very transparent, or they had to be,,in the way that they exposed,what worked and didn't work.,And so B.C. in Barcelona,and B-cycle,and Boris Bikes in London --,no one has had to repeat,the version 1.0 screw-ups,and expensive learning exercises,that happened in Paris.,So the opportunity when we're connected,is also to share failures and successes. 
 We're at the very beginning of something,that, what we're seeing,and the way that mesh companies are coming forward,,is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.,I have a website -- it's a directory --,and it started with about 1,200 companies,,and in the last two-and-a-half months,it's up to about 3,300 companies.,And it grows on a very regular daily basis.,But it's very much at the beginning. 
 So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.,And thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm here today,to start a revolution.,Now before you get up in arms,,or you break into song,,or you pick a favorite color,,I want to define what I mean by revolution.,By revolution,,I mean a drastic and far-reaching change,in the way we think and behave --,the way we think and the way we behave.,Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?,We need a revolution,because things aren't working; they're just not working.,And that makes me really sad,because I'm sick and tired of things not working.,You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.,I'm sick and tired of us being last. 
 And we are last place in so many things --,for example, social factors.,We're last place in Europe in innovation.,There we are right at the end, right at the bottom,,last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.,We're last place in health care,,and that's important for a sense of well-being.,And there we are, not just last in the E.U.,,we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.,And worst of all,,it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.,We're the saddest place on Earth,,relative to GDP per capita --,the saddest place on Earth.,That's social. Let's look at education.,Where do we rank three weeks ago,in another report by the OECD?,Last in reading, math and science. Last.,Business:,The lowest perception in the E.U.,that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.,Why as a result, what happens?,The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.,And this is despite the fact,that everybody knows that small business,is the engine of economies.,We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.,So if our engine's broken, guess what?,Last in Europe GDP per capita.,Last.,So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians,are not optimistic about the future.,We're unhappy, we have bad education,,and we have the worst businesses. 
 And these are facts, guys.,This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.,It's not.,It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.,So I think it should be really, really clear,that our system is broken.,The way we think, the way we behave,,our operating system of behaving is broken.,We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave,to transform Bulgaria for the better,,for ourselves, for our friends,,for our family and for our future.,How did this happen?,Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?,I think we're last because --,and this is going to be drastic to some of you --,because we are handicapping ourselves.,We're holding ourselves back,because we don't value play.,I said "play," all right. 
 In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.,Babies play, kids play,,adults play.,We don't value play.,In fact, we devalue play.,And we devalue it in three areas.,Let's go back to the same three areas.,Social: 45 years of what?,Of communism --,of valuing the society and the state over the individual,and squashing, inadvertently,,creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.,And instead, what do we value?,Because it's shown,the way we apply, generate and use knowledge,is affected by our social and institutional context,,which told us what in communism?,To be serious.,To be really, really serious.,It did.,(Applause),Be serious.,I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park,for letting my kids play on the ground.,Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal,,or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them.,I have been told by babas and dyados,that we shouldn't let our kids play so much,because life is serious,and we need to train them for the seriousness of life. 
 We have a serious meme running through.,It's a social gene running through us.,It's a serious gene.,It's 45 years of it,that's created what I call the "baba factor.",(Laughter),(Applause),And here's how it works.,Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby.",Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!,But then what happens in step three?,I want to go back to work,because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.,I'm going to give bebko to baba.,But we need to remember,that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.,So what happens?,She passes that virus on to baby,,and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees --,for that serious meme,to get out of our operating system. 
 What happens then?,It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system,that has little changed for 100 years,,that values rote learning,,memorization and standardization,,and devalues self-expression, self-exploration,,questioning, creativity and play.,It's a crap system.,True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.,We went to this prestigious little school,and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week,and science eight times a week,and reading five times a day and all this stuff.,And we said, "Well what about play and recess?",And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule.",(Laughter),And we said, "He's five.",What a crime. What a crime.,And it's a crime,that our education system is so serious because education is serious,that we're creating mindless, robotic workers,to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.,But I'm sorry, the problems of today,are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.,We need adaptability,,the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.,We don't need mechanized workers.,But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.,We create robotic workers that we treat like assets,,to lever and just throw away. 
 What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?,Autocratic --,do what I say because I'm the chef.,I'm the boss and I know better than you.,Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.,(Laughter),Controlling --,you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make,a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.,So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone,,don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,,don't be on I.M.,That's somehow unprofessional and bad.,And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling,because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued,and you're not having any fun.,In social, in education and in our business,,don't value play.,And that's why we're last,,because we don't value play. 
 And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.,It can't be because of play.,Just play, that's a stupid thing.",We have the serious meme in us.,Well I'm going to say no.,And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech --,that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,,that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.,Play:,our brains,are hardwired for play.,Evolution has selected,,over millions and billions of years,,for play in animals and in humans.,And you know what?,Evolution does a really, really good job,of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us,and selecting traits for competitive advantage.,Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.,Throughout the animal kingdom, for example:,ants. Ants play.,Maybe you didn't know that.,But when they're playing,,they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.,Rats play, but what you might not have known,is that rats that play more,have bigger brains,and they learn tasks better,,skills.,Kittens play. We all know kittens play.,But what you may not know,is that kittens deprived of play,are unable to interact socially.,They can still hunt, but they can't be social.,Bears play.,But what you may not know,is that bears that play more survive longer.,It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.,It's the ones that play more. 
 And a final really interesting study --,it's been shown, a correlation,between play and brain size.,The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.,Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.,But who do you think,with the biggest brains are the biggest players?,Yours truly: humans.,Kids play, we play --,of every nationality, of every race,,of every color, of every religion.,It's a universal thing -- we play.,And it's not just kids, it's adults too. 
 Really cool term: neoteny --,the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.,And who are the biggest neotenists?,Humans. We play sports.,We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.,We play musical instruments.,We dance, we kiss, we sing,,we just goof around.,We're designed by nature to play,from birth to old age.,We're designed to do that continuously --,to play and play a lot,and not stop playing.,It is a huge benefit.,Just like there's benefits to animals,,there's benefits to humans.,For example, it's been shown,to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,,in the area where it controls emotions.,It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development,where a lot of cognition is happening.,As a result, what happens?,We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.,We develop better decision-making ability,if we play more. 
 These guys are facts.,It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;,it's cold, hard science.,These are the benefits to play.,It is a genetic birthright that we have,,like walking or speaking or seeing.,And if we handicap ourselves with play,,we handicap ourselves,as if we would with any other birthright that we have.,We hold ourselves back.,Little exercise just for a second:,close your eyes,and try to imagine a world without play.,Imagine a world without theater, without the arts,,without song, without dancing,,without soccer, without football,,without laughter.,What does this world look like?,It's pretty bleak.,It's pretty glum. 
 Now imagine your workplace.,Is it fun? Is it playful?,Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.,Is it fun? Is it playful?,Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,,restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?,We have this concept,that the opposite of play is work.,We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.,"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,",or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.,He's going to think I'm not working hard.",But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards. 
 The opposite of play,is not work.,The opposite of play,is depression. It's depression.,In fact,,play improves our work.,Just like there's benefits for humans and animals,,there's benefits for play at work.,For example, it stimulates creativity.,It increases our openness to change.,It improves our ability to learn.,It provides a sense of purpose and mastery --,two key motivational things,that increase productivity,,through play.,So before you start thinking of play as just not serious,,play doesn't mean frivolous.,You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing,,he's serious about it, but he loves it.,He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.,A doctor might be serious,,but laughter's still a great medicine.,Our thinking is backwards.,We shouldn't be feeling guilty.,We should be celebrating play. 
 Quick example from the corporate world.,FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.,If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great,,they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.,What happens? They give better service --,not worse, but better.,And when customers call for service,and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,,how do the customers feel? They feel great.,And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?,They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends,,which leads to more profit.,People, service, profit.,Play increases productivity, not decreases. 
 And you're going to say,,"Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States,,but it can't work in Bulgaria.,No way. We're different.",It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.,One, play is universal.,There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,,besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.,Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.,When I got there, we had zero happy customers.,Not one customer would refer us.,I asked them all.,We had marginal profit -- I did.,We had marginal profits,,and we had unhappy stakeholders.,Through some basic change,,change like improving transparency,,change like promoting self-direction,and collaboration, encouraging collaboration,,not autocracy,,the things like having a results-focus.,I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.,I care that your customer and your team is happy,and you're organized with that.,Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?,Basically promoting fun.,Through promoting fun and a great environment,,we were able to transform Sciant,and, in just three short years --,sounds like a long time, but change is slow --,every customer, from zero to every customer referring us,,above average profits for the industry,and happy stakeholders.,And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?",Well we did win, every year that we entered,,one of the rankings for best employer for small business.,Independent analysis from anonymous employees,on their surveys.,It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.,There's nothing holding us back,,except our own mentality about play. 
 So some steps that we can take -- to finish up --,how to make this revolution through play.,First of all, you have to believe me.,If you don't believe me,,well just go home and think about it some more or something.,Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you,,you need to rediscover play.,Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy,,that you enjoyed only six months ago,,but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy,,because you feel like you have to be serious,,rediscover it.,I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.,Rediscover that,because you're the leaders,,the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.,You're the ones that have to go back to the office,or talk to your friends,and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.,You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,,your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.,You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you.",Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.,I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,,and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.,I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.,I'm going to let you challenge authority.,Because it's by challenging the way things are always done,is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in,and create innovative solutions,to problems of today. 
 We're not always right as leaders.,We're going to eradicate fear.,Fear is the enemy of play.,And we're going to do things,like eliminate restrictions.,You know what, let them use their mobile phone,for personal calls -- heaven forbid.,Let them be on the Internet.,Let them be on instant messengers.,Let them take long lunches.,Lunch is like the recess for work.,It's when you go out in the world,and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends,,you have a beer, you have some food, you talk,,you get some synergy of ideas,that maybe you wouldn't have had before.,Let them do it. Give them some freedom,,and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.,We spend so much of our lives at the workplace,,and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind,,so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?,Is that all there was?",Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.,(Laughter) 
 So in summary,,we need a drastic change,in the way we think and behave,,but we don't need,a workers' revolution.,We don't need a workers' revolution.,What we need,is a players' uprising.,What we need is a players' uprising.,What we need is a players' uprising.,Seriously, we need to band together.,Today is the start of the uprising.,But what you need to do,is fan the flames of the revolution.,You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories,of what worked,about reinvigorating our lives, our schools,,and our work with play;,about how play promotes,a sense of promise and self-fulfillment;,of how play promotes innovation and productivity,,and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.,Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together,,and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play,,we can transform Bulgaria for the better. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to have a pretty simple idea,that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,,and that is all of us are makers.,I really believe that.,All of us are makers.,We're born makers.,We have this ability,to make things,,to grasp things with our hands.,We use words like "grasp" metaphorically,to also think about understanding things.,We don't just live, but we make.,We create things.,Well I'm going to show you a group of makers,from Maker Faire and various places.,It doesn't come out particularly well,,but that's a particularly tall bicycle.,It's a scraper bike; it's called --,from Oakland.,And this is a particularly small scooter,for a gentleman of this size.,But he's trying to power it, or motorize it,,with a drill.,(Laughter),And the question he had is,,"Can I do it? Can it be done?",Apparently it can.,So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;,they're people who love,doing what they do.,They don't always even know why they're doing it. 
 We have begun organizing makers,at our Maker Faire.,There was one held in Detroit here last summer,,and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.,But we hold them in San Francisco --,(Applause),-- and in New York.,And it's a fabulous event,to just meet and talk to these people who make things,and are there to just show them to you and talk about them,and have a great conversation. 
 (Video) Guy: I might get one of those. 
 Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins. 
 Guy: Where did you guys get those? 
 Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.) 
 DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.,We got there first. 
 Lady: Will you glide with us? 
 DD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain.",And you can barely see it,,but it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall,just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.,So imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?,No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?",That's the experience of a clever ride.,And of course, we have fashion.,People are remaking things into fashion.,I don't know if this is called a basket-bra,,but it ought to be something like that.,We have art students getting together,,taking old radiator parts,and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.,They did that in the summer, and it was very warm. 
 Now this one takes a little bit of explaining.,You know what those are, right?,Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.,Now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist.,And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.

 DD: So Richard came up from Houston last year,to visit us in Detroit here,and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.,So, are you a maker?,How many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?,That's a pretty good --,but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.,And again, think about it.,You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;,you're makers of lots of different things,,and partly what interests me today,is you're makers of your own world,,and particularly the role that technology has,in your life.,You're really a driver or a passenger --,to use a Volkswagen phrase.,Makers are in control.,That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.,They want to figure out how things work;,they want to get access to it;,and they want to control it.,They want to use it to their own purpose. 
 Makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.,They're not mainstream.,They're a little bit radical.,They're a bit subversive in what they do.,But at one time,,it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.,It was not something you'd even remark upon.,And I found this old video.,And I'll tell you more about it, but just ... 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are,,we are makers.,With our strengths and our minds and spirit,,we gather, we form, and we fashion.,Makers and shapers,and put-it-togetherers. 
 DD: So it goes on to show you,people making things out of wood,,a grandfather making a ship in a bottle,,a woman making a pie --,somewhat standard fare of the day.,But it was a sense of pride,that we made things,,that the world around us was made by us.,It didn't just exist.,We made it, and we were connected to it that way.,And I think that's tremendously important.,Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.,This particular reel --,it's an industrial video --,but it was shown in drive-in theaters,in 1961 --,in the Detroit area, in fact --,and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho.",(Laughter),So I like to think there was something going on there,of the new generation of makers,coming out of this, plus "Psycho." 
 This is Andrew Archer.,I met Andrew at one of our community meetings,putting together Maker Faire.,Andrew had moved to Detroit,from Duluth, Minnesota.,And I talked to his mom,,and I ended up doing a story on him,for a magazine called Kidrobot.,He's just a kid that grew up,playing with tools instead of toys.,He liked to take things apart.,His mother gave him a part of the garage,,and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.,And then he didn't particularly like school that much,,but he got involved in robotics competitions,,and he realized he had a talent,,and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.,And he began building robots.,And when I sat down next to him,,he was telling me about a company he formed,,and he was building some robots for automobile factories,to move things around on the factory floor.,And that's why he moved to Michigan.,But he also moved here,to meet other people doing what he's doing.,And this kind of gets to this important idea today. 
 This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here,in a hackerspace.,And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.,And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.,But these are like clubs --,they're sharing tools, sharing space,,sharing expertise in what to make.,And so it's a very interesting phenomenon,that's going across the world.,But essentially these are people that are playing with technology.,Let me say that again: playing.,They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.,They're playing,to discover what the technology can do,,and probably to discover what they can do themselves,,what their own capabilities are. 
 Now the other thing that I think is taking off,,another reason making is taking off today,,is there's some great new tools out there.,And you can't see this very well on the screen,,but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.,It's a micro-controller.,If you don't know what those are, they're just the "brains.",So they're the brains of maker projects,,and here's an example of one.,And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox --,so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.,So you figure out how to program this,,and you put this in your mailbox.,And when someone opens your mailbox,,you get a notification,,an alert message goes to your iPhone.,Now that could be a dog door,,it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,,like a little brother into a little sister's room.,There's all kinds of different things,that you can imagine for that. 
 Now here's something -- a 3D printer.,That's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting.,This is Makerbot.,And there are industrial versions of this --,about 20,000 dollars.,These guys came up with a kit version,for 750 dollars,,and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks,can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.,Now they don't know what they want to do with it,,but they're going to figure it out.,They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.,One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,,some new brackets for the box.,Well you printed out the brackets,and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.,Isn't that cool? 
 So makers harvest technology,from all the places around us.,This is a radar speed detector,that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.,And they do interesting things.,They're really creating new areas and exploring areas,that you might only think --,the military is doing drones --,well, there is a whole community of people,building autonomous airplanes, or vehicles --,something that you could program to fly on its own,,without a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going.,Fascinating work they're doing. 
 We just had an issue on space exploration,,DIY space exploration.,This is probably the best time in the history of mankind,to love space.,You could build your own satellite and get it into space,for like 8,000 dollars.,Think how much money and how many years it took NASA,to get satellites into space.,In fact, these guys actually work for NASA,,and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,,cheap things that aren't specialized,that they can combine,and send up into space. 
 Makers are a source of innovation,,and I think it relates back to something,like the birth of the personal computer industry.,This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?,It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace.,And he says, "I could go there all day long,and talk to people,and share ideas for free.",Well he did a little bit better than free.,But it's important to understand,that a lot of the origins of our industries --,even like Henry Ford --,come from this idea of playing,and figuring things out in groups. 
 Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,,I hope I could convince you,that our next generation should be makers,,that kids are particularly interested in this,,in this ability to control the physical world,and be able to use things like micro-controllers,and build robots.,And we've got to get this into schools,,or into communities in many, many ways --,the ability to tinker,,to shape and reshape the world around us.,There's a great opportunity today --,and that's what I really care about the most.,An the answer to the question: what will America make?,It's more makers. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I thought I'd talk a little bitnabout how nature makes materials.,I brought along with me an abalone shell.,This abalone shellnis a biocomposite material,that's 98 percent by massncalcium carbonate,and two percent by mass protein.,Yet, it's 3,000 times toughernthan its geological counterpart.,And a lot of people might usenstructures like abalone shells,,like chalk.,I've been fascinatednby how nature makes materials,,and there's a lot of secretsnto how they do such an exquisite job.,Part of it is that these materialsnare macroscopic in structure,,but they're formed at the nano scale.,They're formed at the nano scale,,and they use proteinsnthat are coded by the genetic level,that allow them to buildnthese really exquisite structures. 
 So something I thinknis very fascinating is:,What if you could give lifento non-living structures,,like batteries and like solar cells?,What if they hadnsome of the same capabilities,that an abalone shell did,,in terms of being ablento build really exquisite structures,at room temperature and room pressure,,using nontoxic chemicals,and adding no toxic materialsnback into the environment?,So that's kind of the visionnthat I've been thinking about.,And so what if you could growna battery in a Petri dish?,Or what if you could givengenetic information to a battery,so that it could actually becomenbetter as a function of time, and do so,in an environmentally friendly way? 
 And so, going back to this abalone shell,,besides being nanostructured,none thing that's fascinating is,,when a male and femalenabalone get together,,they pass on the geneticninformation that says,,"This is how to buildnan exquisite material.,Here's how to do it at roomntemperature and pressure,,using nontoxic materials.",Same with diatoms,nwhich are shown right here,,which are glasseous structures.,Every time the diatoms replicate,,they give the geneticninformation that says,,"Here's how to build glass in the oceannthat's perfectly nanostructured.",And you can do it the same,nover and over again.",So what if you could do the same thingnwith a solar cell or a battery?,I like to say my favoritenbiomaterial is my four year old. 
 But anyone who's ever hadnor knows small children knows,,they're incredibly complex organisms.,If you wanted to convince them to donsomething they don't want to do,,it's very difficult.,So when we thinknabout future technologies,,we actually think of usingnbacteria and viruses --,simple organisms.,Can you convince themnto work with a new toolbox,,so they can build a structurenthat will be important to me? 
 Also, when we thinknabout future technologies,,we start with the beginning of Earth.,Basically, it took a billion yearsnto have life on Earth.,And very rapidly,nthey became multi-cellular,,they could replicate,nthey could use photosynthesis,as a way of getting their energy source.,But it wasn't until about 500nmillion years ago --,during the Cambrianngeologic time period --,that organisms in the oceannstarted making hard materials.,Before that, they were allnsoft, fluffy structures.,It was during this timenthat there was increased calcium,,iron and silicon in the environment,,and organisms learnednhow to make hard materials.,So that's what I would likento be able to do,,convince biology to worknwith the rest of the periodic table. 
 Now, if you look at biology,,there's many structures like DNA,nantibodies, proteins and ribosomes,you've heard about,,that are nanostructured --,nature already gives us really exquisitenstructures on the nano scale.,What if we could harness them,and convince them to not be an antibodynthat does something like HIV?,What if we could convince themnto build a solar cell for us?,Here are some examples.,Natural shells,nnatural biological materials.,The abalone shell here.,If you fracture it, you can looknat the fact that it's nanostructured.,There's diatoms made out of SiO2,,and there are magnetotactic bacteria,that make small, single-domainnmagnets used for navigation.,What all these have in common,is these materialsnare structured at the nano scale,,and they have a DNA sequencenthat codes for a protein sequence,that gives them the blueprint,to be able to buildnthese really wonderful structures.,Now, going back to the abalone shell,,the abalone makes this shellnby having these proteins.,These proteinsnare very negatively charged.,They can pull calciumnout of the environment,,and put down a layer of calciumnand then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.,It has the chemical sequencesnof amino acids which says,,"This is how to build the structure.,Here's the DNA sequence,nhere's the protein sequence,in order to do it.",So an interesting idea is,,what if you could takenany material you wanted,,or any element on the periodic table,,and find its corresponding DNA sequence,,then code it for a correspondingnprotein sequence to build a structure,,but not build an abalone shell --,build something that nature has never hadnthe opportunity to work with yet. 
 And so here's the periodic table.,I absolutely love the periodic table.,Every year for the incomingnfreshman class at MIT,,I have a periodic table made that says,,"Welcome to MIT.nNow you're in your element." 
 (Laughter) 
 And you flip it over,nand it's the amino acids,with the pH at which they havendifferent charges.,And so I give this outnto thousands of people.,And I know it says MITnand this is Caltech,,but I have a couple extranif people want it.,I was really fortunate to havenPresident Obama visit my lab this year,on his visit to MIT,,and I really wanted to givenhim a periodic table.,So I stayed up at nightnand talked to my husband,,"How do I give President Obamana periodic table?,What if he says,n'Oh, I already have one,',or, 'I've already memorized it?'" 
 (Laughter) 
 So he came to visit my lab and lookednaround -- it was a great visit.,And then afterward, I said,,"Sir, I want to give younthe periodic table,,in case you're ever in a bindnand need to calculate molecular weight." 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought "molecular weight" soundednmuch less nerdy than "molar mass." 
 (Laughter) 
 And he looked at it and said,,"Thank you. I'll look at it periodically." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Later in a lecturenthat he gave on clean energy,,he pulled it out and said,,"And people at MIT,nthey give out periodic tables." So ... 
 So basically what I didn't tell you,is that about 500 million years ago,nthe organisms started making materials,,but it took them about 50 million yearsnto get good at it --,50 million years to learn how to perfectnhow to make that abalone shell.,And that's a hard sellnto a graduate student:,"I have this great project ...n50 million years ...",So we had to develop a waynof trying to do this more rapidly.,And so we use a nontoxic virusncalled M13 bacteriophage,,whose job is to infect bacteria.,Well, it has a simple DNA structure,that you can go in and cut and pastenadditional DNA sequences into it,,and by doing that, it allows the virusnto express random protein sequences. 
 This is pretty easy biotechnology,,and you could basicallyndo this a billion times.,So you can havena billion different viruses,that are all genetically identical,,but they differ from each othernbased on their tips,,on one sequence,,that codes for one protein.,Now if you take all billion viruses,nand put them in one drop of liquid,,you can force them to interactnwith anything you want,on the periodic table.,And through a processnof selection evolution,,you can pull one of a billionnthat does something you'd like it to do,,like grow a battery or a solar cell. 
 Basically, viruses can't replicatenthemselves; they need a host.,Once you find that one out of a billion,,you infect it into a bacteria,nand make millions and billions of copies,of that particular sequence.,The other thingnthat's beautiful about biology,is that biology gives younreally exquisite structures,with nice link scales.,These viruses are long and skinny,,and we can get them to express the ability,to grow something like semiconductors,or materials for batteries. 
 Now, this is a high-powerednbattery that we grew in my lab.,We engineered a virusnto pick up carbon nanotubes.,One part of the virusngrabs a carbon nanotube,,the other part of the virus has a sequence,that can grow an electrodenmaterial for a battery,,and then it wires itselfnto the current collector.,And so through a processnof selection evolution,,we went from being able to havena virus that made a crummy battery,to a virus that made a good battery,to a virus that made a record-breaking,nhigh-powered battery,that's all made at room temperature,nbasically at the benchtop.,That battery went to the White Housenfor a press conference,,and I brought it here.,You can see it in this casenthat's lighting this LED.,Now if we could scale this,,you could actually use itnto run your Prius,,which is kind of my dream --nto be able to drive a virus-powered car. 
 (Laughter) 
 But basically you can pullnone out of a billion,,and make lots of amplifications to it.,Basically, you makenan amplification in the lab,,and then you get it to self-assembleninto a structure like a battery.,We're able to do this also with catalysis.,This is the examplenof a photocatalytic splitting of water.,And what we've been able to donis engineer a virus,to basically take dye-absorbing molecules,and line them upnon the surface of the virus,so it acts as an antenna,,and you get an energy transfernacross the virus.,And then we give it a second genento grow an inorganic material,that can be used to split waterninto oxygen and hydrogen,,that can be used for clean fuels.,I brought an examplenof that with me today.,My students promised me it would work.,These are virus-assembled nanowires.,When you shine light on them,nyou can see them bubbling.,In this case, you're seeingnoxygen bubbles come out. 
 (Applause) 
 Basically, by controlling the genes,,you can control multiple materialsnto improve your device performance. 
 The last example are solar cells.,You can also do this with solar cells.,We've been able to engineer virusesnto pick up carbon nanotubes,and then grow titaniumndioxide around them,,and use it as a way of gettingnelectrons through the device.,And what we've foundnis through genetic engineering,,we can actually increasenthe efficiencies of these solar cells,to record numbers,for these types of dye-sensitized systems.,And I brought one of those as well,,that you can play aroundnwith outside afterward.,So this is a virus-based solar cell.,Through evolution and selection,,we took it from an eight percentnefficiency solar cell,to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell. 
 So I hope that I've convinced you,that there's a lot of great,ninteresting things to be learned,about how nature makes materials,,and about taking it the next step,,to see if you can force or take advantagenof how nature makes materials,,to make things that naturenhasn't yet dreamed of making. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I decided when I was asked to do this,that what I really wanted to talk aboutnwas my friend, Richard Feynman.,I was one of the fortunate fewnthat really did get to know him,and enjoyed his presence.,And I'm going to tell younabout the Richard Feynman that I knew.,I'm sure there are people herenwho could tell you,about the Richard Feynman they knew,,and it would probably bena different Richard Feynman. 
 Richard Feynman was a very complex man.,He was a man of many, many parts.,He was, of course, foremost,na very, very, very great scientist.,He was an actor. You saw him act.,I also had the good fortunento be in those lectures,,up in the balcony.,They were fantastic.,He was a philosopher.,He was a drum player.,He was a teacher par excellence.,Richard Feynman was also a showman,,an enormous showman.,He was brash, irreverent.,He was full of macho,na kind of macho one-upmanship.,He loved intellectual battle.,He had a gargantuan ego.,But the man had, somehow,,a lot of room at the bottom.,And what I mean by thatnis a lot of room, in my case --,I can't speak for anybody else,nbut in my case --,a lot of room for another big ego.,Well, not as big as his,,but fairly big.,I always felt good with Dick Feynman. 
 It was always fun to be with him.,He always made me feel smart.,How can somebody like thatnmake you feel smart?,Somehow he did.,He made me feel smart.nHe made me feel he was smart.,He made me feel we were both smart,,and the two of us could solvenany problem whatever.,And in fact, we did sometimesndo physics together.,We never published a paper together,,but we did have a lot of fun. 
 He loved to win,,win these little macho gamesnwe would sometimes play.,And he didn't only play them with me,nbut with all sorts of people.,He would almost always win.,But when he didn't win, when he lost,,he would laugh and seemnto have just as much fun,as if he had won. 
 I remember once he told me a story,about a joke the students played on him.,I think it was for his birthday --,they took him for lunch,to a sandwich place in Pasadena.,It may still exist; I don't know.,Celebrity sandwiches was their thing.,You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.,You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.,The students went there in advance,,and arranged that they'd all ordernFeynman sandwiches.,One after another, they came innand ordered Feynman sandwiches.,Feynman loved this story.,He told me this story,nand he was really happy and laughing.,When he finished the story, I said to him,,"Dick, I wonder whatnwould be the difference,between a Feynman sandwichnand a Susskind sandwich.",And without skipping a beat at all,,he said, "Well, they'd be about the same.,The only difference is a Susskindnsandwich would have a lot more ham.","Ham" as in bad actor. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I happened to have beennvery quick that day,,and I said, "Yeah,nbut a lot less baloney." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The truth of the matter,is that a Feynman sandwichnhad a load of ham,,but absolutely no baloney.,What Feynman hated worsenthan anything else,was intellectual pretense --,phoniness,,false sophistication, jargon.,I remember sometime during the mid-'80s,,Dick and I and Sidney Colemannwould meet a couple of times,up in San Francisco --nat some very rich guy's house --,up in San Francisco for dinner.,And the last time the rich guy invited us,,he also invited a couple of philosophers.,These guys were philosophers of mind.,Their specialty was the philosophynof consciousness.,And they were full of all kinds of jargon.,I'm trying to remember the words --,"monism," "dualism,"ncategories all over the place.,I didn't know what those meant, neitherndid Dick or Sydney, for that matter. 
 And what did we talk about?,Well, what do you talk aboutnwhen you talk about minds?,There's one obvious thing to talk about:,Can a machine become a mind?,Can you build a machine,that thinks like a human beingnthat is conscious?,We sat around and talked about this --nwe of course never resolved it.,But the trouble with the philosophers,is that they were philosophizing,when they should have beennscience-ophizing.,It's a scientific question, after all.,And this was a very, veryndangerous thing to do,around Dick Feynman. 
 (Laughter) 
 Feynman let them have it --nboth barrels, right between the eyes.,It was brutal; it was funny --nooh, it was funny.,But it was really brutal.,He really popped their balloon.,But the amazing thing was --nFeynman had to leave a little early;,he wasn't feeling too well,nso he left a little bit early.,And Sidney and I were left therenwith the two philosophers.,And the amazing thingnis these guys were flying.,They were so happy.,They had met the great man;,they had been instructed by the great man;,they had an enormous amount of fun,having their faces shoved in the mud ...,And it was something special.,I realized there was somethingnjust extraordinary about Feynman,,even when he did what he did. 
 Dick -- he was my friend;nI did call him Dick --,Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport.,I think it may have been a specialnrapport that he and I had.,We liked each other;nwe liked the same kind of things.,I also like the intellectual macho games.,Sometimes I would win,nmostly he would win,,but we both enjoyed them.,And Dick became convinced at some point,that he and I hadnsome kind of similarity of personality.,I don't think he was right.,I think the only pointnof similarity between us,is we both like to talk about ourselves.,But he was convinced of this.,And the man was incredibly curious.,And he wanted to understandnwhat it was and why it was,that there was this funny connection. 
 And one day, we were walking.,We were in France, in Les Houches.,We were up in the mountains, 1976.,And Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ...",The reason he called me "Leonardo"nis because we were in Europe,,and he was practicing his French. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he said, "Leonardo,,were you closer to your mothernor your father when you were a kid?",I said, "Well, my real hero was my father.,He was a working man,,had a fifth-grade education.,He was a master mechanic,nand he taught me how to use tools.,He taught me all sorts of thingsnabout mechanical things.,He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.,He didn't call it the hypotenuse,,he called it the shortcut distance." 
 And Feynman's eyes just opened up.,He went off like a lightbulb.,And he said that he had had,basically exactly the samenrelationship with his father.,In fact, he had been convinced at one time,that to be a good physicist,,it was very important to have hadnthat kind of relationship,with your father.,I apologize for the sexistnconversation here,,but this is the way it really happened. 
 He said he had been absolutelynconvinced that this was necessary,,a necessary part of the growing upnof a young physicist.,Being Dick, he, of course,nwanted to check this.,He wanted to go out and do an experiment. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, he did.,He went out and did an experiment.,He asked all his friendsnthat he thought were good physicists,,"Was it your mom or your popnthat influenced you?",They were all men,,and to a man, every singlenone of them said,,"My mother." 
 (Laughter) 
 There went that theory,ndown the trash can of history. 
 (Laughter) 
 But he was very excitednthat he had finally met somebody,who had the same experiencenwith his father,as he had with his father.,And for some time, he was convincednthis was the reason we got along so well.,I don't know. Maybe. Who knows? 
 But let me tell you a little bitnabout Feynman the physicist.,Feynman's style --nno, "style" is not the right word.,"Style" makes you thinknof the bow tie he might have worn,,or the suit he was wearing.,It's something much deeper than that,,but I can't think of another word for it.,Feynman's scientific stylenwas always to look for the simplest,,most elementary solutionnto a problem that was possible.,If it wasn't possible,nyou had to use something fancier.,No doubt, part of thisnwas his great joy and pleasure,in showing people that he couldnthink more simply than they could.,But he also deeply believed,nhe truly believed,,that if you couldn't explainnsomething simply,,you didn't understand it.,In the 1950s, peoplenwere trying to figure out,how superfluid helium worked. 
 There was a theory.,It was due to a Russiannmathematical physicist.,It was a complicated theory;,I'll tell you what it was soon enough.,It was a terribly complicated theory,,full of very difficultnintegrals and formulas,and mathematics and so forth.,And it sort of worked,nbut it didn't work very well.,The only way it worked,is when the helium atomsnwere very, very far apart.,And unfortunately,,the helium atoms in liquid heliumnare right on top of each other. 
 Feynman decided, as a sortnof amateur helium physicist,,that he would try to figure it out.,He had an idea, a very clear idea.,He would try to figure out,what the quantum wave functionnof this huge number of atoms looked like.,He would try to visualize it,,guided by a small numbernof simple principles.,The small number of simple principlesnwere very, very simple.,The first one was that whennhelium atoms touch each other,,they repel.,The implication of that is thatnthe wave function has to go to zero,,it has to vanish when the heliumnatoms touch each other.,The other factnis that in the ground state --,the lowest energy statenof a quantum system --,the wave function is always very smooth;,it has the minimum number of wiggles. 
 So he sat down --,and I imagine he had nothing more,than a simple piecenof paper and a pencil --,and he tried to write down,nand did write down,,the simplest functionnthat he could think of,,which had the boundary conditions,that the wave functionnvanish when things touch,and is smooth in between.,He wrote down a simple thing --nso simple, in fact,,that I suspect a really smartnhigh-school student,who didn't even have calculus,could understand what he wrote down.,The thing was, that simple thingnthat he wrote down,explained everything that was knownnat the time about liquid helium,,and then some. 
 I've always wonderednwhether the professionals --,the real professional helium physicists --,were just a little bitnembarrassed by this.,They had their super-powerful technique,,and they couldn't do as well.,Incidentally, I'll tell younwhat that super-powerful technique was.,It was the technique of Feynman diagrams. 
 (Laughter) 
 He did it again in 1968.,In 1968, in my own university --nI wasn't there at the time --,they were exploringnthe structure of the proton.,The proton is obviously madenof a whole bunch of little particles;,this was more or less known.,And the way to analyze it was,nof course, Feynman diagrams.,That's what Feynman diagramsnwere constructed for --,to understand particles.,The experiments that were going onnwere very simple:,you simply take the proton,,and you hit it really sharplynwith an electron.,This was the thingnthe Feynman diagrams were for. 
 The only problem was thatnFeynman diagrams are complicated.,They're difficult integrals.,If you could do all of them,nyou would have a very precise theory,,but you couldn't --nthey were just too complicated.,People were trying to do them.,You could do a one-loop diagram.nDon't worry about one loop.,One loop, two loops --nmaybe you could do a three-loop diagram,,but beyond that, you couldn't do anything. 
 Feynman said, "Forget all of that.,Just think of the proton,as an assemblage, a swarm,nof little particles.",He called them "partons.",He said, "Just think of it as a swarmnof partons moving real fast.",Because they're moving real fast,,relativity says the internalnmotions go very slow.,The electron hits it suddenly --,it's like taking a very suddennsnapshot of the proton.,What do you see?,You see a frozen bunch of partons.,They don't move,,and because they don't movenduring the course of the experiment,,you don't have to worrynabout how they're moving.,You don't have to worrynabout the forces between them.,You just get to think of itnas a population of frozen partons.",This was the key to analyzingnthese experiments.,Extremely effective.,Somebody said the wordn"revolution" is a bad word.,I suppose it is,nso I won't say "revolution,",but it certainly evolved very, very deeplynour understanding of the proton,,and of particles beyond that. 
 Well, I had some morenthat I was going to tell you,about my connection with Feynman,,what he was like,,but I see I have exactly half a minute.,So I think I'll just finish up by saying:,I actually don't thinknFeynman would have liked this event.,I think he would have said,n"I don't need this.",But ... 
 (Laughter) 
 How should we honor Feynman?,How should we really honor Feynman?,I think the answernis we should honor Feynman,by getting as much baloneynout of our own sandwiches,as we can. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The universe,is really big.,We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.,There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.,And if you take a camera,and you point it at a random part of the sky,,and you just keep the shutter open,,as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope,,it will see something like this.,Every one of these little blobs,is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way --,a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs.,There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies,in the observable universe.,100 billion is the only number you need to know.,The age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang,,is a hundred billion in dog years.,(Laughter),Which tells you something about our place in the universe. 
 One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.,It's extremely beautiful.,I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure,that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve,to really enjoy pictures of galaxies,when they didn't have any.,But we would also like to understand it.,As a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this?,One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.,If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity,,it would be moving away from you.,And if you look at a galaxy even farther away,,it would be moving away faster.,So we say the universe is expanding. 
 What that means, of course, is that, in the past,,things were closer together.,In the past, the universe was more dense,,and it was also hotter.,If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.,That kind of makes sense to us.,The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much,is that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang,,was also very, very smooth.,You might think that that's not a surprise.,The air in this room is very smooth.,You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out.",But the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different,than the conditions of the air in this room.,In particular, things were a lot denser.,The gravitational pull of things,was a lot stronger near the Big Bang. 
 What you have to think about,is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,,a hundred billion stars each.,At early times, those hundred billion galaxies,were squeezed into a region about this big --,literally -- at early times.,And you have to imagine doing that squeezing,without any imperfections,,without any little spots,where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.,Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull,into a huge black hole.,Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times,is not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.,It's a clue,that the early universe is not chosen randomly.,There is something that made it that way.,We would like to know what. 
 So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,,an Austrian physicist in the 19th century.,And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.,You've heard of entropy.,It's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.,Boltzmann gave us a formula --,engraved on his tombstone now --,that really quantifies what entropy is.,And it's basically just saying,that entropy is the number of ways,we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice,,so that macroscopically it looks the same.,If you have the air in this room,,you don't notice each individual atom.,A low entropy configuration,is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way.,A high entropy arrangement,is one that there are many arrangements that look that way.,This is a crucially important insight,because it helps us explain,the second law of thermodynamics --,the law that says that entropy increases in the universe,,or in some isolated bit of the universe. 
 The reason why entropy increases,is simply because there are many more ways,to be high entropy than to be low entropy.,That's a wonderful insight,,but it leaves something out.,This insight that entropy increases, by the way,,is what's behind what we call the arrow of time,,the difference between the past and the future.,Every difference that there is,between the past and the future,is because entropy is increasing --,the fact that you can remember the past, but not the future.,The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,,always in that order,,that's because entropy is increasing.,Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy,,it's very natural for it to increase,because there's more ways to be high entropy.,What he didn't explain,was why the entropy was ever low in the first place. 
 The fact that the entropy of the universe was low,was a reflection of the fact,that the early universe was very, very smooth.,We'd like to understand that.,That's our job as cosmologists.,Unfortunately, it's actually not a problem,that we've been giving enough attention to.,It's not one of the first things people would say,,if you asked a modern cosmologist,,"What are the problems we're trying to address?",One of the people who did understand that this was a problem,was Richard Feynman.,50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures.,He gave the popular lectures,that became "The Character of Physical Law.",He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads,that became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics.",He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students,that became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation.",In every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures,,he emphasized this puzzle:,Why did the early universe have such a small entropy? 
 So he says -- I'm not going to do the accent --,he says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time,,had a very low entropy for its energy content,,and since then the entropy has increased.,The arrow of time cannot be completely understood,until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe,are reduced still further,from speculation to understanding.",So that's our job.,We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking,,"we've figured it out by now.",It's not true that we've figured it out by now. 
 The reason the problem has gotten worse,,rather than better,,is because in 1998,we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.,We learned that it's accelerating.,The universe is not only expanding.,If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.,If you come back a billion years later and look at it again,,it will be moving away faster.,Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster,so we say the universe is accelerating.,Unlike the low entropy of the early universe,,even though we don't know the answer for this,,we at least have a good theory that can explain it,,if that theory is right,,and that's the theory of dark energy.,It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy. 
 In every little cubic centimeter of space,,whether or not there's stuff,,whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever,,there's still energy, even in the space itself.,And this energy, according to Einstein,,exerts a push on the universe.,It is a perpetual impulse,that pushes galaxies apart from each other.,Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,,does not dilute away as the universe expands.,The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter,remains the same,,even as the universe gets bigger and bigger.,This has crucial implications,for what the universe is going to do in the future.,For one thing, the universe will expand forever. 
 Back when I was your age,,we didn't know what the universe was going to do.,Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future.,Einstein was fond of this idea.,But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away,,the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.,14 billion years in the past,,100 billion dog years,,but an infinite number of years into the future.,Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes,,space looks finite to us.,Space may be finite or infinite,,but because the universe is accelerating,,there are parts of it we cannot see,and never will see.,There's a finite region of space that we have access to,,surrounded by a horizon.,So even though time goes on forever,,space is limited to us.,Finally, empty space has a temperature. 
 In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us,that a black hole, even though you think it's black,,it actually emits radiation,when you take into account quantum mechanics.,The curvature of space-time around the black hole,brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation,,and the black hole radiates.,A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons,showed that if you have dark energy in empty space,,then the whole universe radiates.,The energy of empty space,brings to life quantum fluctuations.,And so even though the universe will last forever,,and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away,,there will always be some radiation,,some thermal fluctuations,,even in empty space.,So what this means,is that the universe is like a box of gas,that lasts forever.,Well what is the implication of that? 
 That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century.,He said, well, entropy increases,because there are many, many more ways,for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.,But that's a probabilistic statement.,It will probably increase,,and the probability is enormously huge.,It's not something you have to worry about --,the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us.,It's very, very unlikely.,Except if they locked the doors,and kept us here literally forever,,that would happen.,Everything that is allowed,,every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room,,would eventually be obtained. 
 So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe,that was in thermal equilibrium.,He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe.,He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton --,they were absolute; they just stuck there forever.,So his idea of a natural universe,was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere --,the everything molecules.,But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough,,the random fluctuations of those molecules,will occasionally bring them,into lower entropy configurations.,And then, of course, in the natural course of things,,they will expand back.,So it's not that entropy must always increase --,you can get fluctuations into lower entropy,,more organized situations. 
 Well if that's true,,Boltzmann then goes onto invent,two very modern-sounding ideas --,the multiverse and the anthropic principle.,He says, the problem with thermal equilibrium,is that we can't live there.,Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.,We would not be able to process information,,metabolize, walk and talk,,if we lived in thermal equilibrium.,So if you imagine a very, very big universe,,an infinitely big universe,,with randomly bumping into each other particles,,there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states,,and then they relax back.,But there will also be large fluctuations.,Occasionally, you will make a planet,or a star or a galaxy,or a hundred billion galaxies.,So Boltzmann says,,we will only live in the part of the multiverse,,in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,,where life is possible.,That's the region where entropy is low.,Maybe our universe is just one of those things,that happens from time to time. 
 Now your homework assignment,is to really think about this, to contemplate what it means.,Carl Sagan once famously said,that "in order to make an apple pie,,you must first invent the universe.",But he was not right.,In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie,,you just wait for the random motion of atoms,to make you an apple pie.,That will happen much more frequently,than the random motions of atoms,making you an apple orchard,and some sugar and an oven,,and then making you an apple pie.,So this scenario makes predictions.,And the predictions are,that the fluctuations that make us are minimal.,Even if you imagine that this room we are in now,exists and is real and here we are,,and we have, not only our memories,,but our impression that outside there's something,called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,,it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain,than for them actually to randomly fluctuate,into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy. 
 The good news is that,,therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.,This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation.,Even if you left our galaxy out,,you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.,And Feynman also understood this.,Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation,,all the predictions are that,if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,,we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at --,high entropy.,If our order were due to a fluctuation,,we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.,We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation.",So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer?,If the universe is not a fluctuation,,why did the early universe have a low entropy?,And I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here is the universe that we tell you about,,versus the universe that really exists.,I just showed you this picture.,The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.,It's cooling off.,But we now know enough about the future of the universe,to say a lot more.,If the dark energy remains around,,the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning.,They will fall into black holes.,We will live in a universe,with nothing in it but black holes.,That universe will last 10 to the 100 years --,a lot longer than our little universe has lived.,The future is much longer than the past.,But even black holes don't last forever.,They will evaporate,,and we will be left with nothing but empty space.,That empty space lasts essentially forever.,However, you notice, since empty space gives off radiation,,there's actually thermal fluctuations,,and it cycles around,all the different possible combinations,of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space.,So even though the universe lasts forever,,there's only a finite number of things,that can possibly happen in the universe.,They all happen over a period of time,equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years. 
 So here's two questions for you.,Number one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,,why are we born,in the first 14 billion years of it,,in the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang?,Why aren't we in empty space?,You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living,",but that's not right.,You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.,Why aren't you?,More homework assignment for you. 
 So like I said, I don't actually know the answer.,I'm going to give you my favorite scenario.,Either it's just like that. There is no explanation.,This is a brute fact about the universe,that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.,Or maybe the Big Bang,is not the beginning of the universe.,An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration,,and yet, when we open our refrigerator,,we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find,this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator.",That's because an egg is not a closed system;,it comes out of a chicken.,Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.,Maybe there is something that naturally,,through the growth of the laws of physics,,gives rise to universe like ours,in low entropy configurations.,If that's true, it would happen more than once;,we would be part of a much bigger multiverse.,That's my favorite scenario. 
 So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation.,My bold speculation,is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history.,And 50 years from now,,all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths,by the scientific and external communities.,We will all believe that our little universe,is just a small part of a much larger multiverse.,And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang,in terms of a theory,that we will be able to compare to observations.,This is a prediction. I might be wrong.,But we've been thinking as a human race,about what the universe was like,,why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.,It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I have a strange career.,I know it because people come up to me,nlike colleagues, and say,,"Chris, you have a strange career." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I can see their point,,because I started my careernas a theoretical nuclear physicist.,And I was thinking about quarksnand gluons and heavy ion collisions,,and I was only 14 years old --,No, no, I wasn't 14 years old.,But after that,,I actually had my own lab,in the ComputationalnNeuroscience department,,and I wasn't doing any neuroscience.,Later, I would worknon evolutionary genetics,,and I would work on systems biology. 
 But I'm going to tell younabout something else today.,I'm going to tell younabout how I learned something about life.,And I was actually a rocket scientist.,I wasn't really a rocket scientist,,but I was workingnat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,in sunny California, where it's warm;,whereas now I amnin the mid-West, and it's cold.,But it was an exciting experience.,One day, a NASA managerncomes into my office,,sits down and says,,"Can you please tell us,nhow do we look for life outside Earth?",And that came as a surprise to me,,because I was actually hirednto work on quantum computation.,Yet, I had a very good answer.,I said, "I have no idea." 
 (Laughter) 
 And he told me, "Biosignatures,nwe need to look for a biosignature.",And I said, "What is that?",And he said, "It's anynmeasurable phenomenon,that allows us to indicatenthe presence of life.",And I said, "Really?,Because isn't that easy?,I mean, we have life.,Can't you apply a definition,,for example, a Supreme Court-likendefinition of life?" 
 And then I thought about itna little bit, and I said,,"Well, is it really that easy?,Because, yes, if you seensomething like this,,then all right, fine,nI'm going to call it life --,no doubt about it.,But here's something.",And he goes, "Right,nthat's life too. I know that.",Except, if you think that lifenis also defined by things that die,,you're not in luck with this thing,,because that's actuallyna very strange organism.,It grows up into the adult stage like that,and then goes throughna Benjamin Button phase,,and actually goes backwards and backwardsnuntil it's like a little embryo again,,and then actually grows back up,nand back down and back up --,sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.,So it's actually life,,but it's actually notnas we thought life would be.,And then you see something like that.,And he was like, "My God,nwhat kind of a life form is that?",Anyone know?,It's actually not life, it's a crystal. 
 So once you start looking and lookingnat smaller and smaller things --,so this particular person wrotena whole article and said,,"Hey, these are bacteria.",Except, if you look a little bit closer,,you see, in fact, that this thingnis way too small to be anything like that.,So he was convinced,nbut, in fact, most people aren't.,And then, of course,nNASA also had a big announcement,,and President Clintonngave a press conference,,about this amazing discoverynof life in a Martian meteorite.,Except that nowadays,nit's heavily disputed.,If you take the lessonnof all these pictures,,then you realize, well, actually,nmaybe it's not that easy.,Maybe I do need a definition of life,in order to make that kind of distinction. 
 So can life be defined?,Well how would you go about it?,Well of course, you'd gonto Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.,No, of course you don't do that;nyou put it somewhere in Google.,And then you might get something. 
 (Laughter) 
 And what you might get --,and anything that actually refersnto things that we are used to,,you throw away.,And then you might come upnwith something like this.,And it says something complicatednwith lots and lots of concepts.,Who on Earth would write somethingnas convoluted and complex and inane?,Oh, it's actually a really, really,nimportant set of concepts.,So I'm highlighting just a few words,and saying definitionsnlike that rely on things,that are not based on amino acidsnor leaves or anything that we are used to,,but in fact on processes only.,And if you take a look at that,,this was actually in a book that I wrotenthat deals with artificial life.,And that explains why that NASA managernwas actually in my office to begin with.,Because the idea was that,nwith concepts like that,,maybe we can actuallynmanufacture a form of life. 
 And so if you go and ask yourself,n"What on Earth is artificial life?",,let me give you a whirlwind tournof how all this stuff came about.,And it started out quite a while ago,,when someone wrote one of the firstnsuccessful computer viruses.,And for those of younwho aren't old enough,,you have no ideanhow this infection was working --,namely, through these floppy disks.,But the interesting thingnabout these computer virus infections,was that, if you look at the ratenat which the infection worked,,they show this spiky behaviornthat you're used to from a flu virus.,And it is in fact due to this arms race,between hackersnand operating system designers,that things go back and forth.,And the result is kind ofna tree of life of these viruses,,a phylogeny that looks very muchnlike the type of life,that we're used to,nat least on the viral level. 
 So is that life?,Not as far as I'm concerned.,Why? Because these thingsndon't evolve by themselves.,In fact, they have hackers writing them.,But the idea was takennvery quickly a little bit further,,when a scientist workingnat the Santa Fe Institute decided,,"Why don't we try to packagenthese little viruses,in artificial worldsninside of the computer,and let them evolve?",And this was Steen Rasmussen.,And he designed this system,nbut it really didn't work,,because his virusesnwere constantly destroying each other.,But there was another scientistnwho had been watching this, an ecologist.,And he went home and says,n"I know how to fix this.",And he wrote the Tierra system,,and, in my book,,is in fact one of the firstntruly artificial living systems --,except for the fact that these programsndidn't really grow in complexity. 
 So having seen this work,nworked a little bit on this,,this is where I came in.,And I decided to create a systemnthat has all the properties,that are necessary to see, in fact,nthe evolution of complexity,,more and more complexnproblems constantly evolving.,And of course, since I really don't knownhow to write code, I had help in this.,I had two undergraduate students,at California Institute of Technologynthat worked with me.,That's Charles Ofria on the left,nTitus Brown on the right.,They are now, actually,nrespectable professors,at Michigan State University,,but I can assure you, back in the day,nwe were not a respectable team.,And I'm really happynthat no photo survives,of the three of usnanywhere close together. 
 But what is this system like?,Well I can't really go into the details,,but what you see herenis some of the entrails.,But what I wanted to focus onnis this type of population structure.,There's about 10,000nprograms sitting here.,And all different strainsnare colored in different colors.,And as you see here, there are groupsnthat are growing on top of each other,,because they are spreading.,Any time there is a programnthat's better at surviving in this world,,due to whatever mutation it has acquired,,it is going to spread over the othersnand drive the others to extinction. 
 So I'm going to show you a movie,where you're going to seenthat kind of dynamic.,And these kinds of experiments are startednwith programs that we wrote ourselves.,We write our own stuff, replicate it,nand are very proud of ourselves.,And we put them in,nand what you see immediately,is that there are wavesnand waves of innovation.,By the way, this is highly accelerated,,so it's like a 1000 generations a second.,But immediately, the system goes like,n"What kind of dumb piece of code was this?,This can be improved uponnin so many ways, so quickly.",So you see waves of new typesntaking over the other types.,And this type of activityngoes on for quite a while,,until the main easy thingsnhave been acquired by these programs.,And then, you seensort of like a stasis coming on,where the system essentially waits,for a new type of innovation,nlike this one,,which is going to spread overnall the other innovations that were before,and is erasing the genesnthat it had before,,until a new type of higher levelnof complexity has been achieved.,And this process goes on and on and on. 
 So what we see here,is a system that lives in very muchnthe way we're used to how life goes.,But what the NASA peoplenhad asked me really was,,"Do these guys have a biosignature?,Can we measure this type of life?,Because if we can,,maybe we have a chance of actuallyndiscovering life somewhere else,without being biasednby things like amino acids.",So I said, "Well, perhapsnwe should construct a biosignature,based on life as a universal process.,In fact, it should perhaps make usenof the concepts that I developed,just in order to sort of capturenwhat a simple living system might be." 
 And the thing I came up with --,I have to first give younan introduction about the idea,,and maybe that would bena meaning detector,,rather than a life detector.,And the way we would do that --,I would like to find outnhow I can distinguish text,that was written by a million monkeys,nas opposed to text that is in our books.,And I would like to do it in such a way,that I don't actually have to be ablento read the language,,because I'm sure I won't be able to.,As long as I knownthat there's some sort of alphabet.,So here would be a frequency plot,of how often you findneach of the 26 letters of the alphabet,in a text written by random monkeys.,And obviously, each of these lettersncomes off about roughly equally frequent. 
 But if you now look at the samendistribution in English texts,,it looks like that.,And I'm telling you,nthis is very robust across English texts.,And if I look at French texts,nit looks a little bit different,,or Italian or German.,They all have their own typenof frequency distribution,,but it's robust.,It doesn't matter whether it writesnabout politics or about science.,It doesn't matter whether it's a poemnor whether it's a mathematical text.,It's a robust signature,,and it's very stable.,As long as our booksnare written in English --,because people are rewriting themnand recopying them --,it's going to be there. 
 So that inspired me to think about,nwell, what if I try to use this idea,in order, not to detect random textsnfrom texts with meaning,,but rather detect the factnthat there is meaning,in the biomolecules that make up life.,But first I have to ask:,what are these building blocks,,like the alphabet, elementsnthat I showed you?,Well it turns out, we havenmany different alternatives,for such a set of building blocks.,We could use amino acids,,we could use nucleic acids,ncarboxylic acids, fatty acids.,In fact, chemistry's extremely rich,nand our body uses a lot of them. 
 So that we actually, to test this idea,,first took a look at amino acidsnand some other carboxylic acids.,And here's the result.,Here is, in fact, what you get,if you, for example, looknat the distribution of amino acids,on a comet or in interstellar spacenor, in fact, in a laboratory,,where you made very surenthat in your primordial soup,,there is no living stuff in there.,What you find is mostlynglycine and then alanine,and there's some trace elementsnof the other ones.,That is also very robust --,what you find in systems like Earth,where there are amino acids,nbut there is no life. 
 But suppose you take some dirtnand dig through it,and then put it into these spectrometers,,because there's bacterianall over the place;,or you take water anywhere on Earth,,because it's teaming with life,,and you make the same analysis;,the spectrum looks completely different.,Of course, there is stillnglycine and alanine,,but in fact, there are these heavynelements, these heavy amino acids,,that are being producednbecause they are valuable to the organism.,And some other onesnthat are not used in the set of 20,,they will not appear at allnin any type of concentration.,So this also turns outnto be extremely robust.,It doesn't matter what kind of sedimentnyou're using to grind up,,whether it's bacterianor any other plants or animals.,Anywhere there's life,,you're going to have this distribution,,as opposed to that distribution.,And it is detectablennot just in amino acids. 
 Now you could ask:,Well, what about these Avidians?,The Avidians being the denizensnof this computer world,where they are perfectly happynreplicating and growing in complexity.,So this is the distribution that you getnif, in fact, there is no life.,They have about 28 of these instructions.,And if you have a system wherenthey're being replaced one by the other,,it's like the monkeysnwriting on a typewriter.,Each of these instructionsnappears with roughly the equal frequency.,But if you now takena set of replicating guys,like in the video that you saw,,it looks like this.,So there are some instructions,that are extremely valuablento these organisms,,and their frequency is going to be high.,And there's actually some instructionsnthat you only use once, if ever.,So they are either poisonous,or really should be usednat less of a level than random.,In this case, the frequency is lower.,And so now we can see,nis that really a robust signature?,I can tell you indeed it is,,because this type of spectrum,njust like what you've seen in books,,and just like what you've seennin amino acids,,it doesn't really matternhow you change the environment,,it's very robust, it's goingnto reflect the environment. 
 So I'm going to show you nowna little experiment that we did.,And I have to explain to you,,the top of this graph,shows you that frequencyndistribution that I talked about.,Here, that's the lifeless environment,where each instruction occursnat an equal frequency.,And below there, I show, in fact,nthe mutation rate in the environment.,And I'm starting thisnat a mutation rate that is so high,that even if you would dropna replicating program,that would otherwise happily grow upnto fill the entire world,,if you drop it in, it gets mutatednto death immediately.,So there is no life possiblenat that type of mutation rate.,But then I'm going to slowlynturn down the heat, so to speak,,and then there's this viability threshold,where now it would be possiblenfor a replicator to actually live.,And indeed, we're going to be droppingnthese guys into that soup all the time. 
 So let's see what that looks like.,So first, nothing, nothing, nothing.,Too hot, too hot.,Now the viability threshold is reached,,and the frequency distributionnhas dramatically changed,and, in fact, stabilizes.,And now what I did there,is, I was being nasty,nI just turned up the heat again and again.,And of course, it reachesnthe viability threshold.,And I'm just showing this to younagain because it's so nice.,You hit the viability threshold.,The distribution changes to "alive!",And then, once you hit the threshold,where the mutation rate is so highnthat you cannot self-reproduce,,you cannot copy the informationnforward to your offspring,without making so many mistakesnthat your ability to replicate vanishes.,And then, that signature is lost. 
 What do we learn from that?,Well, I think we learnna number of things from that.,One of them is,,if we are able to think about lifenin abstract terms --,and we're not talkingnabout things like plants,,and we're not talking about amino acids,,and we're not talking about bacteria,,but we think in terms of processes --,then we could start to think about life,not as somethingnthat is so special to Earth,,but that, in fact, could exist anywhere.,Because it really only has to donwith these concepts of information,,of storing informationnwithin physical substrates --,anything: bits, nucleic acids,nanything that's an alphabet --,and make sure that there's some process,so that this information can be storednfor much longer than you would expect --,the time scales fornthe deterioration of information.,And if you can do that,nthen you have life. 
 So the first thing that we learn,is that it is possible to define lifenin terms of processes alone,,without referring at allnto the type of things that we hold dear,,as far as the type of life on Earth is.,And that, in a sense, removes us again,,like all of our scientific discoveries,nor many of them --,it's this continuous dethroning of man --,of how we think we're specialnbecause we're alive.,Well, we can make life;nwe can make life in the computer.,Granted, it's limited,,but we have learned what it takesnin order to actually construct it.,And once we have that,,then it is not suchna difficult task anymore,to say, if we understandnthe fundamental processes,that do not refernto any particular substrate,,then we can go out and try other worlds,,figure out what kind of chemicalnalphabets might there be,,figure enough about the normal chemistry,nthe geochemistry of the planet,,so that we know what this distributionnwould look like in the absence of life,,and then look for largendeviations from this --,this thing sticking out, which says,n"This chemical really shouldn't be there.",Now we don't know that there's life then,,but we could say,,"Well at least I'm going to have to takena look very precisely at this chemical,and see where it comes from.",And that might be our chancenof actually discovering life,when we cannot visibly see it. 
 And so that's really the onlyntake-home message that I have for you.,Life can be less mysteriousnthan we make it out to be,when we try to thinknabout how it would be on other planets.,And if we remove the mystery of life,,then I think it is a little bit easiernfor us to think about how we live,,and how perhaps we're not as specialnas we always think we are.,And I'm going to leave you with that. 
 And thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Today I'd like to show you,the future of the way we make things.,I believe that soon our buildings and machines,will be self-assembling,,replicating and repairing themselves.,So I'm going to show you,what I believe is the current state of manufacturing,,and then compare that to some natural systems. 
 So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers --,two and a half years [of assembly time],,500,000 to a million parts,,fairly complex,,new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.,We have exciting machines,that can take us into space --,five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts. 
 But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems,,we have proteins,that have two million types,,can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds,,or DNA with three billion base pairs,we can replicate in roughly an hour.,So there's all of this complexity,in our natural systems,,but they're extremely efficient,,far more efficient than anything we can build,,far more complex than anything we can build.,They're far more efficient in terms of energy.,They hardly ever make mistakes.,And they can repair themselves for longevity. 
 So there's something super interesting about natural systems.,And if we can translate that,into our built environment,,then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.,And I think the key to that is self-assembly. 
 So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment,,I think there's four key factors.,The first is that we need to decode,all of the complexity of what we want to build --,so our buildings and machines.,And we need to decode that into simple sequences --,basically the DNA of how our buildings work.,Then we need programmable parts,that can take that sequence,and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.,We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate,,allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.,And we need some type of error correction redundancy,to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want. 
 So I'm going to show you a number of projects,that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on,to achieve this self-assembling future.,The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.,So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots --,8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.,They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.,You decode what you want to fold up into,,into a sequence of angles --,so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0,,120, negative 120 -- something like that;,so a sequence of angles, or turns,,and you send that sequence through the string.,Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 --,it rotates to that, checks if it got there,and then passes it to its neighbor. 
 So these are the brilliant scientists,,engineers, designers that worked on this project.,And I think it really brings to light:,Is this really scalable?,I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours,made to make this eight-foot robot.,Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?,The next one questions that,and looks at passive nature,,or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.,But it goes a step further,,and it tries to have actual computation.,It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing,,the digital logic gate,,directly into your parts. 
 So this is a NAND gate.,You have one tetrahedron which is the gate,that's going to do your computing,,and you have two input tetrahedrons.,One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.,The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.,And then it gives you an output in 3D space.,So what this means,is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.,It computes on what it was doing before,and what you said you wanted it to do.,And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space --,so up or down.,So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.,On the right-hand side,,[0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.,And so what that really means,is that our structures now contain the blueprints,of what we want to build. 
 So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.,So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.,In this case I call it self-guided replication,,because your structure contains the exact blueprints.,If you have errors, you can replace a part.,All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.,So you could have something that climbs along and reads it,and can output at one to one.,It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions. 
 So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains,,and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now,of passive self-assembly systems.,So it takes the reconfigurability,and programmability,and makes it a completely passive system.,So basically you have a chain of elements.,Each element is completely identical,,and they're biased.,So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.,So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.,You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.,So when you shake the chain,,it then folds up,into any configuration that you've programmed in --,so in this case, a spiral,,or in this case,,two cubes next to each other.,So you can basically program,any three-dimensional shape --,or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively. 
 So what does this tell us about the future?,I think that it's telling us,that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair,in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.,There's new programmability in these parts.,And from that you have new possibilities for computing.,We'll have spatial computing.,Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines,,all of our bricks could actually compute.,That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power,,new design possibilities.,So it's exciting potential for this.,So I think these projects I've showed here,are just a tiny step towards this future,,if we implement these new technologies,for a new self-assembling world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Applause) 
 (Applause) 
 I am a papercutter.,(Laughter),I cut stories.,So my process is very straightforward.,I take a piece of paper,,I visualize my story,,sometimes I sketch, sometimes I don't.,And as my image,is already inside the paper,,I just have to remove,what's not from that story.,So I didn't come to papercutting,in a straight line.,In fact,,I see it more as a spiral. 
 I was not born,with a blade in my hand.,And I don't remember papercutting as a child.,As a teenager,,I was sketching, drawing,,and I wanted to be an artist.,But I was also a rebel.,And I left everything,and went for a long series of odd jobs.,So among them,,I have been a shepherdess,,a truck driver,,a factory worker,,a cleaning lady.,I worked in tourism for one year,in Mexico,,one year in Egypt.,I moved for two years,in Taiwan.,And then I settled in New York,where I became a tour guide.,And I still worked as a tour leader,,traveled back and forth,in China, Tibet and Central Asia. 
 So of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40,,and I decided it's time,to start as an artist.,(Applause),I chose papercutting,because paper is cheap,,it's light,,and you can use it,in a lot of different ways.,And I chose the language of silhouette,because graphically it's very efficient.,And it's also just getting to the essential of things.,So the word "silhouette",comes from a minister of finance,,Etienne de Silhouette.,And he slashed so many budgets,that people said they couldn't afford,paintings anymore,,and they needed to have their portrait,"a la silhouette.",(Laughter),So I made series of images, cuttings,,and I assembled them in portfolios.,And people told me --,like these 36 views of the Empire State building --,they told me, "You're making artist books." 
 So artist books have a lot of definitions.,They come in a lot of different shapes.,But to me,,they are fascinating objects,to visually narrate a story.,They can be with words,or without words.,And I have a passion,for images and for words.,I love pun,and the relation to the unconscious.,I love oddities of languages.,And everywhere I lived, I learned the languages,,but never mastered them.,So I'm always looking,for the false cognates,or identical words in different languages. 
 So as you can guess, my mother tongue is French.,And my daily language is English.,So I did a series of work,where it was identical words,in French and in English.,So one of these works,is the "Spelling Spider.",So the Spelling Spider,is a cousin of the spelling bee.,(Laughter),But it's much more connected to the Web.,(Laughter),And this spider,spins a bilingual alphabet.,So you can read "architecture active",or "active architecture.",So this spider goes through the whole alphabet,with identical adjectives and substantives.,So if you don't know one of these languages,,it's instant learning. 
 And one ancient form of the book,is scrolls.,So scrolls are very convenient,,because you can create a large image,on a very small table.,So the unexpected consequences of that,is that you only see one part of your image,,so it makes a very freestyle architecture.,And I'm making all those kinds of windows.,So it's to look beyond the surface.,It's to have a look,at different worlds.,And very often I've been an outsider.,So I want to see how things work,and what's happening.,So each window,is an image,and is a world,that I often revisit.,And I revisit this world,thinking about the image,or cliché about what we want to do,,and what are the words, colloquialisms,,that we have with the expressions. 
 It's all if.,So what if we were living in balloon houses?,It would make a very uplifting world.,And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.,It would be so light.,So sometimes I view from the inside,,like EgoCentriCity,and the inner circles.,Sometimes it's a global view,,to see our common roots,and how we can use them to catch dreams.,And we can use them also,as a safety net. 
 And my inspirations,are very eclectic.,I'm influenced by everything I read,,everything I see.,I have some stories that are humorous,,like "Dead Beats.",(Laughter),Other ones are historical.,Here it's "CandyCity.",It's a non-sugar-coated,history of sugar.,It goes from slave trade,to over-consumption of sugar,with some sweet moments in between.,And sometimes I have an emotional response to news,,such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.,Other times, it's not even my stories.,People tell me their lives,,their memories, their aspirations,,and I create a mindscape.,I channel their history,[so that] they have a place to go back,to look at their life and its possibilities.,I call them Freudian cities. 
 I cannot speak for all my images,,so I'll just go through a few of my worlds,just with the title.,"ModiCity.","ElectriCity.","MAD Growth on Columbus Circle.","ReefCity.","A Web of Time.","Chaos City.","Daily Battles.","FeliCity.","Floating Islands.",And at one point,,I had to do "The Whole Nine Yards.",So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long.,(Laughter),So in life and in papercutting,,everything is connected.,One story leads to another.,I was also interested,in the physicality of this format,,because you have to walk to see it. 
 And parallel to my cutting,is my running.,I started with small images,,I started with a few miles.,Larger images, I started to run marathons.,Then I went to run 50K, then 60K.,Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons.,And I still feel I'm running,,it's just the training,to become a long-distance papercutter. 
 (Laughter) 
 And running gives me a lot of energy.,Here is a three-week papercutting marathon,at the Museum of Arts and Design,in New York City.,The result is "Hells and Heavens.",It's two panels 13 ft. high.,They were installed in the museum on two floors,,but in fact, it's a continuous image.,And I call it "Hells and Heavens",because it's daily hells and daily heavens.,There is no border in between.,Some people are born in hells,,and against all odds, they make it to heavens.,Other people make the opposite trip.,That's the border.,You have sweatshops in hells.,You have people renting their wings in the heavens.,And then you have all those individual stories,where sometimes we even have the same action,,and the result puts you in hells or in heavens.,So the whole "Hells and Heavens",is about free will,and determinism. 
 And in papercutting,,you have the drawing as the structure itself.,So you can take it off the wall.,Here it's an artist book installation,called "Identity Project.",It's not autobiographical identities.,They are more our social identities.,And then you can just walk behind them,and try them on.,So it's like the different layers,of what we are made of,and what we present to the world,as an identity. 
 That's another artist book project.,In fact, in the picture, you have two of them.,It's one I'm wearing,and one that's on exhibition,at the Center for Books Arts in New York City.,Why do I call it a book?,It's called "Fashion Statement,",and there are quotes about fashion,,so you can read it,,and also,,because the definition of artist book,is very generous.,So artist books, you take them off the wall.,You take them for a walk.,You can also install them as public art.,Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona,,and it's called "Floating Memories.",So it's regional memories,,and they are just randomly moved by the wind. 
 I love public art.,And I entered competitions,for a long time.,After eight years of rejection,,I was thrilled to get my first commission,with the Percent for Art in New York City.,It was for a merger station,for emergency workers and firemen.,I made an artist book,that's in stainless steel,instead of paper.,I called it "Working in the Same Direction.",But I added weathervanes on both sides,to show that they cover all directions.,With public art,,I could also make cut glass.,Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx.,And each time I make public art,,I want something that's really relevant,to the place it's installed.,So for the subway in New York,,I saw a correspondence,between riding the subway,and reading.,It is travel in time, travel on time.,And Bronx literature,,it's all about Bronx writers,and their stories. 
 Another glass project,is in a public library,in San Jose, California.,So I made a vegetable point of view,of the growth of San Jose.,So I started in the center,with the acorn,for the Ohlone Indian civilization.,Then I have the fruit from Europe,for the ranchers.,And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today.,And it's still growing.,So the technique, it's cut,,sandblasted, etched,and printed glass into architectural glass.,And outside the library,,I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind.,I took library material,that had fruit in their title,and I used them to make an orchard walk,with these fruits of knowledge.,I also planted the bibliotree.,So it's a tree,,and in its trunk you have the roots of languages.,And it's all about international writing systems.,And on the branches,you have library material growing.,You can also have function and form,with public art.,So in Aurora, Colorado it's a bench.,But you have a bonus with this bench.,Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts,,you will walk away,with temporary branding of,the story element on your thighs. 
 (Laughter) 
 Another functional work,,it's in the south side of Chicago,for a subway station.,And it's called "Seeds of the Future are Planted Today.",It's a story about transformation,and connections.,So it acts as a screen,to protect the rail and the commuter,,and not to have objects falling on the rails.,To be able to change fences,and window guards into flowers,,it's fantastic.,And here I've been working for the last three years,with a South Bronx developer,to bring art to life,to low-income buildings,and affordable housing.,So each building has its own personality.,And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood,,like in Morrisania, about the jazz history.,And for other projects, like in Paris,,it's about the name of the street.,It's called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street.,So I brought back the rabbit,,the dragonfly,,to stay in that street. 
 And in 2009,,I was asked to make a poster,to be placed in the subway cars in New York City,for a year.,So that was a very captive audience.,And I wanted to give them an escape.,I created "All Around Town.",It is a papercutting,,and then after, I added color on the computer.,So I can call it techno-crafted. 
 And along the way,,I'm kind of making papercuttings,and adding other techniques.,But the result is always to have stories.,So the stories, they have a lot of possibilities.,They have a lot of scenarios.,I don't know the stories.,I take images from our global imagination,,from cliché, from things we are thinking about,,from history.,And everybody's a narrator,,because everybody has a story to tell.,But more important,is everybody has to make a story,to make sense of the world.,And in all these universes,,it's like imagination is the vehicle,to be transported with,,but the destination is our minds,and how we can reconnect,with the essential and with the magic.,And it's what story cutting is all about. 
 (Applause)So, I was in the hospital for a long time.,And a few years after I left, I went back,,and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me --,said, "Dan, I have a fantastic new treatment for you.",I was very excited. I walked with him to his office.,And he explained to me that, when I shave,,I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is,,but on the right side of my face,I was badly burned so I have no hair,,and this creates lack of symmetry.,And what's the brilliant idea he had?,He was going to tattoo little black dots,on the right side of my face,and make me look very symmetric. 
 It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave.,Let me tell you, this was a strange way to shave,,because I thought about it,and I realized that the way I was shaving then,would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life --,because I had to keep the width the same.,When I got back to his office,,I wasn't really sure.,I said, "Can I see some evidence for this?",So he showed me some pictures,of little cheeks with little black dots --,not very informative.,I said, "What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white?,What would happen then?","Oh, don't worry about it," he said.,"We have lasers; we can whiten it out.",But I was still concerned,,so I said, "You know what, I'm not going to do it." 
 And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life.,This is coming from a Jewish guy, all right, so that means a lot.,(Laughter),And he said, "Dan, what's wrong with you?,Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric?,Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this?,Do women feel pity for you,and have sex with you more frequently?",None of those happened.,And this was very surprising to me,,because I've gone through many treatments --,there were many treatments I decided not to do --,and I never got this guilt trip to this extent.,But I decided not to have this treatment.,And I went to his deputy and asked him, "What was going on?,Where was this guilt trip coming from?",And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already,,and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now you probably think that this guy's a schmuck.,Right, that's what he seems like.,But let me give you a different perspective on the same story.,A few years ago, I was running some of my own experiments in the lab.,And when we run experiments,,we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.,So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high,,another group that I thought their performance would be very low,,and when I got the results, that's what we got --,I was very happy -- aside from one person.,There was one person in the group,that was supposed to have very high performance,that was actually performing terribly.,And he pulled the whole mean down,,destroying my statistical significance of the test. 
 So I looked carefully at this guy.,He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample.,And I remembered that the old and drunken guy,came one day to the lab,wanting to make some easy cash,and this was the guy.,"Fantastic!" I thought. "Let's throw him out.,Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample?" 
 But a couple of days later,,we thought about it with my students,,and we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition?,What would have happened if he was in the other group?,Would we have thrown him out then?",We probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all,,and if we did look at the data,,we'd probably have said, "Fantastic! What a smart guy who is performing this low,",because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower,,giving us even stronger statistical results than we could.,So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment. 
 But you know, these stories,,and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest,,basically kind of bring two points,to the foreground for me.,The first one is that in life we encounter many people,who, in some way or another,,try to tattoo our faces.,They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality,and give us advice that is inherently biased.,And I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize,,and we see that it happens.,Maybe we don't recognize it every time,,but we understand that it happens. 
 The most difficult thing, of course, is to recognize,that sometimes we too,are blinded by our own incentives.,And that's a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account.,Because we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us.,When I was doing these experiments,,in my mind, I was helping science.,I was eliminating the data,to get the true pattern of the data to shine through.,I wasn't doing something bad.,In my mind, I was actually a knight,trying to help science move along.,But this was not the case.,I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions.,And I think the real challenge is to figure out,where are the cases in our lives,where conflicts of interest work on us,,and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it,,but to try to do things,that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors,,because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances. 
 I do want to leave you with one positive thought.,I mean, this is all very depressing, right --,people have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on.,The positive perspective, I think, of all of this,is that, if we do understand when we go wrong,,if we understand the deep mechanisms,of why we fail and where we fail,,we can actually hope to fix things.,And that, I think, is the hope. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)When I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,,which was to interview three politicians every day.,And from that much contact with politicians,,I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.,They have what I called "logorrhea dementia,",which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.,(Laughter),But what they do have is incredible social skills.,When you meet them, they lock into you,,they look you in the eye,,they invade your personal space,,they massage the back of your head. 
 I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago,who kept his hand on my inner thigh,throughout the whole meal -- squeezing it.,I once -- this was years ago --,I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.,And they were friends, and they hugged each other,and they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart.,And they were moving and grinding,and moving their arms up and down each other.,And I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this.",But they have those social skills. 
 Another case:,Last election cycle,,I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire,,and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons:,Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.,(Laughter),And he's going into a diner.,And he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family,and says, "What village are you from in New Hampshire?",And then he describes the home he owned in their village.,And so he goes around the room,,and then as he's leaving the diner,,he first-names almost everybody he's just met.,I was like, "Okay, that's social skill." 
 But the paradox is,,when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode,,that social awareness vanishes,and they start talking like accountants.,So in the course of my career,,I have covered a series of failures.,We sent economists in the Soviet Union,with privatization plans when it broke up,,and what they really lacked was social trust.,We invaded Iraq with a military,oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.,We had a financial regulatory regime,based on the assumptions,that traders were rational creatures,who wouldn't do anything stupid.,For 30 years, I've been covering school reform,and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes --,charters, private schools, vouchers --,but we've had disappointing results year after year.,And the fact is, people learn from people they love.,And if you're not talking about the individual relationship,between a teacher and a student,,you're not talking about that reality.,But that reality is expunged,from our policy-making process. 
 And so that's led to a question for me:,Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth,completely dehumanized,when they think about policy?,And I came to the conclusion,,this is a symptom of a larger problem.,That, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature,based on the notion,that we're divided selves,,that reason is separated from the emotions,and that society progresses,to the extent that reason can suppress the passions.,And it's led to a view of human nature,that we're rational individuals,who respond in straightforward ways to incentives,,and it's led to ways of seeing the world,where people try to use the assumptions of physics,to measure how human behavior is.,And it's produced a great amputation,,a shallow view of human nature. 
 We're really good at talking about material things,,but we're really bad at talking about emotions.,We're really good at talking about skills,and safety and health;,we're really bad at talking about character.,Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher,,said that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality,of virtue, honor, goodness,,but we no longer have a system,by which to connect them.",And so this has led to a shallow path in politics,,but also in a whole range of human endeavors. 
 You can see it in the way we raise our young kids.,You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon,and you watch the kids come out,,and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.,If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.,You see these cars that drive up --,usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos,,because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car,,so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy --,that's fine.,They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms,,who are highly successful career women,who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.,And you can usually tell the uber-moms,because they actually weigh less than their own children.,(Laughter),So at the moment of conception,,they're doing little butt exercises.,Babies flop out,,they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things. 
 Driving them home, and they want them to be enlightened,,so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company,with its own foreign policy.,In one of my books,,I joke that Ben & Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste --,doesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave.,It would be a big seller.,(Laughter),And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula,,and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores,where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International.,(Laughter),They buy these seaweed-based snacks there,called Veggie Booty with Kale,,which is for kids who come home and say,,"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer." 
 (Laughter) 
 And so the kids are raised in a certain way,,jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure --,SAT prep, oboe, soccer practice.,They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs,,and sometimes they make a success of themselves,in a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.,And sometimes you can see them at vacation places,like Jackson Hole or Aspen.,And they've become elegant and slender --,they don't really have thighs;,they just have one elegant calve on top of another.,(Laughter),They have kids of their own,,and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people,,so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein,,their daughters looks like Halle Berry -- I don't know how they've done that.,They get there and they realize,it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights.,So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs --,all look like velociraptors,,all named after Jane Austen characters. 
 And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life,,but they've decided, "I've been successful at everything;,I'm just not going to die.",And so they hire personal trainers;,they're popping Cialis like breath mints.,You see them on the mountains up there.,They're cross-country skiing up the mountain,with these grim expressions,that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.,(Laughter),And as they whiz by you,,it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet,going up the hill. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so this is part of what life is,,but it's not all of what life is.,And over the past few years,,I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature,and a deeper view of who we are.,And it's not based on theology or philosophy,,it's in the study of the mind,,across all these spheres of research,,from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists,,behavioral economists, psychologists,,sociology,,we're developing a revolution in consciousness.,And when you synthesize it all,,it's giving us a new view of human nature.,And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature,,it's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment.,And I think when you synthesize this research,,you start with three key insights. 
 The first insight is,that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,,the unconscious mind does most of the work.,And so one way to formulate that is,the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,,of which it can be consciously aware of about 40.,And this leads to oddities.,One of my favorite is that people named Dennis,are disproportionately likely to become dentists,,people named Lawrence become lawyers,,because unconsciously we gravitate toward things,that sound familiar,,which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.,(Laughter),Another finding is that the unconscious,,far from being dumb and sexualized,,is actually quite smart.,So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.,It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.,And the way you should do that,is study the furniture,,let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,,and then a few days later, go with your gut,,because unconsciously you've figured it out. 
 The second insight,is that emotions are at the center of our thinking.,People with strokes and lesions,in the emotion-processing parts of the brain,are not super smart,,they're actually sometimes quite helpless.,And the "giant" in the field is in the room tonight,and is speaking tomorrow morning -- Antonio Damasio.,And one of the things he's really shown us,is that emotions are not separate from reason,,but they are the foundation of reason,because they tell us what to value.,And so reading and educating your emotions,is one of the central activities of wisdom. 
 Now I'm a middle-aged guy.,I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.,One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys.,They put them into a brain scan machine --,this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care --,and they had them watch a horror movie,,and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.,And the brain scans were identical in both activities.,It was just sheer terror.,So me talking about emotion,is like Gandhi talking about gluttony,,but it is the central organizing process,of the way we think.,It tells us what to imprint.,The brain is the record of the feelings of a life. 
 And the third insight,is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals.,We're social animals, not rational animals.,We emerge out of relationships,,and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another.,And so when we see another person,,we reenact in our own minds,what we see in their minds.,When we watch a car chase in a movie,,it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.,When we watch pornography,,it's a little like having sex,,though probably not as good.,And we see this when lovers walk down the street,,when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia,gets caught up in an emotional contagion,,the deep interpenetration.,And this revolution in who we are,gives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,,a different way, most importantly,,of seeing human capital. 
 We are now children of the French Enlightenment.,We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.,But I think this research shows,that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,,with David Hume, Adam Smith,,actually had a better handle on who we are --,that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,,and our sentiments are often trustworthy.,And this work corrects that bias in our culture,,that dehumanizing bias.,It gives us a deeper sense,of what it actually takes,for us to thrive in this life.,When we think about human capital,we think about the things we can measure easily --,things like grades, SAT's, degrees,,the number of years in schooling.,What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,,are things that are deeper,,things we don't really even have words for.,And so let me list just a couple of the things,I think this research points us toward trying to understand. 
 The first gift, or talent, is mindsight --,the ability to enter into other people's minds,and learn what they have to offer.,Babies come with this ability.,Meltzoff, who's at the University of Washington,,leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.,He wagged his tongue at the baby.,The baby wagged her tongue back.,Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind,and to download what they find --,their models of how to understand reality.,In the United States, 55 percent of babies,have a deep two-way conversation with Mom,and they learn models to how to relate to other people.,And those people who have models of how to relate,have a huge head start in life.,Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study,in which they could predict,with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months,,who was going to graduate from high school,,based on who had good attachment with mom.,Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships.,They are what we call avoidantly attached.,They have trouble relating to other people.,They go through life,like sailboats tacking into the wind --,wanting to get close to people,,but not really having the models of how to do that.,And so this is one skill,of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another. 
 A second skill is equipoise,,the ability to have the serenity,to read the biases and failures in your own mind.,So for example, we are overconfidence machines.,Ninety-five percent of our professors report,that they are above-average teachers.,Ninety-six percent of college students,say they have above-average social skills.,Time magazine asked Americans, "Are you in the top one percent of earners?",Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners.,(Laughter),This is a gender-linked trait, by the way.,Men drown at twice the rate of women,,because men think they can swim across that lake.,But some people have the ability and awareness,of their own biases, their own overconfidence.,They have epistemological modesty.,They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.,They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions,to the strength of their evidence.,They are curious.,And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ. 
 The third trait is metis,,what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word.,It's a sensitivity to the physical environment,,the ability to pick out patterns in an environment --,derive a gist.,One of my colleagues at the Times,did a great story about soldiers in Iraq,who could look down a street and detect somehow,whether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street.,They couldn't tell you how they did it,,but they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,,and they were more often right than wrong.,The third is what you might call sympathy,,the ability to work within groups.,And that comes in tremendously handy,,because groups are smarter than individuals.,And face-to-face groups are much smarter,than groups that communicate electronically,,because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.,And the effectiveness of a group,is not determined by the IQ of the group;,it's determined by how well they communicate,,how often they take turns in conversation. 
 Then you could talk about a trait like blending.,Any child can say, "I'm a tiger," pretend to be a tiger.,It seems so elementary.,But in fact, it's phenomenally complicated,to take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger",and blend them together.,But this is the source of innovation.,What Picasso did, for example,,was take the concept "Western art",and the concept "African masks",and blend them together --,not only the geometry,,but the moral systems entailed in them.,And these are skills, again, we can't count and measure. 
 And then the final thing I'll mention,is something you might call limerence.,And this is not an ability;,it's a drive and a motivation.,The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.,The unconscious mind hungers,for those moments of transcendence,,when the skull line disappears,and we are lost in a challenge or a task --,when a craftsman feels lost in his craft,,when a naturalist feels at one with nature,,when a believer feels at one with God's love.,That is what the unconscious mind hungers for.,And many of us feel it in love,when lovers feel fused. 
 And one of the most beautiful descriptions,I've come across in this research,of how minds interpenetrate,was written by a great theorist and scientist,named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana.,He was married to a woman named Carol,,and they had a wonderful relationship.,When their kids were five and two,,Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.,And Hofstadter wrote a book,called "I Am a Strange Loop.",In the course of that book, he describes a moment --,just months after Carol has died --,he comes across her picture on the mantel,,or on a bureau in his bedroom. 
 And here's what he wrote:,"I looked at her face,,and I looked so deeply,that I felt I was behind her eyes.,And all at once I found myself saying,as tears flowed,,'That's me. That's me.',And those simple words,brought back many thoughts that I had had before,,about the fusion of our souls,into one higher-level entity,,about the fact that at the core of both our souls,lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children,,about the notion that those hopes,were not separate or distinct hopes,,but were just one hope,,one clear thing that defined us both,,that welded us into a unit --,the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined,before being married and having children.,I realized that, though Carol had died,,that core piece of her had not died at all,,but had lived on very determinedly in my brain." 
 The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom.,Through his suffering, Hofstadter understood,how deeply interpenetrated we are.,Through the policy failures of the last 30 years,,we have come to acknowledge, I think,,how shallow our view of human nature has been.,And now as we confront that shallowness,and the failures that derive from our inability,to get the depths of who we are,,comes this revolution in consciousness --,these people in so many fields,exploring the depth of our nature,and coming away with this enchanted,,this new humanism.,And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious,,it had a vast effect on the climate of the times.,Now we are discovering a more accurate vision,of the unconscious, of who we are deep inside,,and it's going to have a wonderful and profound,and humanizing effect on our culture. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I wanted to be a rock star.,I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.,To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.,This was in the late '80s.,And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member,of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.,They wouldn't have me.,I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.,And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.,And I was certain that's what my life would be. 
 And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,when I was 18,,I was stunned to find,that there was not a Pop Star 101,,or even a degree program for that interest.,And the choir conductor there,knew that I sang,and invited me to come and join the choir.,And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great.",And I left the room and said, "No way.",The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,,and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.,And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,,"Listen, you've got to join choir.,At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,,all expenses paid.,And the soprano section is just full of hot girls.",And so I figured for Mexico and babes,,I could do just about anything. 
 And I went to my first day in choir,,and I sat down with the basses,and sort of looked over my shoulder,to see what they were doing.,They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,,and boom, they launched into the Kyrie,from the "Requiem" by Mozart.,In my entire life I had seen in black and white,,and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.,The most transformative experience I've ever had --,in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony,and people singing, people together,,the shared vision.,And I felt for the first time in my life,that I was part of something bigger than myself.,And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out. 
 I decided to write a piece for choir,a couple of years later,as a gift to this conductor,who had changed my life.,I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.,And that piece was published,,and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.,And then I started conducting,,and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.,And I find myself now in the unlikely position,of standing in front of all of you,as a professional classical composer and conductor. 
 Well a couple of years ago,,a friend of mine emailed me,a link, a YouTube link,,and said, "You have got to see this.",And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,,singing the soprano line,to a piece of mine called "Sleep." 
 (Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.,My name is Britlin Losee,,and this is a video,that I'd like to make for you.,Here's me singing "Sleep.",I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.,♫ If there are noises ♫,♫ in the night ♫ 
 Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.,Britlin was so innocent and so sweet,,and her voice was so pure.,And I even loved seeing behind her;,I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.,Such an intimate video. 
 And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people,to all do this same thing,,sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass --,wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,,we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.,So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG.",I actually wrote, "OMG,",hopefully for the last time in public ever.,(Laughter),And I sent out this call to singers.,And I made free the download of the music,to a piece that I had written in the year 2000,called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold.",And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos. 
 Now I should say, before that,,what I did is I posted a conductor track,of myself conducting.,And it's in complete silence when I filmed it,,because I was only hearing the music in my head,,imagining the choir that would one day come to be.,Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath,so that the singers would have something to listen to.,And then as the videos started to come in ... 
 (Singing),This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore. 
 (Singing),This is Evangelina Etienne 
 (Singing),from Massachusetts. 
 (Singing),Stephen Hanson from Sweden. 
 (Singing),This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas. 
 (Singing) 
 There was even a little soprano solo in the piece,,and so I had auditions.,And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.,I was told later,,and also by lots of singers who were involved in this,,that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes,until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.,Here's our winner of the soprano solo.,This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.,(Singing),I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note --,like, "No problem, everything's fine." 
 (Laughter) 
 And from the crowd,emerged this young man, Scott Haines.,And he said, "Listen, this is the project,I've been looking for my whole life.,I'd like to be the person to edit this all together.",I said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me.",And Scott aggregated all of the videos.,He scrubbed the audio.,He made sure that everything lined up.,And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.,This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir. 
 (Singing) 
 I'll stop it there in the interest of time.,(Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,So there's more. There's more.,Thank you so much. 
 And I had the same reaction you did.,I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.,I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it --,these souls all on their own desert island,,sending electronic messages in bottles to each other.,And the video went viral.,We had a million hits in the first month,and got a lot of attention for it.,And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying,,"All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?",And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0,that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing,,"Sleep," which is another work,that I wrote in the year 2000 --,poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.,And again, I posted a conductor video,,and we started accepting submissions.,This time we got some more mature members.,(Singing),And some younger members. 
 (Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫,♫ Safe in bed ♫,EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine.,Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen? 
 Someone did all eight videos --,a bass even singing the soprano parts.,This is Beau Awtin.,(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫ 
 EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal --,there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop",and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.,And there were 900 people involved in that.,So I told the singers, "That's our goal.,That's the number for us to beat.",And we just closed submissions January 10th,,and our final tally was 2,051 videos,from 58 different countries.,Thank you.,(Applause),From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam,,Jordan, Egypt, Israel,,as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand. 
 And we also put a page on Facebook,for the singers to upload their testimonials,,what it was like for them, their experience singing it.,And I've just chosen a few of them here.,"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.,Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.,It's so wonderful to sing together again!",I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.,"Aside from the beautiful music,,it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before,,but who are connected anyway.",And my personal favorite,,"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this,,he told me that I did not have the voice for it.",Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.,Me too.,"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears,,but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.,It is a dream come true to be part of this choir,,as I've never been part of one.,When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map,,I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.,As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush,,satellite is my connection to the world." 
 So two things struck me deeply about this.,The first is that human beings,will go to any lengths necessary,to find and connect with each other.,It doesn't matter the technology.,And the second is,that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.,It wasn't a virtual choir.,There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.,But, I know myself too, I feel,this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.,I feel a closeness to this choir --,almost like a family. 
 What I'd like to close with then today,is the first look,at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.,This will be a premiere today.,We're not finished with the video yet.,You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos,,the render time is just atrocious.,But we do have the first three minutes.,And it's a tremendous honor,for me to be able to show it to you here first.,You're the very first people to see this.,This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir. 
 (Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫,♫ beneath the moon ♫,♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫,♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫,♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫,♫ Upon my pillow, ♫,♫ safe in bed, ♫,♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫,♫ I cannot sleep ♫,♫ my mind's aflight ♫,♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫,♫ If there are noises in the night ♫ 
 Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much. Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)What's in the box?,Whatever it is must be pretty important,,because I've traveled with it, moved it,,from apartment to apartment to apartment. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Sound familiar?,Did you know that we Americans,have about three times the amount of space,we did 50 years ago?,Three times.,So you'd think, with all this extra space,,we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.,Nope.,There's a new industry in town,,a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry:,that of personal storage.,So we've got triple the space,,but we've become such good shoppers,that we need even more space.,So where does this lead?,Lots of credit card debt,,huge environmental footprints,,and perhaps not coincidentally,,our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years. 
 Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way,,that less might actually equal more.,I bet most of us have experienced at some point,the joys of less:,college -- in your dorm,,traveling -- in a hotel room,,camping -- rig up basically nothing,,maybe a boat.,Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things,,this gave you a little more freedom,,a little more time.,So I'm going to suggest,that less stuff and less space,are going to equal a smaller footprint.,It's actually a great way to save you some money.,And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. 
 So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org,to further this conversation,and to find some great solutions in this area.,First up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan,with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.,I wanted it all --,home office, sit down dinner for 10,,room for guests,,and all my kite surfing gear.,With over 300 entries from around the world,,I got it, my own little jewel box.,By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft.,instead of 600,,immediately I'm saving 200 grand.,Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities --,save some more money there,,but also a smaller footprint.,And because it's really designed,around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff --,and really designed for me,,I'm really excited to be there. 
 So how can you live little?,Three main approaches.,First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.,We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.,And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?,It's time for me to let it go.,We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives,,and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.,We need to think before we buy.,Ask ourselves,,"Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?",By all means,,we should buy and own some great stuff.,But we want stuff that we're going to love for years,,not just stuff. 
 Secondly, our new mantra:,small is sexy.,We want space efficiency.,We want things that are designed,for how they're used the vast majority of the time,,not that rare event.,Why have a six burner stove,when you rarely use three?,So we want things that nest,,we want things that stack, and we want it digitized.,You can take paperwork,,books, movies,,and you can make it disappear -- it's magic. 
 Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares --,a sink combined with a toilet,,a dining table becomes a bed --,same space,,a little side table,stretches out to seat 10.,In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here,,we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture,to get a lot out of the space.,Look at the coffee table --,it grows in height and width,to seat 10.,My office folds away,,easily hidden.,My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.,Guests? Move the moving wall,,have some fold-down guest beds.,And of course, my own movie theater. 
 So I'm not saying that we all need to live,in 420 sq. ft.,But consider the benefits of an edited life.,Go from 3,000 to 2,000,,from 1,500 to 1,000.,Most of us, maybe all of us,,are here pretty happily for a bunch of days,with a couple of bags,,maybe a small space, a hotel room.,So when you go home and you walk through your front door,,take a second and ask yourselves,,"Could I do with a little life editing?,Would that give me a little more freedom?,Maybe a little more time?" 
 What's in the box?,It doesn't really matter.,I know I don't need it.,What's in yours?,Maybe, just maybe,,less might equal more.,So let's make room,for the good stuff. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today,to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. 
 Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution,with a hyena. 
 AK: The ancestor of the horse.,Okay, we'll do something with it.,(Laughter),Hahahaha.,The hyena is the ancestor of the horse,because it was part of a production,called "Faustus in Africa,",a Handspring Production from 1995,,where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.,This production was directed,by South African artist and theater director,,William Kentridge.,So it needed a very articulate front paw.,But, like all puppets, it has other attributes. 
 BJ: One of them is breath,,and it kind of breathes. 
 AK: Haa haa haaa. 
 BJ: Breath is really important for us.,It's the kind of original movement,for any puppet for us onstage.,It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- 
 AK: Oops. 
 BJ: From an actor.,Puppets always have to try to be alive.,It's their kind of ur-story onstage,,that desperation to live. 
 AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,,and it only lives,because you make it.,An actor struggles to die onstage,,but a puppet has to struggle to live.,And in a way that's a metaphor for life. 
 BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.,So we call this,a piece of emotional engineering,that uses up-to-the-minute,17th century technology --,(Laughter),to turn nouns,into verbs. 
 AK: Well actually I prefer to say,that it's an object,constructed out of wood and cloth,with movement built into it,to persuade you to believe that it has life. 
 BJ: Okay so. 
 AK: It has ears that move passively,when the head goes. 
 BJ: And it has these bulkheads,made out of plywood,,covered with fabric --,curiously similar, in fact,,to the plywood canoes,that Adrian's father used to make,when he was a boy in their workshop. 
 AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. 
 BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.,And when we met at art school,and fell in love,in 1971,,I hated puppets.,I really thought they were so beneath me.,I wanted to become an avant-garde artist --,and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.,And, in fact, it took about 10 years 
 to discover,the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,,where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,,to learn a renewed, or a new, respect,for this art form. 
 AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine,to form a puppet company.,And 20 years later, miraculously,,we collaborated with a company from Mali,,the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,,where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.,It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe. 
 BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.,The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,,but it's ultimately the same structure.,It's got two people inside it on stilts,,which give them the height,,and somebody in the front,who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. 
 AK: The person in the hind legs,is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena --,same mechanism, just a bit bigger.,And he's controlling the ear movement. 
 BJ: So this production,was seen by Tom Morris,of the National Theatre in London.,And just around that time,,his mother had said,,"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo,called 'War Horse'?" 
 AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.,The horse is sold to the First World War,,and he joins up to find his horse. 
 BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,,"Do you think you could make us a horse,for a show to happen at the National Theatre?" 
 AK: It seemed a lovely idea. 
 BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider. 
 AK: It had to have a rider,,and it had to participate in cavalry charges.,(Laughter),A play about early 20th century plowing technology,and cavalry charges,was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department,at the National Theatre in London.,But they agreed to go along with it for a while.,So we began with a test. 
 BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,,who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,,and our next-door neighbor Katherine,,riding on a ladder.,The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. 
 AK: And once we put Katherine,through that particular brand of hell,,we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.,So we made a model.,This is a cardboard model,,a little bit smaller than the hyena.,You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs,and the canoe structure is still there. 
 BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.,But we didn't realize at the time,that we actually needed a third manipulator,,because we couldn't manipulate the neck,from inside,and walk the horse at the same time. 
 AK: We started work on the prototype,after the model was approved,,and the prototype took a bit longer,than we anticipated.,We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.,And we had a crate built for it.,It had to be shipped to London.,We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,,and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. 
 BJ: So we got a camera,,and we posed the puppet,in various galloping stances.,And we sent it off,to the National Theatre,,hoping that they believed,that we created something that worked.,(Laughter) 
 AK: A month later, we were there in London,with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. 
 BJ: About 40 people. 
 AK: We were terrified.,We opened the lid, we took the horse out,,and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.,Here I have an 18-second clip,of the very first walk of the prototype.,This is in the National Theatre studio,,the place where they cook new ideas.,It had by no means got the green light yet.,The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,,invented a beautiful sequence,where the baby horse,,which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,,grew up into the big horse.,And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,,saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.,And so the show was given the green light.,And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.,Here is the plan. 
 (Laughter) 
 And here is our factory in Cape Town,where we make horses.,You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.,The horses are completely handmade.,There is very little 20th century technology in them.,We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood,and some of the aluminum pieces.,But because they have to be light and flexible,,and each one of them is different,,they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.,So here are some half-finished horses,ready to be worked in London.,And now we would like to introduce you,to Joey.,Joey boy, you there?,Joey.,(Applause),(Applause),Joey.,Joey, come here.,No, no, I haven't got it.,He's got it; it's in his pocket. 
 BJ: Joey.,AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.,Come here. Stand here where people can see you.,Move around. Come on.,I'd just like to describe --,I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.,Here, Craig is working the head.,He has bicycle brake cables,going down to the head control in his hand.,Each one of them,operates either an ear, separately,,or the head, up and down.,But he also controls the head directly,by using his hand.,The ears are obviously,a very important emotional indicator of the horse.,When they point right back,,the horse is fearful or angry,,depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.,Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down,and the ears listen, either side.,Horses' hearing is very important.,It's almost more important than their eyesight.,Over here,,Tommy's got what you call the heart position.,He's working the leg.,You see the string tendon from the hyena,,the hyena's front leg,,automatically pulls the hoop up.,(Laughter),Horses are so unpredictable.,(Laughter),The way a hoof comes up with a horse,immediately gives you the feeling,that it's a convincing horse action.,The hind legs have got the same action. 
 BJ: And Mikey also has,,in his fingers,,the ability to move the tail,from left to right,,and up and down with the other hand.,And together, there's quite a complex possibility,of tail expression. 
 AK: You want to say something about the breathing? 
 BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.,Adrian thought,that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two,and make it breathe like that --,because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.,But we realized,that, if that were to be happening,,you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.,So he made a channel in here,,and the chest moves up and down in that channel.,So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,,but it feels like breath.,And it's very, very simple,because all that happens,is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. 
 AK: Other emotional stuff.,If I were to touch the horse here,on his skin,,the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside,and get the skin to quiver.,You'll notice, of course,,that the puppet is made out of cane lines.,And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,,that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse,that somehow moves in space.,But of course, it was the cane is light,,the cane is flexible, the cane is durable,and the cane is moldable.,And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. 
 The skin itself,is made out of a see-through nylon mesh,,which, if the lighting designer,wants the horse to almost disappear,,she can light the background,and the horse becomes ghostlike.,You see the skeletal structure of it.,Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.,Again, that was a practical consideration.,The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.,They have to be able to act,along with their fellow actors in the production.,And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.,It's three heads making one character. 
 But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.,And plant. 
 (Whinny) 
 Thank you.,And now just --,(Applause),All the way from sunny California,we have Zem Joaquin,who's going to ride the horse for us. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 So we would like to stress,that the performance you see in the horse,is three guys,who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. 
 BJ: Not being able to talk to one another,while they're onstage,because they're mic'd.,The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse --,the whinnying and the nickering and everything --,that starts usually with one performer,,carries on with a second person,and ends with a third. 
 AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.,(Applause),Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo,,Zem Joaquin and Basil and me. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.,Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.,BR: And we're chefs. So when Moto,opened in 2004, people didn't really know,what to expect. A lot of people thought,that it was a Japanese restaurant, and,maybe it was the name, maybe it was,the logo, which was like a Japanese,character, but anyway, we had all these,requests for Japanese food, which is,really not what we did. And after about,the ten thousandth request for a maki roll,,we decided to give the people,what they wanted. So this picture is,an example of printed food, and this was,the first foray into what we like to call,flavor transformation. So this is all,the ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,,a standard maki roll, printed onto,a little piece of paper. 
 HC: So our diners started to get bored,with this idea, and we decided to give them,the same course twice, so here we actually,took an element from the maki roll and,and took a picture of a dish and then,basically served that picture with the dish.,So this dish in particular is basically,champagne with seafood.,The champagne grapes that you see are,actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of,seafood and some crème fraiche and the,picture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter),BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.,We decided to do something,a little bit different and transform flavors,that were very familiar -- so in this case,,we have carrot cake.,So we take a carrot cake, put it,in a blender, and we have kind of like,a carrot cake juice, and then that went into,a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create,this hollow shell of carrot cake,ice cream, I guess, and it comes off,looking like, you know,,Jupiter's floating around your plate. 
 So yeah, we're transforming things into,something that you have absolutely,no reference for.,HC: And here's something we have no,reference to eat. This is a cigar, and,basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of,a Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these,spices that go into the pork shoulder,,we fashion that into ash. We take,the sandwich and wrap it up in,a collard green, put an edible label,that bears no similarity to,a Cohiba cigar label, and we put it,in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge,you about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter),HC: Delicious. 
 BR: That's not it, though.,Instead of making foods that,look like things that you wouldn't eat,,we decided to make ingredients,look like dishes that you know.,So this is a plate of nachos.,The difference between our nachos,and the other guy's nachos,,is that this is actually a dessert.,So the chips are candied,,the ground beef is made from chocolate,,and the cheese is made from a shredded,mango sorbet that gets shredded,into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.,And after doing all of this,dematerialization and reconfiguring,of this, of these ingredients, we realized,that it was pretty cool,,because as we served it, we learned that,the dish actually behaves like the real thing,,where the cheese begins to melt.,So when you're looking at this thing,in the dining room, you have this sensation,that this is actually a plate of nachos,,and it's not really until you begin tasting it,that you realize this is a dessert, and,it's just kind of like a mind-ripper.,(Laughter) 
 HC: So we had been creating,all of these dishes out of a,kitchen that was more like,a mechanic's shop than a kitchen, and,the next logical step for us was to install,a state-of-the-art laboratory,,and that's what we have here.,So we put this in the basement, and we,got really serious about food, like,serious experimentation.,BR: One of the really cool things about,the lab, besides that we have a new,science lab in the kitchen, is that,,you know, with this new equipment, and,this new approach, all these,different doors to creativity that we never,knew were there began to open, and so the,experiments and the food and the dishes,that we created, they just kept going,further and further out there. 
 HC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,,and let's actually make some cool stuff.,You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.,What I see is a cow about to eat something,delicious. What is that cow eating?,And why is it delicious?,So the cow, basically, eats three basic,things in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,,and so what I do is I actually,challenge my staff with these crazy,,wild ideas. Can we take what the cow,eats, remove the cow, and then make,some hamburgers out of that?,And basically the reaction tends to be,kind of like this. (Laughter),BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,,Chris Jones. This is not the only guy,that just flips out when we assign,a ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,,they're hard to understand.,They're hard to just get automatically. 
 There's a lot of research and a lot of,failure, trial and error -- I guess, more error --,that goes into each and every dish,,so we don't always get it right, and it takes,a while for us to be able to explain that,to people.,HC: So, after about a day of Chris and I,staring at each other, we came up with,something that was pretty close,to the hamburger patty, and as you can,see it basically forms like hamburger meat.,This is made from three ingredients:,beets, barley, corn, and so it,actually cooks up like hamburger meat,,looks and tastes like hamburger meat,,and not only that, but it's basically,removing the cow from the equation.,So replicating food, taking it into that,next level is where we're going.,(Applause) 
 BR: And it's definitely the world's first,bleeding veggie burger,,which is a cool side effect.,And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar,with it, is a natural ingredient, and it,contains a special property.,It's a glycoprotein called miraculin,,a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks,me out every time I eat it, but it has a,unique ability to mask certain taste,receptors on your tongue, so that primarily,sour taste receptors, so normally things,that would taste very sour or tart,,somehow begin to taste very sweet.,HC: You're about to eat a lemon,,and now it tastes like lemonade.,Let's just stop and think about the,economic benefits of something like that.,We could eliminate sugar across the board,for all confectionary products and sodas,,and we can replace it with,all-natural fresh fruit. 
 BR: So you see us here cutting up,some watermelon. The idea with this,is that we're going to eliminate tons of,food miles, wasted energy,,and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,,or any exotic produce or item,from a very far-away place,,with local, organic produce;,so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.,HC: So if miracle berries take sour things,and turn them into sweet things,,we have this other pixie dust,that we put on the watermelon, and it,makes it go from sweet to savory.,So after we do that, we put it into,a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,,some spices, and we roll it, and this,starts taking on the appearance of tuna.,So the key now is to make it,behave like tuna.,BR: And then after a quick dip into some,liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,,we really have something that looks,,tastes and behaves like the real thing. 
 HC: So the key thing to remember here is,,we don't really care,what this tuna really is.,As long as it's good for you and good for,the environment, it doesn't matter.,But where is this going?,How can we take this idea of tricking your,tastebuds and leapfrog it into something,that we can do today that could be,a disruptive food technology?,So here's the next challenge.,I told the staff, let's just take a bunch,of wild plants, think of them as,food ingredients. As long as they're,non-poisonous to the human body,,go out around Chicago sidewalks,,take it, blend it, cook it and then,have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.,Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this,and see what they think. (Laughter) 
 BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task,like this -- this is another one of those,assignments that the kitchen staff,hated us for. But we really had to almost,relearn how to cook in general,,because these are ingredients, you know,,plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,,and two, we have no reference for how,to cook these things because,people don't eat them.,So we really had to think about new, creative ways,to flavor, new ways to cook,and to change texture -- and that was,the main issue with this challenge. 
 HC: So this is where we step into the future,and we leapfrog ahead.,So developing nations,and first-world nations,,imagine if you could take these wild plants,and consume them, food miles would,basically turn into food feet.,This disruptive mentality of what food is,would essentially open up the encyclopedia,of what raw ingredients are, even if we just,swapped out, say, one of these for flour,,that would eliminate so much energy,and so much waste.,And to give you a simple example here as to,what we actually fed these customers,,there's a bale of hay there,and some crab apples.,And basically we took hay and crab apples,and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.,People swore they were eating,barbecue sauce, and this is free food.,BR: Thanks, guys. 
 (Applause)I want to ask you all to consider for a second,the very simple fact,that, by far,,most of what we know about the universe,comes to us from light.,We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky,and see stars with our bare eyes.,The Sun burns our peripheral vision.,We see light reflected off the Moon.,And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope,at the celestial bodies,,the known universe has come to us through light,,across vast eras in cosmic history.,And with all of our modern telescopes,,we've been able to collect,this stunning silent movie of the universe --,these series of snapshots,that go all the way back to the Big Bang. 
 And yet, the universe is not a silent movie,because the universe isn't silent.,I'd like to convince you,that the universe has a soundtrack,and that soundtrack is played on space itself,,because space can wobble like a drum.,It can ring out a kind of recording,throughout the universe,of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.,Now we'd like to be able to add,to a kind of glorious visual composition,that we have of the universe --,a sonic composition.,And while we've never heard the sounds from space,,we really should, in the next few years,,start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there. 
 So in this ambition,to capture songs from the universe,,we turn our focus,to black holes and the promise they have,,because black holes can bang on space-time,like mallets on a drum,and have a very characteristic song,,which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions,for what that song will be like.,Now black holes are dark against a dark sky.,We can't see them directly.,They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.,We can see them indirectly,,because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.,They destroy stars around them.,They churn up debris in their surroundings.,But they won't come to us directly through light.,We might one day see a shadow,a black hole can cast on a very bright background,,but we haven't yet.,And yet black holes may be heard,even if they're not seen,,and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum. 
 Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum,to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.,Einstein realized that if space were empty,,if the universe were empty,,it would be like this picture,,except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.,But if we were freely falling through the space,,even without this helpful grid,,we might be able to paint it ourselves,,because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines,,undeflected straight paths,through the universe.,Einstein also realized --,and this is the real meat of the matter --,that if you put energy or mass in the universe,,it would curve space,,and a freely falling object,would pass by, let's say, the Sun,and it would be deflected,along the natural curves in the space.,It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.,Now even light will be bent by those paths.,And you can be bent so much,that you're caught in orbit around the Sun,,as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.,These are the natural curves in space. 
 What Einstein did not realize,was that, if you took our Sun,and you crushed it down to six kilometers --,so you took a million times the mass of the Earth,and you crushed it to six kilometers across,,you would make a black hole,,an object so dense,that if light veered too close, it would never escape --,a dark shadow against the universe.,It wasn't Einstein who realized this,,it was Karl Schwarzschild,who was a German Jew in World War I --,joined the German army already an accomplished scientist,,working on the Russian front.,I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches,calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire,,and then, in between,,calculating Einstein's equations --,as you do in the trenches.,And he was reading Einstein's recently published,general theory of relativity,,and he was thrilled by this theory.,And he quickly surmised,an exact mathematical solution,that described something very extraordinary:,curves so strong,that space would rain down into them,,space itself would curve like a waterfall,flowing down the throat of a hole.,And even light could not escape this current.,Light would be dragged down the hole,as everything else would be,,and all that would be left would be a shadow. 
 Now he wrote to Einstein,,and he said, "As you will see,,the war has been kind to me enough.,Despite the heavy gunfire,,I've been able to get away from it all,and walk through the land of your ideas.",And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution,,and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.,This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.,And he took Schwarzschild's idea,to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.,But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.,He did not believe they existed in nature.,He thought nature would protect us from their formation.,It was decades,before the term "black hole" was coined,and people realized,that black holes are real astrophysical objects --,in fact they're the death state,of very massive stars,that collapse catastrophically,at the end of their lifetime. 
 Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.,It's actually not massive enough.,But if we did a little thought experiment --,as Einstein was very fond of doing --,we could imagine,putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers,,and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit,,maybe 30 kilometers,outside of the black-hole sun.,And it would be self-illuminated,,because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light --,so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.,And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit,even 30 km,outside of this crushed black hole.,This crushed black hole,actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.,It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit,before it destroyed the Earth.,But basically that's what we're talking about.,We're talking about an object that you could crush down,to half the square area of Manhattan. 
 So we move this Earth very close --,30 kilometers outside --,and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.,There's a sort of myth,that black holes devour everything in the universe,,but you actually have to get very close to fall in.,But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point,,we can always see the Earth.,It cannot hide behind the black hole.,The light from the Earth, some of it falls in,,but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.,So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.,If this were Battlestar Galactica,and you're fighting the Cylons,,don't hide behind the black hole.,They can see you. 
 Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole --,it's not massive enough --,but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.,And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way,,this is what it would look like.,We would see a shadow of that black hole,against the hundred billion stars,in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.,And if we were to fall towards this black hole,,we would see all of that light lensed around it,,and we could even start to cross into that shadow,and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.,It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there,because we couldn't,,anymore than light can escape. 
 But even though the black hole is dark from the outside,,it's not dark on the inside,,because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.,And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation,,our clocks would seem to slow down,relative to galactic time,,it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy,had been sped up and shot at us,,right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.,It would be like a near-death experience,where you see the light at the end of the tunnel,,but it's a total death experience.,(Laughter),And there's no way of telling anybody,about the light at the end of the tunnel. 
 Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole,,but black holes can be heard,,even if they're not seen.,Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation --,imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.,Maybe they started as stars,and collapsed to two black holes --,each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.,So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.,They can be spinning,hundreds of times a second.,At the end of their lives,,they're going around each other very near the speed of light.,So they're crossing thousands of kilometers,in a fraction of a second,,and as they do so, they not only curve space,,but they leave behind in their wake,a ringing of space,,an actual wave on space-time.,Space squeezes and stretches,as it emanates out from these black holes,banging on the universe.,And they travel out into the cosmos,at the speed of light. 
 This computer simulation,is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.,It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.,This was one of the groups.,It shows two black holes in orbit around each other,,again, with these helpfully painted curves.,And if you can see -- it's kind of faint --,but if you can see the red waves emanating out,,those are the gravitational waves.,They're literally the sounds of space ringing,,and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light,as they ring down and coalesce,to one spinning, quiet black hole,at the end of the day.,If you were standing near enough,,your ear would resonate,with the squeezing and stretching of space.,You would literally hear the sound.,Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully,,so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.,But I'd like to play for you,the sound that we predict. 
 This is from my group --,a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.,Imagine a lighter black hole,falling into a very heavy black hole.,The sound you're hearing,is the light black hole banging on space,each time it gets close.,If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.,But it comes in like a mallet,,and it literally cracks space,,wobbling it like a drum.,And we can predict what the sound will be.,We know that, as it falls in,,it gets faster and it gets louder.,And eventually,,we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.,(Thumping),Then it's gone.,Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.,At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.,It's sort of like ding, ding, ding. 
 This is another sound from my group.,No, I'm not showing you any images,,because black holes don't leave behind,helpful trails of ink,,and space is not painted,,showing you the curves.,But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday,and you heard this,,you want to get moving.,(Laughter),Want to get away from the sound.,Both black holes are moving.,Both black holes are getting closer together.,In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.,And then they're going to merge.,(Thumping),Now it's gone.,Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging --,that it chirps up at the end.,Now that's our prediction,for what we'll see. 
 Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.,And surely, somewhere in the universe,two black holes have merged.,And surely, the space around us,is ringing,after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years,,at the speed of light to get to us.,But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.,There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth --,one called LIGO --,which will detect deviations,in the squeezing and stretching of space,at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom,over four kilometers.,It's a remarkably ambitious experiment,,and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity,within the next few years -- to pick this up.,There's also a mission proposed for space,,which hopefully will launch in the next ten years,,called LISA.,And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes --,black holes millions or billions of times,the mass of the Sun. 
 In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.,They look like they're frozen in some embrace.,And each one probably harbors,a super-massive black hole at its core.,But they're not frozen;,they're actually merging.,These two black holes are colliding,,and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.,It's beyond our human perception,to pick up a song of that duration.,But LISA could see the final stages,of two super-massive black holes,earlier in the universe's history,,the last 15 minutes before they fall together.,And it's not just black holes,,but it's also any big disturbance in the universe --,and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.,When that expression was coined, it was derisive --,like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?",But now it actually might be more technically accurate,because it might bang.,It might make a sound. 
 This animation from my friends at Proton Studios,shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.,We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe,because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.,So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.,It's everywhere, it's all around you,,and the space is wobbling chaotically.,Fourteen billion years pass,and this song is still ringing all around us.,Galaxies form,,and generations of stars form in those galaxies,,and around one star,,at least one star,,is a habitable planet.,And here we are frantically building these experiments,,doing these calculations, writing these computer codes. 
 Imagine a billion years ago,,two black holes collided.,That song has been ringing through space,for all that time.,We weren't even here.,It gets closer and closer --,40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.,It's like hurry, build your instruments.,It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...,whatever year it will be,when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity --,we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines,and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.,If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up,,it would sound like this.,(Static) It's a terrible sound.,It's literally the definition of noise.,It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.,But it's around us everywhere, presumably,,if it hasn't been wiped out,by some other process in the universe.,And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears,because it will be the quiet echo,of that moment of our creation,,of our observable universe. 
 So within the next few years,,we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit,,render the universe in audio.,But if we detect those earliest moments,,it'll bring us that much closer,to an understanding of the Big Bang,,which brings us that much closer,to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.,If we run the movie of our universe backwards,,we know that there was a Big Bang in our past,,and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it,,but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?,I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?,Will it happen again?,I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge,to reignite wonder,,we can ask questions, at least for this last minute,,that honestly might evade us forever. 
 But we have to ask:,Is it possible that our universe,is just a plume off of some greater history?,Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse --,each branch with its own Big Bang in its past --,maybe some of them with black holes playing drums,,maybe some without --,maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without --,not in our past, not in our future,,but somehow fundamentally connected to us?,So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse,,in some other patch of that multiverse,,are there creatures?,Here's my multiverse creatures.,Are there other creatures in the multiverse,,wondering about us,and wondering about their own origins?,And if they are,,I can imagine them as we are,,calculating, writing computer code,,building instruments,,trying to detect that faintest sound,of their origins,and wondering who else is out there. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hi, my name is Marcin --,farmer, technologist.,I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.,I started a group called Open Source Ecology.,We've identified the 50 most important machines,that we think it takes for modern life to exist --,things from tractors,,bread ovens, circuit makers.,Then we set out to create,an open source, DIY, do it yourself version,that anyone can build and maintain,at a fraction of the cost.,We call this the Global Village Construction Set. 
 So let me tell you a story.,So I finished my 20s,with a Ph.D. in fusion energy,,and I discovered I was useless.,I had no practical skills.,The world presented me with options,,and I took them.,I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.,So I started a farm in Missouri,and learned about the economics of farming.,I bought a tractor -- then it broke.,I paid to get it repaired --,then it broke again.,Then pretty soon,,I was broke too. 
 I realized,that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed,to start a sustainable farm and settlement,just didn't exist yet.,I needed tools that were robust, modular,,highly efficient and optimized,,low-cost,,made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,,not designed for obsolescence.,I found that I would have to build them myself.,So I did just that.,And I tested them.,And I found that industrial productivity,can be achieved on a small scale. 
 So then I published the 3D designs,,schematics,,instructional videos and budgets,on a wiki.,Then contributors from all over the world,began showing up, prototyping new machines,during dedicated project visits.,So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.,And now the project,is beginning to grow on its own. 
 We know that open source has succeeded,with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.,And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.,We're focusing on hardware,because it is hardware that can change people's lives,in such tangible material ways.,If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,,then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. 
 That's not only in the developing world.,Our tools are being made,for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.,We've seen lots of excitement from these people,,who can now start a construction business,,parts manufacturing,,organic CSA,or just selling power back to the grid.,Our goal is a repository of published designs,so clear, so complete,,that a single burned DVD,is effectively a civilization starter kit. 
 I've planted a hundred trees in a day.,I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day,from the dirt beneath my feet,and built a tractor in six days.,From what I've seen, this is only the beginning. 
 If this idea is truly sound,,then the implications are significant.,A greater distribution of the means of production,,environmentally sound supply chains,,and a newly relevant DIY maker culture,can hope to transcend,artificial scarcity.,We're exploring the limits,of what we all can do to make a better world,with open hardware technology. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So today, I want us to reflect,on the demise of guys.,Guys are flaming out academically;,they're wiping out socially with girls,and sexually with women.,Other than that, there's not much of a problem.,So what's the data?,So the data on dropping out is amazing.,Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls,to drop out of school.,In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.,Girls outperform boys now at every level,,from elementary school to graduate school.,There's a 10 percent differential,between getting BA's and all graduate programs,,with guys falling behind girls.,Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys.,And as you all know,,boys are five times more likely than girls,to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder --,and therefore we drug them with Ritalin. 
 What's the evidence of wiping out?,First, it's a new fear of intimacy.,Intimacy means physical, emotional connection,with somebody else --,and especially with somebody of the opposite sex,who gives off ambiguous, contradictory,,phosphorescent signals.,(Laughter),And every year there's research done,on self-reported shyness among college students.,And we're seeing a steady increase among males.,And this is two kinds.,It's a social awkwardness.,The old shyness was a fear of rejection.,It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.,They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do,,especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.,They don't know the language of face contact,,the non-verbal and verbal set of rules,that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else,,listen to somebody else. 
 There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome,,which tries to account for why guys really prefer,male bonding over female mating.,It turns out, from earliest childhood,,boys, and then men,,prefer the company of guys --,physical company.,And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at,,because guys have been with guys,in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,,especially in the military, and then in pubs.,And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday,when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,,watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers,,rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.,The problem is they now prefer,[the] asynchronistic Internet world,to the spontaneous interaction,in social relationships. 
 What are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence.,I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming,,excessive new access to pornography.,The problem is these are arousal addictions.,Drug addiction, you simply want more.,Arousal addiction, you want different.,Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.,So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained. 
 And the problem is the industry is supplying it.,Jane McGonigal told us last year,that by the time a boy is 21,,he's played 10,000 hours of video games,,most of that in isolation.,As you remember, Cindy Gallop said,men don't know the difference,between making love and doing porn.,The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.,And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.,(Laughter),And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America --,15 billion annually.,For every 400 movies made in Hollywood,,there are 11,000 now made porn videos. 
 So the effect, very quickly,,is it's a new kind of arousal.,Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way,for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.,That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes,,which are analog, static, interactively passive.,They're also totally out of sync,in romantic relationships,,which build gradually and subtly. 
 So what's the solution? It's not my job.,I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But who should care? The only people who should care about this,is parents of boys and girls,,educators, gamers, filmmakers,and women who would like a real man,who they can talk to, who can dance,,who can make love slowly,and contribute to the evolutionary pressures,to keep our species above banana slugs.,No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I think data can actually make us more human.,We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives,,and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories.,Recently, a wise media theorist Tweeted,,"The 19th century culture was defined by the novel,,the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema,,and the culture of the 21st century,will be defined by the interface.",And I believe this is going to prove true.,Our lives are being driven by data,,and the presentation of that data is an opportunity,for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories.,So I'm going to show you a few of the projects,that I've been working on over the last couple years,that reflect on our lives and our systems. 
 This is a project called Flight Patterns.,What you're looking at is airplane traffic,over North America for a 24-hour period.,As you see, everything starts to fade to black,,and you see people going to sleep.,Followed by that, you see on the West coast,planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast.,And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast,,followed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner.,Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast.,You see San Francisco and Los Angeles,start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner. 
 I think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes,being monitored by the federal government at any one time,,and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.,This is a time-lapse image of that exact same data,,but I've color-coded it by type,,so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us.,And I started making these, and I put them into Google Maps,and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports,and the patterns that are occurring there.,So here we can see the white represents low altitudes,,and the blue are higher altitudes.,And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta.,You can see this is a major shipping airport,,and there's all kinds of activity there.,You can also toggle between altitude,for model and manufacturer.,See again, the diversity.,And you can scroll around and see,some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have.,This is scrolling up the East coast.,You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York,with the air traffic controllers,having to deal with all those major airports next to each other. 
 So zooming back out real quick,,we see, again, the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner.,Moving across to the West coast,,you see San Francisco and Los Angeles --,big low-traffic zones,across Nevada and Arizona.,And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom.,I started taking a look as well at different perimeters,,because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.,This is looking at ascending versus descending flights.,And you can see, over time, the ways the airports change.,You see the holding patterns that start to develop,in the bottom of the screen.,And you can see, eventually the airport actually flips directions. 
 So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT.,This is visualizing international communications.,So it's how New York communicates,with other international cities.,And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York,for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition.,And it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset,,so you could see the changing relationship,and some demographic info,coming through AT&amp;T's data and revealing itself.,This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab,and CurrentCity.org.,And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.,So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow,of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city,,until we approach New Year's Eve, where everybody says, "Happy New Year!" 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is an interactive tool,that you can move around and see different parts of the city.,This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day.,So again, you get this daily ebb and flow,of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.,And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city,to celebrate the night before,,which happens right here.,And then you can see people celebrating the next day.,And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. 
 So now on to something completely different.,Some of you may recognize this.,This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.,And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well,,except for one thing: it's not a robot at all.,There's actually a legless man that sits in that box,and controls this chess player.,This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon,called the Mechanical Turk -- named after this guy.,And it's based on the premise that there are certain things,that are easy for people, but really difficult for computers.,So they made this web service and said,,"Any programmer can write a piece of software,and tap into the minds of thousands of people.",The nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing.,I can tap into thousands of people's minds.",And the other nerdy side of me thought,,"This is horrible. This is completely bizarre.,What does this mean for the future of mankind,,where we're all plugged into this borg?",I was probably being a little extreme.,But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on,,and we're just doing these little labors? 
 So I created this drawing tool.,I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.,And I said, "I'll pay you two cents for your contribution.",And I started collecting sheep.,And I collected a lot, a lot of different sheep.,Lots of sheep.,I took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected,,and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com,where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep.,You can't pick individual sheep,,but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.,And juxtaposed against this grid,,you see actually, by rolling over each individual one,,the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.,I think there's something really interesting,to watching people as they go through this creative toil --,something we can all relate to,,this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing.,I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity,versus this massive distributed grid.,Kind of amazing what some people did. 
 So here's a few statistics from the project.,Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour,,which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.,There were 662 rejected sheep,that didn't meet "sheep-like" criteria and were thrown out of the flock.,(Laughter),The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes.,That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication.,And there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project,,or were unique IP addresses --,so about how many people contributed.,But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this.,(Laughter),Which I was pretty surprised by.,I expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?",And I think it's a pretty valid question. 
 And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep.,Sheep were the first animal,to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts,,the first to be selectively bred for production traits,,the first animal to be cloned.,Obviously, we think of sheep as followers.,And there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince",where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep.,He draws sheep after sheep.,The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box.,And he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.,It's about your own interpretation and doing something different.",And I like that. 
 So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times.",It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes,during the Industrial Revolution.,So there were no longer shoe makers,,but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes.,And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot.,So I thought this was an interesting clip,to divide into 16 pieces,and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool.,This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame,,and on the right side you see that frame,as interpreted by 16 people,who have no idea what it is they're doing. 
 And this was the inspiration for a project,that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima.,We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for,,which is making money.,So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces,,and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.,We asked people to draw what it was that they saw.,But here there was no sheep-like criteria.,People, if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face,,it actually made it into the bill.,So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did,what it was they were asked to do.,So we took these hundred dollar bills,,and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com,,where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions.,And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills,and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project,,which is now known as One Laptop Per Child.,This is again showing all the different contributions.,You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings,,like this one on top --,spent a long time making realistic versions.,And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.,Here on the right-hand side in the middle,you see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?",That's all I'm getting paid for this? 
 (Laughter) 
 So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about,is called Bicycle Built for 2000.,This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey.,You may recognize these two guys.,This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '60s,,where they created the song "Daisy Bell,",which was the world's first singing computer.,You may recognize it from "2001: A Space Odyssey.",When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song,,as a reference to when computers became human.,So we resynthesized this song.,This is what that sounded like.,We broke down all the individual notes,in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. 
 Daisy Bell: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ... ♫ 
 Aaron Koblin: And we took all of those individual pieces,,and we fed them into another Turk request.,This is what it would look like if you went to the site.,You type in your code,,but you first test your mic.,You'd be fed a simple audio clip.,(Honk),And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice.,After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted,,you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context.,And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. 
 Recording: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ♫,♫ give me your answer do ♫,♫ I'm half crazy ♫,♫ all for the love of you ♫,♫ It can't be a stylish marriage ♫,♫ I can't afford a carriage ♫,♫ But you'll look sweet upon the seat ♫,♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ 
 AK: So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds,,that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual.,We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative, distributed music making,,where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on.,So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com,you can actually hear what all this sounds like together.,I'm sorry for this. 
 (Noise) 
 Chorus: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ♫,♫ Give me your answer do ♫,♫ I'm half crazy ♫,♫ all for the love of you ♫,♫ It can't be a stylish marriage ♫,♫ I can't afford a carriage ♫,♫ But you'd look sweet upon the seat ♫,♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ 
 AK: So stepping back for a quick second,,when I was at UCLA going to grad school,,I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing.,And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners.,So basically motion through 3D space.,And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost,who said, "Wait a minute.,You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?",So we did exactly that.,We made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead.,And I think one of my favorite parts of this project,was not just shooting a video with lasers,,but we also open sourced it,,and we made it released as a Google Code project,,where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code,to build their own versions of it.,And people were making some amazing things.,This is actually two of my favorites:,the pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke.,A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content.,More recently, somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke's head,,which is a little creepy, but pretty cool. 
 So with everybody making so much amazing stuff,and actually understanding what it was they were working on,,I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project,where people were working together to build something.,And I met a music video director named Chris Milk.,And we started bouncing around ideas,to make a collaborative music video project.,But we knew we really needed the right person,to kind of rally behind and build something for.,So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months.,And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin,,who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album,called "Ain't No Grave.",The lyrics to the leading track are "Ain't no grave can hold my body down.",So we thought this was the perfect,project to build a collaborative memorial,and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash. 
 So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello, also known as Mr. doob,,who's a much better programmer than I am,,and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool.,As you know,,an animation is a series of images.,So what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash,,and at eight frames a second,,we allowed individuals to draw a single frame,that would get woven into,this dynamically changing music video.,So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you,,but I want to show you two short clips.,One is the beginning of the music video.,And that's going to be followed by a short clip,of people who have already contributed to the project,talking about it briefly. 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Johnny Cash: ♫ There ain't no grave ♫,♫ can hold my body down ♫,♫ There ain't no grave ♫,♫ can hold body down ♫,♫ When I hear the trumpet sound ♫,♫ I'm going to ride right out of the ground ♫,♫ Ain't no grave ♫,♫ can hold my body ... ♫ 
 (Applause) 
 AK: What better way to pay tribute to the man,than to make something for one of his songs. 
 Collaborator: I felt really sad when he died.,And I just thought it'd be wonderful,,it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. 
 Collaborator Two: It really allows,this last recording of his,to be a living, breathing memorial. 
 Collaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans,,each individual frame,,it's got a very powerful feeling to it. 
 Collaborator Four: I've seen everybody,from Japan, Venezuela, to the States,,to Knoxville, Tennessee. 
 Collaborator Five: As much as is different from frame to frame,,it really is personal.,Collaborator Six: Watching the video in my room,,I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it.,And I just worked and worked through problems,,until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture,all began to resolve themselves.,You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing,,and a lot of light and dark comes into it.,And in a weird way,,that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well.,It's the sum total of his life,,all the things that had happened --,the bad things, the good things.,You're hearing a person's life. 
 AK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com,,what you'll see is the video playing above.,And below it are all the individual frames,that people have been submitting to the project.,So this isn't finished at all,,but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.,If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails,,you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail,and where they were located.,And if you find one that you're interested in,,you can actually click on it and open up an information panel,where you're able to rate that frame,,which helps it bubble up to the top.,And you can also see the way that it was drawn.,Again, you can get the playback and personal contribution.,In addition to that, it's listed, the artist's name, the location,,how long they spent drawing it.,And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract.",But there's a bunch of different styles.,And you can sort the video a number of different ways.,You can say, "I want to see the pointillist version,or the sketchy version or the realistic version.,And then this is, again, the abstract version,,which ends up getting a little bit crazy. 
 So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk.,And this is called "The Wilderness Downtown.",It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire.,Chris and I were really amazed,by the potential now with modern web browsers,,where you have HTML5 audio and video,and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast.,And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web,beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window,and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen.,But most importantly, I think,,we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project,,where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time,to contribute something for everyone.,What if we had a very low commitment,,but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed? 
 So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address,of the home where you grew up.,And you type in the address --,it actually creates a music video specifically for you,,pulling in Google maps and Streetview images,into the experience itself.,So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address,,but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect. 
 (Video) Win Butler: ♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫,♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫,♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫,♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫,♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫,♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫,♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫,♫ Sometimes it never came ♫,♫ Sometimes it never came ♫,♫ Still moving through the pain ♫,♫ We used to wait for it ♫,♫ We used to wait for it ♫,♫ We used to wait for it ♫ 
 AK: So I think, if there's one thing to take away from my talk today,,it's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device.,And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data,,we have an opportunity, and maybe even an obligation,,to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories,as we explore and collaborate together. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 (Applause)This is a representation of your brain,,and your brain can be broken into two parts.,There's the left half, which is the logical side,,and then the right half,,which is the intuitive.,And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,,then we can plot our brain.,And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.,This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.,So where would you put your brain on this scale?,Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,,but I think for most people in the audience,,your brain is something like this --,with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.,It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.,You can be logical and intuitive. 
 And so I consider myself one of these people,,along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,,who need a good deal of logic,to string together these complex ideas.,But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition,to actually make the experiments work.,How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.,So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,,and then we develop our intuition from there.,And really you do the same thing. 
 So some intuition,that you may have developed over the years,is that one thing is only in one place at a time.,I mean, it can sound weird to think about,one thing being in two different places at the same time,,but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.,And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.,He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.,But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,,and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,,and that they stay in one place. 
 And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,,unless you're a particle physicist.,It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,,because they don't play with car stops,,they play with these little weird particles.,And when they play with their particles,,they find they do all sorts of really weird things --,like they can fly right through walls,,or they can be in two different places at the same time.,And so they wrote down all these observations,,and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. 
 And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;,you needed quantum mechanics,to describe little, tiny particles.,But you didn't need it,to describe the large, everyday objects around us.,This didn't really sit well with my intuition,,and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.,Well, I play with them sometimes,,but not very often.,And I've never seen them.,I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.,But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.,Because if everything is made up of little particles,and all the little particles,follow quantum mechanics,,then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?,I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.,And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing,if we could somehow show,that an everyday object,also follows quantum mechanics.,So a few years ago, I set off to do just that. 
 So I made one.,This is the first object,that you can see,that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.,So what we're looking at here,is a tiny computer chip.,And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.,And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.,This is a photograph of the object.,And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.,And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.,So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,,and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.,And so I made this thing,in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.,I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,,and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.,For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --,to make this swimming pool-shaped hole,underneath the device.,This device has the ability,to be in a quantum superposition,,but it needs a little help to do it. 
 Here, let me give you an analogy.,You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?,I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,,but then other people get on board,and I stop doing those things,because I don't want to bother them,,or, frankly, scare them.,So quantum mechanics says,that inanimate objects feel the same way.,The fellow passengers for inanimate objects,are not just people,,but it's also the light shining on it,and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.,And so we knew, if we wanted to see,this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,,we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. 
 And so that's what we did.,We turned off the lights,,and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,,and then we cooled it down,to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.,Now, all alone in the elevator,,the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.,And so we measured its motion.,We found it was moving in really weird ways.,Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,,and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --,like expanding and contracting bellows.,And by giving it a gentle nudge,,we were able to make it both vibrate,and not vibrate,at the same time --,something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. 
 So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.,What does it mean for one thing,to be both vibrating and not vibrating,at the same time?,So let's think about the atoms.,So in one case:,all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal,are sitting still,and at the same time those same atoms,are moving up and down.,Now it's only at precise times when they align.,The rest of the time they're delocalized.,That means that every atom,is in two different places at the same time,,which in turn means the entire chunk of metal,is in two different places.,I think this is really cool.,(Laughter),Really. 
 (Applause) 
 It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years,because, check this out,,the difference in scale,between a single atom and that chunk of metal,is about the same as the difference,between that chunk of metal and you.,So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,,that chunk of metal can be in two different places,,then why not you?,I mean, this is just my logical side talking.,So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,,what would that be like?,How would your consciousness,handle your body being delocalized in space? 
 There's one more part to the story.,It's when we warmed it up,,and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,,we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.,And so I had to develop this new intuition,,that it seems like all the objects in the elevator,are really just quantum objects,just crammed into a tiny space. 
 You hear a lot of talk,about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.,Well, that's not quite right.,It's more than that; it's deeper.,It's that those connections,,your connections to all the things around you,,literally define who you are,,and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My name is Amit.,And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,,and I pitched this idea,of doing something with museums and art,to my boss who's actually here,,and she allowed me to do it.,And it took 18 months.,A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,,with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.,But I'm going to focus on the demo.,There are a lot of stories about why we did this. 
 I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,,and it's access.,And I grew up in India.,I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --,but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.,And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,,I started learning a lot.,And while working at Google,,I tried to put this desire,to make it more accessible with technology together.,So we formed a team, a great team of people,,and we started doing this. 
 I'm going to probably get into the demo,and then tell you a couple of the interesting things,we've had since launch.,So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.,You look around at all these museums here.,You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,,the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.,I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,,the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.,Two ways of going in -- very simple.,Click and, bang, you're in this museum.,It doesn't matter where you are --,Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.,You move around, you have fun.,You want to navigate around the museum?,Open the plan up,,and, in one click, jump.,You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.,Keep going. Have fun.,Explore. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. 
 (Laughter) 
 So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,,"The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.,I see this plus sign.,If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.,Now this is one of the images.,So this is all of the meta-data information.,For those of you who are truly interested in art,,you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now.,And this is one of these images that we captured,in what we call gigapixel technology.,So this image, for example,,has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.,And I get a lot of people asking me:,"What do you get for 10 billion pixels?",So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.,You can zoom around very simply.,You see some fun stuff happening here.,I love this guy; his expression is priceless. 
 But then you really want to go deep.,And so I started playing around,,and I found something going on over here.,And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting.",Went in, and I started noticing,that these kids were actually beating something.,I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,,and actually found out that this is a game,called squall,,which involves beating a goose with a stick,on Shrove Tuesday.,And apparently it was quite popular.,I don't know why they did it,,but I learned something about it.,Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.,Now just to give you some perspective,,I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.,Here is where we were,,and this is the painting. 
 (Applause) 
 The best is yet to come -- so in a second.,So now let's just quickly,jump into the MoMA, again in New York.,So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night.",Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.,But what if you want to see brush strokes?,And what if you want to see,how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?,You zoom in. You really go in.,I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,,and I'm really going to get to the cracks.,This is "The Starry Night,",I think, never seen like this before. 
 I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.,There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.,This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.,Any one of you, anybody --,doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,,if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter.,You can go and create your own museum online --,create your own collection across all these images.,Very simply, you go in --,and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom --,you can just zoom around.,This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.,You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends,and really get a conversation going,about what you're feeling,when you go through these masterpieces. 
 So I think, in conclusion,,for me, the main thing,is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.,It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.,I probably shouldn't say that.,It really comes from these artists.,And that's been my humbling experience in this.,I mean, I hope in this digital medium,that we do justice to their artwork,and represent it properly online.,And the biggest question I get asked nowadays,is, "Did you do this,to replicate the experience of going to a museum?",And the answer is no.,It's to supplement the experience. 
 And that's it. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.,But you have to have the right tools.,If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics,,I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.,And similarly, she finds prototyping boards,really frustrating for her little hands.,So my wonderful student Sam and I,decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of:,Play-Doh.,And so we spent a summer,looking at different Play-Doh recipes.,And these recipes probably look really familiar,to any of you who have made homemade play-dough --,pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.,We have two favorite recipes --,one that has these ingredients,and a second that had sugar instead of salt.,And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these. 
 But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.,You see that really salty Play-Doh?,Well, it conducts electricity.,And this is nothing new.,It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity,,and high school physics teachers have used that for years.,But our homemade play-dough,actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.,And that sugar dough?,Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current,than that salt dough.,So what does that mean?,Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits --,circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands,can build on their own. 
 (Applause) 
 And so I want to do a little demo for you.,So if I take this salt dough,,again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids,,and I plug it in --,it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack,,you can buy them at Radio Shack,and pretty much anywhere else --,we can actually then,light things up.,But if any of you have studied electrical engineering,,we can also create a short circuit.,If I push these together, the light turns off.,Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.,If I separate them again, I have some light.,Well now if I take that sugar dough,,the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.,It's like a wall to the electricity.,If I place that between, now all the dough is touching,,but if I stick that light back in,,I have light.,In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.,If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor,,put some play-dough on it, stick it on,and we have spinning. 
 (Applause) 
 And once you have the basics,,we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.,We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids.,I plug in again the power to it.,And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.,I can start plugging in lots of lights.,And we can start talking about things like electrical load.,What happens if I put in lots of lights,and then add a motor?,It'll dim.,We can even add microprocessors,and have this as an input,and create squishy sound music that we've done.,You could do parallel and series circuits,for kids using this. 
 So this is all in your home kitchen.,We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.,We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.,We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves.,And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.,We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids,,to a science researcher in the U.K.,,and curriculum developers in Hawaii. 
 So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh,,grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.,We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab,or little kids as circuit designers,,but maybe we should. 
 Have fun. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm here to talk about,the wonder and the mystery,of conscious minds.,The wonder is about the fact,that we all woke up this morning,and we had with it,the amazing return of our conscious mind.,We recovered minds with a complete sense of self,and a complete sense of our own existence,,yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.,We should, in fact,,because without having this possibility of conscious minds,,we would have no knowledge whatsoever,about our humanity;,we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world.,We would have no pains, but also no joys.,We would have no access to love,or to the ability to create.,And of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously,that "he who invented consciousness,would have a lot to be blamed for.",But he also forgot,that without consciousness,,he would have no access to true happiness,and even the possibility of transcendence. 
 So much for the wonder, now for the mystery.,This is a mystery,that has really been extremely hard to elucidate.,All the way back into early philosophy,and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience,,this has been one mystery,that has always resisted elucidation,,has got major controversies.,And there are actually many people,that think we should not even touch it;,we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.,I don't believe that,,and I think the situation is changing.,It would be ridiculous to claim,that we know how we make consciousness,in our brains,,but we certainly can begin,to approach the question,,and we can begin to see the shape of a solution. 
 And one more wonder to celebrate,is the fact that we have imaging technologies,that now allow us to go inside the human brain,and be able to do, for example,,what you're seeing right now.,These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab,,and which show you, in a living brain,,the reconstruction of that brain.,And this is a person who is alive.,This is not a person,that is being studied at autopsy.,And even more --,and this is something that one can be really amazed about --,is what I'm going to show you next,,which is going underneath the surface of the brain,and actually looking in the living brain,at real connections, real pathways.,So all of those colored lines,correspond to bunches of axons,,the fibers that join cell bodies,to synapses.,And I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't come in color.,But at any rate, they are there.,The colors are codes for the direction,,from whether it is back to front,or vice versa. 
 At any rate, what is consciousness?,What is a conscious mind?,And we could take a very simple view,and say, well, it is that which we lose,when we fall into deep sleep without dreams,,or when we go under anesthesia,,and it is what we regain,when we recover from sleep,or from anesthesia.,But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia,,or when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?,Well first of all,,it is a mind,,which is a flow of mental images.,And of course consider images,that can be sensory patterns,,visual, such as you're having right now,in relation to the stage and me,,or auditory images,,as you are having now in relation to my words.,That flow of mental images,is mind. 
 But there is something else,that we are all experiencing in this room.,We are not passive exhibitors,of visual or auditory,or tactile images.,We have selves.,We have a Me,that is automatically present,in our minds right now.,We own our minds.,And we have a sense that it's everyone of us,that is experiencing this --,not the person who is sitting next to you.,So in order to have a conscious mind,,you have a self within the conscious mind.,So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.,The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind,,and we are only fully conscious,when self comes to mind.,So what we need to know to even address this mystery,is, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain,,and, number two, how selves are constructed. 
 Now the first part, the first problem,,is relatively easy -- it's not easy at all --,but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience.,And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds,,we need to construct neural maps.,So imagine a grid, like the one I'm showing you right now,,and now imagine, within that grid,,that two-dimensional sheet,,imagine neurons.,And picture, if you will,,a billboard, a digital billboard,,where you have elements,that can be either lit or not.,And depending on how you create the pattern,of lighting or not lighting,,the digital elements,,or, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet,,you're going to be able to construct a map.,This, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you,,but this applies to any kind of map --,auditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies,,or to the maps that we construct with our skin,in relation to an object that we palpate. 
 Now to bring home the point,of how close it is --,the relationship between the grid of neurons,and the topographical arrangement,of the activity of the neurons,and our mental experience --,I'm going to tell you a personal story.,So if I cover my left eye --,I'm talking about me personally, not all of you --,if I cover my left eye,,I look at the grid -- pretty much like the one I'm showing you.,Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular.,But sometime ago, I discovered,that if I cover my left eye,,instead what I get is this.,I look at the grid and I see a warping,at the edge of my central-left field. 
 Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while.,But sometime ago,,through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine,,Carmen Puliafito,,who developed a laser scanner of the retina,,I found out the the following.,If I scan my retina,through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner,,what I get is the following.,On the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical.,You see the going down towards the fovea,where the optic nerve begins.,But on my left retina there is a bump,,which is marked there by the red arrow.,And it corresponds to a little cyst,that is located below.,And that is exactly what causes,the warping of my visual image. 
 So just think of this:,you have a grid of neurons,,and now you have a plane mechanical change,in the position of the grid,,and you get a warping of your mental experience.,So this is how close,your mental experience,and the activity of the neurons in the retina,,which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball,,or, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex.,So from the retina,you go onto visual cortex.,And of course, the brain adds on,a lot of information,to what is going on,in the signals that come from the retina.,And in that image there,,you see a variety of islands,of what I call image-making regions in the brain.,You have the green for example,,that corresponds to tactile information,,or the blue that corresponds to auditory information. 
 And something else that happens,is that those image-making regions,where you have the plotting,of all these neural maps,,can then provide signals,to this ocean of purple that you see around,,which is the association cortex,,where you can make records of what went on,in those islands of image-making.,And the great beauty,is that you can then go from memory,,out of those association cortices,,and produce back images,in the very same regions that have perception.,So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy,the brain is.,So it provides certain areas,for perception and image-making.,And those are exactly the same,that are going to be used for image-making,when we recall information. 
 So far the mystery of the conscious mind,is diminishing a little bit,because we have a general sense,of how we make these images.,But what about the self?,The self is really the elusive problem.,And for a long time,,people did not even want to touch it,,because they'd say,,"How can you have this reference point, this stability,,that is required to maintain,the continuity of selves day after day?",And I thought about a solution to this problem.,It's the following.,We generate brain maps,of the body's interior,and use them as the reference for all other maps. 
 So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.,I came to this because,,if you're going to have a reference that we know as self --,the Me, the I,in our own processing --,we need to have something that is stable,,something that does not deviate much,from day to day.,Well it so happens that we have a singular body.,We have one body, not two, not three.,And so that is a beginning.,There is just one reference point, which is the body.,But then, of course, the body has many parts,,and things grow at different rates,,and they have different sizes and different people;,however, not so with the interior.,The things that have to do,with what is known as our internal milieu --,for example, the whole management,of the chemistries within our body,are, in fact, extremely maintained,day after day,for one very good reason.,If you deviate too much,in the parameters,that are close to the midline,of that life-permitting survival range,,you go into disease or death.,So we have an in-built system,within our own lives,that ensures some kind of continuity.,I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.,Because if you don't have that sameness, physiologically,,you're going to be sick or you're going to die.,So that's one more element for this continuity. 
 And the final thing,is that there is a very tight coupling,between the regulation of our body within the brain,and the body itself,,unlike any other coupling.,So for example, I'm making images of you,,but there's no physiological bond,between the images I have of you as an audience,and my brain.,However, there is a close, permanently maintained bond,between the body regulating parts of my brain,and my own body. 
 So here's how it looks. Look at the region there.,There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex,and the spinal cord.,And it is within that region,that I'm going to highlight now,that we have this housing,of all the life-regulation devices,of the body.,This is so specific that, for example,,if you look at the part that is covered in red,in the upper part of the brain stem,,if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example,,what you get is coma,or vegetative state,,which is a state, of course,,in which your mind disappears,,your consciousness disappears.,What happens then actually,is that you lose the grounding of the self,,you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence,,and, in fact, there can be images going on,,being formed in the cerebral cortex,,except you don't know they're there.,You have, in effect, lost consciousness,when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem. 
 But if you consider the green part of the brain stem,,nothing like that happens.,It is that specific.,So in that green component of the brain stem,,if you damage it, and often it happens,,what you get is complete paralysis,,but your conscious mind is maintained.,You feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind,that you can report very indirectly.,This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it.,And people are, in fact, imprisoned,within their own bodies,,but they do have a mind.,There was a very interesting film,,one of the rare good films done,about a situation like this,,by Julian Schnabel some years ago,about a patient that was in that condition. 
 So now I'm going to show you a picture.,I promise not to say anything about this,,except this is to frighten you.,It's just to tell you,that in that red section of the brain stem,,there are, to make it simple,,all those little squares that correspond to modules,that actually make brain maps,of different aspects of our interior,,different aspects of our body.,They are exquisitely topographic,and they are exquisitely interconnected,in a recursive pattern.,And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling,between the brain stem and the body,that I believe -- and I could be wrong,,but I don't think I am --,that you generate this mapping of the body,that provides the grounding for the self,and that comes in the form of feelings --,primordial feelings, by the way. 
 So what is the picture that we get here?,Look at "cerebral cortex," look at "brain stem,",look at "body,",and you get the picture of the interconnectivity,in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self,in a very tight interconnection with the body.,And you have the cerebral cortex,providing the great spectacle of our minds,with the profusion of images,that are, in fact, the contents of our minds,and that we normally pay most attention to,,as we should, because that's really,the film that is rolling in our minds.,But look at the arrows.,They're not there for looks.,They're there because there's this very close interaction.,You cannot have a conscious mind,if you don't have the interaction,between cerebral cortex and brain stem.,You cannot have a conscious mind,if you don't have the interaction,between the brain stem and the body. 
 Another thing that is interesting,is that the brain stem that we have,is shared with a variety of other species.,So throughout vertebrates,,the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours,,which is one of the reasons why I think,those other species have conscious minds like we do.,Except that they're not as rich as ours,,because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do.,That's where the difference is.,And I strongly disagree with the idea,that consciousness should be considered,as the great product of the cerebral cortex.,Only the wealth of our minds is,,not the very fact that we have a self,that we can refer,to our own existence,,and that we have any sense of person. 
 Now there are three levels of self to consider --,the proto, the core and the autobiographical.,The first two are shared,with many, many other species,,and they are really coming out,largely of the brain stem,and whatever there is of cortex in those species.,It's the autobiographical self,which some species have, I think.,Cetaceans and primates have also,an autobiographical self to a certain degree.,And everybody's dogs at home,have an autobiographical self to a certain degree.,But the novelty is here. 
 The autobiographical self is built,on the basis of past memories,and memories of the plans that we have made;,it's the lived past and the anticipated future.,And the autobiographical self,has prompted extended memory, reasoning,,imagination, creativity and language.,And out of that came the instruments of culture --,religions, justice,,trade, the arts, science, technology.,And it is within that culture,that we really can get --,and this is the novelty --,something that is not entirely set by our biology.,It is developed in the cultures.,It developed in collectives of human beings.,And this is, of course, the culture,where we have developed something that I like to call,socio-cultural regulation. 
 And finally, you could rightly ask,,why care about this?,Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex,and how this is made?,Three reasons. First, curiosity.,Primates are extremely curious --,and humans most of all.,And if we are interested, for example,,in the fact that anti-gravity,is pulling galaxies away from the Earth,,why should we not be interested in what is going on,inside of human beings? 
 Second, understanding society and culture.,We should look,at how society and culture,in this socio-cultural regulation,are a work in progress.,And finally, medicine.,Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases,of humankind,are diseases such as depression,,Alzheimer's disease, drug addiction.,Think of strokes that can devastate your mind,or render you unconscious.,You have no prayer,of treating those diseases effectively,and in a non-serendipitous way,if you do not know how this works.,So that's a very good reason,beyond curiosity,to justify what we're doing,,and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains. 
 Thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)Good afternoon, everybody.,I've got something to show you.,(Laughter),Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.,This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.,Let me tell you a bit about it.,Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,,and every boy in Italy grows up,with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --,but the reason I'm showing you this,is that something very interesting,happened in Formula 1 racing,over the past couple of decades.,Now some time ago,,if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,,you take a budget, and you bet your budget,on a good driver and a good car.,And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.,Now today, if you want to win the race,,actually you need also something like this --,something that monitors the car in real time,,has a few thousand sensors,collecting information from the car,,transmitting this information into the system,,and then processing it,and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions,and changing things in real time,as information is collected.,This is what, in engineering terms,,you would call a real time control system.,And basically, it's a system made of two components --,a sensing and an actuating component. 
 What is interesting today,is that real time control systems,are starting to enter into our lives.,Our cities, over the past few years,,just have been blanketed,with networks, electronics.,They're becoming like computers in open air.,And, as computers in open air,,they're starting to respond in a different way,to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.,If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.,Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,,cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,,but they are 50 percent of the world's population.,They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --,up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.,So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.,Beyond cities,,all of this sensing and actuating,is entering our everyday objects. 
 That's from an exhibition that,Paola Antonelli is organizing,at MoMA later this year, during the summer.,It's called "Talk to Me.",Well our objects, our environment,is starting to talk back to us.,In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there,were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.,And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans,with the environment out there.,In a certain sense,,it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...,you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,,at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --,actually you can still see a small chip underneath --,and said, shouted,,"Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?",Well today, for the first time,,our environment is starting to talk back to us.,And I'll show just a few examples --,again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it. 
 Let's starting with sensing.,Well, the first project I wanted to share with you,is actually one of the first projects by our lab.,It was four and a half years ago in Italy.,And what we did there,was actually use a new type of network at the time,that had been deployed all across the world --,that's a cellphone network --,and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,,that's collected anyway by the operator,,in order to understand,how the city works.,The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.,It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.,Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,,and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.,And anyway, Italy won at the end. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now look at what happened that day,just by monitoring activity,happening on the network.,Here you see the city.,You see the Colosseum in the middle,,the river Tiber.,It's morning, before the match.,You see the timeline on the top.,Early afternoon,,people here and there,,making calls and moving.,The match begins -- silence.,France scores. Italy scores.,Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.,Second half. End of normal time.,First overtime, second.,Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.,Italy wins. Yeah.,(Laughter),(Applause),Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.,You saw the big peak.,The following day, again everybody went to the center,to meet the winning team,and the prime minister at the time.,And then everybody moved down.,You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,,where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,,to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.,Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today,in a way that we couldn't have done,just a few years ago. 
 Another quick example about sensing:,it's not about people,,but about things we use and consume.,Well today, we know everything,about where our objects come from.,This is a map that shows you,all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.,But we know very little about where things go.,So in this project,,we actually developed some small tags,to track trash as it moves through the system.,So we actually started with a number of volunteers,who helped us in Seattle,,just over a year ago,,to tag what they were throwing away --,different types of things, as you can see here --,things they would throw away anyway.,Then we put a little chip, little tag,,onto the trash,and then started following it.,Here are the results we just obtained. 
 (Music) 
 From Seattle ...,after one week.,With this information we realized,there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.,We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.,This data was not available before.,But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.,But the other thing is that we believe,that if we see every day,that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,,it's still somewhere on the planet.,And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.,And if we show that to people,,then we can also promote some behavioral change.,So that was the reason for the project. 
 My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,,he could tell you much more about sensing,and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,,but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,,and that's actuating our environment.,And the first project,is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.,It started with a question by the mayor of the city,,who came to us saying,that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition,of using water in public space, in architecture.,And the question was: How could technology, new technology,,be added to that?,And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop,was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,,solenoid valves, taps,,opening and closing.,You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.,If those pixels fall,,you can write on it,,you can show patterns, images, text.,And even you can approach it, and it will open up,to let you jump through,,as you see in this image. 
 Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.,He liked it very much.,And we got a commission to design a building,at the entrance of the expo.,We called it Digital Water Pavilion.,The whole building is made of water.,There's no doors or windows,,but when you approach it,,it will open up to let you in.,(Music),The roof also is covered with water.,And if there's a bit of wind,,if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.,Or you could close the building,,and the whole architecture will disappear,,like in this case.,You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,,when they take the roof down,,of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building.",No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,,the architecture almost disappears.,Here's the building working.,You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.,And here was myself trying not to get wet,,testing the sensors that open the water. 
 Well, I should tell you now what happened one night,when all of the sensors stopped working.,But actually that night, it was even more fun.,All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,,because the way of engaging with the building became something different.,Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,,but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,,and you had to jump without getting wet. 
 (Video) (Crowd Noise) 
 And that was, for us, was very interesting,,because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,,we always think about how people will use the things we design.,But then reality's always unpredictable.,And that's the beauty of doing things,that are used and interact with people. 
 Here is an image then of the building,with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,,and then projections on them.,And this is what led us to think about,the following project I'll show you now.,That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.,Imagine you could have small helicopters,that move in the air,,and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --,almost as a cloud that can move in space.,Here is the video. 
 (Music) 
 So imagine one helicopter,,like the one we saw before,,moving with others,,in synchrony.,So you can have this cloud.,You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --,a regular configuration in two dimensions.,Or in regular, but in three dimensions,,where the thing that changes is the light,,not the pixels' position.,You can play with a different type.,Imagine your screen could just appear,in different scales or sizes,,different types of resolution.,But then the whole thing can be,just a 3D cloud of pixels,that you can approach and move through it,and see from many, many directions.,Here is the real Flyfire,control and going down to form the regular grid as before.,When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.,And imagine each of them then controlled by people.,You can have each pixel,having an input that comes from people,,from people's movement, or so and so. 
 I want to show you something here for the first time.,We've been working with Roberto Bolle,,one of today's top ballet dancers --,the étoile at Metropolitan in New York,and La Scala in Milan --,and actually captured his movement in 3D,in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.,And here you can see Roberto dancing.,You see on the left the pixels,,the different resolutions being captured.,It's both 3D scanning in real time,and motion capture.,So you can reconstruct a whole movement.,You can go all the way through.,But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them,and play with color and movement,and gravity and rotation.,So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs,for Flyfire. 
 I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.,It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.,It's called The Cloud.,And the idea here is, imagine, again,,we can involve people,in doing something and changing our environment --,almost to impart what we call cloud raising --,like barn raising, but with a cloud.,Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.,And I think what is remarkable,that has happened over the past couple of years,is that, over the past couple of decades,,we went from the physical world to the digital one.,This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,,and making that accessible through the Internet. 
 Now today, for the first time --,and the Obama campaign showed us this --,we can go from the digital world,,from the self-organizing power of networks,,to the physical one.,This can be, in our case,,we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.,That means something built in a city.,But tomorrow it can be,,in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --,think about climate change or CO2 emissions --,how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.,So the idea that we can actually involve people,in doing this thing together, collectively. 
 The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,,in the same way as the real cloud,is a cloud made of particles.,And those particles are water,,where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.,It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.,You can move inside, have different types of experiences.,You can actually see from underneath,,sharing the main moments,for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,,and really using it as a way to connect with the community.,So both the physical cloud in the sky,and something you can go to the top [of],,like London's new mountaintop.,You can enter inside it.,And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --,but most importantly,,a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I didn't always love unintended consequences,,but I've really learned to appreciate them.,I've learned that they're really the essence,of what makes for progress,,even when they seem to be terrible.,And I'd like to review,just how unintended consequences,play the part that they do. 
 Let's go to 40,000 years before the present,,to the time of the cultural explosion,,when music, art, technology,,so many of the things that we're enjoying today,,so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED,were born.,And the anthropologist Randall White,has made a very interesting observation:,that if our ancestors,40,000 years ago,had been able to see,what they had done,,they wouldn't have really understood it.,They were responding,to immediate concerns.,They were making it possible for us,to do what they do,,and yet, they didn't really understand,how they did it. 
 Now let's advance to 10,000 years before the present.,And this is when it really gets interesting.,What about the domestication of grains?,What about the origins of agriculture?,What would our ancestors 10,000 years ago,have said,if they really had technology assessment?,And I could just imagine the committees,reporting back to them,on where agriculture was going to take humanity,,at least in the next few hundred years.,It was really bad news.,First of all, worse nutrition,,maybe shorter life spans.,It was simply awful for women.,The skeletal remains from that period,have shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.,And politically, it was awful.,It was the beginning of a much higher degree,of inequality among people.,If there had been rational technology assessment then,,I think they very well might have said,,"Let's call the whole thing off." 
 Even now, our choices are having unintended effects.,Historically, for example,,chopsticks -- according to one Japanese anthropologist,who wrote a dissertation about it,at the University of Michigan --,resulted in long-term changes,in the dentition, in the teeth,,of the Japanese public.,And we are also changing our teeth right now.,There is evidence,that the human mouth and teeth,are growing smaller all the time.,That's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence.,But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal,,there would have been a lot of disapproval,of the wimpish choppers that we now have.,So these things are kind of relative,to where you or your ancestors happen to stand. 
 In the ancient world,there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences,,and there was a very healthy sense of caution,,reflected in the Tree of Knowledge,,in Pandora's Box,,and especially in the myth of Prometheus,that's been so important,in recent metaphors about technology.,And that's all very true.,The physicians of the ancient world --,especially the Egyptians,,who started medicine as we know it --,were very conscious,of what they could and couldn't treat.,And the translations of the surviving texts say,,"This I will not treat. This I cannot treat.",They were very conscious.,So were the followers of Hippocrates.,The Hippocratic manuscripts also --,repeatedly, according to recent studies --,show how important it is not to do harm.,More recently,,Harvey Cushing,,who really developed neurosurgery as we know it,,who changed it from a field of medicine,that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery,to one in which there was a hopeful outlook,,he was very conscious,that he was not always going to do the right thing.,But he did his best,,and he kept meticulous records,that let him transform that branch of medicine. 
 Now if we look forward a bit,to the 19th century,,we find a new style of technology.,What we find is,,no longer simple tools,,but systems.,We find more and more,complex arrangements of machines,that make it harder and harder,to diagnose what's going on.,And the first people who saw that,were the telegraphers of the mid-19th century,,who were the original hackers.,Thomas Edison would have been very, very comfortable,in the atmosphere of a software firm today.,And these hackers had a word,for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems,that they called bugs.,That was the origin of the word "bug.",This consciousness, though,,was a little slow to seep through the general population,,even people who were very, very well informed. 
 Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain,,was a big investor,in the most complex machine of all times --,at least until 1918 --,registered with the U.S. Patent Office.,That was the Paige typesetter.,The Paige typesetter,had 18,000 parts.,The patent had 64 pages of text,and 271 figures.,It was such a beautiful machine,because it did everything that a human being did,in setting type --,including returning the type to its place,,which was a very difficult thing.,And Mark Twain, who knew all about typesetting,,really was smitten by this machine.,Unfortunately, he was smitten in more ways than one,,because it made him bankrupt,,and he had to tour the world speaking,to recoup his money.,And this was an important thing,about 19th century technology,,that all these relationships among parts,could make the most brilliant idea fall apart,,even when judged by the most expert people. 
 Now there is something else, though, in the early 20th century,that made things even more complicated.,And that was that safety technology itself,could be a source of danger.,The lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries,,was that you must have enough lifeboats,for everyone on the ship.,And this was the result,of the tragic loss of lives,of people who could not get into them.,However, there was another case, the Eastland,,a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915,,and it killed 841 people --,that was 14 more,than the passenger toll of the Titanic.,The reason for it, in part, was,the extra life boats that were added,that made this already unstable ship,even more unstable.,And that again proves,that when you're talking about unintended consequences,,it's not that easy to know,the right lessons to draw.,It's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded,,the ballast and many other things. 
 So the 20th century, then,,saw how much more complex reality was,,but it also saw a positive side.,It saw that invention,could actually benefit from emergencies.,It could benefit,from tragedies.,And my favorite example of that --,which is not really widely known,as a technological miracle,,but it may be one of the greatest of all times,,was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War.,Penicillin was discovered in 1928,,but even by 1940,,no commercially and medically useful quantities of it,were being produced.,A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it.,They were working on it independently,,and they weren't getting anywhere.,And the Government Research Bureau,brought representatives together,and told them that this is something,that has to be done.,And not only did they do it,,but within two years,,they scaled up penicillin,from preparation in one-liter flasks,to 10,000-gallon vats.,That was how quickly penicillin was produced,and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time.,In the Second World War, too,,the existence,of solar radiation,was demonstrated by studies of interference,that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain.,So there were benefits in calamities --,benefits to pure science,,as well as to applied science,and medicine. 
 Now when we come to the period after the Second World War,,unintended consequences get even more interesting.,And my favorite example of that,occurred beginning in 1976,,when it was discovered,that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease,had always been present in natural waters,,but it was the precise temperature of the water,in heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems,that raised the right temperature,for the maximum reproduction,of Legionella bacillus.,Well, technology to the rescue.,So chemists got to work,,and they developed a bactericide,that became widely used in those systems. 
 But something else happened in the early 1980s,,and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic,of failures of tape drives,all over the United States.,And IBM, which made them,,just didn't know what to do.,They commissioned a group of their best scientists,to investigate,,and what they found was,that all these tape drives,were located near ventilation ducts.,What happened was the bactericide was formulated,with minute traces of tin.,And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads,and were crashing the tape heads.,So they reformulated the bactericide.,But what's interesting to me,is that this was the first case,of a mechanical device,suffering, at least indirectly, from a human disease.,So it shows that we're really all in this together. 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, it also shows something interesting,,that although our capabilities and technology,have been expanding geometrically,,unfortunately, our ability to model their long-term behavior,,which has also been increasing,,has been increasing only arithmetically.,So one of the characteristic problems of our time,is how to close this gap,between capabilities and foresight.,One other very positive consequence,of 20th century technology, though,,was the way in which other kinds of calamities,could lead to positive advances.,There are two historians of business,at the University of Maryland,,Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch,,who have done some extremely interesting work,,much of it still unpublished,,on the history of major innovations.,They have combined the list of major innovations,,and they've discovered that the greatest number, the greatest decade,,for fundamental innovations,,as reflected in all of the lists that others have made --,a number of lists that they have merged --,was the Great Depression. 
 And nobody knows just why this was so,,but one story can reflect something of it.,It was the origin of the Xerox copier,,which celebrated its 50th anniversary,last year.,And Chester Carlson, the inventor,,was a patent attorney.,He really was not intending,to work in patent research,,but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job.,So this was the best job he could get.,He was upset by the low quality and high cost,of existing patent reproductions,,and so he started to develop,a system of dry photocopying,,which he patented in the late 1930s --,and which became the first dry photocopier,that was commercially practical,in 1960.,So we see that sometimes,,as a result of these dislocations,,as a result of people,leaving their original intended career,and going into something else,where their creativity could make a difference,,that depressions,and all kinds of other unfortunate events,can have a paradoxically stimulating effect,on creativity. 
 What does this mean?,It means, I think,,that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities.,Think of the financial world, for example.,The mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham,,developed his system of value investing,as a result of his own losses,in the 1929 crash.,And he published that book,in the early 1930s,,and the book still exists in further editions,and is still a fundamental textbook.,So many important creative things can happen,when people learn from disasters. 
 Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now --,bed bugs, killer bees, spam --,and it's very possible that the solutions to those,will really extend well beyond the immediate question.,If we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur,,who in the 1860s,was asked to study,the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry,,and his discoveries were really the beginning,of the germ theory of disease.,So very often, some kind of disaster --,sometimes the consequence, for example,,of over-cultivation of silk worms,,which was a problem in Europe at the time --,can be the key to something much bigger. 
 So this means,that we need to take a different view,of unintended consequences.,We need to take a really positive view.,We need to see what they can do for us.,We need to learn,from those figures that I mentioned.,We need to learn, for example, from Dr. Cushing,,who killed patients,in the course of his early operations.,He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes.,And he learned meticulously from his mistakes.,And as a result,,when we say, "This isn't brain surgery,",that pays tribute to how difficult it was,for anyone to learn from their mistakes,in a field of medicine,that was considered so discouraging in its prospects.,And we can also remember,how the pharmaceutical companies,were willing to pool their knowledge,,to share their knowledge,,in the face of an emergency,,which they hadn't really been for years and years.,They might have been able to do it earlier. 
 The message, then, for me,,about unintended consequences,is chaos happens;,let's make better use of it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist,,so I put children to sleep for a living.,(Laughter),And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.,(Laughter),But what I actually mostly do,is I manage the pain management service,at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.,And it's from the experience,from about 20 or 25 years of doing that,that I want to bring to you the message this morning,,that pain is a disease. 
 Now most of the time,,you think of pain as a symptom of a disease,,and that's true most of the time.,It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection,or an inflammation or an operation.,But about 10 percent of the time,,after the patient has recovered from one of those events,,pain persists.,It persists for months,and oftentimes for years,,and when that happens,,it is its own disease.,And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens,and what we can do about it,,I want to show you how it feels for my patients.,So imagine, if you will,,that I'm stroking your arm with this feather,,as I'm stroking my arm right now.,Now, I want you to imagine,that I'm stroking it with this.,Please keep your seat.,(Laughter),A very different feeling.,Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?,Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.,Imagine what your life would be like,if I were to stroke it with this feather,,but your brain was telling you,that this is what you are feeling --,and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.,In fact, imagine something even worse.,Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather,,and their brain [was] telling them,that they were feeling this hot torch. 
 That was the experience of my patient, Chandler,,whom you see in the photograph.,As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.,She was 16 years old last year when I met her,,and she aspired to be a professional dancer.,And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,,she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.,Now you would probably imagine, as she did,,that a wrist sprain is a trivial event,in a person's life.,Wrap it in an ACE bandage,,take some ibuprofen for a week or two,,and that's the end of the story.,But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.,This is what her arm looked like,when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.,You can see that the arm is discolored,,purplish in color.,It was cadaverically cold to the touch.,The muscles were frozen, paralyzed --,dystonic is how we refer to that.,The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands,,to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow,,almost all the way to her shoulder. 
 But the worst part was,,not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.,The worst part was that she had allodynia,,the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated,with the feather and with the torch.,The lightest touch of her arm --,the touch of a hand,,the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on --,caused excruciating, burning pain. 
 How can the nervous system get this so wrong?,How can the nervous system,misinterpret an innocent sensation,like the touch of a hand,and turn it into the malevolent sensation,of the touch of the flame?,Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body,is hardwired like your house.,In your house, wires run in the wall,,from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling,and from the junction box to the light bulb.,And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.,And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.,So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.,If you hit your thumb with a hammer,,these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves --,transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord,where new wires, new nerves,,take the information up to the brain,where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. 
 But the situation, of course, in the human body,is far more complicated than that.,Instead of it being the case,that that junction box in the spinal cord,is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve,by releasing these little brown packets,of chemical information called neurotransmitters,in a linear one-on-one fashion,,in fact, what happens,is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions --,laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord --,and they start interacting,with other adjacent cells.,These cells, called glial cells,,were once thought to be,unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord,that did nothing more than hold all the important things together,,like the nerves.,But it turns out,the glial cells have a vital role,in the modulation, amplification,and, in the case of pain, the distortion,of sensory experiences.,These glial cells become activated.,Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,,which spill out,and interact with adjacent nerves,,and they start releasing their neurotransmitters,,and those neurotransmitters spill out,and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,,until what we have,is a positive feedback loop. 
 It's almost as if somebody came into your home,and rewired your walls,so that the next time you turned on the light switch,,the toilet flushed three doors down,,or your dishwasher went on,,or your computer monitor turned off.,That's crazy,,but that's, in fact, what happens,with chronic pain.,And that's why pain becomes its own disease.,The nervous system has plasticity.,It changes, and it morphs,in response to stimuli. 
 Well, what do we do about that?,What can we do in a case like Chandler's?,We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion,at this point in time.,We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs --,painkillers --,which are, frankly, not very effective,for this kind of pain.,We take nerves that are noisy and active,that should be quiet,,and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.,And most importantly, what we do,is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process,of physical therapy and occupational therapy,to retrain the nerves in the nervous system,to respond normally,to the activities and sensory experiences,that are part of everyday life.,And we support all of that,with an intensive psychotherapy program,to address the despondency, despair and depression,that always accompanies,severe, chronic pain. 
 It's successful,,as you can see from this video of Chandler,,who, two months after we first met her,,is now doings a back flip.,And I had lunch with her yesterday,because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here,,and she's doing absolutely fantastic. 
 But the future is actually even brighter.,The future holds the promise,that new drugs will be developed,that are not symptom-modifying drugs,that simply mask the problem,,as we have now,,but that will be disease-modifying drugs,that will actually go right to the root of the problem,and attack those glial cells,,or those pernicious proteins,that the glial cells elaborate,,that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,,or plasticity,,that so is capable,of distorting and amplifying,the sensory experience that we call pain.,So I have hope 
 that in the future,,the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized,,who said, "My philosophy:,No pain, no pain." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I want you now to imagine,a wearable robot,that gives you superhuman abilities,,or another one that takes wheelchair users,up standing and walking again.,We at Berkeley Bionics,call these robots exoskeletons.,These are nothing else,than something that you put on in the morning,,and it will give you extra strength,,and it will further enhance your speed,,and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.,It is actually the true integration,of the man and the machine.,But not only that --,it will integrate and network you,to the universe,and other devices out there. 
 This is just not some blue sky thinking.,To show you now what we are working on,by starting out talking about,the American soldier,,that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,,and they are being asked to carry more equipment.,Obviously, this is resulting,in some major complications --,back injuries, 30 percent of them --,chronic back injuries.,So we thought we would look at this challenge,and create an exoskeleton,that would help deal with this issue.,So let me now introduce to you HULC --,or the Human Universal,Load Carrier. 
 Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,,I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain,for many hours.,Its flexible design allows for deep squats,,crawls and high-agility movements.,It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,,and then augments my strength and endurance. 
 Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner,to introduce this device,,this new exoskeleton this year.,So this is for real.,Now let's turn our heads,towards the wheelchair users,,something that I'm particularly passionate about.,There are 68 million people,estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.,This is about one percent of the total population.,And that's actually a conservative estimate.,We are talking here about, oftentimes,,very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,,that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --,hit a wall,and the wheelchair's the only option.,But it is also the aging population,that is multiplying in numbers.,And the only option, pretty much --,when it's stroke or other complications --,is the wheelchair.,And that is actually for the last 500 years,,since its very successful introduction, I must say.,So we thought we would start,writing a brand new chapter,of mobility.,Let me now introduce you to eLEGS,that is worn by Amanda Boxtel,that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,,and as a result of that,she has not been able to walk,for 19 years until now. 
 (Applause) 
 Amanda Boxtel: Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.,It has sensors.,It's completely non-invasive,,sensors in the crutches,that send signals back to our onboard computer,that is sitting here at her back.,There are battery packs here as well,that power motors that are sitting at her hips,,as well as her knee joints,,that move her forward,in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. 
 AB: I was 24 years old,and at the top of my game,when a freak summersault while downhill skiing,paralyzed me.,In a split second,,I lost all sensation and movement,below my pelvis.,Not long afterwards,,a doctor strode into my hospital room,,and he said, "Amanda,,you'll never walk again.",And that was 19 yeas ago.,He robbed,every ounce of hope,from my being.,Adaptive technology,has since enabled me,to learn how to downhill ski again,,to rock climb and even handcycle.,But nothing has been invented,that enables me to walk,,until now. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 EB: As you can see,,we have the technology,,we have the platforms,to sit down and have discussions with you.,It's in our hands,,and we have all the potential here,to change the lives,of future generations --,not only for the soldiers,,or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,,but for everyone. 
 AB: Thanks. 
 (Applause)How would you like to be better than you are?,Suppose I said,that, with just a few changes in your genes,,you could get a better memory --,more precise,,more accurate and quicker.,Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,,with more stamina.,Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?,How about living longer with good health?,Or perhaps you're one of those,who's always yearned for more creativity.,Which one would you like the most?,Which would you like, if you could have just one?,(Audience Member: Creativity.),Creativity.,How many people would choose creativity?,Raise your hands. Let me see.,A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.,(Laughter) That's very good.,How many would opt for memory?,Quite a few more.,How about fitness?,A few less.,What about longevity?,Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.,If you could have any one of these,,it would be a very different world.,Is it just imaginary?,Or, is it, perhaps, possible? 
 Evolution has been a perennial topic,here at the TED Conference,,but I want to give you today,one doctor's take on the subject.,The great 20th-century geneticist,,T.G. Dobzhansky,,who was also a communicant,in the Russian Orthodox Church,,once wrote an essay that he titled,"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense,Except in the Light of Evolution.",Now if you are one of those,who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,,this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,,take out your personal communications device --,I give you permission --,and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,,because nothing in the rest of this talk,is going to make any sense whatsoever to you.,(Laughter),But if you do accept,biological evolution,,consider this:,is it just about the past,,or is it about the future?,Does it apply to others,,or does it apply to us? 
 This is another look at the tree of life.,In this picture,,I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,,because if you look at the edges,of the tree of life,,every existing species,at the tips of those branches,has succeeded in evolutionary terms:,it has survived;,it has demonstrated a fitness,to its environment.,The human part of this branch,,way out on one end,,is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.,We branch off of a common ancestor,to modern chimpanzees,about six or eight million years ago.,In the interval,,there have been perhaps 20 or 25,different species of hominids.,Some have come and gone.,We have been here for about 130,000 years.,It may seem like we're quite remote,from other parts of this tree of life,,but actually, for the most part,,the basic machinery of our cells,is pretty much the same. 
 Do you realize that we can take advantage,and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium,to produce the protein of human insulin,used to treat diabetics?,This is not like human insulin;,this is the same protein,that is chemically indistinguishable,from what comes out of your pancreas.,And speaking of bacteria,,do you realize that each of us carries in our gut,more bacteria,than there are cells in the rest of our body?,Maybe 10 times more.,I mean think of it,,when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,,do you think about the bacteria?,Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment,for those bacteria.,It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,,it's very cozy.,And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want,with no effort on their part.,It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,,with the occasional interruption,of the unintended forced rush to the exit.,But otherwise,,you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,,just as they are essential to your life.,They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,,and they protect you against certain diseases. 
 But what will come in the future?,Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise,as a species?,Or, are we destined,to become something different --,something, perhaps, even better adapted,to the environment?,Now let's take a step back in time,to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago --,the Earth, the solar system,,about four and a half billion years --,the first signs of proto-life,,maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth --,the first multi-celled organisms,,perhaps as much,as 800 or a billion years ago --,and then the human species,,finally emerging,in the last 130,000 years.,In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,,life on Earth is like a brief measure;,the animal kingdom,,like a single measure;,and human life,,a small grace note.,That was us.,That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,,so I hope you enjoyed it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now when I was a freshman in college,,I took my first biology class.,I was fascinated,by the elegance and beauty of biology.,I became enamored of the power of evolution,,and I realized something very fundamental:,in most of the existence of life,in single-celled organisms,,each cell simply divides,,and all of the genetic energy of that cell,is carried on in both daughter cells.,But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,,things start to change.,Sexual reproduction enters the picture.,And very importantly,,with the introduction of sexual reproduction,that passes on the genome,,the rest of the body,becomes expendable.,In fact, you could say,that the inevitability of the death of our bodies,enters in evolutionary time,at the same moment,as sexual reproduction. 
 Now I have to confess,,when I was a college undergraduate,,I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --,it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,,but with each passing year,,I've come to have increasing doubts.,I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,,who was performing still in Las Vegas,well into his 90s.,And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.,He answers the door.,Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.,She looks at him and says,,"I'm here for super sex.","That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup." 
 (Laughter) 
 I came to realize,,as a physician,,that I was working toward a goal,which was different from the goal of evolution --,not necessarily contradictory, just different.,I was trying to preserve the body.,I wanted to keep us healthy.,I wanted to restore health from disease.,I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.,Evolution is all about passing on the genome,to the next generation,,adapting and surviving,through generation after generation.,From an evolutionary point of view,,you and I are like the booster rockets,designed to send the genetic payload,into the next level of orbit,and then drop off into the sea.,I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed,when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.,I want to achieve it through not dying." 
 (Laughter) 
 Evolution does not necessarily,favor the longest-lived.,It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest,or the strongest or the fastest,,and not even the smartest.,Evolution favors,those creatures best adapted,to their environment.,That is the sole test,of survival and success.,At the bottom of the ocean,,bacteria that are thermophilic,and can survive at the steam vent heat,that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,,sous-vide cooked fish,,nevertheless, have managed,to make that a hospitable environment for them. 
 So what does this mean,,as we look back at what has happened in evolution,,and as we think about the place again,of humans in evolution,,and particularly as we look ahead,to the next phase,,I would say,that there are a number of possibilities.,The first is that we will not evolve.,We have reached,a kind of equipoise.,And the reasoning behind that would be,,first, we have, through medicine,,managed to preserve a lot of genes,that would otherwise be selected out,and be removed from the population.,And secondly, we as a species,have so configured our environment,that we have managed to make it adapt to us,as well as we adapt to it.,And by the way, we immigrate and circulate,and intermix so much,that you can't any longer,have the isolation that is necessary,for evolution to take place. 
 A second possibility,is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,,natural, imposed by the forces of nature.,And the argument here would be,that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,,but they are inexorable.,And as far as isolation goes,,when we as a species,do colonize distant planets,,there will be the isolation and the environmental changes,that could produce evolution,in the natural way. 
 But there's a third possibility,,an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.,I call it neo-evolution --,the new evolution,that is not simply natural,,but guided and chosen,by us as individuals,in the choices that we will make.,Now how could this come about?,How could it be possible that we would do this?,Consider, first, the reality,that people today, in some cultures,,are making choices about their offspring.,They're, in some cultures,,choosing to have more males than females.,It's not necessarily good for the society,,but it's what the individual and the family are choosing. 
 Think also,,if it were possible ever,for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,,but for you in your body,to make the genetic adjustments,that would cure or prevent diseases.,What if you could make the genetic changes,to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's,or reduce the risk of cancer,or eliminate stroke?,Wouldn't you want,to make those changes,in your genes?,If we look ahead,,these kind of changes,are going to be increasingly possible. 
 The Human Genome Project,started in 1990,,and it took 13 years.,It cost 2.7 billion dollars.,The year after it was finished in 2004,,you could do the same job,for 20 million dollars in three to four months.,Today, you can have a complete sequence,of the three billion base pairs in the human genome,at a cost of about 20,000 dollars,and in the space of about a week.,It won't be very long,before the reality will be,the 1,000-dollar human genome,,and it will be increasingly available for everyone.,Just a week ago,,the National Academy of Engineering,awarded its Draper Prize,to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,,two scientists who independently developed techniques,to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster,and to lead to desirable proteins,in a more efficient way --,what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution.",A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize,was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka,for his research,in which he took an adult skin cell,,a fibroblast,,and by manipulating just four genes,,he induced that cell,to revert to a pluripotential stem cell --,a cell potentially capable,of becoming any cell in your body. 
 These changes are coming.,The same technology,that has produced the human insulin in bacteria,can make viruses,that will not only protect you against themselves,,but induce immunity against other viruses.,Believe it or not,,there's an experimental trial going on,with vaccine against influenza,that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.,Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco? 
 These are all reality today,,and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.,Imagine then,just two other little changes.,You can change the cells in your body,,but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?,What if you could change the sperm and the ova,,or change the newly fertilized egg,,and give your offspring a better chance,at a healthier life --,eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,,reduce the risk of cancer?,Who doesn't want healthier children?,And then, that same analytic technology,,that same engine of science,that can produce,the changes to prevent disease,,will also enable us,to adopt super-attributes,,hyper-capacities --,that better memory.,Why not have the quick wit,of a Ken Jennings,,especially if you can augment it,with the next generation of the Watson machine?,Why not have the quick twitch muscle,that will enable you to run faster and longer?,Why not live longer?,These will be irresistible. 
 And when we are at a position,where we can pass it on to the next generation,,and we can adopt the attributes we want,,we will have converted,old-style evolution,into neo-evolution.,We'll take a process,that normally might require 100,000 years,,and we can compress it down to a thousand years --,and maybe even in the next 100 years.,These are choices,that your grandchildren,,or their grandchildren,,are going to have before them.,Will we use these choices,to make a society that is better,,that is more successful, that is kinder?,Or, will we selectively choose different attributes,that we want for some of us,and not for others of us?,Will we make a society,that is more boring and more uniform,,or more robust and more versatile?,These are the kinds of questions,that we will have to face. 
 And most profoundly of all,,will we ever be able to develop the wisdom,,and to inherit the wisdom,,that we'll need to make these choices wisely?,For better or worse,,and sooner than you may think,,these choices will be up to us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I just came back from a community,that holds the secret to human survival.,It's a place where women run the show,,have sex to say hello,,and play rules the day --,where fun is serious business.,And no, this isn't Burning Man,or San Francisco.,(Laughter),Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.,This is the world of wild bonobos,in the jungles of Congo.,Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,,your living closest relative.,That means we all share a common ancestor,,an evolutionary grandmother,,who lived around six million years ago.,Now, chimpanzees are well-known,for their aggression. 
 (Laughter) 
 But unfortunately,,we have made too much of an emphasis,of this aspect,in our narratives of human evolution.,But bonobos show us,the other side of the coin.,While chimpanzees,are dominated by big, scary guys,,bonobo society,is run by empowered females.,These guys have really worked something out,,since this leads to a highly tolerant society,where fatal violence,has not been observed yet.,But unfortunately,,bonobos are the least understood,of the great apes.,They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,,and it has been very difficult to study them. 
 The Congo is a paradox --,a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,,but also the heart of darkness itself --,the scene of a violent conflict,that has raged for decades,and claimed nearly as many lives,as the First World War.,Not surprisingly,,this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.,Bushmeat trades and forest loss,means we couldn't fill a small stadium,with all the bonobos that are left in the world --,and we're not even sure of that to be honest.,Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,,you can hear hidden laughter,swaying the trees. 
 Who are these cousins?,We know them as the "make love, not war" apes,since they have frequent, promiscuous,and bisexual sex,to manage conflict,and solve social issues.,Now, I'm not saying this is the solution,to all of humanity's problems --,since there's more to bonobo life,than the Kama Sutra.,Bonobos, like humans,,love to play throughout their entire lives.,Play is not just child's games.,For us and them,,play is foundational for bonding relationships,and fostering tolerance.,It's where we learn to trust,and where we learn about the rules of the game.,Play increases creativity,and resilience,,and it's all about the generation of diversity --,diversity of interactions,,diversity of behaviors,,diversity of connections.,And when you watch bonobo play,,you're seeing the very evolutionary roots,of human laughter, dance,and ritual.,Play is the glue,that binds us together. 
 Now, I don't know how you play,,but I want to show you a couple of unique clips,fresh from the wild.,First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --,and I do not mean football.,So here,,we have a young female and a male,engaged in a chase game.,Have a look what she's doing.,It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,,"she's got him by the balls.",(Laughter),Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?,Yeah.,(Laughter),So sex play is common,in both bonobos and humans.,And this video is really interesting,because it shows --,this video's really interesting,because it shows the inventiveness,of bringing unusual elements into play --,such as testicles --,and also how play both requires trust,and fosters trust --,while at the same time being tremendous fun. 
 But play's a shapeshifter.,(Laughter),Play's a shapeshifter,,and it can take many forms,,some of which are more quiet,,imaginative, curious --,maybe where wonder is discovered anew.,And I want you to see,,this is Fuku, a young female,,and she is quietly playing with water.,I think, like her,,we sometimes play alone,,and we explore the boundaries,of our inner and our outer worlds.,And it's that playful curiosity,that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,,and then the unexpected connections we form,are the real hotbed for creativity. 
 So these are just small tasters,into the insights that bonobo give us,to our past and present.,But they also hold a secret for our future,,a future where we need to adapt,to an increasingly challenging world,through greater creativity,and greater cooperation.,The secret is that play is the key,to these capacities.,In other words,,play is our adaptive wildcard.,In order to adapt successfully,to a changing world,,we need to play.,But will we make the most of our playfulness?,Play is not frivolous.,Play's essential.,For bonobos and humans alike,,life is not just red in tooth and claw.,In times when it seems least appropriate to play,,it might be the times when it is most urgent. 
 And so, my fellow primates,,let us embrace this gift from evolution,and play together,,as we rediscover creativity,,fellowship and wonder. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,,and the phone rang and I heard,,"Hey, JR,,you won the TED Prize 2011.,You have to make a wish to save the world.",I was lost.,I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.,The world is fucked up.,Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,,population is growing by millions,,there's no more fish in the sea,,the North Pole is melting,and as the last TED Prize winner said,,we're all becoming fat.,(Laughter),Except maybe French people.,Whatever.,So I called back,and I told her,,"Look, Amy,,tell the TED guys I just won't show up.,I can't do anything to save the world.",She said, "Hey, JR,,your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world.","Oh, all right.",(Laughter),"That's cool.",I mean, technology, politics, business,do change the world --,not always in a good way, but they do.,What about art?,Could art change the world? 
 I started when I was 15 years old.,And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.,I was doing graffiti --,writing my name everywhere,,using the city as a canvas.,I was going in the tunnels of Paris,,on the rooftops with my friends.,Each trip was an excursion,,was an adventure.,It was like leaving our mark on society,,to say, "I was here," on the top of a building. 
 So when I found a cheap camera on the subway,,I started documenting those adventures with my friends,and gave them back as photocopies --,really small photos just that size.,That's how, at 17 years old,,I started pasting them.,And I did my first "expo de rue,",which means sidewalk gallery.,And I framed it with color,so you would not confuse it with advertising.,I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.,I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery,and let them decide,if my work was nice enough to show it to people.,I would control it directly with the public,in the streets. 
 So that's Paris.,I would change --,depending on the places I would go --,the title of the exhibition.,That's on the Champs-Elysees.,I was quite proud of that one.,Because I was just 18,and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.,Then when the photo left,,the frame was still there. 
 (Laughter) 
 November 2005:,the streets are burning.,A large wave of riots,had broken into the first projects of Paris.,Everyone was glued to the TV,,watching disturbing, frightening images,taken from the edge of the neighborhood.,I mean, these kids, without control,,throwing Molotov cocktails,,attacking the cops and the firemen,,looting everything they could in the shops.,These were criminals, thugs, dangerous,,destroying their own environment. 
 And then I saw it -- could it be possible? --,my photo on a wall,revealed by a burning car --,a pasting I'd done a year earlier --,an illegal one -- still there.,I mean, these were the faces of my friends.,I know those guys.,All of them are not angels,,but they're not monsters either.,So it was kind of weird to see,those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television. 
 So I went back there,with a 28 mm lens.,It was the only one I had at that time.,But with that lens,,you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.,So you can do it only with their trust.,So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.,They were making scary faces,to play the caricature of themselves.,And then I pasted huge posters everywhere,in the bourgeois area of Paris,with the name, age, even building number,of these guys.,A year later,,the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.,And we go from thug images,,who've been stolen and distorted by the media,,who's now proudly taking over his own image.,That's where I realized,the power of paper and glue.,So could art change the world? 
 A year later,,I was listening to all the noise,about the Middle East conflict.,I mean, at that time, trust me,,they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.,So with my friend Marco,,we decided to go there,and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.,Are they so different?,When we got there, we just went in the street,,started talking with people everywhere,,and we realized that things were a bit different,from the rhetoric we heard in the media.,So we decided to take portraits,of Palestinians and Israelis,doing the same jobs --,taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.,Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.,Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell,about who you are and what you feel.,They all accepted,to be pasted next to the other.,I decided to paste,in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities,and on both sides of the wall.,We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.,We called the project Face 2 Face. 
 The experts said, "No way.,The people will not accept.,The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you.",We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can.",I love the way that people will ask me,,"How big will my photo be?","It will be as big as your house.",When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.,So we arrived with just our ladders,and we realized that they were not high enough.,And so Palestinians guys say,,"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution.",So he went to the Church of Nativity,and brought back an old ladder,that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.,(Laughter),We did Face 2 Face with only six friends,,two ladders, two brushes,,a rented car, a camera,and 20,000 square feet of paper.,We had all sorts of help,from all walks of life. 
 Okay, for example, that's Palestine.,We're in Ramallah right now.,We're pasting portraits --,so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.,People come around us and start asking,,"What are you doing here?","Oh, we're actually doing an art project,and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.,And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers.",And then there was always a silence.,"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --,doing a face -- right here?","Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project.",And I would always leave that moment,,and we would ask them,,"So can you tell me who is who?",And most of them couldn't say. 
 (Applause) 
 We even pasted on Israeli military towers,,and nothing happened.,When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.,People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --,some are a bit high for that, I agree --,but the people in the street,,they are the curator.,The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.,They are not meant to stay.,But exactly four years after,,the photos, most of them are still there.,Face 2 Face demonstrated,that what we thought impossible was possible --,and, you know what, even easy.,We didn't push the limit;,we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. 
 In the Middle East, I experienced my work,in places without [many] museums.,So the reactions in the street,were kind of interesting.,So I decided to go further in this direction,and go in places where there were zero museums.,When you go in these developing societies,,women are the pillars of their community,,but the men are still the ones holding the streets.,So we were inspired to create a project,where men will pay tribute to women,by posting their photos.,I called that project Women Are Heroes.,When I listened to all the stories,everywhere I went on the continents,,I couldn't always understand,the complicated circumstances of their conflict.,I just observed.,Sometimes there was no words,,no sentence, just tears.,I just took their pictures,and pasted them. 
 Women Are Heroes took me around the world.,Most of the places I went to,,I decided to go there,because I've heard about it through the media.,So for example, in June 2008,,I was watching TV in Paris,,and then I heard about this terrible thing,that happened in Rio de Janeiro --,the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.,Three kids -- that was three students --,were [detained] by the army,because they were not carrying their papers.,And the army took them,,and instead of bringing them to the police station,,they brought them to an enemy favela,where they get chopped into pieces.,I was shocked.,All Brazil was shocked.,I heard it was one of the most violent favelas,,because the largest drug cartel controls it.,So I decided to go there. 
 When I arrived --,I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.,There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --,no eyewitnesses.,So we just walked around,,and we met a woman,,and I showed her my book.,And she said, "You know what?,We're hungry for culture.,We need culture out there.",So I went out and I started with the kids.,I just took a few photos of the kids,,and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.,The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.,But that's okay.,I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. 
 Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square,and some women came.,They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.,There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --,they all wanted to shout the story.,After that day,,everyone in the favela gave me the green light.,I took more photos, and we started the project.,The drug lords were kind of worried,about us filming in the place,,so I told them, "You know what?,I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.,You see that enough in the media.,What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.,I've been seeing it around me the last few days.",So that's a really symbolic pasting,,because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.,And that's where the three kids got arrested,,and that's the grandmother of one of them.,And on that stairs,,that's where the traffickers always stand,and there's a lot of exchange of fire.,Everyone there understood the project.,And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill. 
 (Applause) 
 What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.,I mean, you should see that.,They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter,and then have a really long lens,,and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.,And they would put a number: "Please call this number,if you know what's going on in Providencia.",We just did a project and then left,so the media wouldn't know.,So how can we know about the project?,So they had to go and find the women,and get an explanation from them.,So you create a bridge between the media,and the anonymous women. 
 We kept traveling.,We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,,Liberia, Kenya.,In war-torn places like Monrovia,,people come straight to you.,I mean, they want to know what you're up to.,They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?,Are you an NGO? Are you the media?",Art. Just doing art.,Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?,Don't you have color in France?",(Laughter),Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?",Some who understood the project would explain it to others.,And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,,"You know, you've been here for a few hours,trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.,During that time, you haven't thought about,what you're going to eat tomorrow.,This is art.",I think it's people's curiosity,that motivates them,to come into the projects.,And then it becomes more.,It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.,On this bridge that's in Monrovia,,ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait,of a woman that might have been raped during the war.,Women are always the first ones targeted,during conflict. 
 This is Kibera, Kenya,,one of the largest slums of Africa.,You might have seen images about the post-election violence,that happened there in 2008.,This time we covered the roofs of the houses,,but we didn't use paper,,because paper doesn't prevent the rain,from leaking inside the house --,vinyl does.,Then art becomes useful.,So the people kept it.,You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,,there are so [many] houses inside.,And I went there a few months ago --,photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.,So I asked the people what happened.,"Oh, that guy just moved.",(Laughter),When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,,"Now God can see me.",When you look at Kibera now,,they look back. 
 Okay, India.,Before I start that, just so you know,,each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,,so we set up like commandos --,we're a group of friends who arrive there,,and we try to paste on the walls.,But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.,In India it was just impossible to paste.,I heard culturally and because of the law,,they would just arrest us at the first pasting.,So we decided to paste white,,white on the walls.,So imagine white guys pasting white papers.,So people would come to us and ask us,,"Hey, what are you up to?","Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?",Of course, they were confused.,But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,,and the more dust you would have,going up in the air,,on the white paper you can almost see,,but there is this sticky part,like when you reverse a sticker.,So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.,So we could just walk in the street during the next days,and the photos would get revealed by themselves.,(Applause),Thank you.,So we didn't get caught this time. 
 Each project -- that's a film,from Women Are Heroes.,(Music),Okay.,For each project we do,a film.,And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" --,its images, photography,,taken one after the other.,And the photos kept traveling even without us.,(Laughter),(Applause),Hopefully, you'll see the film,,and you'll understand the scope of the project,and what the people felt when they saw those photos.,Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.,Behind each image is a story. 
 Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic,in each of the communities,,and the women kept that dynamic after we left.,For example, we did books -- not for sale --,that all the community would get.,But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.,We did that in most of the places.,We go back regularly.,And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,,we have a cultural center running there.,In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.,Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project,said, "Hey, what about my roof?",So we decided to come the year after,and keep doing the project. 
 A really important point for me,is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.,So I have no responsibility,to anyone but myself,and the subjects.,(Applause),And that is for me,one of the more important things in the work.,I think, today,,as important as the result is the way you do things.,And that has always been a central part of the work.,And what's interesting is that fine line that I have,with images and advertising.,We just did some pasting in Los Angeles,on another project in the last weeks.,And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.,But yesterday the city called them and said,,"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.,Because this can be taken for advertising,,and because of the law,,it has to be taken down.",But tell me, advertising for what? 
 The people I photograph,were proud to participate in the project,and to have their photo in the community.,But they asked me for a promise basically.,They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you.",So I did. That's Paris.,That's Rio.,In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.,You understand the full scope of the project.,That's London.,New York.,And today, they are with you in Long Beach. 
 All right, recently I started a public art project,where I don't use my artwork anymore.,I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,,Giacomelli, other people's artwork.,It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.,The importance is what you do,with the images,,the statement it makes where it's pasted.,So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret,in Switzerland,a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.,(Applause),This image of three men wearing gas masks,was taken in Chernobyl originally,,and I pasted it in Southern Italy,,where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground. 
 In some ways, art can change the world.,Art is not supposed to change the world,,to change practical things,,but to change perceptions.,Art can change,the way we see the world.,Art can create an analogy.,Actually the fact that art cannot change things,makes it a neutral place,for exchanges and discussions,,and then enables you to change the world.,When I do my work,,I have two kinds of reactions.,People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.,They would be really useful.",Or, "How can we help?",I presume that you belong to the second category,,and that's good,,because for that project,,I'm going to ask you to take the photos,and paste them. 
 So now my wish is:,(mock drum roll),(Laughter),I wish for you to stand up,for what you care about,by participating in a global art project,,and together we'll turn the world inside out.,And this starts right now.,Yes, everyone in the room.,Everyone watching.,I wanted that wish,to actually start now.,So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story,or even your own photos --,tell me what you stand for.,Take the photos, the portraits,,upload it -- I'll give you all the details --,and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups,and reveal things to the world.,The full data is on the website --,insideoutproject.net --,that is launching today. 
 What we see changes who we are.,When we act together,,the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.,So I hope that, together, we'll create something,that the world will remember.,And this starts right now and depends on you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Music),["Oedipus Rex"],["The Lion King"],["Titus"],["Frida"],["The Magic Flute"],["Across The Universe"],(Applause),Julie Taymor: Thank you.nThank you very much.,That's a few samples of the theater, opera,and films that I have donenover the last 20 years.,But what I'd like to begin with right now,is to take you back to a moment,that I went through in Indonesia,,which is a seminal moment in my life,and, like all myths,,these stories need to be retold,and told, lest we forget them.,And when I'm in the turbulentntimes, as we know,,that I am right now, through the crucible,and the fire of transformation,,which is what all of you do, actually.,Anybody who creates knowsnthere's that point where,it hasn't quite becomenthe phoenix or the burnt char.,(Laughter),And I am right there on the edge,,which I'll tell you about, another story.,I want to go back to Indonesia,where I was about 21, 22nyears, a long time ago,,on a fellowship.,And I found myself, after two years there,and performing and learning,non the island of Bali,,on the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.,And I was in a village where there was,an initiation ceremony for the young men,,a rite of passage.,Little did I know that itnwas mine as well.,And as I sat in this temple square,under this gigantic beringin banyan tree,,in the dark, there was nonelectricity, just the full moon,,down in this empty square,,and I heard the most beautiful sounds,,like a Charles Ives concert,as I listened to the gamelan music,from all the different villagers that came,for this once-every-five-years ceremony.,And I thought I was alonenin the dark under this tree.,And all of a sudden, out of the dark,,from the other end of the square,,I saw the glint of mirrorsnlit by the moon.,And these 20 old men who I'd seen before,all of a sudden stood up in thesenfull warrior costumes,with the headdress and the spears,,and no one was in the square,nand I was hidden in the shadows.,No one was there, and they came out,,and they did this incredible dance.,"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha.",And they moved their bodiesnand they came forward,,and the lights bounced off these costumes.,And I've been in theaternsince I was 11 years old,,and performing, creating, and I went,,"Who are they performing for,with these elaborate costumes,,these extraordinary headdresses?",And I realized that they werenperforming for God,,whatever that means.,But somehow, it didn'tnmatter about the publicity.,There was no money involved.,It wasn't going to be written down.nIt was no news.,And there were these incredible artists,that felt for me like an eternitynas they performed.,The next moment,,as soon as they finishednand disappeared into the shadows,,a young man with a propanenlantern came on,,hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.,The village square was fillednwith hundreds of people.,And they put on an opera all night long.,Human beings needed the light.,They needed the light to see.,So what I gained and gatherednfrom this incredible,,seminal moment in my lifenas a young artist,was that you must be true,to what you believe as an artistnall the way through,,but you also have to be aware,that the audience is out therenin our lives at this time,,and they also need the light.,And it's this incredible balance,that I think that we walk,when we are creating somethingnthat is breaking ground,,that's trying to do somethingnyou've never seen before,,that imaginary world,where you actually don't knownwhere you're going to end up,,that's the fine linenon the edge of a crater,that I have walked my whole life.,What I would like to do now is to tell you,a little bit,about how I work.nLet's take "The Lion King.",You saw many examples of my work up there,,but it's one that people know.,I start with the notion of the ideograph.,An ideograph is like a brushnpainting, a Japanese brush painting.,Three strokes, you getnthe whole bamboo forest.,I go to the concept of "The Lion King",and I say, "What is the essence of it?,What is the abstraction?,If I were to reduce this entire story,into one image, what would it be?",The circle. The circle. It's so obvious.,The circle of life. Thencircle of Mufasa's mask.,The circle that, when we comento Act II and there's a drought,,how do you express drought?,It's a circle of silk on the floor,that disappears into the holenin the stage floor.,The circle of life comes in the wheels,of the gazelles that leap.,And you see the mechanics.,And being a theater person, what I knownand love about the theater,is that when the audience comes in,and they suspend their disbelief,,when you see men walking or women walking,with a platter of grass on their heads,,you know it's the savanna.,You don't question that.,I love the apparent truth of theater.,I love that people are willingnto fill in the blanks.,The audience is willing to say,,"Oh, I know that's not a real sun.,You took pieces of sticks.,You added silk to the bottom.,You suspended these pieces. Younlet it fall flat on the floor.,And as it rises with the strings,nI see that it's a sun.,But the beauty of itnis that it's just silk and sticks.,And in a way, that is what makesnit spiritual.,That's what moves you.,It's not the actual literalnsunrise that's coming.,It's the art of it.,So in the theater, as muchnas the story is critical,and the book and the language,,the telling of the story, how it's told,,the mechanics, the methods that you use,,is equal to the story itself.,And I'm one who lovesnhigh tech and low tech.,So I could go from --,For instance, I'll show younsome "Spider-Man" later,,these incredible machinesnthat move people along.,But the fact is, without the dancer,who knows how to use his bodynand swing on those wires,,it's nothing.,So now I'm going to show you,some clips from the other bignproject of my life this year,,"The Tempest.",It's a movie. I did "ThenTempest" on a stage three times,in the theater since 1984, '86,,and I love the play.,I did it always with a male Prospero.,And all of a sudden, I thought,,"Well, who am I gonnanget to play Prospero?,Why not Helen Mirren?nShe's a great actor. Why not?",And this material really did worknfor a woman equally as well.,So now, let's take a looknat some of the images,from "The Tempest.",(Music),(Video) Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performednto the point the tempest that I bade thee?,Ariel: I boarded the king's ship.nIn every cabin, I flamed amazement.,Prospera: At first sight,nthey have changed eyes.,Miranda: Do you love me?,Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.,HM: They are both in either's powers.,Trinculo: Misery acquaintsna man with strange bedfellows.,(Music),Looking for business, governor?,Caliban: Hast thou notndropped from heaven?,Stephano: Out of the moon,nI do assure thee.,Prospera: Caliban!,Caliban: This island is mine.,Prospera: For this, be sure,ntonight thou shalt have cramps.,Antonio: Here lies your brother nonbetter than the earth he lies upon.,Sebastian: Draw thy sword.,And I, the king, shall love thee.,Prospera: I will plaguenthem all, even to roaring.,Ariel: I have made you mad.,Prospera: We are such stuffnas dreams are made on.,and our little lifenis rounded with a sleep.,(Music),JT: Okay.,(Applause),So I went from theater,ndoing "The Tempest",on the stage in a verynlow-budget production,many years ago,,and I love the play, and I also think,it's Shakespeare's last play,,and it really lends itself,nas you can see, to cinema.,But I'm just going to givenyou a little example about,how one stages it in theater,and then how one takesnthat same idea or story,and moves it into cinema.,The ideograph that I talkednto you about before,,what is it for "The Tempest"?,What, if I were to boil it down,,would be the one image that I could,hang my hat on for this?,And it was the sand castle,,the idea of nurture versus nature,,that we build these civilizations --,she speaks about it at the end,nHelen Mirren's Prospera --,we build them, but under nature,nunder the grand tempest,,these cloud-capped towers, thesengorgeous palaces will fade,and there will -- leave not a rack behind.,So in the theater, I started the play,,it was a black sand rake, white cyc,,and there was a little girl,nMiranda, on the horizon,,building a drip castle, a sand castle.,And as she was therenon the edge of that stage,,two stagehands all in black,with watering cans ran along the top,and started to pour waternon the sand castle,,and the sand castlenstarted to drip and sink,,but before it did,,the audience sawnthe black-clad stagehands.,The medium was apparent. It was banal.nWe saw it.,But as they started to pour the water,,the light changed from showingnyou the black-clad stagehands,to focusing, this rough magicnthat we do in theater,,it focused right on the water itself.,And all of a sudden,nthe audience's perspective changes.,It becomes something magically large.,It becomes the rainstorm.,The masked actors,nthe puppeteers, they disappear,,and the audience makesnthat leap into this world,,into this imaginary world of "ThenTempest" actually happening.,Now the difference,when I went and did it in the cinema,,I started the actual movie,with a close-up of a sandncastle, a black sand castle,,and what cinema can do is,,by using camera, perspective,,and also long shots and close-ups,,it started on a close-upnof the sand castle,,and as it pulled away,,you saw that it was a miniaturensitting in the palm,of the girl's hands.,And so I could play with the medium,,and why I move from one medium to another,is to be able to do this.,Now I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man.",(Music),(Video) Peter Parker: ♪nStanding on the precipice,,I can soar away from this. ♪,JT: We're trying to doneverything in live theater,that you can't do in two dimensions,in film and television.,PP: ♪ Rise above yourselfnand take control. ♪,George Tsypin: We're looking at NewnYork from a Spider-Man point of view.,Spider Man is not bound by gravity.,Manhattan in the show is notnbound by gravity either.,PP: ♪ Be yourself and rise above it all. ♪,Ensemble: ♪ Sock! Pow! ♪,♪ Slam! Scratch! ♪,Danny Ezralow: I don't want younto even think there's a choreographer.,It's real, what's happening.,I prefer you to see people moving,,and you're going, "Whoa, what was that?",(Music),JT: If I give enough movementnin the sculpture,,and the actor moves their head,nyou feel like it's alive.,It's really comic book live.nIt's a comic book coming alive.,(Music),Bono: They're mythologies.,They're modern myths,nthese comic book heroes.,PP: ♪ They believe. ♪,(Screams),(Music),(Applause),JT: Ohhhh. What was that?,Circus, rock 'n' roll, drama.,What the hell are we doingnup there on that stage?,Well, one last story, very quickly.,After I was in that village,nI crossed the lake,,and I saw that the volcano was erupting,on the other side, Gunung Batur,,and there was a dead volcanonnext to the live volcano.,I didn't think I'd benswallowed by the volcano,,and I am here.,But it's very easy to climb up, is it not?,You hold on to the roots,,you put your foot in the little rocks,and climb up there,nand you get to the top,,and I was with a goodnfriend who was an actor,,and we said, "Let's go up there.,Let's see if we can come close to the edge,of that live volcano.",And we climbed up and we gotnto the very top,,and we're on the edge, on this precipice,,Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke,at the volcano at the other end,,and I'm up there alone,on this incredible precipice.,Did you hear the lyrics?,I'm on the precipice looking down,into a dead volcano to my left.,To my right is sheer shale.nIt's coming off.,I'm in thongs and sarongs.nIt was many years ago.,And no hiking boots.,And he's disappeared, thisnmad French gypsy actor,,off in the smoke, and I realize,,I can't go back the way that I've come.nI can't.,So I throw away my camera.nI throw away my thongs,,and I looked at the linenstraight in front of me,,and I got down on all fours like a cat,,and I held with my knees to either side,of this line in front of me,,for 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.,The wind was massively blowing,,and the only way I couldnget to the other side,was to look at the linenstraight in front of me.,I know you've all been there.,I'm in the crucible right now.,It's my trial by fire.,It's my company's trials by fire.,We survive because our themensong is "Rise Above.",Boy falls from the sky, rise above.,It's right there in the palmnof both of our hands,,of all of my company's hands.,I have beautiful collaborators,nand we as creators,only get there all together.,I know you understand that.,And you just stay going forward,,and then you see this extraordinary thing,in front of your eyes.,Thank you.,(Applause)My name is Kate Hartman.,And I like to make devices,that play with the ways,that we relate and communicate.,So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans,,relate to ourselves, each other,and the world around us.,(Laughter),So just to give you a bit of context,,as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.,I teach courses in physical computing,and wearable electronics.,And much of what I do is either wearable,or somehow related to the human form. 
 And so anytime I talk about what I do,,I like to just quickly address,the reason why bodies matter.,And it's pretty simple.,Everybody's got one -- all of you.,I can guarantee, everyone in this room,,all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats,,the people up top with the laptops --,we all have bodies.,Don't be ashamed.,It's something that we have in common,and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.,And so when working as an interaction designer,,or as an artist who deals with participation --,creating things that live on, in or around the human form --,it's really a powerful space to work within. 
 So within my own work,,I use a broad range of materials and tools.,So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers,to funnels and plastic tubing.,And to tell you a bit about the things that I make,,the easiest place to start the story,is with a hat.,And so it all started several years ago,,late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home,,and I was thinking.,And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.,And so I was thinking about how it might be great,if I could just take all these noises --,like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head --,if I could just physically extricate them,and pull them out in such a form,that I could share them with somebody else.,And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.,And I called it the Muttering Hat,,because it emitted these muttering noises,that were kind of tethered to you,,but you could detach them,and share them with somebody else. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I make other hats as well.,This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.,(Laughter),It's fairly self-explanatory.,It physically carves out conversation space for one.,And when you speak out loud,,the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.,(Laughter),And so when I make these things,,it's really not so much about the object itself,,but rather the negative space around the object.,So what happens when a person puts this thing on?,What kind of an experience do they have?,And how are they transformed by wearing it? 
 So many of these devices,really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.,So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.,And it is a tool,that actually enables one,to listen to their own innards.,(Laughter),And so some of these things,are actually more geared toward expression and communication.,And so the Inflatable Heart,is an external organ,that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.,So they can actually inflate it and deflate it,according to their emotions.,So they can express everything from admiration and lust,to anxiety and angst.,(Laughter),And some of these are actually meant,to mediate experiences.,So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.,(Laughter),And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange,,but is serves to absorb,the specificity of the words that are delivered.,(Laughter),And in the end,,some of these things just act as invitations.,So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there,so someone can grab your ear,and say what they have to say. 
 So even though I'm really interested in the relationship,between people,,I also consider the ways,in which we relate to the world around us.,And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back,,I was thinking a lot about,the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me,and how I would like to better relate to them.,And I thought, "Well, hey!,Maybe if I want to better relate to walls,,maybe I need to be more wall-like myself.",So I made a wearable wall,that I could wear as a backpack.,And so I would put it on,and sort of physically transform myself,so that I could either contribute to or critique,the spaces that surrounded me. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so jumping off of that,,thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world,,I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls --,which actually enables houseplants,to tap into human communication protocols.,So when a plant is thirsty,,it can actually make a phone call,or post a message to a service like Twitter.,And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic,,because a single house plant,can actually express its needs,to thousands of people at the same time. 
 And so kind of thinking about scale,,my most recent obsession,is actually with glaciers -- of course.,And so glaciers are these magnificent beings,,and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them,,but what I'm particularly interested in,is in human-glacier relations.,(Laughter),Because there seems to be an issue.,The glaciers are actually leaving us.,They're both shrinking and retreating --,and some of them have disappeared altogether. 
 And so I actually live in Canada now,,so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.,And this one's particularly interesting,,because, of all the glaciers in North America,,it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.,They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine,and drop people off on the surface of the glacier. 
 And this has really gotten me thinking,about this experience of the initial encounter.,When I meet a glacier for the very first time,,what do I do?,There's no kind of social protocol for this.,I really just don't even know,how to say hello.,Do I carve a message in the snow?,Or perhaps I can assemble one,out of dot and dash ice cubes --,ice cube Morse code.,Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool,,like an icy megaphone,that I can use to amplify my voice,when I direct it at the ice.,But really the most satisfying experience I've had,is the act of listening,,which is what we need in any good relationship. 
 And I was really struck by how much it affected me.,This very basic shift in my physical orientation,helped me shift my perspective,in relation to the glacier.,And so since we use devices,to figure out how to relate to the world these days,,I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.,(Laughter),And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material,that serves to mediate the difference in temperature,between the human body and the glacial ice.,And once again, it's this invitation,that asks people to lay down on the glacier,and give it a hug. 
 So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.,These are initial musings for this project.,And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like,,with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.,And so my intent,is to actually just take the next 10 years,and go on a series of collaborative projects,where I work with people from different disciplines --,artists, technologists, scientists --,to kind of work on this project,of how we can improve human-glacier relations. 
 So beyond that, in closing,,I'd just like to say that we're in this era,of communications and device proliferation,,and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy,,but I think what's really important,is thinking about how we can simultaneously,maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality,about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)It's great being here at TED.,You know, I think there might be some presentations,that will go over my head,,but the most amazing concepts,are the ones that go right under my feet.,The little things in life,,sometimes that we forget about,,like pollination, that we take for granted.,And you can't tell the story about pollinators --,bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies --,without telling the story about the invention of flowers,and how they co-evolved,over 50 million years. 
 I've been filming time-lapse flowers,24 hours a day, seven days a week,,for over 35 years.,To watch them move,is a dance I'm never going to get tired of.,It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.,Beauty and seduction, I believe,,is nature's tool for survival,,because we will protect what we fall in love with.,Their relationship,is a love story that feeds the Earth.,It reminds us that we are a part of nature,,and we're not separate from it. 
 When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder,,it motivated me to take action.,We depend on pollinators,for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.,And many scientists believe,it's the most serious issue facing mankind.,It's like the canary in the coalmine.,If they disappear, so do we.,It reminds us that we are a part of nature,and we need to take care of it. 
 What motivated me to film their behavior,was something that I asked my scientific advisers:,"What motivates the pollinators?",Well, their answer was,,"It's all about risk and reward.",Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?",And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive.",I go, "Why?","Well, in order to reproduce.","Well, why?",And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex.",And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert,,he replied, "Nothing lasts forever.,Everything in the universe wears out." 
 And that blew my mind.,Because I realized,that nature had invented reproduction,as a mechanism for life to move forward,,as a life force that passes right through us,and makes us a link in the evolution of life.,Rarely seen by the naked eye,,this intersection,between the animal world and the plant world,is truly a magic moment.,It's the mystical moment,where life regenerates itself,,over and over again. 
 So here is some nectar from my film.,I hope you'll drink, tweet,and plant some seeds,to pollinate a friendly garden.,And always take time to smell the flowers,,and let it fill you with beauty,,and rediscover that sense of wonder.,Here are some images from the film. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Back in New York, I am the head of development,for a non-profit called Robin Hood.,When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires,as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.,Now in our town,,where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,,you have to get to the fire scene pretty early,to get in on any action. 
 I remember my first fire.,I was the second volunteer on the scene,,so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.,But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers,to get to the captain in charge,to find out what our assignments would be.,When I found the captain,,he was having a very engaging conversation,with the homeowner,,who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.,Here it was, the middle of the night,,she was standing outside in the pouring rain,,under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,,while her house was in flames. 
 The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --,let's call him Lex Luther --,(Laughter),got to the captain first,and was asked to go inside,and save the homeowner's dog.,The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.,Here was some lawyer or money manager,who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people,that he went into a burning building,to save a living creature,,just because he beat me by five seconds.,Well, I was next.,The captain waved me over.,He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.,I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,,and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes.",(Laughter),I swear.,So, not exactly what I was hoping for,,but off I went --,up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,,who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,,into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. 
 Now I know what you're thinking,,but I'm no hero.,(Laughter),I carried my payload back downstairs,where I met my nemesis,and the precious dog by the front door.,We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,,where, not surprisingly,,his received much more attention than did mine.,A few weeks later,,the department received a letter from the homeowner,thanking us for the valiant effort displayed,in saving her home.,The act of kindness she noted above all others:,someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. 
 (Laughter) 
 In both my vocation at Robin Hood,and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,,I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness,on a monumental scale,,but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage,on an individual basis.,And you know what I've learned?,They all matter.,So as I look around this room,at people who either have achieved,,or are on their way to achieving,,remarkable levels of success,,I would offer this reminder:,don't wait.,Don't wait until you make your first million,to make a difference in somebody's life.,If you have something to give,,give it now.,Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park.,Be a mentor. 
 Not every day is going to offer us a chance,to save somebody's life,,but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.,So get in the game. Save the shoes. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back. 
 (Applause) 
 Mark Bezos: Thank you.(Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Imagining a solo cello concert,,one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach,unaccompanied cello suites.,As a child,studying these eternal masterpieces,,Bach's music would intermingle,with the singing voices of Muslim prayers,from the neighboring Arab village,of the northern Kibbutz in Israel,where I grew up.,Late at night, after hours of practicing,,I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday,as the sounds of tango music,would be creeping from my parents' stereo.,It all became music to me.,I didn't hear the boundaries. 
 I still start every day,practicing playing Bach.,His music never ceases,to sound fresh and surprising to me.,But as I was moving away,from the traditional classical repertoire,and trying to find new ways,of musical expression,,I realized that with today's technological resources,,there's no reason to limit,what can be produced at one time,from a single string instrument. 
 The power and coherency,that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices,makes a very different experience.,The excitement of a great orchestra performance,comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians,producing one unified whole concept.,The excitement from using multi-tracking,,the way I did in the piece you will hear next,,comes from the attempt,to build and create a whole universe,with many diverse layers,,all generated from a single source.,My cello and my voice are layered,to create this large sonic canvas. 
 When composers write music for me,,I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.,I hope to arrive at new territories,to discover sounds I have never heard before.,I want to create endless possibilities,with this cello.,I become the medium through which the music is being channeled,,and in the process, when all is right,,the music is transformed,and so am I. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)So for the past year and a half,,my team at Push Pop Press,and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media,have been working on creating,the first feature-length interactive book.,It's called "Our Choice",and the author is Al Gore.,It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,",and it explores all the solutions,that will solve the climate crisis. 
 The book starts like this. This is the cover.,As the globe spins,,we can see our location,,and we can open the book,and swipe through the chapters,to browse the book.,Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.,And if we wanted to zoom into a page,,we can just open it up.,And anything you see in the book,,you can pick up with two fingers,and lift off the page,and open up.,And if you want to go back,and read the book again,,you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.,And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open. 
 (Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself,among the majority,who look at windmills and feel,they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. 
 Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,,Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.,This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.,Zoom into it and see where it was taken.,And throughout the book,,there's over an hour of documentary footage,and interactive animations.,So you can open this one. 
 (Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... 
 MM: It starts playing immediately.,And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page,,and the movie keeps playing.,Or we can zoom out to the table of contents,,and the video keeps playing.,But one of the coolest things in this book,are the interactive infographics.,This one shows the wind potential,all around the United States.,But instead of just showing us the information,,we can take our finger and explore,,and see, state by state,,exactly how much wind potential there is.,We can do the same for geothermal energy,and solar power. 
 This is one of my favorites.,So this shows ...,(Laughter),(Applause),When the wind is blowing,,any excess energy coming from the windmill,is diverted into the battery.,And as the wind starts dying down,,any excess energy will be diverted back into the house --,the lights never go out.,And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.,It also runs on the iPhone.,And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room,and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.,And it works the exact same way.,You can pinch into any page.,Open it up. 
 So that's Push Pop Press' first title,,Al Gore's "Our Choice.",Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.,Do you want to be a publisher,,a technology licenser?,What is the business here?,Is this something that other people can do? 
 MM: Yeah, we're building a tool,that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.,So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast --,and we're on the West coast, building the software --,takes our tool,and, every day, drags in images and text. 
 CA: So you want to license this software to publishers,to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.),All right. Mike, thanks so much. 
 MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.) 
 (Applause)I have spent the past few years,putting myself into situations,that are usually very difficult,and at the same time somewhat dangerous.,I went to prison --,difficult.,I worked in a coal mine --,dangerous.,I filmed in war zones --,difficult and dangerous.,And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this --,fun in the beginning,,little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.,In fact, most of my career,,I've been immersing myself,into seemingly horrible situations,for the whole goal of trying,to examine societal issues,in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,,that hopefully break them down in a way,that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.,So when I knew I was coming here,to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,,I knew I would want to do something a little different. 
 So as some of you may or may not have heard,,a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.,I sent out some Facebook messages,,some Twitter messages,,and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights,to my 2011 TED Talk.,(Laughter),That's right, some lucky individual, corporation,,for-profit or non-profit,,was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity --,because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again --,(Laughter),to buy the naming rights,to the talk you're watching right now,,that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content,and didn't really give much hint,as to what the subject matter would actually be.,So what you were getting was this:,Your name here presents:,My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is,and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,,especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.,But that being said,,it's a very good media opportunity.,(Laughter),You know how many people watch these TED Talks?,It's a lot.,That's just a working title, by the way.,(Laughter),So even with that caveat,,I knew that someone would buy the naming rights. 
 Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago,,I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.,But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,,we examine the world of marketing, advertising.,And as I said earlier,,I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,,but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,,for anything as difficult,or as dangerous,as going into the rooms with these guys.,(Laughter),You see, I had this idea for a movie. 
 (Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film,all about product placement, marketing and advertising,,where the entire film is funded,by product placement, marketing and advertising.,So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.",So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,",is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,,is branded from beginning to end --,from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,,which is brand X.,Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,,the Staples Center ...,these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever.,And so the film explores this whole idea -- (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.),It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?,I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.),That was more for emphasis.,It was, "In perpetuity. Forever.",But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,,but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.,So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...,the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,",the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." 
 Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is,,beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,,but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.) 
 MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.,The goal of this whole film is transparency.,You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.,So that's the whole concept,,the whole film, start to finish.,And I would love for CEG to help make it happen. 
 Robert Friedman: You know it's funny,,because when I first hear it,,it is the ultimate respect,for an audience. 
 Guy: I don't know how receptive,people are going to be to it, though. 
 XK: Do you have a perspective --,I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation --,but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.) 
 David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this? 
 MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.) 
 John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,,but I think it's certainly worth pursuing,a couple big, really obvious brands. 
 XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,,we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. 
 MS: What do you think the response is going to be? 
 Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no." 
 MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film,or a tough sell because of me? 
 JK: Both. 
 MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.,So, sir, can you help me? I need help. 
 MK: I can help you. 
 MS: Okay. (MK: Good.),Awesome. 
 MK: We've gotta figure out which brands. 
 MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.),When you look at the people you deal with .. 
 MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.),Turn the camera off. 
 MS: I thought "Turn the camera off",meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation.",Turns out it really means,,"We want nothing to do with your movie." 
 MS: And just like that, one by one,,all of these companies suddenly disappeared.,None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.,I was amazed.,They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.,And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,,was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,,to get as many people to see it as possible.,Especially in today's world,,this intersection of new media and old media,and the fractured media landscape,,isn't the idea to get,that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle,that's going to get that message to the masses?,No, that's what I thought. 
 But the problem was, you see,,my idea had one fatal flaw,,and that flaw was this.,Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.,That wouldn't have been a problem at all.,This would have been fine.,But what this image represents was the problem.,See, when you do a Google image search for transparency,,this is ---,(Laughter),(Applause),This is one of the first images that comes up.,So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.,(Laughter),This is was the problem: transparency --,free from pretense or deceit;,easily detected or seen through;,readily understood;,characterized by visibility or accessibility of information,,especially concerning business practices --,that last line being probably the biggest problem.,You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.,Our politicians say it, our president says it,,even our CEO's say it.,But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,,something suddenly changes.,But why? Well, transparency is scary --,(Roar),like that odd, still-screaming bear.,(Laughter),It's unpredictable --,(Music),(Laughter),like this odd country road.,And it's also very risky.,(Laughter),What else is risky?,Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.,(Laughter),That's very risky. 
 Now when I started talking to companies,and telling them that we wanted to tell this story,,and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.,We want you to tell a story,,but we just want to tell our story.",See, when I was a kid,and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie --,and there he is giving me the look he often gave me --,he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.,There's your story,,there's my story,and there's the real story.",Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.,But with only one company, one agency willing to help me --,and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years --,I realized that I would have to go on my own,,I'd have to cut out the middleman,and go to the companies myself with all of my team.,So what you suddenly started to realize --,or what I started to realize --,is that when you started having conversations with these companies,,the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. 
 (Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,,and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.,And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies,say the reason their films are so successful,is because of the brand partners that they have.,And then my friends who make small independent films,say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete,with these big, giant Hollywood movies?",And the movie is called,"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.",So how specifically will we see Ban in the film?,Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,,you will see Ban deodorant.,While anytime I do an interview with someone,,I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?,Are you ready? You look a little nervous.,I want to help you calm down.,So maybe you should put some one before the interview.",So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.,Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,",they'll have their chance.,We will have them geared for both male or female --,solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.,That's the two-cent tour.,So now I can answer any of your questions,and give you the five-cent tour. 
 Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand.,Much like you talked about being a smaller movie,,we're very much a challenger brand.,So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.,So doing things like this -- you know,,remind people about Ban --,is kind of why were interested in it. 
 MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?,Ban is blank. 
 KF: That's a great question. 
 (Laughter) 
 Woman: Superior technology. 
 MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something,somebody's putting in their armpit. 
 Man: We talk about bold, fresh.,I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,,versus "fights odor and wetness.",It keeps you fresh.,How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness,,more freshness, three times fresher.,Things like that that are more of that positive benefit. 
 MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.,What about me? What about a regular guy?,I need to go talk to the man on the street,,the people who are like me, the regular Joes.,They need to tell me about my brand. 
 (Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand? 
 Man: Um, my brand?,I don't know.,I like really nice clothes. 
 Woman: 80's revival,meets skater-punk,,unless it's laundry day. 
 MS: All right, what is brand Gerry? 
 Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.) 
 Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am,would be like dark glamor.,I like a lot of black colors,,a lot of grays and stuff like that.,But usually I have an accessory,,like sunglasses,,or I like crystal and things like that too. 
 Woman: If Dan were a brand,,he might be a classic convertible,Mercedes Benz. 
 Man 2: The brand that I am,is, I would call it casual fly. 
 Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,,part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know. 
 Man 3: I'm the pet guy.,I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.,So I guess that's my brand.,In my warped little industry, that's my brand. 
 Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods. 
 Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand.,Is that something? 
 Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand. 
 Tom: I'm Tom. 
 MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself,at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly. 
 (Laughter) 
 And what I realized is I needed an expert.,I needed somebody who could get inside my head,,somebody who could really help me understand,what they call your "brand personality.",And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.,They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark,discover that brand personality.,If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me. 
 (Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right? 
 MS: I did. The very first picture,is a picture of my family. 
 A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are. 
 MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. 
 A: Tell me about this world. 
 MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in --,like people who are around you, your friends, your family,,the way you live your life, the job you do.,All those things stemmed and started from one place,,and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia. 
 A: What's the next one you want to talk about? 
 MS: The next one: This was the best day ever. 
 A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are? 
 MS: It's like, who do I want to be?,I like things that are different.,I like things that are weird. I like weird things. 
 A: Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us?,What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?,Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?,Tell me a little bit about that part.,... A little more about you that is not who you are.,What are some other metamorphoses that you've had?,... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on? 
 MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you. 
 A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.) 
 A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right. 
 MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.,There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there. 
 Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea,that you had two distinct, but complementary,sides to your brand personality --,the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.,Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.,And I think there's almost a paradox with those.,And I think some companies,will just focus on one of their strengths or the other,instead of focusing on both.,Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature --,to avoid things that they're not sure of,,avoid fear, those elements,,and you really embrace those,,and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.,What other brands are like that?,The first on here is the classic, Apple.,And you can see here too, Target, Wii,,Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.,Now there's playful brands and mindful brands,,those things that have come and gone,,but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing. 
 MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?,If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,,what would you be?,Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?,Or are you more of a down attribute?,Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?,Up attributes are things like being playful,,being fresh like the Fresh Prince,,contemporary, adventurous,,edgy or daring like Errol Flynn,,nimble or agile, profane, domineering,,magical or mystical like Gandalf.,Or are you more of a down attribute?,Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?,Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,,empathetic like the Oprah?,Are you reliable, stable, familiar,,safe, secure, sacred,,contemplative or wise,like the Dalai Lama or Yoda? 
 Over the course of this film,,we had 500-plus companies,who were up and down companies,saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.,They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,,they would have no control over the final product.,But we did get 17 brand partners,who were willing to relinquish that control,,who wanted to be in business,with someone as mindful and as playful as myself,and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories,that normally we wouldn't be able to tell --,stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind. 
 They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,,as we got into telling the story in this film,about how now they're using MRI's,to target the desire centers of your brain,for both commercials as well as movie marketing.,We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.,In the entire city for the past five years,,there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.,(Applause),And we went to school districts,where now companies are making their way,into cash-strapped schools all across America.,What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,,or I've had the most success in,,are ones where I've interacted with things directly. 
 And that's what these brands did.,They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies,and said, "Maybe these agencies,don't have my best interest in mind.,I'm going to deal directly with the artist.,I'm going to work with him to create something different,,something that's going to get people thinking,,that's going to challenge the way we look at the world." 
 And how has that been for them? Has it been successful?,Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.,According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,,and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing --,we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.,That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.,That's only online -- no print, no TV.,The film hasn't even been distributed yet.,It's not even online. It's not even streaming.,It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.,So ultimately,,this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.,And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to,advised their clients not to take part. 
 What I always believe,is that if you take chances, if you take risks,,that in those risks will come opportunity.,I believe that when you push people away from that,,you're pushing them more towards failure.,I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,,then you're preparing your whole company,to be reward challenged.,I feel like that what has to happen moving forward,is we need to encourage people to take risks.,We need to encourage people to not be afraid,of opportunities that may scare them.,Ultimately, moving forward,,I think we have to embrace fear.,We've got to put that bear in a cage.,(Laughter),Embrace fear. Embrace risk.,One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk. 
 And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.,Today, more than ever,,a little honesty is going to go a long way.,And that being said, through honesty and transparency,,my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,",has been brought to you,by my good friends at EMC,,who for $7,100,bought the naming rights on eBay.,(Applause),EMC: Turning big data,into big opportunity,for organizations all over the world.,EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency." 
 Thank you very much, guys. 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: So, Morgan,,in the name of transparency,,what exactly happened to that $7,100?,MS: That is a fantastic question.,I have in my pocket a check,made out to the parent organization to the TED organization,,the Sapling Foundation --,a check for $7,100,to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)Good morning everybody. 
 I work with really amazing,,little, itty-bitty creatures called cells.,And let me tell you what it's like,to grow these cells in the lab.,I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.,We plate them into dishes,that we sometimes call petri dishes.,And we feed them -- sterilely of course --,with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food --,and we grow them in incubators. 
 Why do I do this?,We observe the cells in a plate,,and they're just on the surface.,But what we're really trying to do in my lab,is to engineer tissues out of them.,What does that even mean?,Well it means growing an actual heart,,let's say,,or grow a piece of bone,that can be put into the body.,Not only that, but they can also be used for disease models.,And for this purpose, traditional cell culture techniques,just really aren't enough.,The cells are kind of homesick;,the dish doesn't feel like their home.,And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment,to get them to thrive.,We call this the biomimetic paradigm --,copying nature in the lab. 
 Let's take the example of the heart,,the topic of a lot of my research.,What makes the heart unique?,Well, the heart beats,,rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully.,We copy this in the lab,by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes.,These electrodes act like mini pacemakers,to get the cells to contract in the lab.,What else do we know about the heart?,Well, heart cells are pretty greedy.,Nature feeds the heart cells in your body,with a very, very dense blood supply.,In the lab, we micro-pattern channels,in the biomaterials,on which we grow the cells,,and this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells' food,,through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells --,a lot like what you might expect,from a capillary bed in the heart. 
 So this brings me to lesson number one:,life can do a lot with very little.,Let's take the example of electrical stimulation.,Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.,On the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue,that I engineered from rat cells in the lab.,It's about the size of a mini marshmallow.,And after one week, it's beating.,You can see it in the upper left-hand corner.,But don't worry if you can't see it so well.,It's amazing that these cells beat at all.,But what's really amazing,is that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them,,like with a pacemaker,,that they beat so much more. 
 But that brings me to lesson number two:,cells do all the work.,In a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here,,because structural engineers,build bridges and big things,,computer engineers, computers,,but what we are doing,is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves.,What does this mean for us?,Let's do something really simple.,Let's remind ourselves,that cells are not an abstract concept.,Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives,in a very real way.,"We are what we eat," could easily be described,as, "We are what our cells eat.",And in the case of the flora in our gut,,these cells may not even be human.,But it's also worth noting,that cells also mediate our experience of life.,Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell,is a corresponding set of cells,that receive this information,and interpret it for us.,It begs the question:,shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship,to include the ecosystem of our own bodies? 
 I invite you to talk about this with me further,,and in the meantime, I wish you luck.,May none of your non-cancer cells,become endangered species. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My journey to become a polar specialist,,photographing, specializingnin the polar regions,,began when I was four years old,,when my family moved from southern Canada,to Northern Baffin Island,nup by Greenland.,There we lived with the Inuit,in the tiny Inuit communitynof 200 Inuit people,,where [we] were onenof three non-Inuit families.,And in this community,nwe didn't have a television;,we didn't have computers,nobviously, radio.,We didn't even have a telephone.,All of my time was spent outside,with the Inuit, playing.,The snow and the ice were my sandbox,,and the Inuit were my teachers.,And that's where I became,truly obsessed with this polar realm.,And I knew someday thatnI was going to do something,that had to do with tryingnto share news about it,and protect it. 
 I'd like to share with you,nfor just two minutes only,,some images, a cross-section of my work,,to the beautiful musicnby Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever.",I don't know why National Geographicnhas done this, they've never done this before,,but they're allowing mento show you a few images,from a coverage that I've just completednthat is not published yet.,National Geographic doesn't do this,,so I'm very excited to be ablento share this with you. 
 And what these images are --,you'll see them at the start of the slide show --nthere's only about four images --,but it's of a little bearnthat lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.,It's pure white,nbut it's not a polar bear.,It's a spirit bear,nor a Kermode bear.,There are only 200 of these bears left.,They're more rare than the panda bear. 
 I sat there on the rivernfor two months without seeing one.,I thought, my career's over.,I proposed this stupid storynto National Geographic.,What in the heck was I thinking?,So I had two months to sit there,and figure out different waysnof what I was going to do in my next life,,after I was a photographer,nbecause they were going to fire me.,Because National Geographic is a magazine;nthey remind us all the time:,they publish pictures, not excuses. 
 (Laughter) 
 And after two months of sitting there --,one day, thinking that it was all over,,this incredible big white male came down,,right beside me, three feet away from me,,and he went down and grabbed a fishnand went off in the forest and ate it.,And then I spent the entire daynliving my childhood dream,of walking around with this bearnthrough the forest.,He went through this old-growth forest,and sat up beside this 400-year-oldnculturally modified tree and went to sleep.,And I actually got to sleepnwithin three feet of him,,just in the forest, and photograph him. 
 So I'm very excited to be ablento show you those images,and a cross-section of my worknthat I've done on the polar regions.,Please enjoy.

 Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much.nThe show's not over.,My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.,Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
 We're inundated with news all the time,that the sea ice is disappearing,and it's at its lowest level.,And in fact, scientistsnwere originally saying,sea ice is going to disappearnin the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.,Now they're sayingnthe sea ice in the Arctic,,the summertime extent is going to be gonenin the next four to 10 years.,And what does that mean?,After a while of reading this in the news,nit just becomes news.,You glaze over with it.,And what I'm trying to donwith my work is put faces to this.,And I want people to understandnand get the concept,that, if we lose ice,,we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.,Projections are that we couldnlose polar bears, they could become extinct,in the next 50 to 100 years. 
 And there's no better, sexier,,more beautiful,ncharismatic megafauna species,for me to hang my campaign on.,Polar bears are amazing hunters.,This was a bear I sat withnfor a while on the shores.,There was no ice around.,But this glacier caved into the waternand a seal got on it.,And this bear swam out to that seal --,800 lb. bearded seal --,grabbed it, swam back and ate it.,And he was so full,nhe was so happy and so fat eating this seal,,that, as I approached him --,about 20 feet away --nto get this picture,,his only defense was to keep eating more seal.,And as he ate, he was so full --,he probably had aboutn200 lbs of meat in his belly --,and as he ate insidenone side of his mouth,,he was regurgitatingnout the other side of his mouth. 
 So as long as these bearsnhave any bit of ice they will survive,,but it's the ice that's disappearing.,We're finding more and morendead bears in the Arctic.,When I worked on polar bearsnas a biologist 20 years ago,,we never found dead bears.,And in the last four or five years,,we're finding dead bearsnpopping up all over the place.,We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,,floating in the open oceannwhere the ice has melted out.,I found a couple in Norway last year.nWe're seeing them on the ice.,These bears are already showing signs,of the stress of disappearing ice. 
 Here's a mother and her two year-old cub,were traveling on a ship a hundred milesnoffshore in the middle of nowhere,,and they're ridingnon this big piece of glacier ice,,which is great for them;nthey're safe at this point.,They're not going to die of hypothermia.,They're going to get to land.,But unfortunately,n95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic,are also receding right now,to the point that the icenis ending up on land,and not injecting any icenback into the ecosystem. 
 These ringed seals,nthese are the "fatsicles" of the Arctic.,These little, fat dumplings,,150-pound bundles of blubber,are the mainstay of the polar bear.,And they're not likenthe harbor seals that you have here.,These ringed seals alsonlive out their entire life cycle,associated and connected to sea ice.,They give birth inside the ice,,and they feed on the Arctic codnthat live under the ice.,And here's a picture of sick ice.,This is a piece of multi-year icenthat's 12 years old.,And what scientists didn't predictnis that, as this ice melts,,these big pocketsnof black water are forming,and they're grabbing the sun's energy,and accelerating the melting process. 
 And here we are divingnin the Beaufort Sea.,The visibility's 600 ft.;nwe're on our safety lines;,the ice is moving all over the place.,I wish I could spend halfnan hour telling you,about how we almost died on this dive.,But what's important in this picturenis that you have a piece of multi-year ice,,that big chunk of ice up in the corner.,In that one single piece of ice,,you have 300 species of microorganisms.,And in the spring,nwhen the sun returns to the ice,,it forms the phytoplankton,ngrows under that ice,,and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,,and then you get thenzooplankton feeding on all that life.,So really what the ice does,is it acts like a garden.,It acts like the soil in a garden.nIt's an inverted garden.,Losing that ice is likenlosing the soil in a garden. 
 Here's me in my office.,I hope you appreciate yours.,This is after an hour under the ice.,I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen;,I can't feel my hands;nI can't feel my feet.,And I've come up, and all I wantednto do was get out of the water.,After an hour in these conditions,,it's so extreme that, when I go down,,almost every dive I vomit into my regulator,because my body can't dealnwith the stress of the cold on my head.,And so I'm just so happynthat the dive is over.,I get to hand my camera to my assistant,,and I'm looking up at him,nand I'm going, "Woo. Woo. Woo.",Which means, "Take my camera.",And he thinks I'm saying,n"Take my picture.",So we had this littlencommunication breakdown.,(Laughter),But it's worth it. 
 I'm going to show you picturesnof beluga whales, bowhead whales,,and narwhals, and polar bears,nand leopard seals today,,but this picture right here means morento me than any other I've ever made.,I dropped down in this ice hole,njust through that hole that you just saw,,and I looked up undernthe underside of the ice,,and I was dizzy;nI thought I had vertigo.,I got very nervous --nno rope, no safety line,,the whole world is moving around me --,and I thought, "I'm in trouble.",But what happenednis that the entire underside,was full of these billionsnof amphipods and copepods,moving around and feedingnon the underside of the ice,,giving birth and living outntheir entire life cycle.,This is the foundation of the whole food chainnin the Arctic, right here.,And when you have low nproductivity in this, in ice,,the productivity in copepods go down. 
 This is a bowhead whale.,Supposedly, science is stating,that it could be the oldest living animalnon earth right now.,This very whale right herencould be over 250 years old.,This whale could have been born,around the startnof the Industrial Revolution.,It could have survivedn150 years of whaling.,And now its biggest threatnis the disappearance of ice in the North,because of the livesnthat we're leading in the South. 
 Narwhals, these majestic narwhals,with their eight-foot long ivory tusks,ndon't have to be here;,they could be out on the open water.,But they're forcing themselvesnto come up in these tiny little ice holes,where they can breathe, catch a breath,,because right under that icenare all the swarms of cod.,And the cod are there,because they are feedingnon all the copepods and amphipods. 
 Alright, my favorite part.,When I'm on my deathbed,,I'm going to remembernone story more than any other.,Even though that spirit bearnmoment was powerful,,I don't think I'll ever havenanother experience,like I did with these leopard seals.,Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton,nhave had a bad reputation.,They've got that wryly smilenon their mouth.,They've got those black sinister eyes,and those spots on their body.,They look positively prehistoricnand a bit scary.,And tragically in [2003],,a scientist was taken downnand drowned,,and she was being consumednby a leopard seal.,And people were like, "We knewnthey were vicious. We knew they were.",And so people love to form their opinions.,And that's when I got a story idea:,I want to go to Antarctica,,get in the water with as manynleopard seals as I possibly can,and give them a fair shake --,find out if they really are these viciousnanimals, or if they're misunderstood.,So this is that story.,Oh, and they also happennto eat Happy Feet. 
 (Laughter) 
 As a species, as humans,nwe like to say penguins are really cute,,therefore, leopard seals eat them,nso leopard seals are ugly and bad.,It doesn't work that way.,The penguin doesn't know it's cute,,and the leopard seal doesn'tnknow it's kind of big and monstrous.,This is just the food chain unfolding.,They're also big.,They're not these little harbor seals.,They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.,And they're also curiously aggressive.,You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,,floating in these icy waters,,and a leopard seal comes upnand bites the pontoon.,The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship,and get to go home and tellnthe stories of how they got attacked.,All the leopard seal was doing --,it's just biting a balloon.,It just sees this big balloon in the ocean --nit doesn't have hands --,it's going to take a little bite,nthe boat pops, and off they go. 
 (Laughter) 
 So after five days of crossingnthe Drake Passage --,isn't that beautiful --,after five days of crossingnthe Drake Passage,,we have finally arrived at Antarctica.,I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.,His name is Goran Ehlmenfrom Sweden -- Goran.,And he has a lot of experiencenwith leopard seals. I have never seen one.,So we come around the covenin our little Zodiac boat,,and there's this monstrous leopard seal.,And even in his voice, he goes,n"That's a bloody big seal, ya.",(Laughter),And this seal is takingnthis penguin by the head,,and it's flipping it back and forth.,And what it's trying to donis turn that penguin inside-out,,so it can eat the meat off the bones,,and then it goes off and gets another one. 
 And so this leopard sealngrabbed another penguin,,came under the boat, the Zodiac,,starting hitting the hull of the boat.,And we're trying to not fall in the water.,And we sit down,nand that's when Goran said to me,,"This is a good seal, ya.,It's time for you to get in the water.",(Laughter),And I looked at Goran,nand I said to him, "Forget that.",But I think I probably used a different wordnstarting with the letter "F.",But he was right.,He scolded me out,nand said, "This is why we're here.,And you purposed this stupid storynto National Geographic.,And now you've got to deliver.,And you can't publish excuses." 
 So I had such dry mouth --,probably not as bad as now --,but I had such, such dry mouth.,And my legs were just trembling.nI couldn't feel my legs.,I put my flippers on.nI could barely part my lips.,I put my snorkel in my mouth,,and I rolled over the sidenof the Zodiac into the water.,And this was the first thing she did.,She came racing up to me,nengulfed my whole camera --,and her teeth are up herenand down here --,but Goran, before I had gotten in the water,nhad given me amazing advice.,He said, "If you get scared,nyou close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away." 
 (Laughter) 
 So that's all I had to worknwith at that point.,But I just started to shoot these pictures.,So she did this threat displaynfor a few minutes,,and then the most amazing thing happened --nshe totally relaxed.,She went off, she got a penguin.,She stopped about 10 feet away from me,,and she sat there with this penguin,nthe penguin's flapping, and she let's it go.,The penguin swims toward me, takes off.,She grabs another one.nShe does this over and over.,And it dawned on menthat she's trying to feed me a penguin.,Why else would she releasenthese penguins at me?,And after she did this four or five times,,she swam by menwith this dejected look on her face.,You don't want to be too anthropomorphic,nbut I swear that she looked at me,like, "This useless predator'sngoing to starve in my ocean." 
 (Laughter) 
 So realizing I couldn't catchnswimming penguins,,she'd get these other penguinsnand bring them slowly towards me,,bobbing like this,nand she'd let them go.,This didn't work.,I was laughing so hard and so emotional,that my mask was flooding,nbecause I was crying underwater,,just because it was so amazing.,And so that didn't work.,So then she'd get another penguinnand try this ballet-like sexy display,sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter),And she would sort of bring themnover to me and offer it to me.,This went on for four days.,This just didn't happen a couple of times.,And then so she realizednI couldn't catch live ones,,so she brought me dead penguins.,(Laughter),Now I've got four or five penguinsnfloating around my head,,and I'm just sitting there shooting away.,And she would often stopnand have this dejected look on her face,like, "Are you for real?",Because she can't believenI can't eat this penguin.,Because in her world,nyou're either breeding or you're eating --,and I'm not breeding, so ... 
 (Laughter) 
 And then that wasn't enough;nshe started to flip penguins onto my head.,She was trying to force-feed me.nShe's pushing me around.,She's trying to force-feed my camera,,which is every photographer's dream.,And she would get frustrated;nshe'd blow bubbles in my face.,She would, I think, let me knownthat I was going to starve.,But yet she didn't stop.,She would not stopntrying to feed me penguins. 
 And on the last day with this female,where I thought I had pushed her too far,,I got nervous because she came up to me,,she rolled over on her back,,and she did this deep, gutturalnjackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.,And I thought, she's about to bite.,She's about to let me knownshe's too frustrated with me.,What had happenednwas another seal had snuck in behind me,,and she did that to threat display.,She chased that big seal away,nwent and got its penguin,and brought it to me. 
 (Laughter) 
 That wasn't the only sealnI got in the water with.,I got in the waternwith 30 other leopard seals,,and I never once had a scary encounter.,They are the most remarkable animalsnI've ever worked with,,and the same with polar bears.,And just like the polar bears,,these animals dependnon an icy environment.,I get emotional. Sorry. 
 It's a story that lives deep in my heart,,and I'm proud to share this with you.,And I'm so passionate about it.,Anybody want to come with mento Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go.,We've got to get the story out now.nThank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thanks very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.,Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.,Civilization as we know it,has ceased to exist --,no books,,no electronic devices,,no Facebook or Twitter.,All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet,has been lost.,Now imagine archeologists,digging through the rubble of one of our cities.,What might they find?,Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic,with strange symbols on them.,Perhaps some circular pieces of metal.,Maybe some cylindrical containers,with some symbols on them.,And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity,when she discovers --,buried in the hills somewhere in North America --,massive versions of these same symbols.,Now let's ask ourselves,,what could such artifacts say about us,to people 4,000 years into the future? 
 This is no hypothetical question.,In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with,when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,,which existed 4,000 years ago.,The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous,with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,,but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.,It occupied the area,of approximately one million square kilometers,,covering what is now Pakistan,,Northwestern India,and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.,Given that it was such a vast civilization,,you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,,and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.,In fact,,what archeologists have found is none of that.,They've found small objects such as these. 
 Here's an example of one of these objects.,Well obviously this is a replica.,But who is this person?,A king? A god?,A priest?,Or perhaps an ordinary person,like you or me?,We don't know.,But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.,Well no, not pieces of plastic,,but stone seals, copper tablets,,pottery and, surprisingly,,one large sign board,,which was found buried near the gate of a city.,Now we don't know if it says Hollywood,,or even Bollywood for that matter.,In fact, we don't even know,what any of these objects say,,and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered.,We don't know what any of these symbols mean. 
 The symbols are most commonly found on seals.,So you see up there one such object.,It's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.,Now that's a magnificent piece of art.,So how big do you think that is?,Perhaps that big?,Or maybe that big?,Well let me show you.,Here's a replica of one such seal.,It's only about one inch by one inch in size --,pretty tiny.,So what were these used for?,We know that these were used for stamping clay tags,that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.,So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?,These were used to make those kinds of packing slips.,You might wonder what these objects contain,in terms of their text.,Perhaps they're the name of the sender,or some information about the goods,that are being sent from one place to the other -- we don't know.,We need to decipher the script to answer that question. 
 Deciphering the script,is not just an intellectual puzzle;,it's actually become a question,that's become deeply intertwined,with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.,In fact, the script has become a battleground of sorts,between three different groups of people.,First, there's a group of people,who are very passionate in their belief,that the Indus script,does not represent a language at all.,These people believe that the symbols,are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs,or the emblems you find on shields.,There's a second group of people,who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.,If you look at a map of India today,,you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India,belong to the Indo-European language family.,So some people believe that the Indus script,represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit. 
 There's a last group of people,who believe that the Indus people,were the ancestors of people living in South India today.,These people believe that the Indus script,represents an ancient form,of the Dravidian language family,,which is the language family spoken in much of South India today.,And the proponents of this theory,point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,,actually near Afghanistan,,and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,,Dravidian languages were spoken all over India,and that this suggests,that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian. 
 Which of these hypotheses can be true?,We don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,,you would be able to answer this question.,But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.,First, there's no Rosetta Stone.,I don't mean the software;,I mean an ancient artifact,that contains in the same text,both a known text and an unknown text.,We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script.,And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.,And to make matters even worse,,most of the text that we have are extremely short.,So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals,that are very, very tiny. 
 And so given these formidable obstacles,,one might wonder and worry,whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.,In the rest of my talk,,I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying,and love the challenge posed by the Indus script.,I've always been fascinated by the Indus script,ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.,And why was I fascinated?,Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.,My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,,so in my day job,,I create computer models of the brain,to try to understand how the brain makes predictions,,how the brain makes decisions,,how the brain learns and so on. 
 But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.,That's when I was in India,,and I had the wonderful opportunity,to meet with some Indian scientists,who were using computer models to try to analyze the script.,And so it was then that I realized,there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,,and so I jumped at that opportunity.,And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found.,Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher.,Are you ready? 
 The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script,is try to figure out the direction of writing.,Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them.,Can you tell me,if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?,I'll give you a couple of seconds.,Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay.,Okay. Left to right?,Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.,The answer is:,if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,,you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs,,and it seems like 4,000 years ago,,when the scribe was writing from right to left,,they ran out of space.,And so they had to cram the sign.,One of the signs is also below the text on the top.,This suggests the direction of writing,was probably from right to left,,and so that's one of the first things we know,,that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.,And the Indus script now has,this particular property. 
 What other properties of language does the script show?,Languages contain patterns.,If I give you the letter Q,and ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?,Most of you said U, which is right.,Now if I asked you to predict one more letter,,what do you think that would be?,Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A,,but certainly not B, C or D, right?,The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.,There's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.,And this in turn tends to be followed,by this quotation marks-like symbol.,And this is very similar to a Q and U example.,This symbol can in turn be followed,by these fish-like symbols and some other signs,,but never by these other signs at the bottom.,And furthermore, there's some signs,that really prefer the end of texts,,such as this jar-shaped sign,,and this sign, in fact, happens to be,the most frequently occurring sign in the script. 
 Given such patterns, here was our idea.,The idea was to use a computer,to learn these patterns,,and so we gave the computer the existing texts.,And the computer learned a statistical model,of which symbols tend to occur together,and which symbols tend to follow each other.,Given the computer model,,we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.,So we could deliberately erase some symbols,,and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.,Here are some examples.,You may regard this,as perhaps the most ancient game,of Wheel of Fortune. 
 What we found,was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases,in predicting the correct symbol.,In the rest of the cases,,typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.,There's also practical use,for this particular procedure.,There's a lot of these texts that are damaged.,Here's an example of one such text.,And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text,and make a best guess prediction.,Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted.,And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script,by generating more data that we can analyze. 
 Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.,So imagine a monkey,sitting at a keyboard.,I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.,Such a random jumble of letters,is said to have a very high entropy.,This is a physics and information theory term.,But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters.,How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?,You might have encountered the stuck-key problem --,so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.,This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy,because there's no variation at all.,Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;,it's neither too rigid,,nor is it too random.,What about the Indus script?,Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.,At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,,which is a random jumble of letters --,and interestingly, we also find,the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.,And both of these are very, very flexible,,which is why you find them in the very high range.,At the lower end of the scale,,you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's,,and you also find a computer program,,in this case in the language Fortran,,which obeys really strict rules.,Linguistic scripts,occupy the middle range. 
 Now what about the Indus script?,We found that the Indus script,actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.,When this result was first published,,it was highly controversial.,There were people who raised a hue and cry,,and these people were the ones who believed,that the Indus script does not represent language.,I even started to get some hate mail.,My students said,that I should really seriously consider getting some protection.,Who'd have thought,that deciphering could be a dangerous profession?,What does this result really show?,It shows that the Indus script,shares an important property of language.,So, as the old saying goes,,if it looks like a linguistic script,and it acts like a linguistic script,,then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.,What other evidence is there,that the script could actually encode language? 
 Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.,So for example, here's the same sentence written in English,and the same sentence written in Dutch,using the same letters of the alphabet.,If you don't know Dutch and you only know English,and I give you some words in Dutch,,you'll tell me that these words contain,some very unusual patterns.,Some things are not right,,and you'll say these words are probably not English words.,The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.,The computer found several texts --,two of them are shown here --,that have very unusual patterns.,So for example the first text:,there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.,This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign,in the Indus script,,and it's only in this text,that it occurs as a doubling pair. 
 Why is that the case?,We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,,and it turns out that they were found,very, very far away from the Indus Valley.,They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.,And why were they found there?,What I haven't told you is that,the Indus people were very, very enterprising.,They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,,and so in this case, they were traveling by sea,all the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.,And what seems to have happened here,is that the Indus traders, the merchants,,were using this script to write a foreign language.,It's just like our English and Dutch example.,And that would explain why we have these strange patterns,that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text,that are found within the Indus Valley.,This suggests that the same script, the Indus script,,could be used to write different languages.,The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion,that the Indus script probably does represent language. 
 If it does represent language,,then how do we read the symbols?,That's our next big challenge.,So you'll notice that many of the symbols,look like pictures of humans, of insects,,of fishes, of birds.,Most ancient scripts,use the rebus principle,,which is, using pictures to represent words.,So as an example, here's a word.,Can you write it using pictures?,I'll give you a couple seconds.,Got it?,Okay. Great.,Here's my solution.,You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf --,and that's "belief," right.,There could be other solutions.,In the case of the Indus script,,the problem is the reverse.,You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures,such that the entire sequence makes sense.,So this is just like a crossword puzzle,,except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles,because the stakes are so high if you solve it. 
 My colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,,have been making some headway on this particular problem.,And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work.,Here's a really short text.,It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.,And I want to mention that these seals were used,for stamping clay tags,that were attached to bundles of goods,,so it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,,contain names of merchants.,And it turns out that in India,there's a long tradition,of names being based on horoscopes,and star constellations present at the time of birth.,In Dravidian languages,,the word for fish is "meen",which happens to sound just like the word for star.,And so seven stars,would stand for "elu meen,",which is the Dravidian word,for the Big Dipper star constellation.,Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars,,and that translates to "aru meen,",which is the old Dravidian name,for the star constellation Pleiades.,And finally, there's other combinations,,such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.,And that could be translated into "mey meen,",which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.,So that was pretty exciting.,It looks like we're getting somewhere. 
 But does this prove,that these seals contain Dravidian names,based on planets and star constellations?,Well not yet.,So we have no way of validating,these particular readings,,but if more and more of these readings start making sense,,and if longer and longer sequences,appear to be correct,,then we know that we are on the right track.,Today,,we can write a word such as TED,in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,,because both of these were deciphered,in the 19th century.,The decipherment of these two scripts,enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.,The Mayans,started speaking to us in the 20th century,,but the Indus civilization remains silent. 
 Why should we care?,The Indus civilization does not belong,to just the South Indians or the North Indians,or the Pakistanis;,it belongs to all of us.,These are our ancestors --,yours and mine.,They were silenced,by an unfortunate accident of history.,If we decipher the script,,we would enable them to speak to us again.,What would they tell us?,What would we find out about them? About us?,I can't wait to find out. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)When I was a child, I alwaysnwanted to be a superhero.,I wanted to save the worldnand make everyone happy.,But I knew that I'd need superpowersnto make my dreams come true.,So I used to embarknon these imaginary journeys,to find intergalactic objectsnfrom planet Krypton,,which was a lot of fun,nbut didn't yield much result.,When I grew up and realized,that science fiction was notna good source for superpowers,,I decided instead to embarknon a journey of real science,,to find a more useful truth. 
 I started my journey in California,,with a UC Berkeleyn30-year longitudinal study,that examined the photosnof students in an old yearbook,,and tried to measure their successnand well-being throughout their life.,By measuring the students' smiles,,researchers were able to predict,how fulfilling and long-lastingna subject's marriage would be, 
 (Laughter) 
 how well she would scorenon standardized tests of well-being,,and how inspiring she would be to others.,In another yearbook, I stumblednupon Barry Obama's picture.,When I first saw his picture,,I thought that his superpowersncame from his super collar. 
 (Laughter) 
 But now I know it was all in his smile. 
 Another aha! moment came from a 2010nWayne State University research project,that looked into pre-1950snbaseball cards of Major League players.,The researchers foundnthat the span of a player's smile,could actually predictnthe span of his life.,Players who didn't smile in their pictures,lived an average of only 72.9 years,,where players with beaming smiles,lived an average of almost 80 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 The good news is thatnwe're actually born smiling.,Using 3D ultrasound technology,,we can now see that developingnbabies appear to smile,,even in the womb.,When they're born,nbabies continue to smile --,initially, mostly in their sleep.,And even blind babies smile,to the sound of the human voice.,Smiling is one of the most basic,nbiologically uniform,expressions of all humans. 
 In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea,,Paul Ekman, the world's most renownednresearcher on facial expressions,,found that even members of the Fore tribe,,who were completely disconnectednfrom Western culture,,and also known for theirnunusual cannibalism rituals, 
 (Laughter) 
 attributed smilesnto descriptions of situations,the same way you and I would.,So from Papua New Guinea,to Hollywood,all the way to modern art in Beijing,,we smile often,,and use smiles to expressnjoy and satisfaction. 
 How many people here in this roomnsmile more than 20 times per day?,Raise your hand if you do.,Oh, wow.,Outside of this room,,more than a third of us smilenmore than 20 times per day,,whereas less than 14 percent of usnsmile less than five.,In fact, those with the most amazingnsuperpowers are actually children,,who smile as many as 400 times per day. 
 Have you ever wonderednwhy being around children,,who smile so frequently,nmakes you smile very often?,A recent studynat Uppsala University in Sweden,found that it's very difficult to frownnwhen looking at someone who smiles.,You ask why?,Because smilingnis evolutionarily contagious,,and it suppresses the controlnwe usually have on our facial muscles.,Mimicking a smilenand experiencing it physically,helps us understand whethernour smile is fake or real,,so we can understandnthe emotional state of the smiler. 
 In a recent mimicking study,at the Universitynof Clermont-Ferrand in France,,subjects were asked to determinenwhether a smile was real or fake,while holding a pencil in their mouthnto repress smiling muscles.,Without the pencil,nsubjects were excellent judges,,but with the pencil in their mouth --,when they could not mimicnthe smile they saw --,their judgment was impaired. 
 (Laughter) 
 In addition to theorizing on evolutionnin "The Origin of Species,",Charles Darwin also wrotenthe facial feedback response theory.,His theory states that the act of smilingnitself actually makes us feel better,,rather than smiling beingnmerely a result of feeling good.,In his study, Darwin actually citedna French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,,who sent electric jolts to facial musclesnto induce and stimulate smiles.,Please, don't try this at home. 
 (Laughter) 
 In a related German study,,researchers used fMRI imagingnto measure brain activity,before and after injecting Botoxnto suppress smiling muscles.,The finding supported Darwin's theory,,by showing that facial feedback,modifies the neural processingnof emotional content in the brain,,in a way that helps usnfeel better when we smile.,Smiling stimulatesnour brain reward mechanism,in a way that even chocolate --,a well-regarded pleasure inducer --,cannot match. 
 British researchers found that one smile,can generate the same levelnof brain stimulation,as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate. 
 (Laughter) 
 Wait --,The same study foundnthat smiling is as stimulating,as receiving up to 16,000npounds sterling in cash. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's like 25 grand a smile.,It's not bad.,And think about it this way:,25,000 times 400 --,quite a few kids out there feelnlike Mark Zuckerberg every day. 
 (Laughter) 
 And unlike lots of chocolate,,lots of smiling can actuallynmake you healthier.,Smiling can help reduce the levelnof stress-enhancing hormones,like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,,increase the level of mood-enhancingnhormones like endorphins,,and reduce overall blood pressure. 
 And if that's not enough,,smiling can actually make younlook good in the eyes of others.,A recent study at Penn State Universitynfound that when you smile,,you don't only appear to benmore likable and courteous,,but you actually appearnto be more competent. 
 So whenever you wantnto look great and competent,,reduce your stressnor improve your marriage,,or feel as if you just had a whole stacknof high-quality chocolate,without incurring the caloric cost,,or as if you found 25 grand in a pocketnof an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages,,or whenever you wantnto tap into a superpower,that will help you and everyone around you,live a longer, healthier, happier life,,smile. 
 (Applause)Khan Academy is most knownnfor its collection of videos,,so before I go any further,,let me show you a little bit of a montage. 
 (Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenusenis now going to be five.,This animal's fossils are only foundnin this area of South America --,a nice clean band here --,and this part of Africa.,We can integrate over the surface,,and the notationnusually is a capital sigma.,National Assembly: They createnthe Committee of Public Safety,,which sounds like a very nice committee.,Notice, this is an aldehyde,nand it's an alcohol.,Start differentiatingninto effector and memory cells.,A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy.nOh, look! There's another galaxy.,And for dollars, is their 30 million,,plus the 20 million dollarsnfrom the American manufacturer.,If this does not blow your mind,,then you have no emotion. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Live) SK: We now havenon the order of 2,200 videos,,covering everything from basic arithmetic,nall the way to vector calculus,,and some of the stuffnthat you saw up there.,We have a million studentsna month using the site,,watching on the ordernof 100 to 200,000 videos a day.,But what we're going to talk about in thisnis how we're going to the next level.,But before I do that,,I want to talk a little bitnabout really just how I got started.,And some of you all might know,,about five years ago,nI was an analyst at a hedge fund,,and I was in Boston,,and I was tutoring my cousinsnin New Orleans, remotely.,And I started puttingnthe first YouTube videos up,,really just as a kind of nice-to-have,,just kind of a supplement for my cousins,,something that might give themna refresher or something. 
 And as soon as I put thosenfirst YouTube videos up,,something interesting happened.,Actually, a bunch of interestingnthings happened.,The first was the feedbacknfrom my cousins.,They told me that they preferrednme on YouTube than in person. 
 (Laughter) 
 And once you get overnthe backhanded nature of that,,there was actually somethingnvery profound there.,They were saying that they preferrednthe automated version of their cousin,to their cousin.,At first it's very unintuitive,,but when you think about it from theirnpoint of view, it makes a ton of sense.,You have this situation where nownthey can pause and repeat their cousin,,without feelingnlike they're wasting my time.,If they have to review something,that they should have learnedna couple of weeks ago,,or maybe a couple of years ago,,they don't have to be embarrassednand ask their cousin.,They can just watch those videos;nif they're bored, they can go ahead.,They can watch at their own time and pace.,Probably the least-appreciated aspectnof this,is the notion that the very first time,that you're trying to getnyour brain around a new concept,,the very last thing you need,is another human being saying,n"Do you understand this?",And that's what was happening,with the interactionnwith my cousins before,,and now they can just do itnin the intimacy of their own room. 
 The other thing that happened is --,I put them on YouTube just --,I saw no reason to make it private,,so I let other people watch it,,and then people started stumbling on it,,and I started gettingnsome comments and some letters,and all sorts of feedback,from random people around the world.,These are just a few.,This is actually from onenof the original calculus videos.,Someone wrote it on YouTube,nit was a YouTube comment:,"First time I smiled doing a derivative." 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's pause here.,This person did a derivative,,and then they smiled. 
 (Laughter) 
 In response to that same comment --,this is on the thread, you can gonon YouTube and look at the comments --,someone else wrote: "Same thing here.,I actually got a natural highnand a good mood for the entire day,,since I remember seeingnall of this matrix text in class,,and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 We get a lot of feedbacknalong those lines.,This clearly was helping people.,But then, as the viewershipnkept growing and kept growing,,I started getting letters from people,,and it was starting to become clear,that it was more than just a nice-to-have.,This is just an excerptnfrom one of those letters:,"My 12 year-old son has autism,,and has had a terrible time with math.,We have tried everything,,viewed everything, bought everything.,We stumbled on your videonon decimals, and it got through.,Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.,Again, he got it.,We could not believe it.,He is so excited.",And so you can imagine,,here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --,it was very strange for me to donsomething of social value. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But I was excited, so I kept going.,And then a few other thingsnstarted to dawn on me;,that not only would itnhelp my cousins right now,,or these people who were sending letters,,but that this content will never grow old,,that it could help their kidsnor their grandkids.,If Isaac Newton had donenYouTube videos on calculus,,I wouldn't have to. 
 (Laughter) 
 Assuming he was good. We don't know. 
 (Laughter) 
 The other thing that happened --nand even at this point, I said,,"OK, maybe it's a good supplement.nIt's good for motivated students.,It's good for maybe home-schoolers.",But I didn't think it would somehownpenetrate the classroom.,Then I started gettingnletters from teachers,,and the teachers would write, saying,,"We've used your videosnto flip the classroom.,You've given the lectures,nso now what we do --",And this could happen in every classroomnin America tomorrow --,"what I do is I assignnthe lectures for homework,,and what used to be homework,,I now have the studentsndoing in the classroom." 
 And I want to pause here -- 
 (Applause) 
 I want to pause here, because there'sna couple of interesting things.,One, when those teachers are doing that,,there's the obvious benefit --,the benefit that now their students,can enjoy the videos in the waynthat my cousins did,,they can pause, repeat at theirnown pace, at their own time.,But the more interesting thing --nand this is the unintuitive thing,when you talk about technologynin the classroom --,by removing the one-size-fits-allnlecture from the classroom,,and letting students havena self-paced lecture at home,,then when you go to the classroom,,letting them do work,nhaving the teacher walk around,,having the peers actually be ablento interact with each other,,these teachers have used technologynto humanize the classroom.,They took a fundamentallyndehumanizing experience --,30 kids with their fingers on their lips,,not allowed to interact with each other.,A teacher, no matter how good,,has to give this one-size-fits-allnlecture to 30 students --,blank faces, slightly antagonistic --,and now it's a human experience,,now they're actuallyninteracting with each other. 
 So once the Khan Academy --,I quit my job,,and we turned into a real organization --,we're a not-for-profit --,the question is, how do we take thisnto the next level?,How do we take what those teachersnwere doing to its natural conclusion?,And so, what I'm showing over here,,these are actual exercises,that I started writing for my cousins.,The ones I startednwere much more primitive.,This is a more competent version of it.,But the paradigm here is, we'll generatenas many questions as you need,,until you get that concept,nuntil you get 10 in a row.,And the Khan Academy videos are there.,You get hints, the actualnsteps for that problem,,if you don't know how to do it.,The paradigm here seemsnlike a very simple thing:,10 in a row, you move on.,But it's fundamentally different,than what's happeningnin classrooms right now. 
 In a traditional classroom,,you have homework, lecture,nhomework, lecture,,and then you have a snapshot exam.,And that exam, whether you getna 70 percent, an 80 percent,,a 90 percent or a 95 percent,,the class moves on to the next topic.,And even that 95 percent student --,what was the five percentnthey didn't know?,Maybe they didn't know what happens whennyou raise something to the zeroth power.,Then you build on thatnin the next concept.,That's analogous to --nimagine learning to ride a bicycle.,Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,,and I give you a bicycle for two weeks,nthen I come back after two weeks,,and say, "Well, let's see.nYou're having trouble taking left turns.,You can't quite stop.nYou're an 80 percent bicyclist.",So I put a big "C" stampnon your forehead -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and then I say, "Here's a unicycle." 
 (Laughter) 
 But as ridiculous as that sounds,,that's exactly what's happeningnin our classrooms right now.,And the idea is you fast forward,and good students start failingnalgebra all of the sudden,,and start failingncalculus all of the sudden,,despite being smart,ndespite having good teachers,,and it's usually because they haventhese Swiss cheese gaps,that kept buildingnthroughout their foundation.,So our model is: learn mathnthe way you'd learn anything,,like riding a bicycle.,Stay on that bicycle.nFall off that bicycle.,Do it as long as necessary,nuntil you have mastery.,The traditional model,,it penalizes younfor experimentation and failure,,but it does not expect mastery.,We encourage you to experiment.nWe encourage you to fail.,But we do expect mastery. 
 This is just another one of the modules.,This is trigonometry.,This is shifting and reflecting functions.,And they all fit together.,We have about 90 of these right now.,You can go to the site right now,,it's all free,nnot trying to sell anything.,But the general idea is that they allnfit into this knowledge map.,That top node right there,nthat's literally single-digit addition,,it's like one plus one is equal to two.,The paradigm is, once you getn10 in a row on that,,it keeps forwarding younto more and more advanced modules. 
 Further down the knowledge map,,we're getting into morenadvanced arithmetic.,Further down, you start gettingninto pre-algebra and early algebra.,Further down, you start gettingninto algebra one, algebra two,,a little bit of precalculus.,And the idea is, from this we cannactually teach everything --,well, everything that can be taughtnin this type of a framework.,So you can imagine -- and thisnis what we are working on --,from this knowledge map, you havenlogic, you have computer programming,,you have grammar, you have genetics,,all based off of that core of,nif you know this and that,,now you're ready for this next concept.,Now that can work wellnfor an individual learner,,and I encourage younto do it with your kids,,but I also encourage everyonenin the audience to do it yourself.,It'll change what happensnat the dinner table. 
 But what we want to do,is use the natural conclusionnof the flipping of the classroom,that those early teachersnhad emailed me about.,And so what I'm showing you here,,this is data from a pilotnin the Los Altos school district,,where they took two fifth-grade classesnand two seventh-grade classes,,and completely guttedntheir old math curriculum.,These kids aren't using textbooks,nor getting one-size-fits-all lectures.,They're doing Khan Academy, that software,nfor roughly half of their math class.,I want to be clear: we don't view thisnas a complete math education.,What it does is -- this isnwhat's happening in Los Altos --,it frees up time --nit's the blocking and tackling,,making sure you know how to moventhrough a system of equations,,and it frees up timenfor the simulations, for the games,,for the mechanics, for the robot-building,,for the estimating how highnthat hill is based on its shadow. 
 And so the paradigm isnthe teacher walks in every day,,every kid works at their own pace --,this is actually a live dashboardnfrom the Los Altos school district --,and they look at this dashboard.,Every row is a student.,Every column is one of those concepts.,Green means the student'snalready proficient.,Blue means they're workingnon it -- no need to worry.,Red means they're stuck.,And what the teacher doesnis literally just say,,"Let me intervene on the red kids.",Or even better, "Let me getnone of the green kids,,who are already proficientnin that concept,,to be the first line of attack,nand actually tutor their peer." 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I come from a veryndata-centric reality,,so we don't want that teachernto even go and intervene,and have to ask the kid awkward questions:,"What don't you understand? What donyou understand?" and all the rest.,So our paradigm is to arm teachersnwith as much data as possible --,data that, in any othernfield, is expected,,in finance, marketing, manufacturing --,so the teachers can diagnosenwhat's wrong with the students,so they can make their interactionnas productive as possible.,Now teachers know exactlynwhat the students have been up to,,how long they've spent each day,nwhat videos they've watched,,when did they pause the videos,nwhat did they stop watching,,what exercises are they using,nwhat have they focused on?,The outer circle showsnwhat exercises they were focused on.,The inner circle showsnthe videos they're focused on.,The data gets pretty granular,,so you can see the exact problemsnthe student got right or wrong.,Red is wrong, blue is right.,The leftmost question is the first onenthe student attempted.,They watched the video over there.,And you can see, eventuallynthey were able to get 10 in a row.,It's almost like you can see themnlearning over those last 10 problems.,They also got faster -- the heightnis how long it took them. 
 When you talk about self-paced learning,nit makes sense for everyone --,in education-speak,n"differentiated learning" --,but it's kind of crazy, what happensnwhen you see it in a classroom.,Because every time we've done this,nin every classroom we've done,,over and over again,nif you go five days into it,,there's a group of kids who've raced ahead,and a group who are a little bit slower.,In a traditional model,nin a snapshot assessment,,you say, "These are the gifted kids,nthese are the slow kids.,Maybe they should be tracked differently.,Maybe we should put themnin different classes.",But when you let studentsnwork at their own pace --,we see it over and over again --,you see students who tookna little bit extra time,on one concept or the other,,but once they get through that concept,,they just race ahead.,And so the same kids that younthought were slow six weeks ago,,you now would think are gifted.,And we're seeing it over and over again.,It makes you really wonder,how much all of the labels maybena lot of us have benefited from,were really just duento a coincidence of time. 
 Now as valuable as something like this isnin a district like Los Altos,,our goal is to use technology,to humanize, not just in Los Altos,nbut on a global scale,,what's happening in education.,And that brings up an interesting point.,A lot of the effortnin humanizing the classroom,is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.,In our mind, the relevant metric is:,student-to-valuable-human-time-nwith-the-teacher ratio.,So in a traditional model,nmost of the teacher's time,is spent doing lecturesnand grading and whatnot.,Maybe five percent of their timenis sitting next to students,and working with them.,Now, 100 percent of their time is.,So once again, using technology,nnot just flipping the classroom,,you're humanizingnthe classroom, I'd argue,,by a factor of five or 10. 
 As valuable as that is in Los Altos,,imagine what it does to the adult learner,,who's embarrassed to go backnand learn stuff,they should have knownnbefore going back to college.,Imagine what it doesnto a street kid in Calcutta,,who has to help his family during the day,,and that's the reasonnhe or she can't go to school.,Now they can spend two hoursna day and remediate,,or get up to speednand not feel embarrassed,about what they do or don't know.,Now imagine what happens where --,we talked about the peersnteaching each other,inside of a classroom.,But this is all one system.,There's no reason why you can'tnhave that peer-to-peer tutoring,beyond that one classroom.,Imagine what happensnif that student in Calcutta,all of the sudden can tutor your son,,or your son can tutornthat kid in Calcutta.,And I think what you'll see emerging,is this notion of a globalnone-world classroom.,And that's essentiallynwhat we're trying to build. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bill Gates: I'll ask about twonor three questions. 
 Salman Khan: Oh, OK. 
 (Applause continues) 
 (Applause ends) 
 BG: I've seen some thingsnyou're doing in the system,,that have to do with motivationnand feedback --,energy points, merit badges.,Tell me what you're thinking there. 
 SK: Oh yeah. No, we havenan awesome team working on it.,I have to be clear,nit's not just me anymore.,I'm still doing all the videos,,but we have a rock-star teamndoing the software.,We've put a bunch of game mechanicsnin there, where you get badges,,we're going to start having leader boardsnby area, you get points.,It's actually been pretty interesting.,Just the wording of the badging,,or how many points you getnfor doing something,,we see on a system-wide basis,,like tens of thousandsnof fifth-graders or sixth-graders,going one direction or another,ndepending what badge you give them. 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: And the collaborationnyou're doing with Los Altos,,how did that come about? 
 SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.,Once again, I didn't expect itnto be used in classrooms.,Someone from their board came and said,,"What would you do if you hadncarte Blanche in a classroom?",I said, "Well, every studentnwould work at their own pace,,on something like this,nwe'd give a dashboard.",They said, "This is kind of radical.nWe have to think about it.",Me and the rest of the team were like,n"They're never going to want to do this.",But literally the next day they were like,n"Can you start in two weeks?" 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: So fifth-grade mathnis where that's going on right now? 
 SK: It's two fifth-grade classesnand two seventh-grade classes.,They're doing it at the district level.,I think what they're excited aboutnis they can follow these kids,,not only in school; on Christmas,nwe saw some of the kids were doing it.,We can track everything, track themnas they go through the entire district.,Through the summers, as they gonfrom one teacher to the next,,you have this continuity of data thatneven at the district level, they can see. 
 BG: So some of those views we sawnwere for the teacher,to go in and track actuallynwhat's going on with those kids.,So you're getting feedbacknon those teacher views,to see what they think they need? 
 SK: Oh yeah. Most of thosenwere specs by the teachers.,We made some of those for studentsnso they could see their data,,but we have a very tight design loopnwith the teachers themselves.,And they're saying,n"Hey, this is nice, but --",Like that focus graph,na lot of the teachers said,,"I have a feeling a lot of the kidsnare jumping around,and not focusing on one topic.",So we made that focus diagram.,So it's all been teacher-driven.nIt's been pretty crazy. 
 BG: Is this ready for prime time?,Do you think a lot of classes next schoolnyear should try this thing out? 
 SK: Yeah, it's ready.,We've got a million peoplenon the site already,,so we can handle a few more. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, no reason why it really can't happen,in every classroom in America tomorrow. 
 BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.,The idea there is,nif I'm confused about a topic,,somehow right in the user interface,,I'd find people who are volunteering,,maybe see their reputation,,and I could schedule and connect upnwith those people? 
 SK: Absolutely. And this is somethingnI recommend everyone in this audience do.,Those dashboards the teachers have,nyou can go log in right now,and you can essentially become a coach,for your kids, your nephews, your cousins,,or maybe some kidsnat the Boys and Girls Club.,And yeah, you can startnbecoming a mentor, a tutor,,really immediately.,But yeah, it's all there. 
 BG: Well, it's amazing.,I think you just got a glimpsenof the future of education. 
 BG: Thank you.nSK: Thank you. 
 (Applause)As a boy,,I loved cars.,When I turned 18,,I lost my best friend to a car accident.,Like this.,And then I decided I'd dedicate my life,to saving one million people,every year.,Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,,but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. 
 I saw the concept first,in the DARPA Grand Challenges,where the U.S. government issued a prize,to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.,And even though a hundred teams were there,,these cars went nowhere.,So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.,We built the hardware and the software.,We made it learn from us,,and we set it free in the desert.,And the unimaginable happened:,it became the first car,to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,,winning Stanford 2 million dollars.,Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. 
 Since, our work has focused,on building driving cars,that can drive anywhere by themselves --,any street in California.,We've driven 140,000 miles.,Our cars have sensors,by which they magically can see,everything around them,and make decisions,about every aspect of driving.,It's the perfect driving mechanism.,We've driven in cities,,like in San Francisco here.,We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1. 
 We've encountered joggers,,busy highways, toll booths,,and this is without a person in the loop;,the car just drives itself.,In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,,people didn't even notice.,Mountain roads,,day and night,,and even crooked Lombard Street,in San Francisco.,(Laughter),Sometimes our cars get so crazy,,they even do little stunts. 
 (Video) Man: Oh, my God.,What?,Second Man: It's driving itself. 
 Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,,but I can do something for all the people who died.,Do you know that driving accidents,are the number one cause of death for young people?,And do you realize that almost all of those,are due to human error,and not machine error,,and can therefore be prevented by machines? 
 Do you realize,that we could change the capacity of highways,by a factor of two or three,if we didn't rely on human precision,on staying in the lane --,improve body position,and therefore drive a little bit closer together,on a little bit narrower lanes,,and do away with all traffic jams on highways?,Do you realize that you, TED users,,spend an average,of 52 minutes per day,in traffic,,wasting your time,on your daily commute?,You could regain this time.,This is four billion hours,wasted in this country alone.,And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. 
 Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,,and I'm really looking forward to a time,when generations after us look back at us,and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So as a fashion designer,,I've always tended to think of materials,something like this,,or this,,or maybe this.,But then I met a biologist,,and now I think of materials like this --,green tea, sugar,,a few microbes and a little time.,I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe,,which is a symbiotic mix,of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,,which spin cellulose,in a fermentation process.,Over time, these tiny threads,form in the liquid into layers,and produce a mat on the surface. 
 So we start by brewing the tea.,I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time,,and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.,We stir this in until it's completely dissolved,and then pour it into a growth bath.,We need to check that the temperature,has cooled to below 30 degrees C.,And then we're ready to add the living organism.,And along with that, some acetic acid.,And once you get this process going,,you can actually recycle,your previous fermented liquid.,We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.,And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on,and a thermostat to regulate it.,And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.,So this is my mini fabric farm. 
 After about three days,,the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.,So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.,And the bacteria are feeding,on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.,So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers,of pure cellulose.,And they're sticking together, forming layers,and giving us a sheet on the surface.,After about two to three weeks,,we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.,So the bath on the left is after five days,,and on the right, after 10.,And this is a static culture.,You don't have to do anything to it;,you just literally watch it grow.,It doesn't need light. 
 And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath,and you wash it in cold, soapy water.,At this point, it's really heavy.,It's over 90 percent water,,so we need to let that evaporate.,So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.,Again, you can do that outside,and just let it dry in the air.,And as it's drying, it's compressing,,so what you're left with, depending on the recipe,,is something that's either,like a really light-weight, transparent paper,,or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.,And then you can either cut that out,and sew it conventionally,,or you can use the wet material,to form it around a three-dimensional shape.,And as it evaporates,,it will knit itself together, forming seams. 
 So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.,I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin,,which intrigues me.,Since it's organic,,I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.,I can make it change color without using dye,by a process of iron oxidation.,Using fruit and vegetable staining,,create organic patterning.,And using indigo,,make it anti-microbial.,And in fact, cotton,would take up to 18 dips in indigo,to achieve a color this dark.,And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose,,it just takes one, and a really short one at that. 
 What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.,So if I was to walk outside in the rain,wearing this dress today,,I would immediately start to absorb,huge amounts of water.,The dress would get really heavy,,and eventually the seams would probably fall apart --,leaving me feeling rather naked.,Possibly a good performance piece,,but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.,What I'm looking for,is a way to give the material,the qualities that I need.,So what I want to do is say to a future bug,,"Spin me a thread.,Align it in this direction.,Make it hydrophobic.,And while you're at it,,just form it around this 3D shape." 
 Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing,,and possibly in the future,for biocompatible blood vessels,,possibly even replacement bone tissue.,But with synthetic biology,,we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium,to produce something,that gives us the quality,,quantity and shape,of material that we desire.,Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting,because then I start to think, wow,,we could actually imagine,growing consumable products. 
 What excites me about using microbes,is their efficiency.,So we only grow what we need.,There's no waste.,And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream --,so for example,,a waste sugar stream,from a food processing plant.,Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally,along with your vegetable peelings.,What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose,is going to be a replacement,for cotton, leather or other textile materials.,But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition,to our increasingly precious natural resources. 
 Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion,where we see these microbes have their impact.,We could, for example, imagine,growing a lamp, a chair,,a car or maybe even a house.,So I guess what my question to you is:,in the future, what would you choose to grow?,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity,,what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.),This is one of the jackets you grew? 
 SL: Yes, it is.,It's probably -- part of the project's still in process,because this one,is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.,(Laughter),It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it. 
 BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.,Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.) 
 (Applause)Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.,I have a studio in London,that has a particular approach,to designing buildings.,When I was growing up,,I was exposed to making,and crafts and materials,and invention on a small scale.,And I was there looking,at the larger scale of buildings,and finding,that the buildings that were around me,and that were being designed,and that were there in the publications I was seeing,felt soulless and cold.,And there on the smaller scale,,the scale of an earring,or a ceramic pot,or a musical instrument,,was a materiality and a soulfulness.,And this influenced me.,The first building I built was 20 years ago.,And since, in the last 20 years,,I've developed a studio in London.,Sorry, this was my mother, by the way,,in her bead shop in London.,I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that. 
 I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work,,a few projects that we've worked on.,This is a hospital building.,This is a shop for a bag company.,This is studios for artists.,This is a sculpture,made from a million yards of wire,and 150,000 glass beads,the size of a golf ball.,And this is a window display.,And this is pair of cooling towers,for an electricity substation,next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London.,And this is a temple in Japan,for a Buddhist monk.,And this is a cafe by the sea,in Britain. 
 And just very quickly,,something we've been working on very recently,is we were commissioned by the mayor of London,to design a new bus,that gave the passenger,their freedom again.,Because the original Routemaster bus,that some of you may be familiar with,,which had this open platform at the back --,in fact, I think all our Routemasters,are here in California now actually.,But they aren't in London.,And so you're stuck on a bus.,And if the bus is going to stop,and it's three yards away from the bus stop,,you're just a prisoner.,But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce,buses with this open platform.,So we've been working with Transport for London,,and that organization,hasn't actually been responsible,as a client for a new bus,for 50 years.,And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.,The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.,So it's got hybrid drive.,And we've been working,to try to improve,everything from the fabric,to the format,and structure,and aesthetics. 
 I was going to show four main projects.,And this is a project for a bridge.,And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.,And openings seemed --,everyone loves opening bridges,,but it's quite a basic thing.,I think we all kind of stand and watch.,But the bridges that we saw,that opened and closed --,I'm slightly squeamish --,but I once saw a photograph of a footballer,who was diving for a ball.,And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,,and it had broken like this.,And then we looked at these kinds of bridges,and just couldn't help feeling,that it was a beautiful thing that had broken. 
 And so this is in Paddington in London.,And it's a very boring bridge, as you can see.,It's just steel and timber.,But instead of what it is,,our focus was on the way it worked.,(Applause),So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it,would end up kissing each other.,(Applause),We actually had to halve its speed,,because everyone was too scared when we first did it.,So that's it speeded up. 
 A project that we've been working on very recently,is to design a new biomass power station --,so a power station that uses organic waste material.,In the news,,the subject of where our future water is going to come from,and where our power is going to come from,is in all the papers all the time.,And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.,But recently,,any annual report of a power company,doesn't have a power station on it.,It has a child running through a field, or something like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so when a consortium of engineers approached us,and asked us to work with them on this power station,,our condition was that we would work with them,and that, whatever we did,,we were not just going to decorate a normal power station.,And instead, we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us.,And so we spent time traveling with them,and learning about all the different elements,,and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies,that weren't being capitalized on.,That just taking a field and banging all these things out,isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work. 
 So we looked at how we could compose all those elements --,instead of just litter, create one composition.,And what we found --,this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.,It was voted the worst place in Britain to live.,And there are 2,000 new homes being built,next to this power station.,So it felt this has a social dimension.,It has a symbolic importance.,And we should be proud of where our power is coming from,,rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of. 
 So we were looking at how we could make a power station,,that, instead of keeping people out,and having a big fence around the outside,,could be a place that pulls you in.,And it has to be --,I'm trying to get my --,250 feet high.,So it felt that what we could try to do,is make a power park,and actually bring the whole area in,,and using the spare soil that's there on the site,,we could make a power station that was silent as well.,Because just that soil,could make the acoustic difference.,And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure,and have a cost-effective way,of making a structure to do this. 
 The finished project,is meant to be more than just a power station.,It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.,(Laughter),And it's a power park.,So people can come and really experience this,and also look out all around the area,,and use that height that we have to have for its function. 
 In Shanghai,,we were invited to build --,well we weren't invited; what am I talking about.,We won the competition, and it was painful to get there.,(Laughter),So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion.,And an expo,is a totally bonkers thing.,There's 250 pavilions.,It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened.,So there are up to a million people there everyday.,And 250 countries all competing.,And the British government saying,,"You need to be in the top five.",And so that became,the governmental goal --,is, how do you stand out in this chaos,,which is an expo of stimulus?,So our sense was we had to do one thing,,and only one thing,,instead of trying to have everything.,And so what we also felt,was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the thing that was true,,the expo was about the future of cities,,and particularly the Victorians,pioneered integrating nature into the cities.,And the world's first public park of modern times,was in Britain.,And the world's first major botanical institution,is in London,,and they have this extraordinary project,where they've been collecting 25 percent,of all the world's plant species.,So we suddenly realized that there was this thing.,And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,,and I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees.",And the same with flowers.,I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers.",But we realized that seeds --,there's been this very serious project happening --,but that seeds --,at these major botanical gardens,,seeds aren't on show.,But you just have to go to a garden center,,and they're in little paper packets.,But this phenomenal project's been happening.,So we realized we had to make a project,that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral. 
 But how could we show these teeny-weeny things?,And the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us.,Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber,gave us some kind of clue,that these tiny things,could be trapped and be made to seem precious,,rather than looking like nuts.,So the challenge was,,how are we going to bring light and expose these things?,We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content.,So we were trying to think,,how could we make a whole thing emanate.,By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations.,So that was also in the mix,with the site the size of a football pitch.,And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue. 
 (Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop.,Song: ♫ We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫,♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫,♫ They're the Mop Tops ♫ 
 Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea.,So the idea,was to take these 66,000 seeds,that they agreed to give us,,and to take each seed and trap it,in this precious optical hair,and grow that through this box,,very simple box element,,and make it a building,that could move in the wind.,So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows.,And inside, the daylight --,each one is an optic,and it brings light into the center.,And by night,,artificial light in each one,emanates and comes out to the outside.,And to make the project affordable,,we focused our energy.,Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch,,we focused it on this one element.,And the government agreed to do that,and not do anything else,,and focus our energy on that.,And so the rest of the site was a public space.,And with a million people there a day,,it just felt like offering some public space. 
 We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer,to develop a mini-me version,of the seed cathedral,,so that, even if you're partially-sighted,,that it was kind of crunchy and soft,,that piece of landscape that you see there.,And then, you know when a pet has an operation,and they shave a bit of the skin,and get rid of the fur --,in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral,,in effect, we've shaved it. 
 And inside there's nothing;,there's no famous actor's voice;,there's no projections;,there's no televisions; there's no color changing.,There's just silence,and a cool temperature.,And if a cloud goes past,,you can see a cloud on the tips,where it's letting the light through.,This is the only project that we've done,where the finished thing,looked more like a rendering than our renderings. 
 (Laughter) 
 A key thing was how people would interact.,I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing,you could possible do at the expo.,And I just wanted to show you.,The British government --,any government is potentially the worst client in the world,you could ever possibly want to have.,And there was a lot of terror.,But there was an underlying support.,And so there was a moment,when suddenly -- actually, the next thing.,This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment,,who was our client,,with the Chinese children, using the landscape. 
 (Video) Children: One, two, three, go. 
 (Laughter) 
 TH: I'm sorry about my stupid voice there. 
 (Laughter) 
 So finally, texture is something.,In the projects we've been working on,,these slick buildings,,where they might be a fancy shape,,but the materiality feels the same,,is something that we've been trying to research really,,and explore alternatives.,And the project that we're building in Malaysia,is apartment buildings,for a property developer.,And it's in a piece of land,that's this site.,And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur,said that, if this developer,would give something that gave something back to the city,,they would give them more gross floor area, buildable.,So there was an incentive for the developer,to really try to think about,what would be better for the city. 
 And the conventional thing with apartment buildings,in this part of the world,is you have your tower,,and you squeeze a few trees around the edge,,and you see cars parked.,It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience,,and the rest of it is just for postcards.,The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this.,So if we could chop that away,and give the building a small bottom,,we could take that bit and put it at the top,where the greater commercial value is for a property developer.,And by linking these together,,we could have 90 percent of the site,as a rainforest,,instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees,and bits of road around buildings. 
 (Applause) 
 So we're building these buildings.,They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective.,They're just chopped at different heights.,But the key part,is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape,,rather than engulf it.,And that's my final slide. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: So thank you. Thank you, Thomas. You're a delight.,Since we have an extra minute here,,I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds,,which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building. 
 TH: These are a few of the tests we did,when we were building the structure.,So there were 66,000 of these.,This optic,was 22 feet long.,And so the daylight was just coming --,it was caught on the outside of the box,and was coming down to illuminate each seed.,Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy.,Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway,,but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it --,we had quite a time.,There was one person in the contractors who was the right size --,and it wasn't a child --,who could fit between them,for the final waterproofing of the building. 
 JC: Thank you, Thomas. 
 (Applause)Ten years ago exactly,,I was in Afghanistan.,I was covering the war in Afghanistan,,and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,,the amount of suffering and destruction,that emerged out of a war like that.,Then, two years later,,I covered another war -- the war in Iraq.,I was placed at the center of that war,because I was covering the war,from the northern part of Iraq.,And the war ended,with a regime change,,like the one in Afghanistan.,And that regime,that we got rid of,was actually a dictatorship,,an authoritarian regime,,that for decades,created a great sense of paralysis,within the nation, within the people themselves.,However,,the change that came through foreign intervention,created even worse circumstances for the people,and deepened the sense,of paralysis and inferiority,in that part of the world. 
 For decades,,we have lived under authoritarian regimes --,in the Arab world, in the Middle East.,These regimes,created something within us during this period.,I'm 43 years old right now.,For the last 40 years,,I have seen almost the same faces,for kings and presidents ruling us --,old, aged, authoritarian,,corrupt situations --,regimes that we have seen around us.,And for a moment I was wondering,,are we going to live in order to see,real change happening on the ground,,a change that does not come through foreign intervention,,through the misery of occupation,,through nations invading our land,and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?,The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,,but when they saw,their land occupied by foreign forces,they felt very sad,,they felt that their dignity had suffered.,And this is why they revolted.,This is why they did not accept.,And actually other regimes, they told their citizens,,"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?,Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?,Would you like to see destruction?,Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?",And the people thought for themselves,,"Maybe we should live with,this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,,instead of having the second scenario.",That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. 
 For 10 years,,unfortunately we have found ourselves,reporting images of destruction,,images of killing,,of sectarian conflicts,,images of violence,,emerging from a magnificent piece of land,,a region that one day was the source,of civilizations and art and culture,for thousands of years.,Now I am here to tell you,that the future,that we were dreaming for,has eventually arrived.,A new generation,,well-educated,,connected,,inspired by universal values,and a global understanding,,has created a new reality for us.,We have found a new way,to express our feelings,and to express our dreams:,these young people,who have restored self-confidence,in our nations in that part of the world,,who have given us,new meaning for freedom,and empowered us to go down to the streets.,Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing.,Just step out of your house,,raise your voice,and say, "We would like to see the end of the regime." 
 This is what happened in Tunisia.,Over a few days,,the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars,in the security agencies,,billions of dollars,in maintaining, trying to maintain,,its prisons,,collapsed, disappeared,,because of the voices of the public.,People who were inspired to go down to the streets,and to raise their voices,,they tried to kill.,The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.,They found something called Facebook.,They found something called Twitter.,They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.,And they said,,"These kids are misled.",Therefore, they asked their parents,to go down to the streets,and collect them, bring them back home.,This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.,"Bring these kids home,because they are misled.",But yes,,these youth,who have been inspired,by universal values,,who are idealistic enough,to imagine a magnificent future,and, at the same time, realistic enough,to balance this kind of imagination,and the process leading to it --,not using violence,,not trying to create chaos --,these young people,,they did not go home.,Parents actually went to the streets,and they supported them.,And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia. 
 We in Al Jazeera,were banned from Tunisia for years,,and the government did not allow,any Al Jazeera reporter to be there.,But we found that these people in the street,,all of them are our reporters,,feeding our newsroom,with pictures, with videos,and with news.,And suddenly that newsroom in Doha,became a center,that received all this kind of input from ordinary people --,people who are connected and people who have ambition,and who have liberated themselves,from the feeling of inferiority.,And then we took that decision:,We are unrolling the news.,We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.,We are going to spread the message.,Yes, some of these young people,are connected to the Internet,,but the connectivity in the Arab world,is very little, is very small,,because of many problems that we are suffering from.,But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people,and we amplified [it].,We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --,and internationally, globally,,through our English channel. 
 And then people started to feel,that there's something new happening.,And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali,decided to leave.,And then Egypt started,,and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.,And now Libya as you see it.,And then you have Yemen.,And you have many other countries trying to see,and to rediscover that feeling,of, "How do we imagine a future,which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?",I want to tell you something,,that the Internet and connectivity,has created [a] new mindset.,But this mindset,has continued to be faithful,to the soil and to the land,that it emerged from.,And while this was the major difference,between many initiatives before,to create change,,before we thought, and governments told us --,and even sometimes it was true --,that change was imposed on us,,and people rejected that,,because they thought that it is alien to their culture.,Always, we believed,that change will spring from within,,that change should be a reconciliation,with culture, cultural diversity,,with our faith in our tradition,and in our history,,but at the same time,,open to universal values, connected with the world,,tolerant to the outside.,And this is the moment,that is happening right now in the Arab world.,This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment,that we see all of these meanings meet together,and then create the beginning,of this magnificent era,that will emerge from the region. 
 How did the elite deal with that --,the so-called political elite?,In front of Facebook,,they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.,In front of Al Jazeera,,they started creating tribalism.,And then when they failed,,they started speaking about conspiracies,that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington,in order to divide the Arab world.,They started telling the West,,"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.,Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.,These are Islamists,trying to create new Imaras.,Be aware of these people,who [are] coming to you,in order to ruin your great civilization.",Fortunately,,people right now cannot be deceived.,Because this corrupt elite,in that region,has lost even the power of deception.,They could not, and they cannot, imagine,how they could really deal with this reality.,They have lost.,They have been detached,from their people, from the masses,,and now we are seeing them collapsing,one after the other. 
 Al Jazeera is not,a tool of revolution.,We do not create revolutions.,However,,when something of that magnitude happens,,we are at the center of the coverage.,We were banned from Egypt,,and our correspondents,,some of them were arrested.,But most of our camera people,and our journalists,,they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily --,to report what happened in Tahrir Square.,For 18 days,,our cameras were broadcasting, live,,the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.,I remember one night,when someone phoned me on my cellphone --,ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.,He told me, "We appeal to you,not to switch off the cameras.,If you switch off the cameras tonight,,there will be a genocide.,You are protecting us,by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square.",I felt the responsibility,to phone our correspondents there,and to phone our newsroom,and to tell them, "Make your best,not to switch off the cameras at night,,because the guys there really feel confident,when someone is reporting their story --,and they feel protected as well." 
 So we have a chance,to create a new future,in that part of the world.,We have a chance,to go and to think of the future,as something which is open to the world.,Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran,,of [the] Mosaddeq revolution.,Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West --,from thinking about that part of the world,based on oil interest,,or based on interests,of the illusion of stability and security.,The stability and security,of authoritarian regimes,cannot create,but terrorism and violence and destruction.,Let us accept the choice of the people.,Let us not pick and choose,who we would like to rule their future.,The future should be ruled,by people themselves,,even sometimes if they are voices,that might now scare us.,But the values of democracy,and the freedom of choice,that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time,is the best opportunity for the world,,for the West and the East,,to see stability and to see security,and to see friendship and to see tolerance,emerging from the Arab world,,rather than the images of violence and terrorism.,Let us support these people.,Let us stand for them.,And let us give up,our narrow selfishness,in order to embrace change,,and in order to celebrate with the people of that region,a great future,and hope and tolerance.,The future has arrived,,and the future is now.,I thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you.,Thank you for coming here.,How would you characterize the historical significance,of what's happened?,Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade,or something more? 
 Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.,We have covered many wars.,We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,,a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,,because we were centered at the middle of it.,But this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful.,It is not something that you only cover,because you have to cover a great incident.,You are witnessing change in history.,You are witnessing the birth of a new era.,And this is what the story's all about. 
 CA: There are a lot of people in the West,who are still skeptical,,or think this may just be an intermediate stage,before much more alarming chaos.,You really believe,that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,,that a government could emerge,that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly? 
 WK: And people actually,,after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,,the youth who have organized themselves,in certain groups and councils,,they are guarding the transformation,and they are trying to put it on a track,in order to satisfy,the values of democracy,,but at the same time,also to make it reasonable,and to make it rational,,not to go out of order.,In my opinion, these people are much more wiser,than, not only the political elite,,even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders,including political parties.,At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world,are much more wiser,and capable of creating the change,than the old --,including the political and cultural,and ideological,old regimes. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.,What should people here at TED,,here in the West,,do if they want to connect or make a difference,and they believe in what's happening here? 
 WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world --,that people care,,people care about this great transformation.,Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,,the head of Aljazeera.net,,he told me that a 2,500 percent increase,of accessing our website,from various parts of the world.,Fifty percent of it is coming from America.,Because we discovered that people care,,and people would like to know --,they are receiving the stream through our Internet.,Unfortunately in the United States,,we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time,for Al Jazeera English.,But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate,through connecting ourselves,with those people in the street,and expressing our support to them,and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,,of supporting the weak and the oppressed,to create a much better future for all of us. 
 CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community,,TEDxCairo,,are meeting as we speak.,They've had some speakers there.,I believe they've heard your talk.,Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us.,Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)There's actually a major health crisis today,in terms of the shortage of organs.,The fact is that we're living longer.,Medicine has done a much better job,of making us live longer,,and the problem is, as we age,,our organs tend to fail more,,and so currently,there are not enough organs to go around.,In fact, in the last 10 years,,the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,,while in the same time,,the actual number of transplants has barely gone up.,So this is now a public health crisis. 
 So that's where this field comes in,that we call the field of regenerative medicine.,It really involves many different areas.,You can use, actually, scaffolds,,biomaterials --,they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt --,but specific materials you can actually implant in patients,and they will do well and help you regenerate.,Or we can use cells alone,,either your very own cells,or different stem cell populations.,Or we can use both.,We can use, actually, biomaterials,and the cells together.,And that's where the field is today. 
 But it's actually not a new field.,Interestingly, this is a book,that was published back in 1938.,It's titled "The Culture of Organs.",The first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.,He actually devised some of the same technologies,used today for suturing blood vessels,,and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today,were actually designed by Alexis.,But I want you to note his co-author:,Charles Lindbergh.,That's the same Charles Lindbergh,who actually spent the rest of his life,working with Alexis,at the Rockefeller Institute in New York,in the area of the culture of organs. 
 So if the field's been around for so long,,why so few clinical advances?,And that really has to do to many different challenges.,But if I were to point to three challenges,,the first one is actually the design of materials,that could go in your body,and do well over time.,And many advances now,,we can do that fairly readily.,The second challenge was cells.,We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.,Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.,Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells.,Plus we have stem cells.,But even now, 2011,,there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.,Liver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells --,we still can't grow them even today.,And the third challenge is vascularity,,the actual supply of blood,to allow those organs or tissues to survive,once we regenerate them. 
 So we can actually use biomaterials now.,This is actually a biomaterial.,We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.,This is actually like a cotton candy machine.,You saw the spray going in.,That was like the fibers of the cotton candy,creating this structure, this tubularized structure,,which is a biomaterial,that we can then use,to help your body regenerate,using your very own cells to do so.,And that's exactly what we did here. 
 This is actually a patient,who [was] presented with a deceased organ,,and we then created one of these smart biomaterials,,and then we then used that smart biomaterial,to replace and repair,that patient's structure.,What we did was we actually,used the biomaterial as a bridge,so that the cells in the organ,could walk on that bridge, if you will,,and help to bridge the gap,to regenerate that tissue.,And you see that patient now six months after,with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,,which is fully regenerated,when you analyze it under the microscope.,We can also use cells alone.,These are actually cells that we obtained.,These are stem cells that we create from specific sources,,and we can drive them to become heart cells,,and they start beating in culture.,So they know what to do.,The cells genetically know what to do,,and they start beating together.,Now today, many clinical trials,are using different kinds of stem cells,for heart disease.,So that's actually now in patients. 
 Or if we're going to use larger structures,to replace larger structures,,we can then use the patient's own cells,,or some cell population,,and the biomaterials,,the scaffolds, together.,So the concept here:,so if you do have a deceased or injured organ,,we take a very small piece of that tissue,,less than half the size of a postage stamp.,We then tease the cells apart,,we grow the cells outside the body.,We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial --,again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt --,we then shape that material,,and we then use those cells to coat that material,one layer at a time --,very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.,We then place it in an oven-like device,,and we're able to create that structure,and bring it out.,This is actually a heart valve,that we've engineered,,and you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve,and we've seeded that with cells,,and then we exercise it.,So you see the leaflets opening and closing --,of this heart valve,that's currently being used experimentally,to try to get it to further studies. 
 Another technology,that we have used in patients,actually involves bladders.,We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient --,less than half the size of a postage stamp.,We then grow the cells outside the body,,take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells --,the patient's own cells, two different cell types.,We then put it in this oven-like device.,It has the same conditions as the human body --,37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.,A few weeks later, you have your engineered organ,that we're able to implant back into the patient.,For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.,We use three-dimensional imagining analysis,,but we actually created these biomaterials by hand. 
 But we now have better ways,to create these structures with the cells.,We use now some type of technologies,,where for solid organs, for example,,like the liver,,what we do is we take discard livers.,As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.,So we can take these liver structures,,which are not going to be used,,and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure,that will allow the cells to be washed away.,Two weeks later,,you have something that looks like a liver.,You can hold it like a liver,,but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.,And we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,,preserving the blood vessel tree.,So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree,with the patient's own blood vessel cells,,and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.,And we now have been able just to show,the creation of human liver tissue,just this past month,using this technology. 
 Another technology that we've used,is actually that of printing.,This is actually a desktop inkjet printer,,but instead of using ink,,we're using cells.,And you can actually see here the printhead,going through and printing this structure,,and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.,And there's a 3D elevator,that then actually goes down one layer at a time,each time the printhead goes through.,And then finally you're able to get that structure out.,You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.,And this is actually a piece of bone,that I'm going to show you in this slide,that was actually created with this desktop printer,and implanted as you see here.,That was all new bone that was implanted,using these techniques. 
 Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now,,our next generation of technologies,,are more sophisticated printers.,This particular printer we're designing now,is actually one where we print right on the patient.,So what you see here --,I know it sounds funny,,but that's the way it works.,Because in reality, what you want to do,is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,,and you have a scanner,,basically like a flatbed scanner.,That's what you see here on the right side.,You see a scanner technology,that first scans the wound on the patient,and then it comes back with the printheads,actually printing the layers that you require,on the patients themselves. 
 This is how it actually works.,Here's the scanner going through,,scanning the wound.,Once it's scanned,,it sends information in the correct layers of cells,where they need to be.,And now you're going to see here,a demo of this actually being done,in a representative wound.,And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.,So once those cells are on the patient,they will stick where they need to be.,And this is actually new technology,still under development. 
 We're also working on more sophisticated printers.,Because in reality, our biggest challenge,are the solid organs.,I don't know if you realize this,,but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list,are actually waiting for a kidney.,Patients are dying every day,because we don't have enough of those organs to go around.,So this is more challenging --,large organ, vascular,,a lot of blood vessel supply,,a lot of cells present.,So the strategy here is --,this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray --,and we go layer by layer,,using computerized morphometric imaging analysis,and 3D reconstruction,to get right down to those patient's own kidneys.,We then are able to actually image those,,do 360 degree rotation,to analyze the kidney,in its full volumetric characteristics,,and we then are able,to actually take this information,and then scan this,in a printing computerized form.,So we go layer by layer through the organ,,analyzing each layer as we go through the organ,,and we then are able to send that information, as you see here,,through the computer,and actually design the organ,for the patient.,This actually shows the actual printer.,And this actually shows that printing. 
 In fact, we actually have the printer right here.,So while we've been talking today,,you can actually see the printer,back here in the back stage.,That's actually the actual printer right now,,and that's been printing this kidney structure,that you see here.,It takes about seven hours to print a kidney,,so this is about three hours into it now.,And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,,and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys,that we printed a little bit earlier today.,Put a pair of gloves here.,Thank you.,Go backwards.,So, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.,You can actually see that kidney,as it was printed earlier today. 
 (Applause) 
 Has a little bit of consistency to it.,This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,,and part of our team.,Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it. 
 (Applause) 
 So this is actually a new generation.,This is actually the printer that you see here onstage.,And this is actually a new technology we're working on now.,In reality, we now have a long history of doing this.,I'm going to share with you a clip,in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while. 
 And this is actually a very brief clip --,only about 30 seconds --,of a patient who actually received an organ. 
 (Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.,I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.,I couldn't go out,and play basketball at recess,without feeling like I was going to pass out,when I got back inside.,I felt so sick.,I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,,and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like,if I was on that.,So after the surgery,,life got a lot better for me.,I was able to do more things.,I was able to wrestle in high school.,I became the captain of the team, and that was great.,I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.,And because they used my own cells to build this bladder,,it's going to be with me.,I've got it for life, so I'm all set. 
 (Applause) 
 Juan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,,and it's very cool when they do.,Luke, come up please. 
 (Applause) 
 So Luke, before last night,,when's the last time you saw Tony? 
 LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery --,and it's really great to see him. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing. 
 LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.,I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,,and basically trying to live life like a normal kid,,which I always wanted growing up.,But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida,and my kidneys and bladder weren't working.,I went through about 16 surgeries,,and it seemed impossible to do that,when I was in kidney failure when I was 10.,And this surgery came along,and basically made me who I am today,and saved my life. 
 (Applause) 
 JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these? 
 LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab,and coming up with crazy stuff.,I know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.,And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.,I was a little kid, and I was like,,"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery.",(Laughter),All I wanted to do was to get better,,and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older,and I see the amazing things that he's doing. 
 JE: When you got this call out of the blue --,Tony's really shy,,and it took a lot of convincing,to get somebody as modest as Tony,to allow us to bring Luke.,So Luke, you go to your communications professors --,you're majoring in communications --,and you ask them for permission to come to TED,,which might have a little bit to do with communications,,and what was their reaction? 
 LM: Most of my professors were all for it,,and they said, "Bring pictures,and show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you.",There were a couple that were a little stubborn,,but I had to talk to them.,I pulled them aside. 
 JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you.,Thank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.) 
 JE: Thank you, Tony. 
 (Applause)By birth and by choice,,I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life,,and for the past 30 years,,I've worked at Ford Motor Company.,And for most of those years,,I worried about,,how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?,But today I worry about,,what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?,What happens,when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,,or even quadruples? 
 My life is guided by two great passions,,and the first is automobiles.,I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.,I thought it was so cool as a little boy,when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln,and leave it in the driveway.,And I decided about that time, about age 10,,that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.,So my parents would go to dinner.,They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.,I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,,and it was a blast.,And that went on for about two years,,until -- I think I was about 12 --,my dad brought home,a Lincoln Mark III.,And it was snowing that day.,So he and mom went to dinner,,and I snuck out,and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts,or even some figure-eights in the snow.,My dad finished dinner early that evening.,And he was walking to the front hall,and out the front door,just about the same time I hit some ice,and met him at the front door with the car --,and almost ended up in the front hall.,So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.,But I really began to love cars then.,And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.,And even though the color was pretty hideous,,I did love the car,,and it really cemented my love affair with cars,that's continued on to this day. 
 But cars are really more than a passion of mine;,they're quite literally in my blood.,My great grandfather was Henry Ford,,and on my mother's side,,my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.,So when I was born,,I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.,But my great grandfather, Henry Ford,,really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company,was to make people's lives better,and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.,Because he believed that with mobility,comes freedom and progress.,And that's a belief that I share. 
 My other great passion is the environment.,And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan,and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in,and then later wrote about.,And it really struck me,as the years went by,,in a very negative way,,when I would go to some stream that I'd loved,,and was used to walking through this field,that was once filled with fireflies,,and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.,And so even at a young age,,that really resonated with me,,and the whole notion of environmental preservation,,at a very basic level, sunk in with me. 
 As a high-schooler, I started to read,authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold,and Edward Abbey,,and I really began to develop,a deeper appreciation of the natural world.,But it never really occurred to me,that my love of cars and trucks,would ever be in conflict with nature.,And that was true,until I got to college.,And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise,when I would go to class,and a number of my professors would say,that Ford Motor Company and my family,was everything that was wrong with our country.,They thought that we were more interested, as an industry,,in profits, rather than progress,,and that we filled the skies with smog --,and frankly, we were the enemy. 
 I joined Ford after college,,after some soul searching,whether or not this is really the right thing to do.,But I decided that I wanted to go,and see if I could affect change there.,And as I look back over 30 years ago,,it was a little naive to think at that age,that I could. But I wanted to.,And I really discovered,that my professors weren't completely wrong.,In fact, when I got back to Detroit,,my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced,by those in my own company,,and certainly by those in the industry.,I had some very interesting conversations,,as you can imagine.,There were some within Ford,who believed that all this ecological nonsense,should just disappear,and that I needed to stop hanging out,with "environmental wackos.",I was considered a radical.,And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management,and told to stop associating,with any known or suspected environmentalists.,(Laughter),Of course, I had no intention of doing that,,and I kept speaking out about the environment,,and it really was the topic,that we now today call sustainability.,And in time, my views went from controversial,to more or less consensus today.,I mean, I think most people in the industry,understand that we've got to get on with it. 
 And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,,of cars and the environment --,not only at Ford, but really as an industry.,We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.,And with new technology,,we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate --,CO2 emissions.,We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.,We're developing alternative powertrains,that are going to make cars affordable,in every sense of the word --,economically, socially,and environmentally.,And actually, although we've got a long way to go,and a lot of work to do,,I can see the day where my two great passions --,cars and the environment --,actually come into harmony. 
 But unfortunately,,as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem --,and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do,,but I can see where we will --,but even as we're in the process of doing that,,another huge problem is looming,,and people aren't noticing.,And that is the freedom of mobility,that my great grandfather brought to people,is now being threatened, just as the environment is.,The problem, put in its simplest terms,,is one of mathematics.,Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,,and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow,to about nine billion.,And at that population level,,our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.,And with that growth,comes some severe practical problems,,one of which is our transportation system,simply won't be able to deal with it. 
 When we look at the population growth in terms of cars,,it becomes even clearer.,Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.,But with more people,and greater prosperity around the world,,that number's going to grow,to between two and four billion cars by mid century.,And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock,that the world has never seen before.,Now think about the impact,that this is going to have on our daily lives.,Today the average American,spends about a week a year,stuck in traffic jams,,and that's a huge waste of time and resources.,But that's nothing compared,to what's going on,in the nations that are growing the fastest.,Today the average driver in Beijing,has a five-hour commute.,And last summer -- many of you probably saw this --,there was a hundred-mile traffic jam,that took 11 days to clear in China.,In the decades to come,,75 percent of the world's population,will live in cities,,and 50 of those cities,will be of 10 million people or more. 
 So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.,When you factor in population growth,,it's clear that the mobility model that we have today,simply will not work tomorrow.,Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road,are still four billion cars,,and a traffic jam with no emissions,is still a traffic jam.,So, if we make no changes today,,what does tomorrow look like?,Well I think you probably already have the picture.,Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,,and they're really very, very inconvenient,,but that's all they are.,But the bigger issue,is that global gridlock,is going to stifle economic growth,and our ability to deliver,food and health care,,particularly to people that live in city centers.,And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.,So what's going to solve this? 
 Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same.,My great grandfather once said,before he invented the Model T,,"If I had asked people then what they wanted,,they would have answered,,'We want faster horses.'",So the answer to more cars,is simply not to have more roads.,When America began moving west,,we didn't add more wagon trains,,we built railroads.,And to connect our country after World War II,,we didn't build more two-lane highways,,we built the interstate highway system.,Today we need that same leap in thinking,for us to create a viable future.,We are going to build smart cars,,but we also need to build,smart roads, smart parking,,smart public transportation systems and more.,We don't want to waste our time,sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths,or looking for parking spots.,We need an integrated system,that uses real time data,to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale,without hassle or compromises for travelers.,And frankly, that's the kind of system,that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. 
 Now the good news is some of this work has already begun,in different parts of the world.,The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi,uses driverless electric vehicles,that can communicate with one another,,and they go underneath the city streets.,And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.,On New York City's 34th Street,,gridlock will soon be replaced,with a connected system,of vehicle-specific corridors.,Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,,and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute,to get across town in New York,from about an hour today at rush hour,to about 20 minutes.,Now if you look at Hong Kong,,they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.,It's a system that really ties together,all the transportation assets,into a single payment system.,So parking garages, buses, trains,,they all operate within the same system.,Now shared car services,are also springing up around the world,,and these efforts, I think, are great.,They're relieving congestion,,and they're frankly starting to save some fuel. 
 These are all really good ideas,that will move us forward.,But what really inspires me,is what's going to be possible,when our cars can begin talking to each other.,Very soon, the same systems that we use today,to bring music and entertainment,and GPS information into our vehicles,are going to be used to create,a smart vehicle network.,Every morning I drive about 30 miles,from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.,And every night I go home,,my commute is a total crapshoot.,And I often have to leave the freeway,and look for different ways,for me to try and make it home.,But very soon we're going to see the days,when cars are essentially talking to each other.,So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,,it will immediately alert my car,and tell my car to reroute itself,to get me home in the best possible way.,And these systems are being tested right now,,and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon. 
 But the potential of a connected car network,is almost limitless.,So just imagine:,one day very soon,,you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown,and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.,So you get in your car,,and as you get in your car,,your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive --,no more driving around looking for one,,which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel,in today's cars in urban areas --,is looking for parking spots.,Or think about being in New York City,and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone,so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.,Or being at a future TED Conference,and having your car,talk to the calendars of everybody here,and telling you all the best route to take home,and when you should leave,so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.,This is the kind of technology,that will merge millions of individual vehicles,into a single system. 
 So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution,to this enormous problem.,But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,,and also fossil fuels,,there is no one silver bullet.,The solution is not going to be,more cars, more roads or a new rail system;,it can only be found, I believe,,in a global network,of interconnected solutions.,Now I know we can develop the technology,that's going to make this work,,but we've got to be willing to get out there,and seek out the solutions --,whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation,or some other way we haven't even thought of yet;,our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure,must support all the future options. 
 We need our best and our brightest,to start entertaining this issue.,Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,,they all need to understand,this is a huge business opportunity,,as well as an enormous social problem.,And just as these groups,embrace the green energy challenge --,and it's really been amazing to me to watch,how much brain power, how much money,and how much serious thought,has, really over the last three years,,just poured into the green energy field.,We need that same kind of passion and energy,to attack global gridlock.,But we need people like all of you in this room,,leading thinkers.,I mean, frankly, I need all of you,to think about how,you can help solve this huge issue.,And we need people from all walks of life;,not just inventors, we need policymakers,and government officials,to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge. 
 This isn't going to be solved,by any one person or one group.,It's going to really require a national energy policy,,frankly for each country,,because the solutions in each country are going to be different,based upon income levels, traffic jams,and also how integrated,the systems already are.,But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.,And we must have an infrastructure,that's designed to support,this flexible future. 
 You know, we've come a long way.,Since the Model T,,most people never traveled,more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.,And since then,,the automobile has allowed us the freedom,to choose where we live, where we work,,where we play,and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.,We don't want to regress and lose that freedom.,We're on our way to solving --,and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go --,the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it,,and that's the environmental issue,,but I believe we all must turn,all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination,to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.,Because in doing so,,we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted,,which is the freedom to move,and move very effortlessly around the world.,And it frankly will enhance our quality of life,if we fix this.,Because, if you can envision, as I do,,a future of zero emissions,and freedom to move around the country and around the world,like we take for granted today,,that's worth the hard work today,to preserve that for tomorrow. 
 I believe we're at our best,when we're confronted with big issues.,This is a big one, and it won't wait.,So let's get started now. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Well, this is about state budgets.,This is probably the most boring topic,of the whole morning.,But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic,that we need to care about.,State budgets,are big, big money --,I'll show you the numbers --,and they get very little scrutiny.,The understanding is very low.,Many of the people involved,have special interests or short-term interests,that get them not thinking,about what the implications of the trends are.,And these budgets,are the key for our future;,they're the key for our kids.,Most education funding --,whether it's K through 12,,or the great universities or community colleges --,most of the money for those things,is coming out of these state budgets. 
 But we have a problem.,Here's the overall picture.,U.S. economy is big --,14.7 trillion.,Now out of that pie,,the government spends 36 percent.,So this is combining the federal level,,which is the largest,,the state level and the local level.,And it's really in this combined way,that you get an overall sense of what's going on,,because there's a lot of complex things,like Medicaid and research money,that flow across those boundaries.,But we're spending 36 percent.,Well what are we taking in?,Simple business question.,Answer is 26 percent.,Now this leaves 10 percent deficit,,sort of a mind-blowing number.,And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact,that we've had an economic recession.,Receipts go down,,some spending programs go up,,but most of it is not because of that.,Most of it is because of ways,that the liabilities are building up,and the trends,,and that creates a huge challenge.,In fact, this is the forecast picture.,There are various things in here:,I could say we might raise more revenue,,or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.,It is an increasingly difficult picture,,even assuming the economy does quite well --,probably better than it will do.,This is what you see,at this overall level. 
 Now how did we get here?,How could you have a problem like this?,After all, at least on paper,,there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.,Only one state says,they don't have to balance the budget.,But what this means actually,is that there's a pretense.,There's no real, true balancing going on,,and in a sense, the games they play to hide that,actually obscure the topic so much,that people don't see things,that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.,When Jerry Brown was elected,,this was the challenge that was put to him.,That is, through various gimmicks and things,,a so-called balanced budget,had led him to have 25 billion missing,out of the 76 billion in proposed spending.,Now he's put together some thoughts:,About half of that he'll cut,,another half,,perhaps in a very complex set of steps,,taxes will be approved.,But even so,,as you go out into those future years,,various pension costs, health costs go up enough,,and the revenue does not go up enough.,So you get a big squeeze. 
 What were those things that allowed us to hide this?,Well, some really nice little tricks.,And these were somewhat noticed.,The paper said, "It's not really balanced.,It's got holes.,It perpetuates deficit spending.,It's riddled with gimmicks.",And really when you get down to it,,the guys at Enron never would have done this.,This is so blatant,,so extreme.,Is anyone paying attention,to some of the things these guys do?,They borrow money.,They're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.,They make you pay more in withholding,just to help their cash flow out.,They sell off the assets.,They defer the payments.,They sell off the revenues from tobacco.,And California's not unique.,In fact, there's about five states that are worse,and only really four states,that don't face this big challenge.,So it's systemic across the entire country.,It really comes from the fact,that certain long-term obligations --,health care, where innovation makes it more expensive,,early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,,and just generosity --,that these mis-accounting things,allow to develop over time,,that you've got a problem.,This is the retiree health care benefits.,Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability --,much worse than the car companies.,And everybody looked at that,and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.,The forecast for the medical piece alone,is to go from 26 percent of the budget,to 42 percent. 
 Well what's going to give?,Well in order to accommodate that,,you would have to cut education spending in half.,It really is this young versus the old,to some degree.,If you don't change that revenue picture,,if you don't solve what you're doing in health care,,you're going to be deinvesting in the young.,The great University of California university system,,the great things that have gone on,,won't happen.,So far it's meant layoffs,,increased class sizes.,Within the education community there's this discussion of,,"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,,or the less good teachers who get laid off?",And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,,where do you do that? How much effect does that have?,And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,,well maybe you think that's okay.,In fact, no, education spending should not be cut.,There's ways, if it's temporary,,to minimize the impact,,but it's a problem.,It's also really a problem for where we need to go.,Technology has a role to play.,Well we need money to experiment with that,,to get those tools in there.,There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,,measuring them, giving them feedback,,taking videos in the classroom.,That's something I think is very, very important.,Well you have to allocate dollars,for that system,and for that incentive pay.,In a situation where you have growth,,you put the new money into this.,Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.,But with the type of cuts we're talking about,,it will be far, far harder,to get these incentives for excellence,,or to move over,to use technology in the new way. 
 So what's going on?,Where's the brain trust,that's in error here?,Well there really is no brain trust.,(Laughter),It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.,Just look at this spending.,California will spend over 100 billion,,Microsoft, 38,,Google, about 19.,The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,,both inside Google and Microsoft,and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions --,should they have spent on that?,No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? --,it really is quite phenomenal.,Everybody has an opinion.,There's great feedback.,And the numbers are used to make decisions.,If you go over the education spending and the health care spending --,particularly these long-term trends --,you don't have that type of involvement,on a number that's more important,in terms of equity, in terms of learning. 
 So what do we need to do?,We need better tools.,We can get some things out on the Internet.,I'm going to use my website,to put up some things that will give the basic picture.,We need lots more.,There's a few good books,,one about school spending and where the money comes from --,how that's changed over time, and the challenge.,We need better accounting.,We need to take the fact,that the current employees, the future liabilities they create,,that should come out of the current budget.,We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting,the way they have.,It should be more like private accounting.,It's the gold standard.,And finally, we need to really reward politicians.,Whenever they say there's these long-term problems,,we can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?,We just shot you.",In fact, there are some like these:,Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,,who have gone through and given proposals,for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.,But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.,In fact, the week afterwards,,some tax cuts were done,that made the situation even worse,than their assumptions.,So we need these pieces. 
 Now I think this is a solvable problem.,It's a great country with lots of people.,But we have to draw those people in,,because this is about education.,And just look at what happened with the tuitions,with the University of California,and project that out for another three, four, five years --,it's unaffordable.,And that's the kind of thing --,the investment in the young --,that makes us great, allows us to contribute.,It allows us to do the art,,the biotechnology, the software,and all those magic things.,And so the bottom line is,we need to care about state budgets,because they're critical for our kids and our future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to share with you,over the next 18 minutes,a pretty incredible idea.,Actually, it's a really big idea.,But to get us started,,I want to ask if everyone,could just close your eyes for two seconds,and try and think of a technology or a bit of science,that you think has changed the world.,Now I bet, in this audience,,you're thinking of some really incredible technology,,some stuff that I haven't even heard of,,I'm absolutely sure.,But I'm also sure, pretty sure,,that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.,This is a polio vaccine. 
 And it's a great thing actually,that nobody's had to think about it here today,because it means that we can take this for granted.,This is a great technology.,We can take it completely for granted.,But it wasn't always that way.,Even here in California,,if we were to go back just a few years,,it was a very different story.,People were terrified of this disease.,They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.,And it was because of scenes like this.,In this scene,,people are living in an iron lung.,These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,,and then two days later,,they can no longer breathe,,and this polio virus has paralyzed,not only their arms and their legs,,but also their breathing muscles.,And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,,in this iron lung to breathe for them. 
 This disease was terrifying.,There was no cure,,and there was no vaccine.,The disease was so terrifying,that the president of the United States,launched an extraordinary national effort,to find a way to stop it.,Twenty years later, they succeeded,and developed the polio vaccine.,It was hailed as a scientific miracle,in the late 1950s.,Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,,and here in the United States,it had an incredible impact.,As you can see, the virus stopped,,and it stopped very, very fast. 
 But this wasn't the case,everywhere in the world.,And it happened so fast in the United States, however,,that even just last month Jon Stewart said this: 
 (Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?,Because I thought that had been eradicated,in the way that smallpox had been eradicated. 
 Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.,But the reality is,that polio still exists today.,We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.,This is the picture.,There's not very much left in the world.,But the reason there's not very much left,is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership,working behind the scenes, almost unknown,,I'm sure to most of you here today.,It's been working for 20 years,to try and eradicate this disease,,and it's got it down to these few cases,that you can see here on this graphic. 
 But just last year,,we had an incredible shock,and realized that almost just isn't good enough,with a virus like polio.,And this is the reason:,in two countries,that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade,,on opposite sides of the globe,,there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.,Hundreds of people were paralyzed.,Hundreds of people died --,children as well as adults.,And in both cases,,we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,,and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.,They had come from thousands of miles away.,And in one case, it originated on another continent.,And not only that, but when they came into these countries,,then they got on commercial jetliners probably,and they traveled even farther,to other places like Russia,,where, for the first time in over a decade last year,,children were crippled and paralyzed,by a disease that they had not seen for years. 
 Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you,,these are under control now,,and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.,But the message was very clear.,Polio is still,a devastating, explosive disease.,It's just happening in another part of the world.,And our big idea,is that the scientific miracle of this decade,should be the complete eradication,of poliomyelitis. 
 So I want to tell you a little bit,about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,,is trying to do.,We're not trying to control polio.,We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases,,because this disease is like a root fire;,it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.,So what we're looking for,is a permanent solution.,We want a world in which every child, just like you guys,,can take for granted,a polio-free world.,So we're looking for a permanent solution,,and this is where we get lucky.,This is one of the very few viruses in the world,where there are big enough cracks in its armor,that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.,This virus can only survive in people.,It can't live for a very long time in people.,It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.,And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.,So we are trying,to wipe out this virus completely.,What the polio eradication program is trying to do,is to kill the virus itself,that causes polio,everywhere on Earth. 
 Now we don't have a great track record,when it comes to doing something like this,,to eradicating diseases.,It's been tried six times in the last century,,and it's been successful exactly once.,And this is because disease eradication,,it's still the venture capital of public health.,The risks are massive,,but the pay-off --,economic, humanitarian, motivational --,it's absolutely huge.,One congressman here in the United States,thinks that the entire investment,that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication,pays itself off every 26 days --,in foregone treatment costs,and vaccination costs.,And if we can finish polio eradication,,the poorest countries in the world,are going to save over 50 billion dollars,in the next 25 years alone.,So those are the kind of stakes that we're after. 
 But smallpox eradication was hard;,it was very, very hard.,And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,,and there's a few reasons for that.,The first is that,,when we started trying to eradicate polio,about 20 years ago,,more than twice as many countries were infected,than had been when we started off with smallpox.,And there were more than 10 times as many people,living in these countries.,So it was a massive effort.,The second challenge we had was --,in contrast to the smallpox vaccine,,which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life --,the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.,It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics,that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor,on every single vial,so that it will change very quickly,when it's exposed to too much heat,,and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child --,it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.,Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine. 
 But the third challenge we have --,and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge --,is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy --,every single person almost who was infected with smallpox,had this telltale rash.,So you could get around the disease;,you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.,With polio it's almost completely different.,The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus,show absolutely no sign of the disease.,So you can't see the enemy most of the time,,and as a result,,we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio,than what was done with smallpox. 
 We've had to create,one of the largest social movements in history.,There's over 10 million people,,probably 20 million people,,largely volunteers,,who have been working over the last 20 years,in what has now been called,the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.,These people, these 20 million people,,vaccinate over 500 million children,every single year,,multiple times,at the peak of our operation.,Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.,It's just two drops, like that.,But reaching 500 million people,is much, much tougher.,And these vaccinators, these volunteers,,they have got to dive headlong,into some of the toughest, densest,urban slums in the world.,They've got to trek under sweltering suns,to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.,And they also have to dodge bullets,,because we have got to operate,during shaky cease-fires and truces,to try and vaccinate children,,even in areas affected by conflict. 
 One reporter,who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago --,a place which has eradicated polio,,not once, but twice, because they got reinfected.,He was sitting outside of the road,,watching one of these polio campaigns unfold,,and a few months later he wrote:,"This is foreign aid at its most heroic.",And these heroes, they come from every walk of life,,all sorts of backgrounds.,But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.,This is a group,whose million-strong army of volunteers,have been working to eradicate polio,for over 20 years.,They're right at the center of the whole thing. 
 Now it took years to build up the infrastructure,for polio eradication --,more than 15 years, much longer than it should have --,but once it was built, the results were striking.,Within a couple of years,,every country that started polio eradication,rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,,with the exception of four countries that you see here.,And in each of those, it was only part of the country.,And then, by 1999,,one of the three polio viruses,that we were trying to eradicate,had been completely eradicated worldwide --,proof of concept.,And then today,,there's been a 99 percent reduction --,greater than 99 percent reduction --,in the number of children,who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.,When we started, over 20 years ago,,1,000 children were being paralyzed,every single day by this virus.,Last year, it was 1,000. 
 And at the same time,,the polio eradication program,has been working to help with a lot of other areas.,It's been working to help control pandemic flu,,SARS for example.,It's also tried to save children by doing other things --,giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,,giving bed nets against malaria even,during some of these campaigns.,But the most exciting thing,that the polio eradication program has been doing,has been to force us,,the international community,,to reach every single child, every single community,,the most vulnerable people in the world,,with the most basic of health services,,irrespective of geography, poverty,,culture and even conflict. 
 So things were looking very exciting,,and then about five years ago,,this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.,The first problem we ran into,was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,,we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.,And then to make the matters even worse,,the virus started to spread out of these four places,,especially northern India and northern Nigeria,,into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,,causing horrific outbreaks,in places that had not seen this disease for decades.,And then,,in one of the most important, tenacious,and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,,we found that our vaccine was working,half as well as it should have.,In conditions like this,,the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to,in the guts of these children,and protect them the way that it needed to. 
 Now at that time,,there was a great, as you can imagine,,frustration -- let's call it frustration --,it started to grow very, very quickly.,And all of a sudden, some very important voices,in the world of public health,started to say, "Hang on.,We should abandon this idea of eradication.,Let's settle for control -- that's good enough.",Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds,,it's a false premise.,The brutal truth is,,if we don't have the will or the skill,,or even the money that we need,to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world,,with something as simple,as an oral polio vaccine,,then pretty soon,,more than 200,000 children,are again going to be paralyzed by this disease,every single year.,There's absolutely no question. 
 These are children like Umar.,Umar is seven years old,,and he's from northern Nigeria.,He lives in a family home there,with his eight brothers and sisters.,Umar also has polio.,Umar was paralyzed for life.,His right leg was paralyzed,in 2004.,This leg, his right leg,,now takes an awful beating,because he has to half-crawl,,because it's faster to move that way,to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters,,than to get up on his crutches and walk.,But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.,As you probably can't see the detail here,,but this is his report card,,and you'll see, he's got perfect scores.,He got 100 percent in all the important things,,like nursery rhymes, for example there.,But you know I'd love to be able to tell you,that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days,,but it's not true.,Umar is an exceptional kid,in exceptional circumstances. 
 The reality of polio today,is something very different.,Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world.,It leaves their children paralyzed,,and it drags their families,deeper into poverty,,because they're desperately searching,and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have,,trying in vain,to find a cure for their children.,We think children deserve better.,And so when the going got really tough,in the polio eradication program,about two years ago,,when people were saying, "We should call it off,",the Polio Partnership,decided to buckle down once again,and try and find innovative new solutions,,new ways to get to the children,that we were missing again and again. 
 In northern India, we started mapping the cases,using satellite imaging like this,,so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters,,so we could get to the millions of children,on the Koshi River basin,where there are no other health services.,In northern Nigeria,,the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders,,they got directly involved in the program,to help solve the problems of logistics,and community confidence. 
 And now they've even started using these devices --,speaking of cool technology --,these little devices, little GIS trackers like this,,which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.,And then they can track them,,and at the end of the day, they look and see,,did these guys get every single street, every single house.,This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing,to try and reach all of the children we've been missing.,And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches --,access negotiators.,We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross,to ensure that we can reach every child. 
 But as we tried these extraordinary things,,as people went to this trouble,to try and rework their tactics,,we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine --,and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine,,so that when they finally get to these kids,,we can have a better bang for our buck.,And this started an incredible collaboration with industry,,and within six months,,we were testing a new polio vaccine,that targeted, just two years ago,,the last two types of polio in the world.,Now June the ninth, 2009,,we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine,,and it turned out to be a game-changer.,The new vaccine,had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses,as the old vaccine had,,and we immediately started using this.,Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.,And it started rolling off the production lines,and into the mouths of children around the world.,And we didn't start with the easy places.,The first place this vaccine was used,was in southern Afghanistan,,because it's in places like that,where kids are going to benefit the most,from technologies like this. 
 Now here at TED, over the last couple of days,,I've seen people challenging the audience again and again,to believe in the impossible.,So this morning at about seven o'clock,,I decided that we'd try to drive Chris,and the production crew here berserk,by downloading all of our data from India again,,so that you could see something,that's just unfolding today,,which proves that the impossible is possible.,And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.,Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm,when it comes to polio.,Over 500,000 children,are born in the two states that have never stopped polio --,Uttar Pradesh and Bihar --,500,000 children every single month.,Sanitation is terrible,,and our old vaccine, you remember,,worked half as well as it should have.,And yet, the impossible is happening.,Today marks exactly six months --,and for the first time in history,,not a single child has been paralyzed,in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. 
 (Applause) 
 India's not unique.,In Umar's home country of Nigeria,,a 95 percent reduction,in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.,And in the last six months,,we've had less places reinfected by polio,than at any other time in history. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination,of smart people, smart technology,and smart investments,,polio can now be eradicated anywhere.,We have major challenges, you can imagine,,to finish this job,,but as you've also seen,,it's doable,,it has great secondary benefits,,and polio eradication is a great buy.,And as long as any child anywhere,is paralyzed by this virus,,it's a stark reminder,that we are failing, as a society, to reach children,with the most basic of services.,And for that reason, polio eradication:,it's the ultimate in equity,and it's the ultimate in social justice.,The huge social movement,that's been involved in polio eradication,is ready to do way more for these children.,It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.,But capitalizing on their enthusiasm,,capitalizing on their energy,means finishing the job,that they started 20 years ago. 
 Finishing polio is a smart thing to do,,and it's the right thing to do.,Now we're in tough times economically.,But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom,said about a month ago when he was talking about polio,,"There's never a wrong time,to do the right thing.",Finishing polio eradication,is the right thing to do.,And we are at a crossroads right now,in this great effort over the last 20 years.,We have a new vaccine,,we have new resolve,,and we have new tactics.,We have the chance,to write an entirely new polio-free chapter,in human history.,But if we blink now,,we will lose forever,the chance to eradicate an ancient disease.,Here's a great idea to spread:,End polio now.,Help us tell the story.,Help us build the momentum,so that very soon,every child, every parent,everywhere,can also take for granted,a polio-free life forever. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be?,Where would you say we need to be the smartest? 
 BA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped --,northern Nigeria, northern India,,the southern corner of Afghanistan,and bordering areas of Pakistan --,they're going to be the toughest.,But the interesting thing is, of those three,,India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.,And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think,has probably stopped polio repeatedly.,It keeps getting reinfected.,So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished,and getting Pakistan finished.,They're going to be the tough ones. 
 BG: Now what about the money?,Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.,And is it easy to raise that money?,And what's it going to be like the next couple of years? 
 BA: It's interesting.,We spend right now about 750 million,to 800 million dollars a year.,That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.,It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.,But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times --,20, 30 cents to reach a child --,that's not very much money.,But right now we don't have enough of that.,We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners,,and every time we cut corners,,more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.,And that great buy costs us a little bit more. 
 BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out,,and the governments will keep their generosity up.,So good luck. We're all in this with you.,Thank you. (BA: Thank you.) 
 (Applause)As an artist,,connection is very important to me.,Through my work I'm trying to articulate,that humans are not separate from nature,and that everything is interconnected.,I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,,where I saw my first icebergs.,I was in awe.,My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,,trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.,The icebergs around me,were almost 200 feet out of the water,,and I could only help but wonder,that this was one snowflake,on top of another snowflake,,year after year. 
 Icebergs are born,when they calve off of glaciers,or break off of ice shelves.,Each iceberg has its own individual personality.,They have a distinct way,of interacting with their environment,and their experiences.,Some refuse to give up,and hold on to the bitter end,,while others can't take it anymore,and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion. 
 It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,,that they're isolated,,that they're separate and alone,,much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.,But the reality is far from it.,As an iceberg melts,,I am breathing in,its ancient atmosphere.,As the iceberg melts,,it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water,that nourishes many forms of life. 
 I approach photographing these icebergs,as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,,knowing that in these individual moments,they exist in that way,and will never exist that way again.,It is not a death when they melt;,it is not an end,,but a continuation,of their path through the cycle of life.,Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --,a couple thousand years old.,And some of the ice,is over 100,000 years old. 
 The last pictures I'd like to show you,are of an iceberg that I photographed,in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.,It's a very rare occasion,that you get to actually witness,an iceberg rolling.,So here it is.,You can see on the left side a small boat.,That's about a 15-foot boat.,And I'd like you to pay attention,to the shape of the iceberg,and where it is at the waterline.,You can see here, it begins to roll,,and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.,This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.,It's about 120 feet above the water,,or 40 meters.,And this video is real time. 
 (Music) 
 And just like that,,the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a savant,,or more precisely,,a high-functioning,autistic savant.,It's a rare condition.,And rarer still when accompanied,,as in my case,,by self-awareness,and a mastery of language.,Very often when I meet someone,and they learn this about me,,there's a certain kind of awkwardness.,I can see it in their eyes.,They want to ask me something.,And in the end, quite often,,the urge is stronger than they are,and they blurt it out:,"If I give you my date of birth,,can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?",(Laughter),Or they mention cube roots,or ask me to recite a long number or long text.,I hope you'll forgive me,if I don't perform,a kind of one-man savant show for you today.,I'm going to talk instead,about something,far more interesting,than dates of birth or cube roots --,a little deeper,and a lot closer, to my mind, than work. 
 I want to talk to you briefly,about perception.,When he was writing the plays and the short stories,that would make his name,,Anton Chekhov kept a notebook,in which he noted down,his observations,of the world around him --,little details,that other people seem to miss.,Every time I read Chekhov,and his unique vision of human life,,I'm reminded of why I too,became a writer.,In my books,,I explore the nature of perception,and how different kinds of perceiving,create different kinds of knowing,and understanding. 
 Here are three questions,drawn from my work.,Rather than try to figure them out,,I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment,the intuitions,and the gut instincts,that are going through your head and your heart,as you look at them.,For example, the calculation:,can you feel where on the number line,the solution is likely to fall?,Or look at the foreign word and the sounds:,can you get a sense of the range of meanings,that it's pointing you towards?,And in terms of the line of poetry,,why does the poet use the word hare,rather than rabbit?,I'm asking you to do this,because I believe our personal perceptions, you see,,are at the heart,of how we acquire knowledge.,Aesthetic judgments,,rather than abstract reasoning,,guide and shape the process,by which we all come to know,what we know.,I'm an extreme example of this. 
 My worlds of words and numbers,blur with color, emotion,and personality.,As Juan said,,it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia,,an unusual cross-talk,between the senses.,Here are the numbers one to 12,as I see them --,every number with its own shape and character.,One is a flash of white light.,Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.,The sketches are in black and white here,,but in my mind they have colors.,Three is green.,Four is blue.,Five is yellow. 
 I paint as well.,And here is one of my paintings.,It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.,Three-dimensional shapes,and the space they create in the middle,creates a new shape,,the answer to the sum.,What about bigger numbers?,Well you can't get much bigger than Pi,,the mathematical constant.,It's an infinite number --,literally goes on forever.,In this painting that I made,of the first 20 decimals of Pi,,I take the colors,and the emotions and the textures,and I pull them all together,into a kind of rolling numerical landscape. 
 But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.,Words too, for me,,have colors and emotions,and textures.,And this is an opening phrase,from the novel "Lolita.",And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.,And you can see here,how my perception of the sound L,helps the alliteration,to jump right out.,Another example:,a little bit more mathematical.,And I wonder if some of you will notice,the construction of the sentence,from "The Great Gatsby.",There is a procession of syllables --,wheat, one;,prairies, two;,lost Swede towns, three --,one, two, three.,And this effect is very pleasant on the mind,,and it helps the sentence,to feel right. 
 Let's go back to the questions,I posed you a moment ago.,64 multiplied by 75.,If some of you play chess,,you'll know that 64,is a square number,,and that's why chessboards,,eight by eight,,have 64 squares.,So that gives us a form,that we can picture, that we can perceive.,What about 75?,Well if 100,,if we think of 100 as being like a square,,75 would look like this.,So what we need to do now,is put those two pictures,together in our mind --,something like this.,64 becomes 6,400.,And in the right-hand corner,,you don't have to calculate anything.,Four across, four up and down --,it's 16.,So what the sum is actually asking you to do,is 16,,16, 16.,That's a lot easier,than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.,It's 16, 16, 16, 48,,4,800 --,4,800,,the answer to the sum.,Easy when you know how. 
 (Laughter) 
 The second question was an Icelandic word.,I'm assuming there are not many people here,who speak Icelandic.,So let me narrow the choices down to two.,Hnugginn:,is it a happy word,,or a sad word?,What do you say?,Okay.,Some people say it's happy.,Most people, a majority of people,,say sad.,And it actually means sad.,(Laughter),Why do, statistically,,a majority of people,say that a word is sad, in this case,,heavy in other cases?,In my theory, language evolves in such a way,that sounds match,,correspond with, the subjective,,with the personal,,intuitive experience,of the listener. 
 Let's have a look at the third question.,It's a line from a poem by John Keats.,Words, like numbers,,express fundamental relationships,between objects,and events and forces,that constitute our world.,It stands to reason that we, existing in this world,,should in the course of our lives,absorb intuitively those relationships.,And poets, like other artists,,play with those intuitive understandings.,In the case of hare,,it's an ambiguous sound in English.,It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.,And if we think of that --,let me put the picture up --,the fibers represent vulnerability.,They yield to the slightest movement,or motion or emotion.,So what you have is an atmosphere,of vulnerability and tension.,The hare itself, the animal --,not a cat, not a dog, a hare --,why a hare?,Because think of the picture --,not the word, the picture.,The overlong ears,,the overlarge feet,,helps us to picture, to feel intuitively,,what it means to limp,and to tremble. 
 So in these few minutes,,I hope I've been able to share,a little bit of my vision of things,and to show you,that words can have colors and emotions,,numbers, shapes and personalities.,The world is richer,,vaster,than it too often seems to be.,I hope that I've given you the desire,to learn to see the world with new eyes. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Think about your day for a second.,You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door,,encountered new colleagues and had great discussions,,and felt in awe when you found something new.,But I bet there's something you didn't think about today --,something so close to home,that you probably don't think about it very often at all.,And that's that all the sensations, feelings,,decisions and actions,are mediated by the computer in your head,called the brain. 
 Now the brain may not look like much from the outside --,a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,,amorphous --,but the last hundred years of neuroscience,have allowed us to zoom in on the brain,,and to see the intricacy of what lies within.,And they've told us that this brain,is an incredibly complicated circuit,made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.,Now unlike a human-designed computer,,where there's a fairly small number of different parts --,we know how they work, because we humans designed them --,the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells,,maybe tens of thousands.,They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules.,And they project and connect to different brain regions,,and they also change different ways in different disease states. 
 Let's make it concrete.,There's a class of cells,,a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.,It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.,It's called the basket cell.,And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell,that we are learning about.,New ones are being discovered everyday.,As just a second example:,these pyramidal cells, large cells,,they can span a significant fraction of the brain.,They're excitatory.,And these are some of the cells,that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.,Every one of these cells,is an incredible electrical device.,They receive input from thousands of upstream partners,and compute their own electrical outputs,,which then, if they pass a certain threshold,,will go to thousands of downstream partners.,And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so,,happens thousands of times a minute,in every one of your 100 billion cells,,as long as you live,and think and feel. 
 So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?,Ideally, we could go through the circuit,and turn these different kinds of cell on and off,and see whether we could figure out,which ones contribute to certain functions,and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.,If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash,,what they can initiate and sustain.,If we could turn them off,,then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.,And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today.,And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years,,through an attempt to find ways,of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain,on and off,,both to understand the science,and also to confront some of the issues,that face us all as humans. 
 Now before I tell you about the technology,,the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room,,if we live long enough,,will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.,Already, a billion people,have had some kind of brain disorder,that incapacitates them,,and the numbers don't do it justice though.,These disorders -- schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,,depression, addiction --,they not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.,They take our identity and change our emotions,and change who we are as people.,Now in the 20th century,,there was some hope that was generated,through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders,,and while many drugs have been developed,that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders,,practically none of them can be considered to be cured.,And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical.,This elaborate circuit,made out of thousands of different kinds of cell,is being bathed in a substance.,That's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market,can present some kind of serious side effect too. 
 Now some people have gotten some solace,from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.,And for Parkinson's disease,,Cochlear implants,,these have indeed been able,to bring some kind of remedy,to people with certain kinds of disorder.,But electricity also will go in all directions --,the path of least resistance,,which is where that phrase, in part, comes from.,And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.,So again, we're sent back to the idea,of ultra-precise control.,Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go? 
 So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago,,I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist,,and the first thing I thought about was,,if these neurons are electrical devices,,all we need to do is to find some way,of driving those electrical changes at a distance.,If we could turn on the electricity in one cell,,but not its neighbors,,that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells,,figure out what they do and how they contribute,to the networks in which they're embedded.,And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need,in order to fix the circuit computations,that have gone awry.,Now how are we going to do that?,Well there are many molecules that exist in nature,,which are able to convert light into electricity.,You can think of them as little proteins,that are like solar cells.,If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow,,then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.,And their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not.,There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen,,and that's the ability to get light into the brain.,And to do that -- the brain doesn't feel pain -- you can put --,taking advantage of all the effort,that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on --,optical fibers connected to lasers,that you can use to activate, in animal models for example,,in pre-clinical studies,,these neurons and to see what they do. 
 So how do we do this?,Around 2004,,in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,,this vision came to fruition.,There's a certain alga that swims in the wild,,and it needs to navigate towards light,in order to photosynthesize optimally.,And it senses light with a little eye-spot,,which works not unlike how our eye works.,In its membrane, or its boundary,,it contains little proteins,that indeed can convert light into electricity.,So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.,And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.,When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole,and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot,,and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal,just like a solar cell charging up a battery. 
 So what we need to do is to take these molecules,and somehow install them in neurons.,And because it's a protein,,it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.,So all we've got to do is take that DNA,,put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus,,and put it into neurons.,So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy,,and lots of viruses were coming along.,So this turned out to be very simple to do.,And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004,,we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.,You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.,The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery,to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins,and install them all over the cell,,like putting solar panels on a roof,,and the next thing you know,,you have a neuron which can be activated with light.,So this is very powerful. 
 One of the tricks you have to do,is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want,and not all the other neighbors.,And you can do that; you can tweak the viruses,so they hit just some cells and not others.,And there's other genetic tricks you can play,in order to get light-activated cells.,This field has now come to be known as optogenetics.,And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do,,you can take a complex network,,use one of these viruses to deliver the gene,just to one kind of cell in this dense network.,And then when you shine light on the entire network,,just that cell type will be activated. 
 So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier --,the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia,and the one that is inhibitory.,If we can deliver that gene to these cells --,and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course --,and then flash blue light over the entire brain network,,just these cells are going to be driven.,And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal,,so they don't seem to be averse against that.,Not only can you use this to study what these cells do,,what their power is in computing in the brain,,but you can also use this to try to figure out --,well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells,,if indeed they're atrophied. 
 Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories,about how we're using this,,both at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.,One of the questions we've confronted,is, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?,Because if you could find those,,those would be some of the signals that could drive learning.,The brain will do more of whatever got that reward.,And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.,So if we could figure out what cells they are,,we could maybe find new targets,for which drugs could be designed or screened against,,or maybe places where electrodes could be put in,for people who have very severe disability.,So to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm,in collaboration with the Fiorella group,,where one side of this little box,,if the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of light,in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.,So if these cells can mediate reward,,the animal should go there more and more.,And so that's what happens. 
 This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there,,and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.,And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.,These are the dopamine neurons,,which some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.,Now we've shown that a brief activation of these,is enough, indeed, to drive learning.,Now we can generalize the idea.,Instead of one point in the brain,,we can devise devices that span the brain,,that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns --,arrays of optical fibers,,each coupled to its own independent miniature light source.,And then we can try to do things in vivo,that have only been done to-date in a dish --,like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain,for the signals that can cause certain things to happen.,Or that could be good clinical targets,for treating brain disorders. 
 And one story I want to tell you about,is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder --,a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.,And one of the things that we did,was to adopt a very classical model of fear.,This goes back to the Pavlovian days.,It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning --,where a tone ends with a brief shock.,The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.,And over time -- in this case, a mouse,,which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments --,the animal learns to fear the tone.,The animal will react by freezing,,sort of like a deer in the headlights.,Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find,that allow us to overcome this fear?,So what we do is we play that tone again,after it's been associated with fear.,But we activate targets in the brain, different ones,,using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide,,in order to try and figure out which targets,can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. 
 And so this brief video,shows you one of these targets that we're working on now.,This is an area in the prefrontal cortex,,a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.,And the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there.,There's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing.,This tone used to mean bad news.,And there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner,,so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.,And now this next clip,is just eight minutes later.,And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.,Okay, there it goes. Right now.,And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment,,that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area,to overcome the expression,of this fear memory. 
 Now over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life,because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.,If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.,If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds,,you can figure out what necessary role they play,in the circuits in which they're embedded.,And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life --,every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.,And we found all sorts of molecules, they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,,that respond to green and yellow light.,And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before,with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin. 
 Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.,Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy,,where the brain is overactive.,Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,,one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.,But that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.,What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time,,until the seizure dies away,,and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state --,sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state.,So this animation just tries to explain this concept,where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light,,and we beam light in,,and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure,,we're hoping to be able to turn it off.,And so we don't have data to show you on this front,,but we're very excited about this. 
 Now I want to close on one story,,which we think is another possibility --,which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control,,can be used in the brain itself,to make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.,I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.,Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.,Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants,,which allow them to hear.,There's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells.,And new hope in gene therapy has been developed,because viruses like the adeno-associated virus,,which probably most of us around this room have,,and it doesn't have any symptoms,,which have been used in hundreds of patients,to deliver genes into the brain or the body.,And so far, there have not been serious adverse events,associated with the virus. 
 There's one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves,,which come from algae and bacteria and fungi,,and all over the tree of life.,Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains,,so what is our brain going to do if we put that in?,Are the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react?,In its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet --,but we're working on a variety of studies,to try and examine this,,and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity,to these molecules,or to the illumination of the brain with light.,So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it. 
 I wanted to close with one story,,which we think could potentially,be a clinical application.,Now there are many forms of blindness,where the photoreceptors,,our light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.,And the retina, of course, is a complex structure.,Now let's zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.,The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top,,and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors,are transformed by various computations,until finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells,,relay the information to the brain,,where we see that as perception.,In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa,,or macular degeneration,,the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.,Now how could you repair this?,It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored,,because there's nothing for the drug to bind to.,On the other hand, light can still get into the eye.,The eye is still transparent and you can get light in.,So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules,and install them on some of these other spare cells,and convert them into little cameras.,And because there's so many of these cells in the eye,,potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras. 
 So this is some work that we're doing.,It's being led by one of our collaborators,,Alan Horsager at USC,,and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience,,which is funded by the NIH.,And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.,It's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze,to motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there.,And the goal, of course, of this maze,is to get out of the water and go to a little platform,that's under the lit top port.,Now mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually,,but he does a brute-force search.,He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.,So he's not using vision to do it.,These different mice are different mutations,that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.,And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models,so we come up with a generalized approach. 
 So how are we going to solve this?,We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.,We're going to take these blue light photosensors,and install them on a layer of cells,in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye,and convert them into a camera --,just like installing solar cells all over those neurons,to make them light sensitive.,Light is converted to electricity on them.,So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment,and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.,And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls,and go to this little platform,and make cognitive use of its eyes again.,And to point out the power of this:,these animals are able to get to that platform,just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.,So this pre-clinical study, I think,,bodes hope for the kinds of things,we're hoping to do in the future. 
 To close, I want to point out that we're also exploring,new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.,We're developing these tools,,but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world,,so people can study and try to treat different disorders.,And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits,at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them,,we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier,,practically none of which are cured,,and in the 21st century make them history. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Juan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.,(Laughter),But the implications,of being able to control seizures or epilepsy,with light instead of drugs,,and being able to target those specifically,is a first step.,The second thing that I think I heard you say,is you can now control the brain in two colors,,like an on/off switch. 
 Ed Boyden: That's right. 
 JE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code. 
 EB: Right, yeah.,So with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.,And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.,So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors,that work with the brain,so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. 
 JE: And in theory, that means that,,as a mouse feels, smells,,hears, touches,,you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros. 
 EB: Sure, yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing,what neural codes can drive certain behaviors,and certain thoughts and certain feelings,,and use that to understand more about the brain. 
 JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories,and maybe upload them? 
 EB: Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard.,We're now working on some work,where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.,So we can record information and then drive information back in --,sort of computing what the brain needs,in order to augment its information processing. 
 JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. (EB: Thank you.) 
 (Applause)So I want to take you on a trip,to an alien world.,And it's not a trip,that requires light-years of travel,,but it's to a place,where it's defined by light. 
 So it's a little-appreciated fact,that most of the animals in our ocean,make light.,I've spent most of my career,studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.,I study it because I think understanding it,is critical to understanding life in the ocean,where most bioluminescence occurs.,I also use it as a tool,for visualizing and tracking pollution.,But mostly I'm entranced by it.,Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible,,when I went down and turned out the lights,and saw the fireworks displays,,I've been a bioluminescence junky.,But I would come back from those dives,and try to share the experience with words,,and they were totally inadequate to the task.,I needed some way to share the experience directly.,And the first time I figured out that way,was in this little single-person submersible,called Deep Rover. 
 This next video clip,,you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.,And the first thing you're going to see,is a transect screen,that is about a meter across. 
 (Video) Narrator: In front of the sub,,a mess screen will come into contact,with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.,With the sub's lights switched off,,it is possible to see their bioluminescence --,the light produced when they collide with the mesh.,This is the first time,it has ever been recorded. 
 Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera,that has about the sensitivity,of the fully dark-adapted human eye.,Which means that really is what you would see,if you took a dive in a submersible.,But just to try to prove that fact to you,,I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton,in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt,at a live demonstration. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, if we could have the lights down,and have it as dark in here as possible,,I have a flask,that has bioluminescent plankton in it.,And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now,,either because they're dead --,(Laughter),or because I need to stir them up in some way,for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like. 
 (Gasps) 
 Oops. Sorry. 
 (Laughter) 
 I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.,Okay. 
 So that light,was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate,,a single-celled alga.,So why would a single-celled alga,need to be able to produce light?,Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.,The flash is like a scream for help.,It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,,and just like the alarm on your car or your house,,it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder,,thereby either leading to his capture,or scaring him away. 
 There's a lot of animals that use this trick,,for example this black dragonfish.,It's got a light organ under its eye.,It's got a chin barbel.,It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.,So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime,,because the top speed of this fish is one knot,,which was the top speed of the submersible.,But it was worth it,,because we caught it in a special capture device,,brought it up into the lab on the ship,,and then everything on this fish lights up.,It's unbelievable.,The light organs under the eyes are flashing.,That chin barbel is flashing.,It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing,,fin lights.,It's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.,It's phenomenal.,And you normally don't get to see this,because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets. 
 There's other ways you can defend yourself with light.,For example, this shrimp,releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water,just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.,This blinds or distracts the predator.,This little squid is called the fire shooter,because of its ability to do this.,Now it may look like a tasty morsel,,or a pig's head with wings --,(Laughter),but if it's attacked,,it puts out a barrage of light --,in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.,I just barely got the lights out in time,for you to be able to see those gobs of light,hitting the transect screen,and then just glowing.,It's phenomenal. 
 So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean --,most of them that make light.,And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.,They use it for finding food, for attracting mates,,for defending against predators.,But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean,,that's where things get really strange.,And some of these animals,are probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar,",but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.,They're things like this. 
 This is a golden coral, a bush.,It grows very slowly.,In fact, it's thought that some of these,are as much as 3,000 years old,,which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.,The other reason is this amazing bush glows.,So if you brush up against it,,any place you brushed against it,,you get this twinkling blue-green light,that's just breathtaking.,And you see things like this.,This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book --,just all manner of creatures all over this thing.,And these are flytrap anemones.,Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.,But if you keep poking it,,it starts to produce light.,And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.,It produces these strings of light,,presumably as some form of defense. 
 There are starfish that can make light.,And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light,that dance along their arms.,This looks like a plant,,but it's actually an animal.,And it anchors itself in the sand,by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.,So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents,,as you see here.,But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab,and just squeeze it at the base of the stock,,it produces this light,that propagates from stem to the plume,,changing color as it goes,,from green to blue.,Colorization and sound effects,added for you viewing pleasure.,(Laughter),But we have no idea why it does that. 
 Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.,It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.,It's a green saber of light.,And like the one you just saw,,it can produce these as bands of light.,So if I squeeze the base,,the bands go from base to tip.,If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.,So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?,(Gasps),I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about. 
 (Laughter) 
 So there's a language of light in the deep ocean,,and we're just beginning to understand it,,and one way we're going about that,is we're imitating a lot of these displays.,This is an optical lure that I've used.,We call it the electronic jellyfish.,It's just 16 blue LEDs,that we can program to do different types of displays.,And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea,that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals,,so it's unobtrusive.,So I just want to show you,some of the responses we've elicited,from animals in the deep sea. 
 So the camera's black and white.,It's not high-resolution.,And what you're seeing here is a bait box,with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean --,there are isopods all over it.,And right in the front,is the electronic jellyfish.,And when it starts flashing,,it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.,But as soon as it starts to flash --,and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera --,I want you to look right here.,There's something small there that responds.,We're talking to something.,It looks like a little of string pearls basically --,in fact, three strings of pearls.,And this was very consistent.,This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.,We basically have a chat room going on here,,because once it gets started, everybody's talking.,And I think this is actually a shrimp,that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.,But the cool thing is, we're talking to it.,We don't know what we're saying.,Personally, I think it's something sexy. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then finally,,I want to show you some responses that we recorded,with the world's first deep-sea webcam,,which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.,We've only just begun to analyze all of this data.,This is going to be a glowing source first,,which is like bioluminescent bacteria.,And it is an optical cue,that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.,So this scavenger comes in,,which is a giant sixgill shark.,And I can't claim for sure,that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.,But if it had been following the odor plume,,it would have come in from the other direction.,And it does actually seem to be trying,to eat the electronic jellyfish.,That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark. 
 Okay, so this next one is from the webcam,,and it's going to be this pinwheel display.,And this is a burglar alarm.,And that was a Humboldt squid,,a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.,This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.,But if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.,It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.,But we did see a bunch of responses like this.,This guy is a little more contemplative.,"Hey, wait a minute.,There's supposed to be something else there.",He's thinking about it.,But he's persistent.,He keeps coming back.,And then he goes away for a few seconds,to think about it some more,,and thinks,,"Maybe if I come in from a different angle.",(Laughter),Nope. 
 So we are starting to get a handle on this,,but only just the beginnings.,We need more eyes on the process.,So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible,,by all means, climb in and take the plunge.,This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list,,because we live on an ocean planet.,More than 90 percent, 99 percent,,of the living space on our planet,is ocean.,It's a magical place,filled with breathtaking light shows,and bizarre and wondrous creatures,,alien life forms,that you don't have to travel to another planet to see. 
 But if you do take the plunge,,please remember to turn out the lights.,But I warn you,,it's addictive. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Mark Zuckerberg,,a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed.,And the journalist was asking him,,"Why is this so important?",And Zuckerberg said,,"A squirrel dying in your front yard,may be more relevant to your interests right now,than people dying in Africa.",And I want to talk about,what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like. 
 So when I was growing up,in a really rural area in Maine,,the Internet meant something very different to me.,It meant a connection to the world.,It meant something that would connect us all together.,And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy,and for our society.,But there's this shift,in how information is flowing online,,and it's invisible.,And if we don't pay attention to it,,it could be a real problem.,So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time --,my Facebook page.,I'm progressive, politically -- big surprise --,but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives.,I like hearing what they're thinking about;,I like seeing what they link to;,I like learning a thing or two.,And so I was surprised when I noticed one day,that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed.,And what it turned out was going on,was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on,,and it was noticing that, actually,,I was clicking more on my liberal friends' links,than on my conservative friends' links.,And without consulting me about it,,it had edited them out.,They disappeared. 
 So Facebook isn't the only place,that's doing this kind of invisible, algorithmic,editing of the Web.,Google's doing it too.,If I search for something, and you search for something,,even right now at the very same time,,we may get very different search results.,Even if you're logged out, one engineer told me,,there are 57 signals,that Google looks at --,everything from what kind of computer you're on,to what kind of browser you're using,to where you're located --,that it uses to personally tailor your query results.,Think about it for a second:,there is no standard Google anymore.,And you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see.,You can't see how different your search results are,from anyone else's. 
 But a couple of weeks ago,,I asked a bunch of friends to Google "Egypt",and to send me screen shots of what they got.,So here's my friend Scott's screen shot.,And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot.,When you put them side-by-side,,you don't even have to read the links,to see how different these two pages are.,But when you do read the links,,it's really quite remarkable.,Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all,in his first page of Google results.,Scott's results were full of them.,And this was the big story of the day at that time.,That's how different these results are becoming. 
 So it's not just Google and Facebook either.,This is something that's sweeping the Web.,There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization.,Yahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet,,is now personalized -- different people get different things.,Huffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times --,all flirting with personalization in various ways.,And this moves us very quickly,toward a world in which,the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see,,but not necessarily what we need to see.,As Eric Schmidt said,,"It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something,that has not in some sense,been tailored for them." 
 So I do think this is a problem.,And I think, if you take all of these filters together,,you take all these algorithms,,you get what I call a filter bubble.,And your filter bubble is your own personal,,unique universe of information,that you live in online.,And what's in your filter bubble,depends on who you are, and it depends on what you do.,But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in.,And more importantly,,you don't actually see what gets edited out.,So one of the problems with the filter bubble,was discovered by some researchers at Netflix.,And they were looking at the Netflix queues, and they noticed something kind of funny,that a lot of us probably have noticed,,which is there are some movies,that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses.,They enter the queue, they just zip right out.,So "Iron Man" zips right out,,and "Waiting for Superman",can wait for a really long time. 
 What they discovered,was that in our Netflix queues,there's this epic struggle going on,between our future aspirational selves,and our more impulsive present selves.,You know we all want to be someone,who has watched "Rashomon,",but right now,we want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time.,(Laughter),So the best editing gives us a bit of both.,It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber,and a little bit of Afghanistan.,It gives us some information vegetables;,it gives us some information dessert.,And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters,,these personalized filters,,is that, because they're mainly looking,at what you click on first,,it can throw off that balance.,And instead of a balanced information diet,,you can end up surrounded,by information junk food. 
 What this suggests,is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong.,In a broadcast society --,this is how the founding mythology goes --,in a broadcast society,,there were these gatekeepers, the editors,,and they controlled the flows of information.,And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way,,and it allowed all of us to connect together,,and it was awesome.,But that's not actually what's happening right now.,What we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch,from human gatekeepers,to algorithmic ones.,And the thing is that the algorithms,don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics,that the editors did.,So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us,,if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see,,then we need to make sure,that they're not just keyed to relevance.,We need to make sure that they also show us things,that are uncomfortable or challenging or important --,this is what TED does --,other points of view. 
 And the thing is, we've actually been here before,as a society.,In 1915, it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot,about their civic responsibilities.,Then people noticed,that they were doing something really important.,That, in fact, you couldn't have,a functioning democracy,if citizens didn't get a good flow of information,,that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter,,and then journalistic ethics developed.,It wasn't perfect,,but it got us through the last century.,And so now,,we're kind of back in 1915 on the Web.,And we need the new gatekeepers,to encode that kind of responsibility,into the code that they're writing. 
 I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google --,Larry and Sergey --,people who have helped build the Web as it is,,and I'm grateful for that.,But we really need you to make sure,that these algorithms have encoded in them,a sense of the public life, a sense of civic responsibility.,We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough,that we can see what the rules are,that determine what gets through our filters.,And we need you to give us some control,so that we can decide,what gets through and what doesn't.,Because I think,we really need the Internet to be that thing,that we all dreamed of it being.,We need it to connect us all together.,We need it to introduce us to new ideas,and new people and different perspectives.,And it's not going to do that,if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Thank you.,I'm thrilled to be here.,I'm going to talk about a new, old material,that still continues to amaze us,,and that might impact the way we think,about material science, high technology --,and maybe, along the way,,also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.,So that's kind of a bold statement.,I'll tell you a little bit more.,This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.,It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material,that is processed all in water and at room temperature --,and is biodegradable with a clock,,so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water,or have it stable for years.,It's edible; it's implantable in the human body,without causing any immune response.,It actually gets reintegrated in the body.,And it's technological,,so it can do things like microelectronics,,and maybe photonics do.,And the material,looks something like this.,In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.,The components of this material are just water and protein. 
 So this material is silk.,So it's kind of different,from what we're used to thinking about silk.,So the question is, how do you reinvent something,that has been around for five millennia?,The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.,And so we marvel at silk worms --,the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.,The silk worm does a remarkable thing:,it uses these two ingredients, protein and water,,that are in its gland,,to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection --,so comparable to technical fibers,like Kevlar.,And so in the reverse engineering process,that we know about,,and that we're familiar with,,for the textile industry,,the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon,and then weaves glamorous things.,We want to know how you go from water and protein,to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar. 
 So the insight,is how do you actually reverse engineer this,and go from cocoon to gland,and get water and protein that is your starting material.,And this is an insight,that came, about two decades ago,,from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with,,David Kaplan.,And so we get this starting material.,And so this starting material is back to the basic building block.,And then we use this to do a variety of things --,like, for example, this film.,And we take advantage of something that is very simple.,The recipe to make those films,is to take advantage of the fact,that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.,They find their way to self-assemble.,So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it,,and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.,And then you detach the protein and you get this film,,as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates. 
 But I mentioned that the film is also technological.,And so what does that mean?,It means that you can interface it,with some of the things that are typical of technology,,like microelectronics and nanoscale technology.,And the image of the DVD here,is just to illustrate a point,that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,,which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.,So it would be able to replicate the information,that is on the DVD.,And we can store information that's film with water and protein.,So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk,,which is right here, and the message is over there.,And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.,And this requires a stable hand,,so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people.,So let me see.,So as you see the film go in transparently through there,,and then ...,(Applause),And the most remarkable feat,is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that. 
 So once you have these attributes,of this material,,then you can do a lot of things.,It's actually not limited to films.,And so the material can assume a lot of formats.,And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components,or you do microprism arrays,,like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.,Or you can do beautiful things,that, if the camera can capture, you can make.,You can add a third dimensionality to the film.,And if the angle is right,,you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk.,But you can do other things.,You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light,,and so we've made optical fibers. 
 But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.,And you can think of different formats.,So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle,,we do microneedle arrays.,What you see there on the screen is a human hair,superimposed on the needle that's made of silk --,just to give you a sense of size.,You can do bigger things.,You can do gears and nuts and bolts --,that you can buy at Whole Foods.,And the gears work in water as well.,So you think of alternative mechanical parts.,And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong,to replace peripheral veins, for example,,or maybe an entire bone.,And so you have here a little example,of a small skull --,what we call mini Yorick.,(Laughter),But you can do things like cups, for example,,and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors,you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.,You can do electronic pieces,that fold and wrap.,Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos. 
 So there's versatility, as you see,,in the material formats,,that you can do with silk.,But there are still some unique traits.,I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?,I mentioned it briefly at the beginning;,the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.,And you see here a picture of a tissue section.,And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?,You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.,Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats,,in principle, can be implanted and disappear.,And what you see there in that tissue section,,in fact, is you see that reflector tape.,So, much like you're seen at night by a car,,then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue,,you can see deeper parts of tissue,because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.,And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.,And reintegration in the human body,is not the only thing,,but reintegration in the environment is important.,So you have a clock, you have protein,,and now a silk cup like this,can be thrown away without guilt --,(Applause),unlike the polystyrene cups,that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.,It's edible,,so you can do smart packaging around food,that you can cook with the food.,It doesn't taste good,,so I'm going to need some help with that. 
 But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.,Silk, during its self-assembly process,,acts like a cocoon for biological matter.,And so if you change the recipe,,and you add things when you pour --,so you add things to your liquid silk solution --,where these things are enzymes,or antibodies or vaccines,,the self-assembly process,preserves the biological function of these dopants.,So it makes the materials environmentally active,and interactive.,So that screw that you thought about beforehand,can actually be used,to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together --,and deliver drugs at the same,,while your bone is healing, for example.,Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.,So we've made a silk card,with penicillin in it.,And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C,,so 140 degrees Fahrenheit,,for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.,And so that could be ---,(Applause),that could be potentially a good alternative,to solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter),And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it]. 
 And so there is this other unique material trait,that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.,And so what you see there is the difference.,In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade,,and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.,And what you see is that the film on the bottom,releases what is inside it.,So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.,And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs,and for reintegration in the environment,in all of these formats that you've seen. 
 So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.,We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do,,whether you want to replace a vein or a bone,,or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics,,perhaps drink a coffee in a cup,and throw it away without guilt,,maybe carry your drugs in your pocket,,deliver them inside your body,or deliver them across the desert,,the answer may be in a thread of silk. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This story,is about taking imagination seriously.,Fourteen years ago,,I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,,used the same way for centuries.,Today, I'm using it to create,permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms,the scale of hard-edged buildings,in cities around the world.,I was an unlikely person to be doing this.,I never studied sculpture,,engineering or architecture.,In fact, after college,I applied to seven art schools,and was rejected by all seven. 
 I went off on my own to become an artist,,and I painted for 10 years,,when I was offered a Fulbright to India.,Promising to give exhibitions of paintings,,I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.,The deadline for the show arrived --,my paints didn't.,I had to do something.,This fishing village was famous for sculpture.,So I tried bronze casting.,But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.,I went for a walk on the beach,,watching the fishermen,bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.,I'd seen it every day,,but this time I saw it differently --,a new approach to sculpture,,a way to make volumetric form,without heavy solid materials. 
 My first satisfying sculpture,was made in collaboration with these fishermen.,It's a self-portrait,titled "Wide Hips.",(Laughter),We hoisted them on poles to photograph.,I discovered,their soft surfaces,revealed every ripple of wind,in constantly changing patterns.,I was mesmerized.,I continued studying craft traditions,and collaborating with artisans,,next in Lithuania with lace makers.,I liked the fine detail,it gave my work,,but I wanted to make them larger --,to shift from being an object you look at,to something you could get lost in. 
 Returning to India to work with those fishermen,,we made a net,of a million and a half hand-tied knots --,installed briefly in Madrid.,Thousands of people saw it,,and one of them was the urbanist,Manual Sola-Morales,who was redesigning the waterfront,in Porto, Portugal.,He asked if I could build this,as a permanent piece for the city.,I didn't know if I could do that,and preserve my art.,Durable, engineered, permanent --,those are in opposition,to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral. 
 For two years, I searched for a fiber,that could survive ultraviolet rays,,salt, air, pollution,,and at the same time remain soft enough,to move fluidly in the wind.,We needed something to hold the net up,out there in the middle of the traffic circle.,So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.,We had to engineer it,to move gracefully in an average breeze,and survive in hurricane winds.,But there was no engineering software,to model something porous and moving.,I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer,who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts,named Peter Heppel.,He helped me tackle the twin challenges,of precise shape,and gentle movement. 
 I couldn't build this the way I knew,because hand-tied knots,weren't going to withstand a hurricane.,So I developed a relationship,with an industrial fishnet factory,,learned the variables of their machines,,and figured out a way,to make lace with them.,There was no language,to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft,into something machine operators could produce.,So we had to create one.,Three years and two children later,,we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.,It was hard to believe,that what I had imagined,was now built, permanent,and had lost nothing in translation. 
 (Applause) 
 This intersection had been bland and anonymous.,Now it had a sense of place.,I walked underneath it,for the first time.,As I watched the wind's choreography unfold,,I felt sheltered,and, at the same time,,connected to limitless sky.,My life was not going to be the same.,I want to create these oases of sculpture,in spaces of cities around the world.,I'm going to share two directions,that are new in my work. 
 Historic Philadelphia City Hall:,its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture,that was lighter than netting.,So we experimented,with tiny atomized water particles,to create a dry mist,that is shaped by the wind,and in testing, discovered,that it can be shaped by people,who can interact and move through it without getting wet.,I'm using this sculpture material,to trace the paths of subway trains above ground,in real time --,like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding. 
 Next challenge,,the Biennial of the Americas in Denver,asked, could I represent,the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness,in a sculpture?,(Laughter),I didn't know where to begin,,but I said yes.,I read about the recent earthquake in Chile,and the tsunami that rippled across,the entire Pacific Ocean.,It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,,sped up the planet's rotation,and literally shortened the length of the day.,So I contacted NOAA,,and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,,and translated it into this.,Its title: "1.26",refers to the number of microseconds,that the Earth's day was shortened. 
 I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.,Its shape was too complex now.,So I replaced the metal armature,with a soft, fine mesh,of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.,The sculpture could now be entirely soft,,which made it so light,it could tie in to existing buildings --,literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.,There was no software,that could extrude these complex net forms,and model them with gravity.,So we had to create it. 
 Then I got a call from New York City,asking if I could adapt these concepts,to Times Square,or the High Line.,This new soft structural method,enables me to model these,and build these sculptures,at the scale of skyscrapers.,They don't have funding yet,,but I dream now,of bringing these to cities around the world,where they're most needed. 
 Fourteen years ago,,I searched for beauty,in the traditional things,,in craft forms.,Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering,to create voluptuous, billowing forms,the scale of buildings.,My artistic horizons continue to grow. 
 I'll leave you with this story.,I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.,An attorney in the office,who'd never been interested in art,,never visited the local art museum,,dragged everyone she could from the building,and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.,There they were in their business suits,,laying in the grass,,noticing the changing patterns of wind,beside people they didn't know,,sharing the rediscovery of wonder. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you.,Thank you.,Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)From all outward appearances,,John had everything going for him.,He had just signed the contract,to sell his New York apartment,at a six-figure profit,,and he'd only owned it for five years.,The school where he graduated from with his master's,had just offered him a teaching appointment,,which meant not only a salary,,but benefits for the first time in ages.,And yet, despite everything going really well for John,,he was struggling,,fighting addiction and a gripping depression. 
 On the night of June 11th, 2003,,he climbed up to the edge,of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge,and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.,Remarkably --,no, miraculously --,he lived.,The fall shattered his right arm,,broke every rib that he had,,punctured his lung,,and he drifted in and out of consciousness,as he drifted down the East River,,under the Brooklyn Bridge,and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,,where passengers on the ferry,heard his cries of pain,,contacted the boat's captain,who contacted the Coast Guard,who fished him out of the East River,and took him to Bellevue Hospital. 
 And that's actually where our story begins.,Because once John committed himself,to putting his life back together --,first physically, then emotionally,,and then spiritually --,he found that there were very few resources available,to someone who has attempted to end their life,in the way that he did. 
 Research shows,that 19 out of 20 people,who attempt suicide,will fail.,But the people who fail,are 37 times more likely to succeed,the second time.,This truly is,an at-risk population,with very few resources to support them.,And what happens,when people try to assemble themselves back into life,,because of our taboos around suicide,,we're not sure what to say,,and so quite often we say nothing.,And that furthers the isolation,that people like John found themselves in. 
 I know John's story very well,because I'm John.,And this is, today,,the first time in any sort of public setting,I've ever acknowledged,the journey that I have been on.,But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006,and a good friend last year to suicide,,and sitting last year at TEDActive,,I knew that I needed to step out of my silence,and past my taboos,to talk about an idea worth spreading --,and that is that people,who have made the difficult choice,to come back to life,need more resources and need our help. 
 As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.,It gets way better.,And I'm choosing to come out,of a totally different kind of closet today,to encourage you, to urge you,,that if you are someone,who has contemplated or attempted suicide,,or you know somebody who has,,talk about it; get help.,It's a conversation worth having,and an idea worth spreading. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.,But before I show you what I've got inside,,I'm going to make a very public confession,,and that is,,I'm outfit-obsessed.,I love finding, wearing,,and more recently,,photographing and blogging,a different, colorful, crazy outfit,for every single occasion.,But I don't buy anything new.,I get all my clothes secondhand,from flea markets and thrift stores.,Aww, thank you.,Secondhand shopping,allows me to reduce the impact,my wardrobe has on the environment,and on my wallet.,I get to meet all kinds of great people;,my dollars usually go to a good cause;,I look pretty unique;,and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.,I mean, what am I going to find today?,Is it going to be my size?,Will I like the color?,Will it be under $20?,If all the answers are yes,,I feel as though I've won. 
 I want to get back to my suitcase,and tell you what I packed,for this exciting week here at TED.,I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?,So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.,I brought seven pairs of underpants,and that's it.,Exactly one week's worth of undies,is all I put in my suitcase.,I was betting that I'd be able to find,everything else I could possible want to wear,once I got here to Palm Springs.,And since you don't know me,as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --,(Laughter),that means I found a few things.,And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.,Does that sound good?,(Applause),So as I do this,,I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons,that, believe it or not, I have picked up,in these adventures wearing nothing new. 
 So let's start with Sunday.,I call this "Shiny Tiger.",You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.,You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.,This whole outfit, including the jacket,,cost me $55,,and it was the most expensive thing,that I wore the entire week. 
 Monday: Color is powerful.,It is almost physiologically impossible,to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.,(Laughter),If you are happy,,you are going to attract other happy people to you. 
 Tuesday:,Fitting in is way overrated.,I've spent a whole lot of my life,trying to be myself,and at the same time fit in.,Just be who you are.,If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,,they will not only get it,,they will appreciate it. 
 Wednesday:,Embrace your inner child.,Sometimes people tell me,that I look like I'm playing dress-up,,or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.,I like to smile,and say, "Thank you." 
 Thursday:,Confidence is key.,If you think you look good in something,,you almost certainly do.,And if you don't think you look good in something,,you're also probably right.,I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.,But it wasn't until I turned 30,that I really got what this meant.,And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.,If you believe you're a beautiful person,inside and out,,there is no look that you can't pull off.,So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.,We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:,Gold sequins go with everything. 
 And finally, Saturday:,Developing your own unique personal style,is a really great way to tell the world something about you,without having to say a word.,It's been proven to me time and time again,as people have walked up to me this week,simply because of what I'm wearing,,and we've had great conversations. 
 So obviously this is not all going to fit,back in my tiny suitcase.,So before I go home to Brooklyn,,I'm going to donate everything back.,Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week,is that it's okay to let go.,I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things,because around the corner,,there is always going to be,another crazy, colorful,,shiny outfit,just waiting for me,,if I put a little love in my heart and look. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A few years ago,nI felt like I was stuck in a rut,,so I decided to follow in the footsteps,of the great Americannphilosopher, Morgan Spurlock,,and try something new for 30 days.,The idea is actually pretty simple.,Think about something you've alwaysnwanted to add to your life,and try it for the next 30 days.,It turns out 30 days is justnabout the right amount of time,to add a new habit or subtract a habit --,like watching the news --,from your life. 
 There's a few things I learnednwhile doing these 30-day challenges.,The first was,,instead of the monthsnflying by, forgotten,,the time was much more memorable.,This was part of a challenge I didnto take a picture every day for a month.,And I remember exactly where I wasnand what I was doing that day.,I also noticed,that as I started to do morenand harder 30-day challenges,,my self-confidence grew.,I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd,to the kind of guy who bikes to work.,For fun! 
 (Laughter) 
 Even last year, I ended up hikingnup Mt. Kilimanjaro,,the highest mountain in Africa.,I would never have been that adventurousnbefore I started my 30-day challenges. 
 I also figured out that if younreally want something badly enough,,you can do anything for 30 days.,Have you ever wanted to write a novel?,Every November,,tens of thousands of people,try to write their ownn50,000-word novel, from scratch,,in 30 days.,It turns out, all you have to donis write 1,667 words a day,for a month.,So I did.,By the way, the secretnis not to go to sleep,until you've writtennyour words for the day.,You might be sleep-deprived,,but you'll finish your novel.,Now is my book the next greatnAmerican novel?,No. I wrote it in a month.,It's awful. 
 (Laughter) 
 But for the rest of my life,,if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,,I don't have to say,,"I'm a computer scientist.",No, no, if I want to,nI can say, "I'm a novelist." 
 (Laughter) 
 So here's one last thingnI'd like to mention.,I learned that when I madensmall, sustainable changes,,things I could keep doing,,they were more likely to stick.,There's nothing wrongnwith big, crazy challenges.,In fact, they're a ton of fun.,But they're less likely to stick.,When I gave up sugar for 30 days,,day 31 looked like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 So here's my question to you:,What are you waiting for?,I guarantee you the next 30 days,are going to passnwhether you like it or not,,so why not think about somethingnyou have always wanted to try,and give it a shot!,For the next 30 days. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)I have had the distinct blessing in my life,to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.,But the coolest I ever worked on,was around this guy.,This guy's name is TEMPT.,TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.,And he came up home from a run one day,and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling.",And that was the onset of ALS.,So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.,He only has use of his eyes. 
 I was exposed to him.,I have a company that does design and animation,,so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part,of what we admire and respect in the art world.,And so we decided that we were going to sponsor,Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.,So I went and met with his brother and father,and said, "We're going to give you this money.,What are you going to do with it?",And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.,I just want to be able to communicate with him,and him to be able to communicate with me.",And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --,don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate,via these devices?",And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and,you've got really amazing insurance,,you can't actually do that.,These devices aren't accessible to people.",And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?",Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?",That's how they communicate --,so run their finger along.,I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?" 
 So I showed up with the desire to just write a check,,and instead, I wrote a check,that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.,I committed to his brother and his father right then and there --,I'm like, "All right, here's the deal:,Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,,and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.,Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him,isn't able to communicate it." 
 So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.,I met these guys called GRL,,Graffiti Research Lab,,and they have a technology,that allows them to project a light onto any surface,and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,,and it just registers the negative space.,So they go around and do art installations like this.,All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.,First it starts with the sexual organs,,then it starts with cuss words,,then it was Bush slanders,and then people actually got to art.,But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.,So I went home and was having dinner with my wife,and was telling her about this,,and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists,where you can use your eyes to control things,,why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser,and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome." 
 So that started the journey.,And about two years later, about a year later,,after a bunch of organization,and a bunch of moving things around,,we'd accomplished a couple things.,One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,,and we actually got TEMPT a machine,that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine.,(Applause),Which was awesome.,And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda,,because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,,and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing." 
 The other thing we did,is we flew seven programmers from all over the world --,literally every corner of the world --,into our house.,My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,,and these hackers and programmers,and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.,A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that,and that we were going to come back,and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.,But for over two weeks,,we programmed,,we went to the Venice boardwalk,,my kids got involved,,my dog got involved,,and we created this. 
 This is called the EyeWriter,,and you can see the description.,This is a cheap pair of sunglasses,that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,,some copper wire,and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.,We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,,mounted it to an LED light,,and now there's a device that is free --,you build this yourself, we publish the code for free,,you download the software for free.,And now we've created a device,that has absolutely no limitations.,There's no insurance company that can say "No.",There's no hospital that can say "No.",Anybody who's paralyzed now has access,to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,Thank you guys very much. That was awesome. 
 So at the end of the two weeks,,we went back to TEMPT's room.,I love this picture, because this is someone else's room,and that's his room.,So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.,And after over a year of planning,,two weeks of programming,,carb-fest and all-night sessions,,Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.,And this is an amazing picture,,because this is his life support system,,and he's looking over his life support system.,We kicked his bed so that he could see out.,And we set up a projector,on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.,And he drew again for the first time,,in front of his family and friends --,and you can only imagine,what the feeling in the parking lot was.,The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,,so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too. 
 (Laughter) 
 So at the end of this, he sent us an email,,and this is what the email said:,"That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.,I feel like I had been held underwater,,and someone finally reached down,and pulled my head up so I could breathe.",Isn't that awesome? 
 (Applause) 
 So that's kind of our battle cry.,That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.,And we've got such a long way to go with this.,This is an amazing device,,but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.,And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.,So we're in the process of trying to figure out,how to make it better, faster, stronger. 
 Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.,We've won a bunch of awards.,Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.,It's all coming out of our own pockets.,So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic.",Armstrong Twittered about us,,and then in December, Time magazine honored us,as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool. 
 (Applause) 
 The coolest thing about this --,and this is what's completing the whole circle --,is that in April of this year,,at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,,there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets.",And "Art of the Streets" is going to have,pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene --,Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS --,all of these guys will be there.,TEMPT's going to be in the show,,which is pretty awesome. 
 (Applause) 
 So basically this is my point:,If you see something that's not possible,,make it possible.,Everything in this room wasn't possible --,this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter --,wasn't possible at one point.,Make it possible, everyone in this room.,I'm not a programmer,,never done anything with ocular recognition technology,,but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people,so that we could make something happen.,And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself,every single day,when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:,if not now, then when? And if not me, then who? 
 Thank you guys. 
 (Applause)A few weeks ago, I had a chancento go to Saudi Arabia.,And the first thingnI wanted to do as a Muslim,was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,,the holiest shrine of Islam.,And I did that;nI put on my ritualistic dress,,I went to the holy mosque,,I did my prayers,,I observed all the rituals.,And meanwhile,nbesides all the spirituality,,there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba,that was pretty interesting for me:,there was no separation of sexes.,In other words, men and womennwere worshiping all together.,They were together while doing tawāf,nthe circular walk around the Kaaba.,They were together while praying. 
 And if you wondernwhy this is interesting at all,,you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia,,because this a country which is strictlyndivided between the sexes.,In other words:,as men, you are simply not supposed to benin the same physical space,with women.,And I noticed this in a very funny way.,I left the Kaaba to eat somethingnin downtown Mecca.,I headed to the nearestnBurger King restaurant.,And I went there -- I noticednthat there was a male section,,which is carefully separatednfrom the female section.,I had to pay, order and eatnin the male section.,"It's funny," I said to myself,,"You can mingle with the opposite sexnat the holy Kaaba,,but not at the Burger King?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Quite, quite ironic.,Ironic, and it's also,nI think, quite telling,,because the Kaabanand the rituals around it,are relics from the earliestnphase of Islam,,that of prophet Muhammad.,And if there was a big emphasisnat the time to separate men from women,,the rituals around the Kaabancould have been designed accordingly.,But apparently, that was notnan issue at the time.,So the rituals came that way.,This is also, I think,nconfirmed by the fact,that the seclusion of womennin creating a divided society,is something that you alsondo not find in the Koran --,the very core of Islam,nthe divine core of Islam --,that all Muslims, equally myself, believe. 
 And I think it's not an accident,that you don't find this ideanin the very origin of Islam,,because many scholars who studynthe history of Islamic thought --,Muslim scholars or Westerners --,think that, actually, the practicenof dividing men and women physically,came as a later development in Islam,,as Muslims adoptednsome preexisting cultures,and traditions of the Middle East.,Seclusion of women was actuallyna Byzantine and Persian practice,,and Muslims adopted itnand made it a part of their religion. 
 Actually, this is just one examplenof a much larger phenomenon.,What we call today Islamic law,nand especially Islamic culture --,and there are many Islamicncultures, actually;,the one in Saudi Arabia is much different,from where I comenfrom in Istanbul or Turkey.,But still, if you're going to speaknabout a Muslim culture,,this has a core: the divine messagenwhich began the religion.,But then many traditions, perceptions,npractices were added on top of it.,And these were traditionsnof the Middle East medieval traditions. 
 There are two importantnmessages, or two lessons,,to take from that reality.,First of all, Muslims --,pious, conservative, believing Muslimsnwho want to be loyal to their religion --,should not cling onto everythingnin their culture,,thinking that that's divinely mandated.,Maybe some things are bad traditionsnand they need to be changed.,On the other hand, the Westernersnwho look at Islamic culture,and see some troubling aspects,should not readily concludenthat this is what Islam ordains.,Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culturenthat became confused with Islam. 
 There is a practicencalled female circumcision.,It's something terrible, horrible.,It is basically an operationnto deprive women of sexual pleasure.,And Westerners --,Europeans or Americans --nwho didn't know about this before,,[saw] this practice,within some of the Muslim communitiesnwho migrated from North Africa.,And they've thought,,"Oh, what a horrible religion that is,nwhich ordains something like that.",But when you look at female circumcision,,you see that it hasnnothing to do with Islam;,it's just a North African practicenwhich predates Islam.,It was there for thousands of years.,And, quite tellingly,nsome Muslims do practice it --,the Muslims in North Africa,nnot in other places.,But also the non-Muslimncommunities of North Africa --,the animists, some Christiansnand even a Jewish tribe in North Africa --,are known to practice female circumcision.,So what might look like a problemnwithin Islamic faith,might turn out to be a traditionnthat Muslims have subscribed to. 
 The same thing can be saidnfor honor killings,,which is a recurrent themenin the Western media --,and which is, of course,na horrible tradition.,And we see, truly, in some Muslimncommunities, that tradition.,But in the non-Muslim communitiesnof the Middle East,,such as some Christian communities,nEastern communities,,you see the same practice.,We had a tragic case of an honor killing,within Turkey's Armenian communitynjust a few months ago. 
 Now, these are thingsnabout general culture,,but I'm also very muchninterested in political culture,and whether libertynand democracy is appreciated,,or whether there's an authoritariannpolitical culture,in which the state is supposednto impose things on the citizens.,And it is no secret,that many Islamic movementsnin the Middle East,tend to be authoritarian,,and some of the so-calledn"Islamic regimes,",such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worstncase, the Taliban in Afghanistan,,they are pretty authoritarian --nno doubt about that. 
 For example, in Saudi Arabia,,there is a phenomenonncalled the religious police.,And the religious police imposesnthe supposed Islamic way of life,on every citizen, by force --,like, women are forcednto cover their heads --,wear the hijab, the Islamic head cover.,Now that is pretty authoritarian,,and that's somethingnI'm very much critical of.,But when I realized that the non-Muslim,,or the non-Islamic-mindednactors in the same geography,sometimes behaved similarly,,I realized that the problem maybe lies,in the political culturenof the whole region, not just Islam.,Let me give you an example:nin Turkey, where I come from,,which is a very hyper-secular republic,,until very recently, we used to havenwhat I call "secularism police,",which would guard the universitiesnagainst veiled students.,In other words, they would force studentsnto uncover their heads.,And I think forcing peoplento uncover their head,is as tyrannical as forcingnthem to cover it.,It should be the citizen's decision. 
 But when I saw that, I said,,"Maybe the problem is justnan authoritarian culture in the region,,and some Muslimsnhave been influenced by that.,But the secular-minded peoplencan be influenced by that.,Maybe it's a problemnof the political culture,,and we have to think aboutnhow to change that political culture.",Now, these are some of the questionsnI had in mind a few years ago,when I sat down to write a book.,I said, "Well, I will do research,about how Islam actuallyncame to be what it is today,,and what roads were takennand what roads could have been taken.",The name of the book is "Islam WithoutnExtremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty.",And as the subtitle suggests,,I looked at Islamic traditionnand the history of Islamic thought,from the perspectivenof individual liberty,,and I tried to find what are the strengthsnwith regard to individual liberty. 
 And there are strengthsnin Islamic tradition.,Islam, actually,nas a monotheistic religion,,which defined mannas a responsible agent by itself,,created the idea of the individualnin the Middle East,,and saved it from the communitarianism,nthe collectivism of the tribe.,You can derive many ideas from that.,But besides that, I also sawnproblems within Islamic tradition.,But one thing was curious:,most of those problems turn out to benproblems that emerged later,,not from the very divine corenof Islam, the Koran,,but from, again,ntraditions and mentalities,,or the interpretations of the Korannthat Muslims made in the Middle Ages.,The Koran, for example,ndoesn't condone stoning.,There is no punishment for apostasy.,There is no punishmentnfor personal sins like drinking.,These things which make Islamic law,,the troubling aspects of Islamic law,,were developed into laterninterpretations of Islam. 
 Which means that Muslims can, today,,look at those things and say,,"Well, the core of our religionnis here to stay with us.,It's our faith,nand we will be loyal to it.,But we can change how it was interpreted,,because it was interpretednaccording to the time,and milieu in the Middle Ages.,Now we're living in a different world,,with different valuesnand political systems.",That interpretationnis quite possible and feasible. 
 Now, if I were the only personnthinking that way,,we would be in trouble.,But that's not the case at all.,Actually, from the 19th century on,,there's a whole revisionist, reformist --nwhatever you call it -- tradition,,a trend in Islamic thinking.,These were intellectuals or statesmen,of the 19th century,nand later, 20th century,,which looked at Europe, basically,,and saw that Europenhas many things to admire,,like science and technology.,But not just that;nalso democracy, parliament,,the idea of representation,,the idea of equal citizenship.,These Muslim thinkers, intellectualsnand statesmen of the 19th century,,looked at Europe,nsaw these things, and said,,"Why don't we have these things?",And they looked back at Islamic tradition,,and saw that there arenproblematic aspects,,but they're not the core of the religion,nso maybe they can be re-understood,,and the Koran can be rereadnin the modern world. 
 That trend is generally callednIslamic modernism,,and it was advancednby intellectuals and statesmen,,not just as an intellectual idea, though,,but also as a political program.,And that's why, actually,nin the 19th century,,the Ottoman Empire, which thenncovered the whole Middle East,,made very important reforms --,reforms like giving Christians and Jewsnan equal citizenship status,,accepting a constitution,,accepting a representative parliament,,advancing the idea of freedom of religion.,That's why the Ottoman Empire,nin its last decades,,turned into a proto-democracy,na constitutional monarchy,,and freedom was a very importantnpolitical value at the time. 
 Similarly, in the Arab world,,there was what the great Arabnhistorian Albert Hourani defines,as the Liberal Age.,He has a book, "Arabic Thoughtnin the Liberal Age,",and the Liberal Age, he definesnas 19th century and early 20th century.,Quite notably, this was the dominant trendnin the early 20th century,among Islamic thinkersnand statesmen and theologians.,But there is a very curious patternnin the rest of the 20th century,,because we see a sharp declinenin this Islamic modernist line.,And in place of that,,what happens is that Islamism growsnas an ideology which is authoritarian,,which is quite strident,,which is quite anti-Western,,and which wants to shape societynbased on a utopian vision. 
 So Islamism is the problematic idea,that really created a lot of problemsnin the 20th-century Islamic world.,And even the very extremenforms of Islamism,led to terrorism in the name of Islam --,which is actually a practicenthat I think is against Islam,,but some, obviously, extremists,ndid not think that way.,But there is a curious question:,If Islamic modernism was so popularnin the 19th and early 20th centuries,,why did Islamism become so popularnin the rest of the 20th century?,And this is a question, I think,nwhich needs to be discussed carefully.,In my book, I wentninto that question as well.,And actually, you don't need to bena rocket scientist to understand that.,Just look at the politicalnhistory of the 20th century,,and you see things have changed a lot.,The contexts have changed. 
 In the 19th century,,when Muslims were lookingnat Europe as an example,,they were independent;nthey were more self-confident.,In the early 20th century,nwith the fall of the Ottoman Empire,,the whole Middle East was colonized.,And when you have colonialization,nwhat do you have?,You have anti-colonialization.,So Europe is not justnan example now to emulate;,it's an enemy to fight and to resist.,So there's a very sharp declinenin liberal ideas in the Muslim world,,and what you see is more of a defensive,nrigid, reactionary strain,,which led to Arab socialism,nArab nationalism,and ultimately to the Islamist ideology.,And when the colonial period ended,,what you had in place of thatnwas generally secular dictators,,which say they're a country,,but did not bringndemocracy to the country,,and established their own dictatorship.,And I think the West,nat least some powers in the West,,particularly the United States,,made the mistake of supportingnthose secular dictators,,thinking that they were morenhelpful for their interests.,But the fact that those dictatorsnsuppressed democracy in their country,and suppressed Islamicngroups in their country,actually made the Islamistsnmuch more strident. 
 So in the 20th century,,you had this vicious cyclenin the Arab world,,where you have a dictatorshipnsuppressing its own people,,including the Islamic pious,,and they're reacting in reactionary ways.,There was one country, though,,which was able to escape or stay awaynfrom that vicious cycle.,And that's the countrynwhere I come from, Turkey.,Turkey has never been colonized,,so it remained as an independent nationnafter the fall of the Ottoman Empire.,That's one thing to remember;,it did not sharenthe same anti-colonial hype,that you can find in some otherncountries in the region.,Secondly, and most importantly,,Turkey became a democracy,earlier than any of the countriesnwe are talking about.,In 1950, Turkey had the firstnfree and fair elections,,which ended the morenautocratic secular regime,,which was in the beginning of Turkey.,And the pious Muslims in Turkey,saw that they could changenthe political system by voting.,And they realized that democracynis something compatible with Islam,,compatible with their values,,and they've been supportive of democracy.,That's an experience,that not every other Muslim nationnin the Middle East had,,until very recently. 
 Secondly, in the past two decades,,thanks to globalization,nthanks to the market economy,,thanks to the rise of a middle class,,we in Turkey see what I definenas a rebirth of Islamic modernism.,Now, there's the more urbannmiddle-class pious Muslims,who, again, look at their tradition,and see that there arensome problems in the tradition,,and understand that they need to benchanged and questioned and reformed.,And they look at Europe,nand see an example, again, to follow.,They see an example, at least,nto take some inspiration from.,That's why the EU process,nTurkey's effort to join the EU,,has been supported inside Turkeynby the Islamic pious,,while some secular nationalistsnwere against it.,Well, that processnhas been a little bit blurred,by the fact that not allnEuropeans are that welcoming,,but that's another discussion.,But the pro-EU sentimentnin Turkey in the past decade,has become almost an Islamic causenand supported by the Islamic liberals,and the secular liberalsnas well, of course. 
 And thanks to that,,Turkey has been ablento reasonably create a success story,in which Islam and the most piousnunderstandings of Islam,have become part of the democratic game,,and even contributes to the democraticnand economic advance of the country.,And this has beennan inspiring example right now,for some of the Islamic movements,or some of the countriesnin the Arab world. 
 You must have all seen the Arab Spring,,which began in Tunis and in Egypt.,Arab masses just revoltednagainst their dictators.,They were asking for democracy;nthey were asking for freedom.,And they did not turn out to benthe Islamist boogeyman,that the dictators were always usingnto justify their regime.,They said, "We want freedom;nwe want democracy.,We are Muslim believers,,but we want to be livingnas free people in free societies.",Of course, this is a long road.,Democracy is not an overnightnachievement; it's a process.,But this is a promising eranin the Muslim world. 
 And I believe that the Islamic modernismnwhich began in the 19th century,,but which had a setbacknin the 20th century,because of the politicalntroubles of the Muslim world,,is having a rebirth.,And I think the takeaway messagenfrom that would be that Islam,,despite some of the skeptics in the West,,has the potential in itself,to create its own way to democracy,ncreate its own way to liberalism,,create its own way to freedom.,They just should be allowednto work for that. 
 Thanks so much. 
 (Applause)So I'm going to tell you a little bit,about reimagining food.,I've been interested in food for a long time.,I taught myself to cook,with a bunch of big books like this.,I went to chef school in France.,And there is a way,the world both envisions food,,the way the world writes about food and learns about food.,And it's largely what you would find in these books.,And it's a wonderful thing.,But there's some things that have been going on,since this idea of food was established. 
 In the last 20 years,,people have realized that science,has a tremendous amount to do with food.,In fact, understanding why cooking works,requires knowing the science of cooking --,some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.,But that's not in any of those books.,There's also a tremendous number of techniques,that chefs have developed,,some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.,There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.,He's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.,A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal,,he's developed his avant-garde cuisine.,None of the techniques that these people have developed,over the course of the last 20 years,is in any of those books.,None of them are taught in cooking schools.,In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.,And finally,,there's the old way of viewing food,is the old way. 
 And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually --,I set out to say, is there a way,we can communicate science and technique and wonder?,Is there a way we can show people food,in a way they have not seen it before?,So we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.,This is a picture called a cutaway.,This is actually the first picture I took in the book.,The idea here is to explain what happens,when you steam broccoli.,And this magic view allows you to see,all of what's happening,while the broccoli steams.,Then each of the different little pieces around it,explain some fact. 
 And the hope was two-fold.,One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.,But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people,into stuff that was a little more technical,,maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y,than they otherwise would have.,Because with that beautiful photo,,maybe I can also package this little box here,that talks about how steaming and boiling,actually take different amounts of time.,Steaming ought to be faster.,It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,,and this explains that. 
 Well, that first cutaway picture worked,,so we said, "Okay, let's do some more.",So here's another one.,We discovered why woks are the shape they are.,This shaped wok doesn't work very well;,this caught fire three times.,But we had a philosophy,,which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second. 
 (Laughter) 
 And one of our canning cutaways.,Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,,so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.,And each of these text blocks,explains a key thing that's going on.,In this case, boiling water canning,is for canning things that are already pretty acidic.,You don't have to heat them up as hot,as you would something you do pressure canning,because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.,So this is great for pickled vegetables,,which is what we're canning here. 
 Here's our hamburger cutaway.,One of our philosophies in the book,is that no dish,is really intrinsically any better than any other dish.,So you can lavish,all the same care, all the same technique,,on a hamburger,as you would on some much more fancy dish.,And if you do lavish as much technique as possible,,and you try to make the highest quality hamburger,,it gets to be a little bit involved.,The New York Times ran a piece,after my book was delayed,and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger,Just Got Longer.",Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,,if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,,it does take about 30 hours.,Of course, you're not actually working the whole time.,Most of the time is kind of sitting there. 
 The point of this cutaway,is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before,and to explain the physics of hamburgers,and the chemistry of hamburgers,,because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry --,in particular, those flames underneath the burger.,Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste,doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.,Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.,Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.,So it's the fat that drips down and flares up,that causes the characteristic taste. 
 Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?,Most people assume we use Photoshop.,And the answer is: no, not really;,we use a machine shop.,And it turns out, the best way to cut things in half,is to actually cut them in half.,So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.,(Laughter),We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.,The manufacturer said,,"What would it take for you to cut one in half?",I said, "It would have to show up free.",And so it showed up, we used it a little while,,we cut it in half. 
 Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.,We would glue a piece of Pyrex,or heat-resistant glass in front.,We used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.,The great thing is, when you cut something in half,,you have another half.,So you photograph that in exactly the same position,,and then you can substitute in --,and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges.,So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie,where a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,,and then they take the wires away digitally,so you're flying through the air. 
 In most cases, though, there was no glass.,Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.,And so those coals that kept falling off the edge,,we kept having to put them back up.,But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.,The wok shot caught fire three times.,What happens when you have your wok cut in half,is the oil goes down into the fire,and whoosh!,One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.,But hey, they grow back. 
 In addition to cutaways,,we also explain physics.,This is Fourier's law of heat conduction.,It's a partial differential equation.,We have the only cookbook in the world,that has partial differential equations in it.,But to make them palatable,,we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire,and photographed it like this.,We've got lots of little tidbits in the book.,Everybody knows that your various appliances,have wattage, right?,But you probably don't know that much about James Watt.,But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.,It's a little couple paragraphs,to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,,and where he got his inspiration.,It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery,to understand why they were burning so damn much peat,to distill the whiskey. 
 We also did a lot of calculation.,I personally wrote thousands of lines of code,to write this cookbook.,Here's a calculation,that shows how the intensity of a barbecue,,or other radiant heat source, goes,as you move away from it.,So as you move vertically away from this surface,,the heat falls off.,As you move side to side, it moves off.,That horn-shaped region,is what we call the sweet spot.,That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.,So that's the place where you really want to cook.,And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,,which as far as I know, again,,the first cookbook to ever do this.,Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.,You know, there's two ways,you can make a product.,You can do lots of market research,and do focus groups,and figure out what people really want,,or you can just kind of go for it,and make the book you want and hope other people like it. 
 Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.,If you really want great hamburger,,it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.,And it's really simple, as you can see here.,As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,,and you just take it off in little passes,,build it up, slice it vertically.,Here's the final hamburger.,This is the 30-hour hamburger.,We make every aspect of this burger.,The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.,We also have things about how to make the bun.,There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on. 
 Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.,The popcorn is illustrating,a key thing in physics.,Isn't that beautiful?,We have a very high-speed camera,,which we had lots of fun with on the book.,The key physics principle here,is when water boils to steam,it expands by a factor of 1,600.,That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.,So it's a great illustration of that. 
 Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.,We have a chapter on gels.,And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI,,I thought, well, let's put in a recipe,for a ballistics gelatin.,Well, if you have a high-speed camera,,and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around,,pretty soon somebody does this.,(Gasps),Now the amazing thing here,is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic,what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that's why you shouldn't get shot.,The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down,,it falls back down as a nice block. 
 Anyway, here's the book.,Here it is.,2,438 pages.,And they're nice big pages too.,(Applause),A friend of mine complained,that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen,,so there's a sixth volume,that has washable, waterproof paper. 
 (Applause)In 2007,,I decided that we needed to reconceptualize,how we thought about economic development.,Our new goal should be,that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,,they should be able to choose between,at least a handful,of different cities,that were all competing to attract new residents.,Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.,There are billions of people in developing countries,who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.,But the amazing thing about cities,is they're worth so much more,than it costs to build them.,So we could easily supply the world,with dozens, maybe hundreds,,of new cities. 
 Now this might sound preposterous to you,if you've never thought about new cities.,But just substitute apartment building for cities.,Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;,the other half aren't there yet.,You could try and expand the capacity,by doing additions on all the existing apartments.,But you know what you'd run into,is those apartments and the surrounding areas,have rules to avoid discomfort,and the distractions of construction.,So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.,But you could go out someplace brand new,,build a brand new apartment building,,as long as the rules there,were ones that facilitated construction,rather than getting in the way.,So I proposed,that governments create new reform zones,big enough to hold cities,and gave them a name: charter cities. 
 Later I learned that at about this same time,,Javier and Octavio,were thinking about the challenge of reform,in Honduras.,They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year,would leave to go to the United States,,and they wanted to ask, what could they do,to make sure that those people could stay,and do the same things in Honduras.,At one point, Javier said to Octavio,,"What if we took some of our empty land --,what if we just gave it to an embassy --,give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --,and then if people want to go work,under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,,they can go get jobs,,do everything they do on those embassy grounds,that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?" 
 In the summer of 2009,,Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.,At the next regularly scheduled election,,Pepe Lobo won in a landslide,on a platform that promised reform,,but reconciliation as well.,He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.,Meanwhile, I was getting ready,to give a talk at TEDGlobal.,Through a process of refinement,,trial and error, a lot of user testing,,I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city,down to the bare essentials.,The first point was the importance of rules,,like those rules that say,you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.,We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,,but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,,and it's usually the rules that hold us back. 
 In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala,sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.,He showed it to Javier.,They called me.,They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country.",So in December we met in Miami,,in a hotel conference room.,I tried to explain this point,about how valuable cities are,,how much more valuable they are than they cost.,And I used this slide,showing how valuable the raw land is,in a place like New York City:,notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,,per square meter.,But it was a fairly abstract discussion,,and at some point when there was a pause,,Octavio said,,"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk." 
 (Laughing) 
 So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,,a charter city is a place,where you start with uninhabited land,,a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there,and then a chance for people to opt in,,to go live under those rules or not.,So I was asked by the president of Honduras,who said that we need to do this project,,this is important,,this could be the way forward for our country.,I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa,and talk again on January fourth and fifth.,So I presented,another fact-filled lecture,that included a slide like this,,which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,,it has to be very big.,This is a picture of Denver,,and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.,This airport alone,covers more than 100 square kilometers.,So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,,if you build a new city,,you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.,That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.,Everybody applauded politely.,The faces in the audience,were very serious and attentive.,The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,,"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,,but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.,I've got it here on my laptop.",So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk. 
 And it got to the essence,,which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.,There would be a choice of a city which you could go to,which could be in Honduras,,instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.,And it also involved new choices for leaders.,Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras,would need help from partner countries,,who could benefit from partner countries,who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,,so everybody can trust,that the charter really will be enforced.,And the insight of President Lobo,was that that assurance of enforcement,that I was thinking about,as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city,could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras,who had suffered for so many years,from fear and distrust. 
 We went and looked at a site.,This picture's from there.,It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.,And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,,they voted in the congress to amend their constitution,to have a constitutional provision,that allows for special development regions.,In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,,the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment,was 124 to one.,All parties, all factions in society, backed this.,To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.,On February 17th they passed it again,with another vote of 114 to one. 
 Immediately after that vote,,on February 21st to the 24th,,a delegation of about 30 Hondurans,went to the two places in the world,that are most interested in getting into the city building business.,One is South Korea.,This is a picture of a big, new city center,that's being built in South Korea --,bigger than downtown Boston.,Everything you see there was built in four years,,after they spent four years getting the permits.,The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.,They've actually built two cities already in China,and are preparing the third. 
 So if you think about this practically,,here's where we are.,They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.,They're putting in place a legal system,that could allow for managers to come in,,and also an external legal system.,One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court,be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.,There's designers and builders of cities,who are very interested.,They even can bring with them some financing.,But the one thing you know they've already solved,is that there's lots of tenants.,There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,,especially in a place with a free trade zone,,and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.,Around the world, there's 700 million people,who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. 
 There's a million a year,who leave Latin America to go to the United States.,Many of these are a father,who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --,sometimes a single mother,who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.,Sadly, sometimes there are even children,who are trying to get reunited with their parents,that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade. 
 So what kind of an idea is it,to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?,Or to build a dozen of these,,or a hundred of these, around the world?,What kind of an idea is it,to think about insisting,that every family have a choice of several cities,that are competing to attract new residents?,This is an idea worth spreading.,And my friends from Honduras,asked me to say thank you, TED. 
 (Applause)The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm,is actually quite simple.,We don't want Iran to get the bomb.,Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons,is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.,The gray boxes that you see,,these are real-time control systems.,Now if we manage to compromise these systems,that control drive speeds and valves,,we can actually cause a lot of problems,with the centrifuge.,The gray boxes don't run Windows software;,they are a completely different technology.,But if we manage,to place a good Windows virus,on a notebook,that is used by a maintenance engineer,to configure this gray box,,then we are in business.,And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. 
 So we start with a Windows dropper.,The payload goes onto the gray box,,damages the centrifuge,,and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --,mission accomplished.,That's easy, huh?,I want to tell you how we found that out.,When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,,it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.,The only thing that was known,is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,,used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.,And it seemed to want to do something,with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.,So that got our attention,,and we started a lab project,where we infected our environment with Stuxnet,and checked this thing out.,And then some very funny things happened.,Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat,that didn't like our cheese --,sniffed, but didn't want to eat.,Didn't make sense to me.,And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,,I realized, well, this is a directed attack.,It's completely directed.,The dropper is prowling actively,on the gray box,if a specific configuration is found,,and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect,is actually running on that target.,And if not, Stuxnet does nothing. 
 So that really got my attention,,and we started to work on this,nearly around the clock,,because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.,It could be, let's say for example,,a U.S. power plant,,or a chemical plant in Germany.,So we better find out what the target is soon.",So we extracted and decompiled,the attack code,,and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --,a smaller one and a bigger one.,And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered,by people who obviously had all insider information.,They knew all the bits and bites,that they had to attack.,They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.,So they know everything. 
 And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet,is complex and high-tech,,let me tell you this:,the payload is rocket science.,It's way above everything,that we have ever seen before.,Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.,We are talking about --,around about 15,000 lines of code.,Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.,And I want to tell you how we were able,to make sense out of this code.,So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,,because we know what they do. 
 And then we were looking for timers and data structures,and trying to relate them to the real world --,to potential real world targets.,So we do need target theories,that we can prove or disprove.,In order to get target theories,,we remember,that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,,it must be a high-value target,and it is most likely located in Iran,,because that's where most of the infections had been reported.,Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.,It basically boils down,to the Bushehr nuclear power plant,and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. 
 So I told my assistant,,"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.",And I phoned them up and picked their brain,in an effort to match their expertise,with what we found in code and data.,And that worked pretty well.,So we were able to associate,the small digital warhead,with the rotor control.,The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,,that black object that you see.,And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,,you are actually able to crack the rotor,and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.,What we also saw,is that the goal of the attack,was really to do it slowly and creepy --,obviously in an effort,to drive maintenance engineers crazy,,that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. 
 The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this,by looking very closely,at data and data structures.,So for example, the number 164,really stands out in that code;,you can't overlook it.,I started to research scientific literature,on how these centrifuges,are actually built in Natanz,and found they are structured,in what is called a cascade,,and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.,So that made sense, that was a match. 
 And it even got better.,These centrifuges in Iran,are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.,And guess what we found in the attack code?,An almost identical structure.,So again, that was a real good match.,And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.,Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.,These results have been obtained,over several weeks of really hard labor.,And we often went into just a dead end,and had to recover. 
 Anyway, so we figured out,that both digital warheads,were actually aiming at one and the same target,,but from different angles.,The small warhead is taking one cascade,,and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,,and the big warhead,is talking to six cascades,and manipulating valves.,So in all, we are very confident,that we have actually determined what the target is.,It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.,So we don't have to worry,that other targets,might be hit by Stuxnet. 
 Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --,really knocked my socks off.,Down there is the gray box,,and on the top you see the centrifuges.,Now what this thing does,is it intercepts the input values from sensors --,so for example, from pressure sensors,and vibration sensors --,and it provides legitimate program code,,which is still running during the attack,,with fake input data.,And as a matter of fact, this fake input data,is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.,So it's just like from the Hollywood movies,where during the heist,,the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.,That's cool, huh? 
 The idea here is obviously,not only to fool the operators in the control room.,It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.,The idea,is to circumvent a digital safety system.,We need digital safety systems,where a human operator could not act quick enough.,So for example, in a power plant,,when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,,you must open relief valves within a millisecond.,Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.,So this is where we need digital safety systems.,And when they are compromised,,then real bad things can happen.,Your plant can blow up.,And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.,That's scary. 
 But it gets worse.,And this is very important, what I'm going to say.,Think about this:,this attack is generic.,It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,,with centrifuges,,with uranium enrichment.,So it would work as well, for example,,in a power plant,or in an automobile factory.,It is generic.,And you don't have -- as an attacker --,you don't have to deliver this payload,by a USB stick,,as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.,You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.,Just spread it as wide as possible.,And if you do that,,what you end up with,is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.,That's the consequence,that we have to face.,So unfortunately,,the biggest number of targets for such attacks,are not in the Middle East.,They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.,So all of the green areas,,these are your target-rich environments.,We have to face the consequences,,and we better start to prepare right now. 
 Thanks.

 Chris Anderson: I've got a question.,Ralph, it's been quite widely reported,that people assume that Mossad,is the main entity behind this.,Is that your opinion? 
 Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?,Yeah. Okay.,My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,,but that the leading force is not Israel.,So the leading force behind that,is the cyber superpower.,There is only one,,and that's the United States --,fortunately, fortunately.,Because otherwise,,our problems would even be bigger. 
 CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph. 
 (Applause)The Highline,is an old, elevated rail line,that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.,And it was originally a freight line,that ran down 10th Ave.,And it became known as "Death Avenue",because so many people were run over by the trains,that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,,and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy.",But even with a cowboy,,about one person a month,was killed and run over.,So they elevated it.,They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.,But with the rise of interstate trucking,,it was used less and less.,And by 1980, the last train rode.,It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving --,from the meatpacking district.,And then it was abandoned. 
 And I live in the neighborhood,,and I first read about it in the New York Times,,in an article that said it was going to be demolished.,And I assumed someone was working,to preserve it or save it,and I could volunteer,,but I realized no one was doing anything.,I went to my first community board meeting --,which I'd never been to one before --,and sat next to another guy named Joshua David,,who's a travel writer.,And at the end of the meeting, we realized,we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project;,most people wanted to tear it down.,So we exchanged business cards,,and we kept calling each other,and decided to start this organization,,Friends of the High Line.,And the goal at first,was just saving it from demolition,,but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it. 
 And what first attracted me, or interested me,,was this view from the street --,which is this steel structure,,sort of rusty,,this industrial relic.,But when I went up on top,,it was a mile and a half of wildflowers,running right through the middle of Manhattan,with views of the Empire State Building,and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.,And that's really where we started,,the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park,,and let's have it be sort of inspired,by this wildscape. 
 At the time, there was a lot of opposition.,Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.,I'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits,and a lot of community engagement.,Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive,,but we still had to make the economic case.,This was after 9/11;,the city was in tough times.,So we commissioned an economic feasibility study,to try to make the case.,And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.,We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.,So far it's cost about 150 million.,And the main case was,,this is going to make good economic sense for the city.,So we said over a 20-year time period,,the value to the city in increased property values,and increased taxes,would be about 250 million.,That was enough. It really got the city behind it.,It turns out we were wrong on that.,Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars,,or will create about a half a billion dollars,,in tax revenues for the city.,We did a design competition,,selected a design team.,We worked with them to really create a design,that was inspired by that wildscape.,There's three sections. 
 We opened the fist section in 2009.,It's been successful beyond our dreams.,Last year we had about two million people,,which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.,This is one of my favorite features in section one.,It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.,And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.,The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value;,it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.,There's a point, you can stand here,and see buildings by Frank Gehry,,Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban,,Neil Denari.,And the Whitney is moving downtown,and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.,And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.,And they're going to break ground in May. 
 And we've already started construction on section two.,This is one of my favorite features,,this flyover where you're eight feet,off the surface of the High Line,,running through a canopy of trees.,The High Line used to be covered in billboards,,and so we've taken a playful take,where, instead of framing advertisements,,it's going to frame people in views of the city.,This was just installed last month.,And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards,,which is the largest undeveloped site,in Manhattan.,And the city has planned -- for better or for worse --,12 million square-feet of development,that the High Line is going to ring around. 
 But what really, I think, makes the High Line special,is the people.,And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building,,I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it,,because I fell in love with that wildscape --,and how could you recreate that magic?,But what I found,is it's in the people and how they use it,that, to me, makes it so special.,Just one quick example,is I realized right after we opened,that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.,And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands;,we just don't do that outside.,But you see that happening on the High Line,,and I think that's the power,that public space can have,to transform how people experience their city,and interact with each other. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)If I should have a daughter,,instead of "Mom,",she's going to call me "Point B,",because that way she knowsnthat no matter what happens,,at least she can always findnher way to me. 
 And I'm going to paint solar systemsnon the backs of her hands,so she has to learn the entire universe,before she can say, "Oh, I know thatnlike the back of my hand." 
 And she's going to learn,that this life will hit younhard in the face,,wait for you to get back up justnso it can kick you in the stomach.,But getting the wind knocked out of you,is the only way to remind your lungs,how much they like the taste of air.,There is hurt, here,,that cannot be fixednby Band-Aids or poetry. 
 So the first time she realizesnthat Wonder Woman isn't coming,,I'll make sure she knows,she doesn't have to wearnthe cape all by herself,,because no matter how widenyou stretch your fingers,,your hands will always be too small,to catch all the pain you want to heal.,Believe me, I've tried.,"And, baby," I'll tell her,,don't keep your nose upnin the air like that.,I know that trick;nI've done it a million times.,You're just smelling for smoke,so you can follow the trailnback to a burning house,,so you can find the boynwho lost everything in the fire,to see if you can save him.,Or else find the boy who litnthe fire in the first place,,to see if you can change him.,But I know she will anyway,,so instead I'll always keepnan extra supply,of chocolate and rain boots nearby,,because there is no heartbreaknthat chocolate can't fix.,Okay, there's a fewnthat chocolate can't fix. 
 But that's what the rain boots are for,,because rain will wash awayneverything, if you let it.,I want her to look at the world,through the undersidenof a glass-bottom boat,,to look through a microscope,at the galaxies that exist,on the pinpoint of a human mind,,because that's the way my mom taught me.,That there'll be days like this. 
 (Singing) There'll be daysnlike this, my momma said.,When you open your hands to catch,and wind up with onlynblisters and bruises;,when you step out of the phonenbooth and try to fly,and the very people you want to save,are the ones standing on your cape;,when your boots will fill with rain,,and you'll be up to your kneesnin disappointment.,And those are the very days you havenall the more reason to say thank you. 
 Because there's nothing more beautiful,than the way the ocean refusesnto stop kissing the shoreline,,no matter how many times it's sent away.,You will put the windnin win some, lose some.,You will put the starnin starting over, and over.,And no matter how many landnmines erupt in a minute,,be sure your mind lands,on the beauty of thisnfunny place called life.,And yes, on a scalenfrom one to over-trusting,,I am pretty damn naive.,But I want her to knownthat this world is made out of sugar.,It can crumble so easily,,but don't be afraid to sticknyour tongue out and taste it. 
 "Baby," I'll tell her, "remember,nyour momma is a worrier,,and your poppa is a warrior,,and you are the girlnwith small hands and big eyes,who never stops asking for more.",Remember that good things come in threes,and so do bad things.,Always apologize whennyou've done something wrong,,but don't you ever apologize,for the way your eyesnrefuse to stop shining.,Your voice is small,nbut don't ever stop singing.,And when they finally hand you heartache,,when they slip warnand hatred under your door,and offer you handouts on street-corners,of cynicism and defeat,,you tell them that they reallynought to meet your mother. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 All right, so I want you to take a moment,,and I want you to think of three thingsnthat you know to be true.,They can be about whatever you want --,technology, entertainment, design,,your family, what you had for breakfast.,The only rule is don't think too hard.,Okay, ready? Go.,Okay. 
 So here are three thingsnI know to be true.,I know that Jean-Luc Godardnwas right when he said that,,"A good story has a beginning,na middle and an end,,although not necessarily in that order.",I know that I'm incredibly nervousnand excited to be up here,,which is greatly inhibitingnmy ability to keep it cool. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I know,that I have been waitingnall week to tell this joke. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?,Because he was out standing in his field. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm sorry.,Okay, so these are three thingsnI know to be true.,But there are plenty of thingsnI have trouble understanding.,So I write poems to figure things out.,Sometimes the only way I knownhow to work through something,is by writing a poem.,Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,,look back and go,n"Oh, that's what this is all about,",and sometimes I get to the end of the poem,and haven't solved anything,,but at least I have a new poem out of it. 
 Spoken-word poetry is the artnof performance poetry.,I tell people it involves creating poetry,that doesn't just want to sit on paper,,that something about itndemands it be heard out loud,or witnessed in person. 
 When I was a freshman in high school,,I was a live wire of nervous hormones.,And I was underdevelopednand over-excitable.,And despite my fear,of ever being looked at for too long,,I was fascinated by the ideanof spoken-word poetry.,I felt that my two secret loves,npoetry and theater,,had come together, had a baby,,a baby I needed to get to know.,So I decided to give it a try.,My first spoken-word poem,,packed with all the wisdomnof a 14-year-old,,was about the injustice,of being seen as unfeminine.,The poem was very indignant,,and mainly exaggerated,,but the only spoken-word poetrynthat I had seen up until that point,was mainly indignant,,so I thoughtnthat's what was expected of me. 
 The first time that I performed,,the audience of teenagers hootednand hollered their sympathy,,and when I came off the stage,nI was shaking.,I felt this tap on my shoulder,,and I turned around to see,this giant girl in a hoodiensweatshirt emerge from the crowd.,She was maybe eight feet tall,and looked like she couldnbeat me up with one hand,,but instead she just noddednat me and said,,"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks.",And lightning struck.,I was hooked. 
 I discovered this barnon Manhattan's Lower East Side,that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,,and my bewildered,nbut supportive, parents took me,to soak in every ouncenof spoken word that I could.,I was the youngest by at least a decade,,but somehow the poetsnat the Bowery Poetry Club,didn't seem botherednby the 14-year-old wandering about.,In fact, they welcomed me. 
 And it was here, listening to these poetsnshare their stories,,that I learned that spoken-wordnpoetry didn't have to be indignant,,it could be fun or painful,or serious or silly.,The Bowery Poetry Club becamenmy classroom and my home,,and the poets who performed,encouraged me to share my stories as well.,Never mind the fact that I was 14.,They told me, "Write about being 14.",So I did and stood amazed every week,when these brilliant, grown-up poets,laughed with me and groaned their sympathy,and clapped and told me,n"Hey, I really felt that too." 
 Now I can divide my spoken-word journey,into three steps.,Step one was the moment I said,,"I can. I can do this.",And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.,Step two was the moment I said,,"I will. I will continue.,I love spoken word. I will keepncoming back week after week.",And step three began,when I realized I didn't havento write indignant poems,,if that's not what I was.,There were thingsnthat were specific to me,,and the more that I focusednon those things,,the weirder my poetry got,,but the more that it felt like mine.,It's not just the adagen"Write what you know.",It's about gathering upnall of the knowledge and experience,you've collected up to now,to help you dive into the thingsnyou don't know.,I use poetry to help me worknthrough what I don't understand,,but I show up to each new poem,with a backpack fullnof everywhere else that I've been. 
 When I got to university,nI met a fellow poet,who shared my belief in the magicnof spoken-word poetry.,And actually, Phil Kaye and I,coincidentally also sharenthe same last name.,When I was in high school I hadncreated Project V.O.I.C.E.,as a way to encourage my friendsnto do spoken word with me.,But Phil and I decided to reinventnProject V.O.I.C.E.,,this time changing the mission,to using spoken-word poetrynas a way to entertain,,educate and inspire.,We stayed full-time students,nbut in between we traveled,,performing and teaching,nine-year-olds to MFA candidates,,from California to Indiana to India,to a public high schoolnjust up the street from campus. 
 And we saw over and over,the way that spoken-word poetry,cracks open locks.,But it turns out sometimes,npoetry can be really scary.,Turns out sometimes,,you have to trick teenagersninto writing poetry.,So I came up with lists.nEveryone can write lists.,And the first list that I assign,is "10 Things I Know to be True.",And here's what happens,nyou would discover it too,if we all started sharingnour lists out loud.,At a certain point, you would realizenthat someone has the exact same thing,,or one thing very similar,,to something on your list.,And then someone else,has something the completenopposite of yours.,Third, someone has somethingnyou've never even heard of before.,Fourth, someone has somethingnyou thought you knew everything about,,but they're introducingna new angle of looking at it.,And I tell people that this isnwhere great stories start from --,these four intersections,of what you're passionate about,and what others might be invested in. 
 And most people respondnreally well to this exercise.,But one of my students,na freshman named Charlotte,,was not convinced.,Charlotte was very good at writing lists,nbut she refused to write any poems.,"Miss," she'd say,n"I'm just not interesting.,I don't have anything interesting to say.",So I assigned her list after list,,and one day I assigned the list,"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now.",Number three on Charlotte's list was,,"I should have learnednnot to crush on guys,three times my age.",I asked her what that meant,,and she said, "Miss,nit's kind of a long story.",And I said, "Charlotte, it soundsnpretty interesting to me.",And so she wrote her first poem,,a love poem unlike anynI had ever heard before.,And the poem began,,"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Did you see him on 60 Minutes,,racing Michael Phelps in a pool --,nothing but swim trunks on --,diving in the water, determinednto beat this swimming champion?,After the race, he tossednhis wet, cloud-white hair,and said, 'You're a god.',No, Anderson, you're the god." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I know that the number onenrule to being cool,is to seem unfazed,,to never admit that anything scares you,or impresses you or excites you.,Somebody once told me,it's like walking through life like this.,You protect yourself,from all the unexpected miseriesnor hurt that might show up.,But I try to walk through life like this.,And yes, that means catchingnall of those miseries and hurt,,but it also meansnthat when beautiful, amazing things,just fall out of the sky,,I'm ready to catch them.,I use spoken word to help my students,rediscover wonder,,to fight their instinctsnto be cool and unfazed,and, instead, actively pursue beingnengaged with what goes on around them,,so that they can reinterpretnand create something from it. 
 It's not that I thinknthat spoken-word poetry,is the ideal art form.,I'm always trying to findnthe best way to tell each story.,I write musicals; I make short filmsnalongside my poems.,But I teach spoken-word poetry,because it's accessible.,Not everyone can read musicnor owns a camera,,but everyone can communicate in some way,,and everyone has storiesnthat the rest of us can learn from.,Plus, spoken-word poetry allowsnfor immediate connection.,It's not uncommonnto feel like you're alone,or that nobody understands you,,but spoken word teaches,that if you have the abilitynto express yourself,and the courage to presentnthose stories and opinions,,you could be rewarded,with a room full of your peers,,or your community, who will listen.,And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie,who will connect with what you've shared.,And that is an amazingnrealization to have,,especially when you're 14.,Plus, now with YouTube,,that connection's not even limitednto the room we're in.,I'm so lucky that there'snthis archive of performances,that I can share with my students.,It allows for even more opportunities,for them to find a poet or a poemnthat they connect to. 
 Once you've figured this out,,it is tempting to keepnwriting the same poem,,or keep telling the same story,nover and over,,once you've figured outnthat it will gain you applause.,It's not enough to just teachnthat you can express yourself.,You have to grow and explore,and take risks and challenge yourself.,And that is step three:,infusing the work you're doing,with the specific thingsnthat make you you,,even while those thingsnare always changing.,Because step three never ends.,But you don't get to start on step three,,until you take step one first:,"I can." 
 I travel a lot while I'm teaching,,and I don't always get to watchnall of my students reach their step three,,but I was very lucky with Charlotte,,that I got to watch her journeynunfold the way it did.,I watched her realize,that, by putting the things that she knowsnto be true into the work she's doing,,she can create poemsnthat only Charlotte can write,,about eyeballs and elevatorsnand Dora the Explorer.,And I'm trying to tellnstories only I can tell --,like this story.,I spent a lot of time thinkingnabout the best way to tell this story,,and I wondered if the best way,was going to bena PowerPoint, a short film --,And where exactly was the beginning,nthe middle or the end?,I wondered whether I'd getnto the end of this talk,and finally havenfigured it all out, or not. 
 And I always thought that my beginningnwas at the Bowery Poetry Club,,but it's possiblenthat it was much earlier.,In preparing for TED,,I discovered this diary pagenin an old journal.,I think December 54thnwas probably supposed to be 24th.,It's clear that when I was a child,,I definitely walkednthrough life like this.,I think that we all did.,I would like to help othersnrediscover that wonder --,to want to engage with it,nto want to learn,,to want to share what they've learned,,what they've figured out to be true,and what they're still figuring out. 
 So I'd like to close with this poem. 
 When they bombed Hiroshima,,the explosion formed a mini-supernova,,so every living animal, human or plant,that received direct contactnwith the rays from that sun,was instantly turned to ash.,And what was leftnof the city soon followed.,The long-lasting damagenof nuclear radiation,caused an entire city and its population,to turn into powder.,When I was born, my mom saysnI looked around the whole hospital room,with a stare that said,n"This? I've done this before.",She says I have old eyes.,When my Grandpa Genji died,nI was only five years old,,but I took my momnby the hand and told her,,"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby.",And yet, for someonenwho's apparently done this already,,I still haven't figured anything out yet.,My knees still bucklenevery time I get on a stage.,My self-confidence can be measured out,in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,,and it still alwaysntastes funny in my mouth.,But in Hiroshima, some peoplenwere wiped clean away,,leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.,So no matter that I have inhibitionsnto fill all my pockets,,I keep trying,,hoping that one day I'll write a poem,I can be proud to let sitnin a museum exhibit,as the only proof I existed.,My parents named me Sarah,nwhich is a biblical name.,In the original story, God told Sarahnshe could do something impossible, and --,she laughed,,because the first Sarah,,she didn't know what to donwith impossible.,And me?,Well, neither do I,,but I see the impossible every day.,Impossible is tryingnto connect in this world,,trying to hold onto others while thingsnare blowing up around you,,knowing that while you're speaking,,they aren't just waiting for their turnnto talk -- they hear you.,They feel exactly what you feel,at the same time that you feel it.,It's what I strive for every timenI open my mouth --,that impossible connection.,There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima,that was completely burntnblack by the radiation.,But on the front step,na person who was sitting there,blocked the rays from hitting the stone.,The only thing left now,is a permanent shadow of positive light.,After the A-bomb,,specialists said it would take 75 years,for the radiation-damagednsoil of Hiroshima City,to ever grow anything again.,But that spring, there werennew buds popping up from the earth.,When I meet you, in that moment,,I'm no longer a part of your future.,I start quickly becomingnpart of your past.,But in that instant,nI get to share your present.,And you, you get to share mine.,And that is the greatest present of all.,So if you tell menI can do the impossible --,I'll probably laugh at you.,I don't know if I can changenthe world yet,,because I don't know that much about it --,and I don't know that muchnabout reincarnation either,,but if you make me laugh hard enough,,sometimes I forget what century I'm in.,This isn't my first time here.nThis isn't my last time here.,These aren't the last words I'll share.,But just in case, I'm trying my hardest,to get it right this time around. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a contemporary artist,with a bit of an unexpected background.,I was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.,I grew up in the middle of nowhere,on a dirt road in rural Arkansas,,an hour from the nearest movie theater.,And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist,because I grew up around quirky, colorful characters,who were great at making with their hands.,And my childhood is more hick,than I could ever possibly relate to you,,and also more intellectual than you would ever expect.,For instance, me and my sister, when we were little,,we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains.,(Laughter),But on the other side of that, though,,we were big readers in our house.,And if the TV was on, we were watching a documentary.,And my dad is the most voracious reader I know.,He can read a novel or two a day. 
 But when I was little, I remember,,he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun.,And what was so amazing to me about that --,well he would be in his recliner, would holler for me to fetch the BB gun,,and I'd go get it.,And what was amazing to me --,well it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun --,but what was so amazing to me,was that he knew just enough how to pump it.,And he could shoot it from two rooms away,and not damage what it was on,because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly,and not damage what it landed on. 
 So I should talk about art.,(Laughter),Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories.,I love contemporary art,,but I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world,and the contemporary art scene.,A few years ago,,I spent months in Europe,to see the major international art exhibitions,that have the pulse,of what is supposed to be going on in the art world.,And I was struck,by going to so many, one after the other,,with some clarity of what it was,that I was longing for.,And I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting,,or not getting enough of.,But two of the main things:,one of it, I was longing for more work,that was appealing to a broad public,,that was accessible.,And the second thing that I was longing for,was some more exquisite craftsmanship,and technique. 
 So I started thinking and listing,what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial.,So I decided,,I'm going to start my own biennial.,I'm going to organize it and direct it,and get it going in the world.,So I thought, okay,,I have to have some criteria of how to choose work.,So amongst all the criteria I have,,there's two main things.,One of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.,And what that is,is I imagine explaining a work of art,to my grandmother in five minutes,,and if I can't explain it in five minutes,,then it's too obtuse,or esoteric,and it hasn't been refined enough yet.,It needs to worked on,until it can speak fluently.,And then my other second set of rules --,I hate to say "rules" because it's art --,my criteria would be,the three H's,,which is head, heart and hands.,And great art would have "head":,it would have interesting intellectual ideas,and concepts.,It would have "heart" in that it would have passion,and heart and soul.,And it would have "hand" in that it would be greatly crafted. 
 So I started thinking about,how am I going to do this biennial,,how am I going to travel the world,and find these artists?,And then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this.,I'm just going to make the whole thing myself.,(Laughter),And so this is what I did.,So I thought, a biennial needs artists.,I'm going to do an international biennial; I need artists from all around the world.,So what I did was,I invented a hundred artists from around the world.,I figured out their bios, their passions in life,and their art styles,,and I started making their work. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.,So I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial.,It's going to be two years of studio work.,And I'm going to create this in two years,,and I have.,So I should start to talk about these guys.,Well the range is quite a bit.,And I'm such a technician, so I loved this project,,getting to play with all the techniques.,So for example, in realist paintings,,it ranges from this,,which is kind of old masters style,,to really realistic still-life,,to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair.,And then at the other end, there's performance and short films,and indoor installations,like this indoor installation,and this one,,and outdoor installations like this one,and this one.,I know I should mention: I'm making all these things.,This isn't Photoshopped.,I'm under the river with those fish. 
 So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you.,This is Nell Remmel.,Nell is interested in agricultural processes,,and her work is based in these practices.,This piece, which is called "Flipped Earth" --,she was interested in taking the sky,and using it to cleanse barren ground.,And by taking giant mirrors --,(Applause),and here she's taking giant mirrors,and pulling them into the dirt.,And this is 22 feet long.,And what I loved about her work,is, when I would walk around it,and look down into the sky,,looking down to watch the sky,,and it unfolded in a new way.,And probably the best part of this piece,is at dusk and dawn,when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,,but there's still the light above, bright above.,And so you're standing there and everything else is dark,,but there's this portal that you want to jump in.,This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.,And I love to dig a hole.,So this piece was great fun,because it was two days of digging in soft dirt. 
 The next artist is Kay Overstry,,and she's interested in ephemerality and transience.,And in her most recent project,,it's called "Weather I Made.",And she's making weather,on her body's scale.,And this piece is "Frost.",And what she did was she went out on a cold, dry night,and breathed back and forth on the lawn,to leave --,to leave her life's mark,,the mark of her life.,(Applause),And so this is five-foot, five-inches of frost,that she left behind.,The sun rises, and it melts away.,And that was played by my mom. 
 So the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists,,a collective of Japanese artists --,(Laughter),in Tokyo.,And they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space,,and they needed funding for it,,so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.,One of these is scratch-off masterpieces.,(Laughter),And so what they're doing --,each of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card,,which they sell for 10 bucks,,they drew original works of art.,And you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not.,Well this has sparked a craze in Japan,,because everyone's wanting a masterpiece.,And the ones that are the most sought after,are the ones that are only barely scratched off.,And all these works, in some way,,talk about luck or fate or chance.,Those first two,are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win. 
 And in this one it's called "Drawing the Short Stick.",(Laughter),I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home,who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction --,to a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea.,He draws sticks real good.",(Laughter),Which is one of the best compliments ever. 
 This artist is Gus Weinmueller,,and he's doing a project, a large project, called "Art for the Peoples.",And within this project, he's doing a smaller project,called "Artists in Residence.",And what he does is --,(Laughter),he spends a week at a time with a family.,And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,,with a toothbrush and pajamas,,and he's ready to spend the week with them.,And using only what's present,,he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.,And he spends that week talking to the family,about what do they think great art is.,He has all these discussions with their family,,and he digs through everything they have,,and he finds materials to make work.,And he makes a work,that answers what they think great art is.,For this family, he made this still-life painting.,And whatever he makes,somehow references nesting and space,and personal property. 
 This next project,,this is by Jaochim Parisvega,,and he's interested in --,he believes art is everywhere waiting --,that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen.,And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces,,like in his series where he used rain to make paintings.,This project is called "Love Nests.",What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.,So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them,,and they crafted his nests for him.,And this one's called "Lovelock's Nest.",This one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest.",(Laughter),And this one's called "Lovemaking Nest.",(Laughted) 
 Next is Sylvia Slater.,Sylvia's interested in art training.,She's a very serious Swiss artist.,(Laughter),And she was thinking about her friends and family,who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries,,and she was thinking,,what can I make that would be of value to them,,in case something bad happens,and they have to buy their way across the border,or pay off a gunman?,And so she came up with creating,these pocket-sized artworks,that are portraits of the person that would carry them.,And you would carry this around with you,,and if everything went to hell, you could make payments,and buy your life.,So this life price,is for an irrigation non-profit director.,So hopefully what happens is you never use it,,and it's an heirloom that you pass down.,And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments,,or they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.,And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.,And this one had to get broken up.,He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently. 
 This is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.,And they're interested in creating culture,,just tradition.,So what they do is they move into an area,and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.,So this is in Eastern Tennessee,,and what they decided was,that we need a positive tradition,that goes with death.,So they came up with "dig jigs.",And a dig jig --,a dig jig is where,,for a milestone anniversary or a birthday,,you gather all your friends and family together,and you dance on where you're going to be buried.,(Laughter),And we got a lot of attention when we did it.,I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.,And I was like, "Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work.",And so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious --,the attention that we got.,So what happens is you dance on the grave,,and after you've done your dance,,everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are.,And you in essence have a funeral,that you get to be present for.,That's my mom and dad. 
 This is by Jason Birdsong.,He is interested in how we see as an animal,,how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.,You know, we look down a dark alley,or a jungle path,,trying to make out a face or a creature.,We just have that natural way of seeing.,And he plays with this idea.,And this piece: those aren't actually leaves.,They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage.,So he pairs these up.,There's another pile of leaves.,Those are actually all real butterfly specimens.,And he pairs these up with paintings.,Like this is a painting of a snake in a box.,So you open the box and you think, "Whoa, there's a snake in there.",But it's actually a painting.,So he makes these interesting conversations,about realism and mimicry,and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage. 
 (Laughter) 
 The next artist is Hazel Clausen.,Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical,and decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture,if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch.",So that's what she did.,She created the Swiss people named the Uvulites,,and they have this distinctive yodeling song,that they use the uvula for.,And also they reference how the uvula --,everything they say is fallen,because of the forbidden fruit.,And that's the symbol of their culture.,And this is from a documentary,called "Sexual Practices and Populations Control,Among the Uvulites.",This is a typical angora embroidery for them.,This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.,(Laughter),And actually this is my Aunt Irene.,It was so funny having a fake person,who was making fake things.,And I crack up at this piece,,because when I see it I know that's French angora,and all antique German ribbons,and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill,and carried around for 10 years,and then antique Chinese skirts. 
 The next is a collective of artists,called the Silver Dobermans,,and their motto is to spread pragmatism,one person at a time.,(Laughter),And they're really interested,in how over-coddled we've become.,So this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.,And what they've done,is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence.,(Laughter),(Applause),And this is called "Horse Sense Fence." 
 The next artist is K. M. Yoon,,a really interesting South Korean artist.,And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition,of scholar stones.,Next is Maynard Sipes.,And I love Maynard Sipes,,but he's off in his own world,,and, bless his heart, he's so paranoid.,Next is Roy Penig,,a really interesting Kentucky artist,,and he's the nicest guy.,He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese,because the person wanted it so badly. 
 Next is an Australian artist, Janeen Jackson,,and this is from a project of hers,called "What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching.",(Laughter),Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller, Jurgi Petrauskas.,Next is Ginger Cheshire.,This is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person.",And that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.,The next, this is by Sam Sandy.,He's an Australian Aboriginal elder,,and he's also an artist.,And this is from a large traveling sculpture project,that he's doing. 
 This is from Estelle Willoughsby.,She heals with color.,And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists,,even though she's going to be 90 next year.,(Laughter),This is by Z. Zhou,,and he's interested in stasis.,Next is by Hilda Singh,,and she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits." 
 Next is by Vera Sokolova.,And I have to say, Vera kind of scares me.,You can't look her directly in the eyes,because she's kind of scary.,And it's good that she's not real;,she'd be mad that I said that.,(Laughter),And she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg,,and she plays with optics.,Next, this is by Thomas Swifton.,This is from a short film, "Adventures with Skinny.",(Laughter),And this is by Cicily Bennett,,and it's from a series of short films. 
 And after this one, there's 77 other artists.,And all together with those other 77 you're not seeing,,that's my biennial.,Thank you. Thank you.,Thanks.,(Applause),Thank you. Thanks.,(Applause)So I just want to tell you my story.,I spend a lot of time,teaching adults how to use visual language,and doodling in the workplace.,And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,,because it's considered to be anti-intellectual,and counter to serious learning.,But I have a problem with that belief,,because I know that doodling has a profound impact,on the way that we can process information,and the way that we can solve problems. 
 So I was curious about why there was a disconnect,between the way our society perceives doodling,and the way that the reality is.,So I discovered some very interesting things.,For example, there's no such thing,as a flattering definition of a doodle.,In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool --,as in Yankee Doodle.,In the 18th century, it became a verb,,and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.,In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.,And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,,at least to me, which is the following:,To doodle officially means,to dawdle,,to dilly dally, to monkey around,,to make meaningless marks,,to do something of little value, substance or import,,and -- my personal favorite --,to do nothing.,No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.,Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work;,it's totally inappropriate. 
 (Laughter) 
 Additionally, I've heard horror stories,from people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.,And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.,There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling,in settings in which we are supposed to learn something.,And unfortunately,,the press tends to reinforce this norm,when they're reporting on a doodling scene --,of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like --,they typically use words like "discovered",or "caught" or "found out,",as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed. 
 And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling --,thank you, Freud.,In the 1930s, Freud told us all,that you could analyze people's psyches,based on their doodles.,This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair,at the Davos Forum in 2005,,when his doodles were, of course, "discovered",and he was labeled the following things.,Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.,(Laughter),And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.,But that does contribute,to people not wanting to share their doodles. 
 And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.,I think that our culture,is so intensely focused on verbal information,that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.,And I'm not comfortable with that.,And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,,I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.,And here's the truth:,doodling is an incredibly powerful tool,,and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn. 
 So here's a new definition for doodling.,And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary,,because I want to talk to you later.,Here's the real definition:,Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.,That is why millions of people doodle.,Here's another interesting truth about the doodle:,People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information,retain more of that information,than their non-doodling counterparts.,We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus,,but in reality, it is a preemptive measure,to stop you from losing focus.,Additionally, it has a profound effect,on creative problem-solving,and deep information processing. 
 There are four ways that learners intake information,so that they can make decisions.,They are visual, auditory,,reading and writing and kinesthetic.,Now in order for us to really chew on information,and do something with it,,we have to engage at least two of those modalities,,or we have to engage one of those modalities,coupled with an emotional experience.,The incredible contribution of the doodle,is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously,with the possibility of an emotional experience.,That is a pretty solid contribution,for a behavior equated with doing nothing. 
 This is so nerdy,,but this made me cry when I discovered this.,So they did anthropological research,into the unfolding of artistic activity in children,,and they found that, across space and time,,all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic,as they grow.,In other words, they have a shared and growing,complexity in visual language,that happens in a predictable order.,And I think that is incredible.,I think that means doodling is native to us,and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.,And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,,but the doodle is a precursor,to some of our greatest cultural assets.,This is but one:,this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi. 
 So here is my point:,Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated,from a classroom or a boardroom,or even the war room.,On the contrary,,doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations,where information density is very high,and the need for processing that information is very high.,And I will go you one further.,Because doodling is so universally accessible,and it is not intimidating as an art form,,it can be leveraged as a portal,through which we move people,into higher levels of visual literacy.,My friends, the doodle has never been,the nemesis of intellectual thought.,In reality, it is one of its greatest allies. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Meet Tony. He's my student.,He's about my age,,and he's in San Quentin State Prison.,When Tony was 16 years old,,one day, one moment,,"It was mom's gun.,Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.,He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.,Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.',My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.',I say, 'Let's do this.'",And those three words, Tony's going to remember,,because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.,There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.,And that's felony murder --,25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,,and Tony's not feeling very lucky. 
 So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison,and I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,",Tony interrupts me.,"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?,I know what is wrong. I have done wrong.,I am told every day,,by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.,If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.,I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.',What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?" 
 So I say to Tony,,"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.,You think you know right and wrong?,Then can you tell me what wrong is?,No, don't just give me an example.,I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.,What is that idea?,What makes something wrong?,How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.,Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.,Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions;,everyone's got an opinion.,We are here for knowledge.,Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy." 
 And something changes for Tony.,"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.,I want to know what is wrong.,I want to know what I know.",What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,,the project that begins in wonder --,what Kant called "admiration and awe,at the starry sky above and the moral law within.",What can creatures like us know of such things?,It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence --,what Heidegger called "the always already there.",It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it --,what Socrates called "the examined life.",Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.,Socrates died in prison,,his philosophy intact. 
 So Tony starts doing his homework.,He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,,his logic, his fallacies.,Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.,His body is in prison, but his mind is free.,Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,,the epistemologically anxious,,the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.,That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche,and Bill Clinton. 
 So when he gives me his final paper,,in which he argues that the categorical imperative,is perhaps too uncompromising,to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday,and challenges me to tell him,whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,,I say, "I don't know.,Let us think about that.",Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;,it's just the two of us standing there.,It is not professor and convict,,it is just two minds ready to do philosophy.,And I say to Tony,,"Let's do this." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)First, a video.,Yes, it is a scrambled egg.,But as you look at it,,I hope you'll begin to feelnjust slightly uneasy.,Because you may noticenthat what's actually happening,is that the egg is unscrambling itself.,And you'll now see the yolknand the white have separated.,And now they're going to benpoured back into the egg.,And we all know in our heart of hearts,that this is not the waynthe universe works.,A scrambled egg is mush --ntasty mush -- but it's mush.,An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing,that can create even morensophisticated things,,such as chickens.,And we know in our heart of hearts,that the universe does not travelnfrom mush to complexity.,In fact, this gut instinct,is reflected in one of the mostnfundamental laws of physics,,the second law of thermodynamics,nor the law of entropy.,What that says basically,is that the generalntendency of the universe,is to move from order and structure,to lack of order, lack of structure --,in fact, to mush.,And that's why that videonfeels a bit strange. 
 And yet, look around us.,What we see around usnis staggering complexity.,Eric Beinhocker estimatesnthat in New York City alone,,there are some 10 billion SKUs,nor distinct commodities, being traded.,That's hundreds of timesnas many species as there are on Earth.,And they're being traded by a speciesnof almost seven billion individuals,,who are linked by trade,ntravel, and the Internet,into a global systemnof stupendous complexity. 
 So here's a great puzzle:,in a universe rulednby the second law of thermodynamics,,how is it possible,to generate the sortnof complexity I've described,,the sort of complexitynrepresented by you and me,and the convention center?,Well, the answer seems to be,,the universe can create complexity,,but with great difficulty.,In pockets,,there appearnwhat my colleague, Fred Spier,,calls "Goldilocks conditions" --,not too hot, not too cold,,just right for the creation of complexity.,And slightly more complex things appear.,And where you havenslightly more complex things,,you can get slightly more complex things.,And in this way, complexitynbuilds stage by stage.,Each stage is magical,because it creates the impressionnof something utterly new,appearing almost out of nowherenin the universe.,We refer in big history to these momentsnas threshold moments.,And at each threshold,nthe going gets tougher.,The complex things get more fragile,,more vulnerable;,the Goldilocks conditionsnget more stringent,,and it's more difficultnto create complexity. 
 Now, we, as extremely complex creatures,,desperately need to know this story,of how the universe creates complexityndespite the second law,,and why complexity meansnvulnerability and fragility.,And that's the storynthat we tell in big history.,But to do it, you have do something,that may, at first sight,nseem completely impossible.,You have to survey the wholenhistory of the universe.,So let's do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's begin by winding the timeline back,13.7 billion years,,to the beginning of time. 
 Around us, there's nothing.,There's not even time or space.,Imagine the darkest,nemptiest thing you can,and cube it a gazillion timesnand that's where we are.,And then suddenly,,bang!,A universe appears, an entire universe.,And we've crossed our first threshold.,The universe is tiny;nit's smaller than an atom.,It's incredibly hot.,It contains everythingnthat's in today's universe,,so you can imagine, it's busting.,And it's expanding at incredible speed.,And at first, it's just a blur,,but very quickly distinct thingsnbegin to appear in that blur.,Within the first second,,energy itself shattersninto distinct forces,including electromagnetism and gravity.,And energy does somethingnelse quite magical:,it congeals to form matter --,quarks that will create protons,and leptons that include electrons.,And all of that happensnin the first second. 
 Now we move forward 380,000 years.,That's twice as long as humansnhave been on this planet.,And now simple atoms appearnof hydrogen and helium.,Now I want to pause for a moment,,380,000 years after the originsnof the universe,,because we actually know quite a lotnabout the universe at this stage.,We know above allnthat it was extremely simple.,It consisted of huge cloudsnof hydrogen and helium atoms,,and they have no structure.,They're really a sort of cosmic mush.,But that's not completely true.,Recent studies,by satellites such as the WMAP satellite,have shown that, in fact,,there are just tiny differencesnin that background.,What you see here,,the blue areas are about a thousandthnof a degree cooler,than the red areas.,These are tiny differences,,but it was enoughnfor the universe to move on,to the next stage of building complexity. 
 And this is how it works.,Gravity is more powerfulnwhere there's more stuff.,So where you get slightly denser areas,,gravity starts compacting cloudsnof hydrogen and helium atoms.,So we can imagine the early universenbreaking up into a billion clouds.,And each cloud is compacted,,gravity gets more powerfulnas density increases,,the temperature begins to risenat the center of each cloud,,and then, at the center,,the temperature crossesnthe threshold temperature,of 10 million degrees,,protons start to fuse,,there's a huge release of energy,,and --,bam!,We have our first stars.,From about 200 million yearsnafter the Big Bang,,stars begin to appearnall through the universe,,billions of them.,And the universe is nownsignificantly more interesting,and more complex. 
 Stars will createnthe Goldilocks conditions,for crossing two new thresholds.,When very large stars die,,they create temperatures so high,that protons begin to fusenin all sorts of exotic combinations,,to form all the elementsnof the periodic table.,If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,,it was forged in a supernova explosion.,So now the universenis chemically more complex.,And in a chemically more complex universe,,it's possible to make more things.,And what starts happeningnis that, around young suns,,young stars,,all these elements combine,nthey swirl around,,the energy of the star stirs them around,,they form particles, they form snowflakes,nthey form little dust motes,,they form rocks, they form asteroids,,and eventually,nthey form planets and moons.,And that is how ournsolar system was formed,,four and a half billion years ago.,Rocky planets like our Earthnare significantly more complex than stars,because they containna much greater diversity of materials.,So we've crossed a fourthnthreshold of complexity. 
 Now, the going gets tougher.,The next stage introduces entitiesnthat are significantly more fragile,,significantly more vulnerable,,but they're also much more creative,and much more capablenof generating further complexity.,I'm talking, of course,nabout living organisms.,Living organisms are created by chemistry.,We are huge packages of chemicals.,So, chemistry is dominatednby the electromagnetic force.,That operates over smallernscales than gravity,,which explains why you and Inare smaller than stars or planets.,Now, what are the idealnconditions for chemistry?,What are the Goldilocks conditions?,Well, first, you need energy,,but not too much.,In the center of a star,nthere's so much energy,that any atoms that combinenwill just get busted apart again.,But not too little.,In intergalactic space,,there's so little energynthat atoms can't combine.,What you want is just the right amount,,and planets, it turns out, are just right,,because they're close to stars,nbut not too close. 
 You also need a great diversitynof chemical elements,,and you need liquids, such as water.,Why?,Well, in gases, atoms movenpast each other so fast,that they can't hitch up.,In solids,,atoms are stuck together, they can't move.,In liquids,,they can cruise and cuddle,and link up to form molecules.,Now, where do you findnsuch Goldilocks conditions?,Well, planets are great,,and our early Earth was almost perfect.,It was just the rightndistance from its star,to contain huge oceans of liquid water.,And deep beneath those oceans,,at cracks in the Earth's crust,,you've got heat seeping upnfrom inside the Earth,,and you've got a greatndiversity of elements.,So at those deep oceanic vents,,fantastic chemistry began to happen,,and atoms combined in all sortsnof exotic combinations. 
 But of course, life is morenthan just exotic chemistry.,How do you stabilize those huge molecules,that seem to be viable?,Well, it's here that life introducesnan entirely new trick.,You don't stabilize the individual;,you stabilize the template,,the thing that carries information,,and you allow the template to copy itself.,And DNA, of course,nis the beautiful molecule,that contains that information.,You'll be familiarnwith the double helix of DNA.,Each rung contains information.,So, DNA contains informationnabout how to make living organisms.,And DNA also copies itself.,So, it copies itself,and scatters the templatesnthrough the ocean.,So the information spreads.,Notice that informationnhas become part of our story.,The real beauty of DNA thoughnis in its imperfections.,As it copies itself,nonce in every billion rungs,,there tends to be an error.,And what that meansnis that DNA is, in effect, learning.,It's accumulating new waysnof making living organisms,because some of those errors work.,So DNA's learning,and it's building greaterndiversity and greater complexity.,And we can see this happeningnover the last four billion years. 
 For most of that time of life on Earth,,living organisms have beennrelatively simple --,single cells.,But they had great diversity,nand, inside, great complexity.,Then from about 600nto 800 million years ago,,multi-celled organisms appear.,You get fungi, you get fish,,you get plants,,you get amphibia, you get reptiles,,and then, of course,nyou get the dinosaurs.,And occasionally, there are disasters.,Sixty-five million years ago,,an asteroid landed on Earth,near the Yucatan Peninsula,,creating conditions equivalentnto those of a nuclear war,,and the dinosaurs were wiped out.,Terrible news for the dinosaurs,,but great newsnfor our mammalian ancestors,,who flourished,in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.,And we human beings are partnof that creative evolutionary pulse,that began 65 million years ago,with the landing of an asteroid. 
 Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.,And I believe we countnas a threshold in this great story.,Let me explain why.,We've seen that DNA learns in a sense,,it accumulates information.,But it is so slow.,DNA accumulates informationnthrough random errors,,some of which just happen to work.,But DNA had actually generatedna faster way of learning:,it had produced organisms with brains,,and those organismsncan learn in real time.,They accumulate information, they learn.,The sad thing is, when they die,,the information dies with them.,Now what makes humans differentnis human language.,We are blessed with a language,na system of communication,,so powerful and so precise,that we can share what we've learnednwith such precision,that it can accumulatenin the collective memory.,And that means,it can outlast the individualsnwho learned that information,,and it can accumulatenfrom generation to generation.,And that's why, as a species,nwe're so creative and so powerful,,and that's why we have a history.,We seem to be the only speciesnin four billion years,to have this gift. 
 I call this ability collective learning.,It's what makes us different.,We can see it at worknin the earliest stages of human history.,We evolved as a speciesnin the savanna lands of Africa,,but then you see humans migratingninto new environments,,into desert lands, into jungles,,into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --,tough, tough environment --,into the Americas, into Australasia.,Each migration involved learning --,learning new ways of exploitingnthe environment,,new ways of dealingnwith their surroundings. 
 Then 10,000 years ago,,exploiting a suddennchange in global climate,with the end of the last ice age,,humans learned to farm.,Farming was an energy bonanza.,And exploiting that energy,nhuman populations multiplied.,Human societies got larger,ndenser, more interconnected.,And then from about 500 years ago,,humans began to link up globally,through shipping, through trains,,through telegraph, through the Internet,,until now we seem to formna single global brain,of almost seven billion individuals.,And that brain is learning at warp speed.,And in the last 200 years,nsomething else has happened.,We've stumbled on another energy bonanza,in fossil fuels.,So fossil fuels and collectivenlearning together,explain the staggering complexitynwe see around us. 
 So --,Here we are,,back at the convention center.,We've been on a journey,na return journey, of 13.7 billion years.,I hope you agree this is a powerful story.,And it's a story in which humansnplay an astonishing and creative role.,But it also contains warnings.,Collective learning is a very,nvery powerful force,,and it's not clearnthat we humans are in charge of it.,I remember very vividlynas a child growing up in England,,living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.,For a few days, the entire biosphere,seemed to be on the verge of destruction.,And the same weapons are still here,,and they are still armed.,If we avoid that trap,nothers are waiting for us.,We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate,that we seem to be underminingnthe Goldilocks conditions,that made it possiblenfor human civilizations,to flourish over the last 10,000 years.,So what big history can do,is show us the naturenof our complexity and fragility,and the dangers that face us,,but it can also show usnour power with collective learning. 
 And now, finally --,this is what I want.,I want my grandson, Daniel,,and his friends and his generation,,throughout the world,,to know the story of big history,,and to know it so well,that they understandnboth the challenges that face us,and the opportunities that face us.,And that's why a group of us,are building a free, online syllabus,in big history,for high-school studentsnthroughout the world.,We believe that big history,will be a vitalnintellectual tool for them,,as Daniel and his generation,face the huge challenges,and also the huge opportunities,ahead of them at this threshold moment,in the history of our beautiful planet. 
 I thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)Imagine if you could record your life --,everything you said, everything you did,,available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips,,so you could go back,and find memorable moments and relive them,,or sift through traces of time,and discover patterns in your own life,that previously had gone undiscovered.,Well that's exactly the journey,that my family began,five and a half years ago.,This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.,And on this day, at this moment,,we walked into the house with our first child,,our beautiful baby boy.,And we walked into a house,with a very special home video recording system. 
 (Video) Man: Okay. 
 Deb Roy: This moment,and thousands of other moments special for us,were captured in our home,because in every room in the house,,if you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone,,and if you looked down,,you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.,Here's our living room,,the baby bedroom,,kitchen, dining room,and the rest of the house.,And all of these fed into a disc array,that was designed for a continuous capture.,So here we are flying through a day in our home,as we move from sunlit morning,through incandescent evening,and, finally, lights out for the day.,Over the course of three years,,we recorded eight to 10 hours a day,,amassing roughly a quarter-million hours,of multi-track audio and video. 
 So you're looking at a piece of what is by far,the largest home video collection ever made.,(Laughter),And what this data represents,for our family at a personal level,,the impact has already been immense,,and we're still learning its value.,Countless moments,of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments,,are captured there,,and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them. 
 But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project,,which was to use this natural longitudinal data,to understand the process,of how a child learns language --,that child being my son.,And so with many privacy provisions put in place,to protect everyone who was recorded in the data,,we made elements of the data available,to my trusted research team at MIT,so we could start teasing apart patterns,in this massive data set,,trying to understand the influence of social environments,on language acquisition.,So we're looking here,at one of the first things we started to do.,This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen,,and as we move through space and through time,,a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen. 
 In order to convert,this opaque, 90,000 hours of video,into something that we could start to see,,we use motion analysis to pull out,,as we move through space and through time,,what we call space-time worms.,And this has become part of our toolkit,for being able to look and see,where the activities are in the data,,and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular,,where my son moved throughout the home,,so that we could focus our transcription efforts,,all of the speech environment around my son --,all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny,,and over time, the words he began to produce.,So with that technology and that data,and the ability to, with machine assistance,,transcribe speech,,we've now transcribed,well over seven million words of our home transcripts.,And with that, let me take you now,for a first tour into the data. 
 So you've all, I'm sure,,seen time-lapse videos,where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.,I'd like you to now experience,the blossoming of a speech form.,My son, soon after his first birthday,,would say "gaga" to mean water.,And over the course of the next half-year,,he slowly learned to approximate,the proper adult form, "water.",So we're going to cruise through half a year,in about 40 seconds.,No video here,,so you can focus on the sound, the acoustics,,of a new kind of trajectory:,gaga to water. 
 (Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga,Gaga gaga gaga,guga guga guga,wada gaga gaga guga gaga,wader guga guga,water water water,water water water,water water,water. 
 DR: He sure nailed it, didn't he. 
 (Applause) 
 So he didn't just learn water.,Over the course of the 24 months,,the first two years that we really focused on,,this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.,And because we have full transcripts,,we've identified each of the 503 words,that he learned to produce by his second birthday.,He was an early talker.,And so we started to analyze why.,Why were certain words born before others?,This is one of the first results,that came out of our study a little over a year ago,that really surprised us.,The way to interpret this apparently simple graph,is, on the vertical is an indication,of how complex caregiver utterances are,based on the length of utterances.,And the [horizontal] axis is time. 
 And all of the data,,we aligned based on the following idea:,Every time my son would learn a word,,we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard,that contained that word.,And we would plot the relative length of the utterances.,And what we found was this curious phenomena,,that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum,,making language as simple as possible,,and then slowly ascend back up in complexity.,And the amazing thing was,that bounce, that dip,,lined up almost precisely,with when each word was born --,word after word, systematically.,So it appears that all three primary caregivers --,myself, my wife and our nanny --,were systematically and, I would think, subconsciously,restructuring our language,to meet him at the birth of a word,and bring him gently into more complex language.,And the implications of this -- there are many,,but one I just want to point out,,is that there must be amazing feedback loops.,Of course, my son is learning,from his linguistic environment,,but the environment is learning from him.,That environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops,and creating a kind of scaffolding,that has not been noticed until now. 
 But that's looking at the speech context.,What about the visual context?,We're not looking at --,think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.,We've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras,,and we've done some optical correction,,and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life.,So welcome to my home.,This is a moment,,one moment captured across multiple cameras.,The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine,,where you can go back and interactively fly around,and then breathe video-life into this system.,What I'm going to do,is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes,,again, of just life in the living room.,That's me and my son on the floor.,And there's video analytics,that are tracking our movements.,My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink.,We're now on the couch,,looking out through the window at cars passing by.,And finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself. 
 Now we freeze the action, 30 minutes,,we turn time into the vertical axis,,and we open up for a view,of these interaction traces we've just left behind.,And we see these amazing structures --,these little knots of two colors of thread,we call "social hot spots.",The spiral thread,we call a "solo hot spot.",And we think that these affect the way language is learned.,What we'd like to do,is start understanding,the interaction between these patterns,and the language that my son is exposed to,to see if we can predict,how the structure of when words are heard,affects when they're learned --,so in other words, the relationship,between words and what they're about in the world. 
 So here's how we're approaching this.,In this video,,again, my son is being traced out.,He's leaving red ink behind.,And there's our nanny by the door. 
 (Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.),Nanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.) 
 DR: She offers water,,and off go the two worms,over to the kitchen to get water.,And what we've done is use the word "water",to tag that moment, that bit of activity.,And now we take the power of data,and take every time my son,ever heard the word water,and the context he saw it in,,and we use it to penetrate through the video,and find every activity trace,that co-occurred with an instance of water.,And what this data leaves in its wake,is a landscape.,We call these wordscapes.,This is the wordscape for the word water,,and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.,That's where those big peaks are over to the left.,And just for contrast, we can do this with any word.,We can take the word "bye",as in "good bye.",And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house.,And we look, and we find, as you would expect,,a contrast in the landscape,where the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way.,So we're using these structures,to start predicting,the order of language acquisition,,and that's ongoing work now. 
 In my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT --,this is at the media lab.,This has become my favorite way,of videographing just about any space.,Three of the key people in this project,,Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.,Philip has been a close collaborator,on all the visualizations you're seeing.,And Michael Fleischman,was another Ph.D. student in my lab,who worked with me on this home video analysis,,and he made the following observation:,that "just the way that we're analyzing,how language connects to events,which provide common ground for language,,that same idea we can take out of your home, Deb,,and we can apply it to the world of public media.",And so our effort took an unexpected turn. 
 Think of mass media,as providing common ground,and you have the recipe,for taking this idea to a whole new place.,We've started analyzing television content,using the same principles --,analyzing event structure of a TV signal --,episodes of shows,,commercials,,all of the components that make up the event structure.,And we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing,a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.,And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones,to get people's conversations,,you just tune into publicly available social media feeds. 
 So we're pulling in,about three billion comments a month,,and then the magic happens.,You have the event structure,,the common ground that the words are about,,coming out of the television feeds;,you've got the conversations,that are about those topics;,and through semantic analysis --,and this is actually real data you're looking at,from our data processing --,each yellow line is showing a link being made,between a comment in the wild,and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.,And the same idea now,can be built up.,And we get this wordscape,,except now words are not assembled in my living room.,Instead, the context, the common ground activities,,are the content on television that's driving the conversations.,And what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now,,are commentary,that are linked to content on television.,Same concept,,but looking at communication dynamics,in a very different sphere. 
 And so fundamentally, rather than, for example,,measuring content based on how many people are watching,,this gives us the basic data,for looking at engagement properties of content.,And just like we can look at feedback cycles,and dynamics in a family,,we can now open up the same concepts,and look at much larger groups of people.,This is a subset of data from our database --,just 50,000 out of several million --,and the social graph that connects them,through publicly available sources.,And if you put them on one plain,,a second plain is where the content lives.,So we have the programs,and the sporting events,and the commercials,,and all of the link structures that tie them together,make a content graph.,And then the important third dimension.,Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here,is an actual connection made,between something someone said,and a piece of content.,And there are, again, now tens of millions of these links,that give us the connective tissue of social graphs,and how they relate to content.,And we can now start to probe the structure,in interesting ways. 
 So if we, for example, trace the path,of one piece of content,that drives someone to comment on it,,and then we follow where that comment goes,,and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated,and then trace back to see the relationship,between that social graph and content,,a very interesting structure becomes visible.,We call this a co-viewing clique,,a virtual living room if you will.,And there are fascinating dynamics at play.,It's not one way.,A piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk.,They talk to other people.,That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media,,and you have these cycles,that drive the overall behavior. 
 Another example -- very different --,another actual person in our database --,and we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these.,We've given this person a name.,This is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic,who has this high fan-out rate.,So a lot of people are following this person -- very influential --,and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV.,So this person is a key link,in connecting mass media and social media together. 
 One last example from this data:,Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.,So if we go and look at this piece of content,,President Obama's State of the Union address,from just a few weeks ago,,and look at what we find in this same data set,,at the same scale,,the engagement properties of this piece of content,are truly remarkable.,A nation exploding in conversation,in real time,in response to what's on the broadcast.,And of course, through all of these lines,are flowing unstructured language.,We can X-ray,and get a real-time pulse of a nation,,real-time sense,of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph,being activated by content. 
 So, to summarize, the idea is this:,As our world becomes increasingly instrumented,and we have the capabilities,to collect and connect the dots,between what people are saying,and the context they're saying it in,,what's emerging is an ability,to see new social structures and dynamics,that have previously not been seen.,It's like building a microscope or telescope,and revealing new structures,about our own behavior around communication.,And I think the implications here are profound,,whether it's for science,,for commerce, for government,,or perhaps most of all,,for us as individuals. 
 And so just to return to my son,,when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder,,and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today,,and I asked him for permission -- granted.,And then I went on to reflect,,"Isn't it amazing,,this entire database, all these recordings,,I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" --,who arrived two years later --,"and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments,that you could never, with your biological memory,,possibly remember the way you can now?",And he was quiet for a moment.,And I thought, "What am I thinking?,He's five years old. He's not going to understand this.",And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said,,"So that when I grow up,,I can show this to my kids?",And I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff." 
 So I want to leave you,with one last memorable moment,from our family.,This is the first time our son,took more than two steps at once --,captured on film.,And I really want you to focus on something,as I take you through.,It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.,My mother's in the kitchen, cooking,,and, of all places, in the hallway,,I realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps.,And so you hear me encouraging him,,realizing what's happening,,and then the magic happens.,Listen very carefully.,About three steps in,,he realizes something magic is happening,,and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in,,and he takes a breath in,,and he whispers "wow",and instinctively I echo back the same.,And so let's fly back in time,to that memorable moment. 
 (Video) DR: Hey.,Come here.,Can you do it?,Oh, boy.,Can you do it?,Baby: Yeah.,DR: Ma, he's walking. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 DR: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Many believe driving is an activity,solely reserved for those who can see.,A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently,was thought to be an impossible task, until now.,Hello, my name is Dennis Hong,,and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind,by building a vehicle for the visually impaired. 
 So before I talk about this car for the blind,,let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on,called the DARPA Urban Challenge.,Now this was about building a robotic car,that can drive itself.,You press start, nobody touches anything,,and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.,So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars,by placing third place in this competition.,So about that time,,the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB,,challenged the research committee,about who can develop a car,that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.,We decided to give it a try,,because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?",We have already an autonomous vehicle.,We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?,(Laughter),We couldn't have been more wrong.,What NFB wanted,was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around,,but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.,So we had to throw everything out the window,and start from scratch. 
 So to test this crazy idea,,we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle,to test the feasibility.,And in the summer of 2009,,we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country,and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.,It was an absolutely amazing experience.,But the problem with this car was,it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment,,in a flat, closed-off parking lot --,even the lanes defined by red traffic cones. 
 So with this success,,we decided to take the next big step,,to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.,So how does it work?,Well, it's a rather complex system,,but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.,So we have three steps.,We have perception, computation,and non-visual interfaces.,Now obviously the driver cannot see,,so the system needs to perceive the environment,and gather information for the driver.,For that, we use an initial measurement unit.,So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration --,like a human ear, inner ear.,We fuse that information with a GPS unit,to get an estimate of the location of the car.,We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.,And we also use three laser range finders.,The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles --,a car approaching from the front, the back,and also any obstacles that run into the roads,,any obstacles around the vehicle. 
 So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer,,and the computer can do two things.,One is, first of all, process this information,to have an understanding of the environment --,these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles --,and convey this information to the driver.,The system is also smart enough,to figure out the safest way to operate the car.,So we can also generate instructions,on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.,But the problem is this: How do we convey,this information and instructions,to a person who cannot see,fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?,So for this, we developed many different types,of non-visual user interface technology.,So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system,,a vibrating vest,,a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip,,even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.,But today we're going to talk about,three of these non-visual user interfaces. 
 Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.,So these are a pair of gloves,,and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part,so you can convey instructions about how to steer --,the direction and the intensity.,Another device is called SpeedStrip.,So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.,We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns,,and we actuate them to convey information about the speed,,and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.,So over here, you can see,how the computer understands the environment,,and because you cannot see the vibration,,we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.,This is the sensory data,,and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer. 
 So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip,,are very effective.,But the problem is,these are instructional cue devices.,So this is not really freedom, right?,The computer tells you how to drive --,turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.,We call this the "backseat-driver problem.",So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices,,and we're now focusing more,on the informational devices.,A good example for this informational non-visual user interface,is called AirPix.,So think of it as a monitor for the blind.,So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it,,and compressed air comes out,,so it can actually draw images.,So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it,,you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.,Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out,and possibly the temperature.,So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.,So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle,and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.,For this, we're showing a simulator,,a blind person driving using the AirPix.,This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers,and also quickly testing different types of ideas,for different types of non-visual user interfaces.,So basically that's how it works. 
 So just a month ago,,on January 29th,,we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public,at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway,during the Rolex 24 racing event.,We also had some surprises. Let's take a look. 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Announcer: This is an historic day in January.,He's coming up to the grandstand, fellow Federationists. 
 (Cheering) 
 (Honking) 
 There's the grandstand now.,And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him.,Well there comes the first box.,Now let's see if Mark avoids it.,He does. He passes it on the right.,Third box is out. The fourth box is out.,And he's perfectly making his way between the two.,He's closing in on the van,to make the moving pass.,Well this is what it's all about,,this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity.,He's approaching the end of the run,,makes his way between the barrels that are set up there. 
 (Honking) 
 (Applause) 
 Dennis Hong: I'm so happy for you.,Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel. 
 Mark Riccobono: Yes. 
 (Applause) 
 DH: So since we started this project,,we've been getting hundreds of letters, emails, phone calls,from people from all around the world.,Letters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one:,"Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine.",(Laughter),But sometimes --,(Laughter),But sometimes I also do get --,I wouldn't call it hate mail --,but letters of really strong concern:,"Dr. Hong, are you insane,,trying to put blind people on the road?,You must be out of your mind.",But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle,,and it's not going to be on the road,until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.,And I truly believe that this can happen. 
 But still, will the society,,would they accept such a radical idea?,How are we going to handle insurance?,How are we going to issue driver's licenses?,There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges,that we need to address before this becomes a reality.,Of course, the main goal of this project,is to develop a car for the blind.,But potentially more important than this,is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology,that can come from this project.,The sensors that are used can see through the dark,,the fog and rain.,And together with this new type of interfaces,,we can use these technologies,and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.,Or for the blind, everyday home appliances --,in the educational setting, in the office setting.,Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard,and a blind student can see what's written and read,using these non-visual interfaces.,This is priceless.,So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)When I was growing up in Montana,,I had two dreams.,I wanted to be a paleontologist,,a dinosaur paleontologist,,and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.,And so that's what I've been striving for,all of my life.,I was very fortunate,early in my career.,I was fortunate,in finding things.,I wasn't very good at reading things.,In fact, I don't read much of anything.,I am extremely dyslexic,,and so reading is the hardest thing I do.,But instead, I go out and I find things.,Then I just pick things up.,I basically practice for finding money on the street.,(Laughter),And I wander about the hills,,and I have found a few things. 
 And I have been fortunate enough,to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere,and the first baby dinosaurs in nests,,the first dinosaur embryos,and massive accumulations of bones.,And it happened to be at a time,when people were just starting to begin to realize,that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles,that people had thought for so many years.,People were starting to get an idea,that dinosaurs were special. 
 And so, at that time,,I was able to make some interesting hypotheses,along with my colleagues.,We were able to actually say,that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had --,that dinosaurs built nests,and lived in colonies,and cared for their young,,brought food to their babies,and traveled in gigantic herds.,So it was pretty interesting stuff.,I have gone on to find more things,and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.,We have found a lot of evidence,that dinosaurs changed,from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.,The appearance of them would have been different --,which it is in all social animals.,In social groups of animals,,the juveniles always look different than the adults.,The adults can recognize the juveniles;,the juveniles can recognize the adults.,And so we're making a better picture,of what a dinosaur looks like.,And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it is that social thing,that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.,And in his book, he talked about the social animals.,And then Steven Spielberg, of course,,depicts these dinosaurs,as being very social creatures.,The theme of this story is building a dinosaur,,and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park.",Michael Crichton really was one of the first people,to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.,You all know the story, right.,I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park." 
 If you want to make a dinosaur,,you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap --,otherwise known as amber --,that has some blood-sucking insects in it,,good ones,,and you get your insect and you drill into it,and you suck out some DNA,,because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days,sucked dinosaur DNA out.,And you take your DNA back to the laboratory,and you clone it.,And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,,or something like that,,and then you wait,,and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.,And everybody's happy about that.,(Laughter),And they're happy over and over again.,They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.,And then, then, then, and then ...,Then the dinosaurs, being social,,act out their socialness,,and they get together,,and they conspire.,And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie --,conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around. 
 So I assume everybody knows,that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,,and you drilled into it,,and you got something out of that insect,,and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,,you'd have a room full of mosquitos.,(Laughter),(Applause),And probably a whole bunch of trees as well. 
 Now if you want dinosaur DNA,,I say go to the dinosaur.,So that's what we've done.,Back in 1993 when the movie came out,,we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation,to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,,and we chose the dinosaur on the left,,a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.,And one of my former doctoral students,,Dr. Mary Schweitzer,,actually had the background,to do this sort of thing.,And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,,one of the thigh bones,,and she actually found,some very interesting structures in there.,They found these red circular-looking objects,,and they looked, for all the world,,like red blood cells.,And they're in,what appear to be the blood channels,that go through the bone.,And so she thought, well, what the heck.,So she sampled some material out of it.,Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.,But she did find heme,,which is the biological foundation,of hemoglobin.,And that was really cool.,That was interesting.,That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.,Well we tried and tried,and we couldn't really get anything else out of it. 
 So a few years went by,,and then we started the Hell Creek Project.,And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking,to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,,and hopefully find some dinosaurs,that had more material in them.,And out in eastern Montana,there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,,and not very many people,,and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.,And we did find a lot of stuff.,We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,,but we found one special Tyrannosaur,,and we called it B-rex.,And B-rex was found,under a thousand cubic yards of rock.,It wasn't a very complete T. rex,,and it wasn't a very big T. rex,,but it was a very special B-rex.,And I and my colleagues cut into it,,and we were able to determine,,by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,,that B-rex had died at the age of 16.,We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,,because we haven't found the oldest one yet.,But this one died at the age of 16. 
 We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,,and she was actually able to determine,that B-rex was a female,based on medullary tissue,found on the inside of the bone.,Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up,,the calcium storage basically,,when an animal is pregnant,,when a bird is pregnant.,So here was the character,that linked birds and dinosaurs.,But Mary went further.,She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.,Now we all know that bones are fossilized,,and so if you dump it into acid,,there shouldn't be anything left.,But there was something left.,There were blood vessels left.,There were flexible, clear blood vessels.,And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.,It was extraordinary.,But she also found osteocytes,,which are the cells that laid down the bones.,And try and try, we could not find DNA,,but she did find evidence of proteins. 
 But we thought maybe --,well, we thought maybe,that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.,We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.,And so we built a laboratory,in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,,and actually took the laboratory to the field,where we could get better samples.,And we did. We got better material.,The cells looked better.,The vessels looked better.,Found the protein collagen.,I mean, it was wonderful stuff.,But it's not dinosaur DNA.,So we have discovered,that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,,just breaks down too fast.,We're just not going to be able,to do what they did in "Jurassic Park.",We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur,based on a dinosaur. 
 But birds are dinosaurs.,Birds are living dinosaurs.,We actually classify them,as dinosaurs.,We now call them non-avian dinosaurs,and avian dinosaurs.,So the non-avian dinosaurs,are the big clunky ones that went extinct.,Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.,So we don't have to make a dinosaur,because we already have them. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.,(Laughter),The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No.",(Laughter),"You can call it a dinosaur,,but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool.",(Laughter),"The chicken is not.",(Laughter),So this is our problem,,as you can imagine.,The chicken is a dinosaur.,I mean it really is.,You can't argue with it,because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.,(Laughter),(Applause),But the sixth-graders demand it.,"Fix the chicken.",(Laughter),So that's what I'm here to tell you about:,how we are going to fix a chicken. 
 So we have a number of ways,that we actually can fix the chicken.,Because evolution works,,we actually have some evolutionary tools.,We'll call them biological modification tools.,We have selection.,And we know selection works.,We started out with a wolf-like creature,and we ended up with a Maltese.,I mean, that's --,that's definitely genetic modification.,Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.,We also have transgenesis.,Transgenesis is really cool too.,That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.,That's how people make GloFish.,You take a glow gene,out of a coral or a jellyfish,and you stick it in a zebrafish,,and, puff, they glow.,And that's pretty cool.,And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.,And now they're making Glow-rabbits,and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.,I guess we could make a glow chicken.,(Laughter),But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either. 
 But there's another thing.,There's what we call atavism activation.,And atavism activation,is basically --,an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.,You heard,that occasionally children are born with tails,,and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.,And so there are a number of atavisms,that can happen.,Snakes are occasionally born with legs.,And here's an example.,This is a chicken with teeth.,A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris,at the University of Wisconsin in Madison,actually figured out a way to stimulate,the gene for teeth,,and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on,and produce teeth in chickens.,Now that's a good characteristic.,We can save that one.,We know we can use that.,We can make a chicken with teeth.,That's getting closer.,That's better than a glowing chicken. 
 (Laughter) 
 A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,,Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,,is actually looking at atavisms.,And he's looking at them,by looking at the embryo genesis of birds,and actually looking at how they develop,,and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.,He's also interested in the transformation,of the arm, the hand, to the wing.,He's looking for those genes as well.,And I said, "Well, if you can find those,,I can just reverse them,and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders.",And so he agreed.,And so that's what we're looking into. 
 If you look at dinosaur hands,,a velociraptor,has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.,Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,,still has that very primitive hand.,But as you can see, the pigeon,,or a chicken or anything else, another bird,,has kind of a weird-looking hand,,because the hand is a wing.,But the cool thing is,that, if you look in the embryo,,as the embryo is developing,the hand actually looks,pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.,It has the three fingers, the three digits.,But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.,And so what we're looking for is that gene.,We want to stop that gene from turning on,,fusing those hands together,,so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,,like the archaeopteryx.,And the same goes for the tails.,Birds have basically,rudimentary tails.,And so we know,that in embryo,,as the animal is developing,,it actually has a relatively long tail.,But a gene turns on,and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.,So that's the other gene we're looking for.,We want to stop that tail from resorbing. 
 So what we're trying to do really,is take our chicken,,modify it,and make the chickenosaurus.,(Laughter),It's a cooler-looking chicken.,But it's just the very basics.,So that really is what we're doing.,And people always say, "Why do that?,Why make this thing?,What good is it?",Well, that's a good question.,Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids,about evolutionary biology,and developmental biology,and all sorts of things.,And quite frankly, I think,if Colonel Sanders,was to be careful how he worded it,,he could actually advertise an extra piece.,(Laughter) 
 Anyway --,When our dino-chicken hatches,,it will be, obviously, the poster child,,or what you might call a poster chick,,for technology, entertainment and design. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm very fortunate to be here.,I feel so fortunate.,I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.,I called my wife Leslie,,and I said, "You know, there's so many good people,trying to do so much good.,It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels.",It's a true feeling.,But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running. 
 I'm a public school teacher,,and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.,Her name is Pam Moran,in Albemarle County, Virginia,,the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.,And she's a very high-tech superintendent.,She uses smart boards, she blogs,,she Tweets, she does Facebook,,she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.,She's a technology leader and instructional leader.,But in her office,,there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table --,peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.,And I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.,Why is this old table in your office?" 
 And she told me, she said,,"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,,in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,,and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.,And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working,,and we'd sit around that table every night.,And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge,and so many insights and so much wisdom,come out around this table,,I began to call it the wisdom table.,And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,,and it reminds me of him.,It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.",The project I'm going to tell you about,is called the World Peace Game,,and essentially it is also an empty space.,And I'd like to think of it,as a 21st century wisdom table, really. 
 It all started back in 1977.,I was a young man,,and I had been dropping in and out of college.,And my parents were very patient,,but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India,on a mystical quest.,And I remember the last time I came back from India --,in my long white flowing robes,and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses --,and I said to my father,,"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment.",He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find.",I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job.",(Laughter),And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.,So I got a degree,and it turned out to be education.,It was an experimental education program.,It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it,,and so that's what I had to go for. 
 And I went in for a job interview,in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,,bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention --,kept my long beard and my afro,and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s --,and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.,And I guess they were hard up for teachers,because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,,said I had the job teaching gifted children.,And I was so shocked, so stunned,,I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?",(Laughter),Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much.,There weren't really many materials or things to use.,And I said, "What do I do?",And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.,Her answer set the template,for the entire career I was to have after that.,She said, "What do you want to do?",And that question cleared the space.,There was no program directive, no manual to follow,,no standards in gifted education,in that way.,And she cleared such a space,that I endeavored from then on,to clear a space for my students, an empty space,,whereby they could create and make meaning,out of their own understanding. 
 So this happened in 1978,,and I was teaching many years later,,and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.,His name is Chris Farina.,Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.,Chris, could you stand up and let them see you --,a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.,(Applause),This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements.",He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.,He proposed the film to me,,and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV,,and we can say hi to our friends.",But the film has really gone places.,Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,,to get this film out.,So we made a film,and it turns out to be more than a story about me,,more than a story about one teacher.,It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.,And it's a beautiful thing. 
 And the strange thing is, when I watch the film --,I have the eerie sensation of seeing it --,I saw myself literally disappear.,What I saw,was my teachers coming through me.,I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's,wry smile under his handlebar mustache.,That's the smile I use -- that's his smile.,I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.,And they weren't flashing in anger,,they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.,And I have that kind of flash sometimes.,And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks,who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.,And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.,You know the one.,(Laughter),"And I'm not even talking about you behind me,,because I've got eyes in the back of my head.",(Laughter),You know that teacher?,I didn't use that stare very often,,but I do have it in my repertoire.,And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me. 
 And then I saw,my own parents, my first teachers.,My father, very inventive, spatial thinker.,That's my brother Malcolm there on the right.,And my mother,,who taught me in fourth grade,in segregated schools in Virginia,,who was my inspiration.,And really, I feel as though,,when I see the film --,I have a gesture she does, like this --,I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.,I am one of her teaching gestures.,And the beautiful thing was,,I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.,And so that gesture of my mother's,continues through many generations.,It's an amazing feeling,to have that lineage.,And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.,I'm not here alone.,There are many people on this stage right now. 
 And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.,It started out like this:,it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board,in an inner-city urban school, 1978.,I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.,We put all the problems of the world there,,and I thought, let's let them solve it.,I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.,I wanted to have them be immersed,and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.,So I thought, well they like to play games.,I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive;,we didn't have that term in 1978 --,but something interactive.,And so we made the game,,and it has since evolved,to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot,Plexiglass structure.,And it has four Plexiglass layers. 
 There's an outer space layer,with black holes and satellites,and research satellites and asteroid mining.,There's an air and space level,with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around,and territorial air spaces and air forces,,a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it --,even an undersea level,with submarines and undersea mining.,There are four countries around the board.,The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor.,They have different assets, commercial and military.,And each country has a cabinet.,There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense,and a CFO, or Comptroller.,I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.,I offer them the job, they can turn it down,,and then they choose their own cabinet.,There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.,There's also a weather goddess,who controls a random stock market and random weather. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's not all.,And then there's a 13-page crisis document,with 50 interlocking problems.,So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.,I throw them into this complex matrix,,and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.,And so with all these crises,,we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions;,we have chemical and nuclear spills,,nuclear proliferation.,There's oil spills, environmental disasters,,water rights disputes, breakaway republics,,famine, endangered species and global warming.,If Al Gore is here,,I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you,because they solved global warming in a week.,(Laughter),(Applause),And they've done it several times too. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I also have in the game a saboteur --,some child -- it's basically a troublemaker --,and I have my troublemaker put to use,because they, on the surface,,are trying to save the world and their position in the game.,But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.,And they do it secretly through misinformation,and ambiguities and irrelevancies,,trying to cause everyone to think more deeply.,The saboteur is there,,and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War.",Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old --,and they handle that and use that,to understand how to, not follow --,at first they do --,the paths to power and destruction,,the path to war.,They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions,and impulsive thinking,,to think in a long-term, more consequential way. 
 Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him,with a CoEvolution Quarterly article,on a peace force.,And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.,I'm just a clock watcher.,I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.,The students run the game.,I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever,once they start playing.,So I'll just share with you ... 
 (Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.,You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world.,See, Mr. Hunter is doing that,because he says his time has messed up a lot,,and he's trying to tell us,how to fix that problem. 
 John Hunter: I offered them a --,(Applause),Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.,And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.,And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.,And so I apologize to them as well.,I say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls,,but the truth is,we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape,,and we hope you can fix it for us,,and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it.",It's a sincere apology,,and they take it very seriously. 
 Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.,Well when we have the game start, here's what you see. 
 (Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.,(Chatter) 
 JH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom?,It's a serious question: who is really in charge?,I've learned to cede control of the classroom,over to the students over time.,There's a trust and an understanding,and a dedication to an ideal,that I simply don't have to do,what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher:,control every conversation and response in the classroom.,It's impossible. Their collective wisdom,is much greater than mine,,and I admit it to them openly.,So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly,of some magical things that have happened. 
 In this game we had a little girl,,and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.,And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.,And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.,Without provocation,,suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders,,the next-door neighbor's oil fields.,She marched into the oil field reserves,,surrounded it, without firing a shot,,and secured it and held it.,And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations,because their fuel supply was locked up. 
 We were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this?,This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?",(Laughter),This was a little girl and, at nine years old,,she held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing.",To her girlfriends she said that.,That's a breach there.,And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross,a nine year-old girl with tanks.,(Laughter),They are the toughest opponents.,And we were very upset.,I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this? 
 But come to find out, a few game days later --,and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team --,actually there's a negotiation period with all teams,,and each team takes a turn,,then we go back in negotiation, around and around,,so each turn around is one game day.,So a few game days later it came to light,that we found out this major country,was planning a military offensive,to dominate the entire world.,Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.,She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions,long before any of us,and understand what was going to happen,and made a philosophical decision,to attack in a peace game. 
 Now she used a small war to avert a larger war,,so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion,about whether that was right,,conditional good, or not right.,That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.,I could not have designed that in teaching it.,It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom. 
 (Applause) 
 Another example, a beautiful thing happened.,We have a letter in the game.,If you're a military commander and you wage troops --,the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them,,I put in a letter.,You have to write a letter to their parents --,the fictional parents of your fictional troops --,explaining what happened and offering your condolences.,So you have a little bit more thought,before you commit to combat.,And so we had this situation come up --,last summer actually,,at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County --,and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter,and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter,,let's ask -- there's a parent over there.",There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.,"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.,It'll be more realer if she reads it.",So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.,"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.,She read two sentences.,By the third sentence, she was in tears.,I was in tears.,Everybody understood,that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.,We all lose.,And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding. 
 I'll show you what my friend David says about this.,He's been in many battles. 
 (Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking.,I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.,But now I'm feeling really weird,because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.,One week he said,,"Those who go into battle and win,will want to go back,,and those who lose in battle,will want to go back and win.",And so I've been winning battles,,so I'm going into battles, more battles.,And I think it's sort of weird to be living,what Sun Tzu said. 
 JH: I get chills every time I see that.,That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.,And I can't design that, I can't plan that,,and I can't even test that.,But it's self-evident assessment.,We know that's an authentic assessment of learning.,We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data,with the real truth of what's going on. 
 So I'll just share a third story.,This is about my friend Brennan.,We had played the game one session after school,for many weeks, about seven weeks,,and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.,The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved,and every country's asset value,has to be increased above its starting point.,Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.,The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.,He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away.",But he was setting fiscal policy in that game,for high school players who were playing with him. 
 So the team that was the poorest,had gotten even poorer.,There was no way they could win.,And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time --,there was about a minute left --,and despair just settled over the room.,I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.,I should have gotten it so they could have won.,They shouldn't be failing like this.,I've failed them.,And I was just feeling so sad and dejected.,And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair,and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring,to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,,and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.,Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;,there was yelling, waving of their dossiers.,They get these dossiers full of secret documents.,They were gesticulating; they were running around.,I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.,Principal walks in, I'm out of a job.,The parents were looking in the window. 
 And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.,He rings the bell again. He says, "We have" --,and there's 12 seconds left on the clock --,"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.,And we've got 600 billion dollars.,We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.,And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.,Will you accept it?",And there are three seconds left on the clock.,Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country,,and he says, "Yes.",And the game is won.,Spontaneous compassion,that could not be planned for,,that was unexpected and unpredictable. 
 Every game we play is different.,Some games are more about social issues,,some are more about economic issues.,Some games are more about warfare.,But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.,I allow them to go there,and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,,how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.,And they find out what is right,their own way, their own selves.,And so in this game,,I've learned so much from it,,but I would say,that if only,they could pick up a critical thinking tool,or creative thinking tool,from this game,and leverage something good for the world,,they may save us all.,If only. 
 And on behalf of all of my teachers,on whose shoulders I'm standing,,thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)So it's 1995,,I'm in college,,and a friend and I go on a road trip,from Providence, Rhode Island,to Portland, Oregon.,And you know, we're young and unemployed,,so we do the whole thing on back roads,through state parks,and national forests --,basically the longest route we can possibly take.,And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,,I turn to my friend,and I ask her a question,that's been bothering me,for 2,000 miles.,"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?",My friend looks at me totally blankly.,There's actually a gentleman in the front row,who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.,(Laughter),And I'm like, "You know,,all the signs we keep seeing,with the Chinese character on them.",She just stares at me for a few moments,,and then she cracks up,,because she figures out what I'm talking about.,And what I'm talking about is this.,(Laughter),Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've spent the last five years of my life,thinking about situations,exactly like this --,why we sometimes misunderstand,the signs around us,,and how we behave when that happens,,and what all of this can tell us about human nature.,In other words, as you heard Chris say,,I've spent the last five years,thinking about being wrong.,This might strike you as a strange career move,,but it actually has one great advantage:,no job competition.,(Laughter),In fact, most of us do everything we can,to avoid thinking about being wrong,,or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility,that we ourselves are wrong.,We get it in the abstract.,We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.,The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine. 
 But when it comes down to me, right now,,to all the beliefs I hold,,here in the present tense,,suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility,goes out the window --,and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.,And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.,We go to meetings in the present tense;,we go on family vacations in the present tense;,we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.,So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,,trapped in this little bubble,of feeling very right about everything. 
 I think this is a problem.,I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,,in our personal and professional lives,,and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.,So what I want to do today,is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck,inside this feeling of being right.,And second, why it's such a problem.,And finally, I want to convince you,that it is possible,to step outside of that feeling,and that if you can do so,,it is the single greatest,moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make. 
 So why do we get stuck,in this feeling of being right?,One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.,So let me ask you guys something --,or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:,How does it feel -- emotionally --,how does it feel to be wrong?,Dreadful. Thumbs down.,Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.,Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --,thank you, these are great answers,,but they're answers to a different question.,You guys are answering the question:,How does it feel to realize you're wrong?,(Laughter),Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?,I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,,it can actually be quite funny,,like my stupid Chinese character mistake.,But just being wrong,doesn't feel like anything. 
 I'll give you an analogy.,Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon,where there's this pathetic coyote,who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?,In pretty much every episode of this cartoon,,there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner,and the roadrunner runs off a cliff,,which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.,But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.,And what's funny --,at least if you're six years old --,is that the coyote's totally fine too.,He just keeps running --,right up until the moment that he looks down,and realizes that he's in mid-air.,That's when he falls.,When we're wrong about something --,not when we realize it, but before that --,we're like that coyote,after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.,You know, we're already wrong,,we're already in trouble,,but we feel like we're on solid ground.,So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.,It does feel like something to be wrong;,it feels like being right. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is one reason, a structural reason,,why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.,I call this error blindness.,Most of the time,,we don't have any kind of internal cue,to let us know that we're wrong about something,,until it's too late.,But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --,and this one is cultural.,Think back for a moment to elementary school.,You're sitting there in class,,and your teacher is handing back quiz papers,,and one of them looks like this.,This is not mine, by the way.,(Laughter),So there you are in grade school,,and you know exactly what to think,about the kid who got this paper.,It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,,the one who never does his homework.,So by the time you are nine years old,,you've already learned, first of all,,that people who get stuff wrong,are lazy, irresponsible dimwits --,and second of all,,that the way to succeed in life,is to never make any mistakes. 
 We learn these really bad lessons really well.,And a lot of us --,and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --,deal with them by just becoming,perfect little A students,,perfectionists, over-achievers.,Right,,Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?,(Laughter),You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.,Okay, so fine.,Except that then we freak out,at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.,Because according to this,,getting something wrong,means there's something wrong with us.,So we just insist that we're right,,because it makes us feel smart and responsible,and virtuous and safe. 
 So let me tell you a story.,A couple of years ago,,a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.,Beth Israel's in Boston.,It's the teaching hospital for Harvard --,one of the best hospitals in the country.,So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.,She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --,stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.,Everything seems to have gone fine.,And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,,and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?",Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages,because the surgeon has performed a major operation,on her left leg instead of her right one.,When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel,spoke about this incident,,he said something very interesting.,He said, "For whatever reason,,the surgeon simply felt,that he was on the correct side of the patient.",(Laughter),The point of this story,is that trusting too much in the feeling,of being on the correct side of anything,can be very dangerous. 
 This internal sense of rightness,that we all experience so often,is not a reliable guide,to what is actually going on in the external world.,And when we act like it is,,and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,,well that's when we end up doing things,like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,,or torpedoing the global economy.,So this is a huge practical problem.,But it's also a huge social problem. 
 Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.,It means that you think that your beliefs,just perfectly reflect reality.,And when you feel that way,,you've got a problem to solve,,which is, how are you going to explain,all of those people who disagree with you?,It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,,by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.,The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us,is we just assume they're ignorant.,They don't have access to the same information that we do,,and when we generously share that information with them,,they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.,When that doesn't work,,when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do,and they still disagree with us,,then we move on to a second assumption,,which is that they're idiots.,(Laughter),They have all the right pieces of the puzzle,,and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.,And when that doesn't work,,when it turns out that people who disagree with us,have all the same facts we do,and are actually pretty smart,,then we move on to a third assumption:,they know the truth,,and they are deliberately distorting it,for their own malevolent purposes.,So this is a catastrophe. 
 This attachment to our own rightness,keeps us from preventing mistakes,when we absolutely need to,and causes us to treat each other terribly.,But to me, what's most baffling,and most tragic about this,is that it misses the whole point of being human.,It's like we want to imagine,that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows,and we just gaze out of them,and describe the world as it unfolds.,And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window,and see the exact same thing.,That is not true,,and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.,The miracle of your mind,isn't that you can see the world as it is.,It's that you can see the world as it isn't.,We can remember the past,,and we can think about the future,,and we can imagine what it's like,to be some other person in some other place.,And we all do this a little differently,,which is why we can all look up at the same night sky,and see this,and also this,and also this.,And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong. 
 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing,about "I think therefore I am,",this guy, St. Augustine, sat down,and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" --,"I err therefore I am.",Augustine understood,that our capacity to screw up,,it's not some kind of embarrassing defect,in the human system,,something we can eradicate or overcome.,It's totally fundamental to who we are.,Because, unlike God,,we don't really know what's going on out there.,And unlike all of the other animals,,we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.,To me, this obsession,is the source and root,of all of our productivity and creativity. 
 Last year, for various reasons,,I found myself listening to a lot of episodes,of the Public Radio show This American Life.,And so I'm listening and I'm listening,,and at some point, I start feeling,like all the stories are about being wrong.,And my first thought was,,"I've lost it.,I've become the crazy wrongness lady.,I just imagined it everywhere,",which has happened.,But a couple of months later,,I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.,And I mentioned this to him,,and he was like, "No actually, that's true.,In fact," he says,,"as a staff, we joke,that every single episode of our show,has the same crypto-theme.,And the crypto-theme is:,'I thought this one thing was going to happen,and something else happened instead.',And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.,We need these moments,of surprise and reversal and wrongness,to make these stories work.",And for the rest of us, audience members,,as listeners, as readers,,we eat this stuff up.,We love things like plot twists,and red herrings and surprise endings.,When it comes to our stories,,we love being wrong. 
 But, you know, our stories are like this,because our lives are like this.,We think this one thing is going to happen,and something else happens instead.,George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,,find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,,liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.,And something else happened instead.,And Hosni Mubarak,thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,,until he got too old or too sick,and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.,And something else happened instead.,And maybe you thought,you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart,and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.,And something else happened instead.,And I have to tell you,that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book,about a subject everybody hates,for an audience that would never materialize.,And something else happened instead. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, this is life.,For good and for ill,,we generate these incredible stories,about the world around us,,and then the world turns around and astonishes us.,No offense, but this entire conference,is an unbelievable monument,to our capacity to get stuff wrong.,We just spent an entire week,talking about innovations and advancements,and improvements,,but you know why we need all of those innovations,and advancements and improvements?,Because half the stuff,that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --,TED 1998 --,eh.,(Laughter),Didn't really work out that way, did it?,(Laughter),Where's my jet pack, Chris? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So here we are again.,And that's how it goes.,We come up with another idea.,We tell another story.,We hold another conference.,The theme of this one,,as you guys have now heard seven million times,,is the rediscovery of wonder.,And to me,,if you really want to rediscover wonder,,you need to step outside,of that tiny, terrified space of rightness,and look around at each other,and look out at the vastness,and complexity and mystery,of the universe,and be able to say,,"Wow, I don't know.,Maybe I'm wrong." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you guys. 
 (Applause)Imagine a big explosionnas you climb through 3,000 ft.,Imagine a plane full of smoke.,Imagine an enginengoing clack, clack, clack.,It sounds scary. 
 Well, I had a unique seat that day.,I was sitting in 1D.,I was the only one who could talknto the flight attendants.,So I looked at them right away,,and they said, "No problem.nWe probably hit some birds.",The pilot had alreadynturned the plane around,,and we weren't that far.,You could see Manhattan.,Two minutes later,,three things happened at the same time. 
 The pilot lines up the planenwith the Hudson River.,That's usually not the route. 
 (Laughter) 
 He turns off the engines.,Now, imagine beingnin a plane with no sound.,And then he says three words.,The most unemotionalnthree words I've ever heard.,He says, "Brace for impact.",I didn't have to talknto the flight attendant anymore. 
 (Laughter) 
 I could see in her eyes, it was terror.,Life was over. 
 Now I want to share with you three thingsnI learned about myself that day.,I learned that itnall changes in an instant.,We have this bucket list,,we have these thingsnwe want to do in life,,and I thought about all the peoplenI wanted to reach out to that I didn't,,all the fences I wanted to mend,,all the experiences I wantednto have and I never did.,As I thought about that later on,,I came up with a saying,,which is, "I collect bad wines.",Because if the wine is readynand the person is there, I'm opening it.,I no longer want to postponenanything in life.,And that urgency, that purpose,nhas really changed my life. 
 The second thing I learned that day --,and this is as we clearnthe George Washington Bridge,,which was by not a lot -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought about, wow,nI really feel one real regret.,I've lived a good life.,In my own humanity and mistakes,,I've tried to get betternat everything I tried.,But in my humanity,nI also allow my ego to get in.,And I regretted the time I wastednon things that did not matter,with people that matter.,And I thought aboutnmy relationship with my wife,,with my friends, with people.,And after, as I reflected on that,,I decided to eliminatennegative energy from my life.,It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.,I've not had a fightnwith my wife in two years.,It feels great.,I no longer try to be right;,I choose to be happy. 
 The third thing I learned --,and this is as your mental clocknstarts going, "15, 14, 13.",You can see the water coming.,I'm saying, "Please blow up.",I don't want this thingnto break in 20 pieces,like you've seen in those documentaries.,And as we're coming down,,I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.,It's almost like we've been preparingnfor it our whole lives.,But it was very sad.,I didn't want to go; I love my life.,And that sadnessnreally framed in one thought,,which is, I only wish for one thing.,I only wish I could see my kids grow up.,About a month later,nI was at a performance by my daughter --,first-grader, not much artistic talent -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Yet! 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm bawling,nI'm crying, like a little kid.,And it made all the sensenin the world to me.,I realized at that point,nby connecting those two dots,,that the only thingnthat matters in my life,is being a great dad.,Above all, above all,,the only goal I have in lifenis to be a good dad. 
 I was given the gift of a miracle,,of not dying that day.,I was given another gift,,which was to be ablento see into the future,and come back,and live differently.,I challenge you guysnthat are flying today,,imagine the same thingnhappens on your plane --,and please don't --,but imagine, and how would you change?,What would you get done,that you're waiting to get donenbecause you think you'll be here forever?,How would you change your relationships,and the negative energy in them?,And more than anything,nare you being the best parent you can? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.,This is Alex, the best computer voice,I've been able to find,,which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.,For most of my life,,I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.,It was like breathing.,In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise.,After surgeries for cancer,took away my ability to speak, eat or drink,,I was forced to enter this virtual world,in which a computer does some of my living for me. 
 For several days now,,we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.,I used to be able to talk like that.,Maybe I wasn't as smart,,but I was at least as talkative.,I want to devote my talk today,to the act of speaking itself,,and how the act of speaking or not speaking,is tied so indelibly to one's identity,as to force the birth of a new person,when it is taken away.,However, I've found that listening to a computer voice,for any great length of time,can be monotonous.,So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends,to read my words aloud for me.,I will start with my wife, Chaz. 
 Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side,through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw,and restore my ability to speak.,Going into the first surgery,for a recurrence of salivary cancer,in 2006,,I expected to be out of the hospital,in time to return to my movie review show,,'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.',I had pre-taped enough shows,to get me through six weeks of surgery,and recuperation.,The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg,and some tissue from my shoulder,to fashion into a new jaw.,My tongue, larynx and vocal cords,were still healthy and unaffected. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 CE: I was optimistic,,and all was right with the world.,The first surgery was a great success.,I saw myself in the mirror,and I looked pretty good.,Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.,I was using my iPod,to play the Leonard Cohen song,'I'm Your Man',for my doctors and nurses.,Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.,My carotid artery had ruptured.,Thank God I was still in my hospital room,and my doctors were right there.,Chaz told me,that if that song hadn't played for so long,,I might have already been in the car, on the way home,,and would have died right there and then.,So thank you, Leonard Cohen,,for saving my life. 
 (Applause) 
 There was a second surgery --,which held up for five or six days,and then it also fell apart.,And then a third attempt,,which also patched me back together pretty well,,until it failed.,A doctor from Brazil said,he had never seen anyone survive,a carotid artery rupture.,And before I left the hospital,,after a year of being hospitalized,,I had seven ruptures,of my carotid artery. 
 There was no particular day,when anyone told me,I would never speak again;,it just sort of became obvious.,Human speech,is an ingenious manipulation of our breath,within the sound chamber of our mouth,and respiratory system.,We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath,in order to form sounds.,Therefore, the system,must be essentially airtight,in order to capture air.,Because I had lost my jaw,,I could no longer form a seal,,and therefore my tongue,and all of my other vocal equipment,was rendered powerless. 
 Dean Ornish: At first for a long time,,I wrote messages in notebooks.,Then I tried typing words on my laptop,and using its built in voice.,This was faster,,and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.,I tried out various computer voices that were available online,,and for several months I had a British accent,,which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.",(Laughter),"It was the clearest I could find.,Then Apple released the Alex voice,,which was the best I'd heard.,It knew things like the difference,between an exclamation point and a question mark.,When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence,sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.,There are all sorts of html codes you can use,to control the timing and inflection of computer voices,,and I've experimented with them.,For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow.,When I find myself in a conversational situation,,I need to type fast and to jump right in.,People don't have the time or the patience,to wait for me to fool around with the codes,for every word or phrase. 
 But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?,How does that affect who you are as a person?,When people hear Alex speaking my words,,do they experience a disconnect?,Does that create a separation or a distance,from one person to the next?,How did I feel not being able to speak?,I felt, and I still feel,,a lot of distance from the human mainstream.,I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.,Even then, I'm aware that most people have little patience,for my speaking difficulties. 
 So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice,using my TV show voice,from a period of 30 years.,At first I was against it.,I thought it would be creepy,to hear my own voice coming from a computer.,There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.,But I decided then to just give it a try.,So we contacted a company in Scotland,that created personalized computer voices.,They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials.,All of their voices had been made by a speaker,recording original words in a control booth.,But they were willing to give it a try. 
 So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,,including several audio commentary tracks,that I'd made for movies on DVDs.,And it sounded like me, it really did.,There was a reason for that; it was me.,But it wasn't that simple.,The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful,because there were too many other kinds of audio involved --,movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me --,(Laughter),and my words often had a particular emphasis,that didn't fit into a sentence well enough. 
 I'll let you hear a sample of that voice.,These are a few of the comments I recorded for use,when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.,And here's the voice we call Roger Jr.,or Roger 2.0. 
 Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is,to be back on your show.,We have been talking for a long time,,and now here we are again.,This is the first version of my computer voice.,It still needs improvement,,but at least it sounds like me,and not like HAL 9000.,When I heard it the first time,,it sent chills down my spine.,When I type anything,,this voice will speak whatever I type.,When I read something, it will read in my voice.,I have typed these words in advance,,as I didn't think it would be thrilling,to sit here watching me typing. 
 The voice was created by a company in Scotland,named CereProc.,It makes me feel good,that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken,while I was commenting on "Casablanca",and "Citizen Kane.",This is the first voice they've created for an individual.,There are several very good voices available for computers,,but they all sound like somebody else,,while this voice sounds like me.,I plan to use it on television, radio,and the Internet.,People who need a voice should know,that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.,Many blind people use them,to read pages on the Web to themselves.,But I've got to say, in first grade,,they said I talked too much,,and now I still can. 
 (Laughter) 
 Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me,,but the words jump up and down.,The flow isn't natural.,The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice,,and I'm optimistic about it.,But so far, the Apple Alex voice,is the best one I've heard.,I wrote a blog about it,and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.,He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations,to be used in the voice.,A very large sample is needed. 
 John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth.,Now I have spoken my last words,,and I don't even remember for sure,what they were.,I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story,titled "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.",On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us,what a tiny instant the human race represents,in the time-span of the universe.,For almost all of its millions and billions of years,,there was no life on Earth at all.,For almost all the years of life on Earth,,there was no intelligent life.,Only after we learned to pass knowledge,from one generation to the next,,did civilization become possible.,In cosmological terms,,that was about 10 minutes ago.,Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool,,the computer.,That has mostly happened in my lifetime. 
 Some of the famous early computers,were being built in my hometown of Urbana,,the birthplace of HAL 9000.,When I heard the amazing talk,by Salman Khan on Wednesday,,about the Khan Academy website,that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,,I had a flashback.,It was about 1960.,As a local newspaper reporter still in high school,,I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois,to interview the creators,of something called PLATO.,The initials stood for Programmed Logic,for Automated Teaching Operations.,This was a computer-assisted instruction system,,which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.,The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. 
 I doubt, on that day 50 years ago,,they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.,But that's not the point.,The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago,,an instant in time.,It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another,on more and more sophisticated computers,,until only five years ago.,I have learned from Wikipedia,that, starting with that humble beginning,,PLATO established forums, message boards,,online testing,,email, chat rooms,,picture languages, instant messaging,,remote screen sharing,and multiple-player games. 
 Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana,,it appears that my hometown,in downstate Illinois,was the birthplace,of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today.,But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce.,(Laughter),I'm here as a man who wants to communicate. 
 All of this has happened in my lifetime.,I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s,when one of the first Atech systems was installed,at the Chicago Sun-Times.,I was in line at Radio Shack,to buy one of the first Model 100's.,And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards,that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections,,they didn't know what I was talking about.,When I bought my first desktop,,it was a DEC Rainbow.,Does anybody remember that?",(Applause),"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival,with a portable computer the size of a suitcase,named the Porteram Telebubble.,I joined CompuServe,when it had fewer numbers,than I currently have followers on Twitter. 
 (Laughter) 
 CE: All of this has happened,in the blink of an eye.,It is unimaginable,what will happen next.,It makes me incredibly fortunate,to live at this moment in history.,Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all,,because without intelligence and memory,there is no history.,For billions of years,,the universe evolved,completely without notice.,Now we live in the age of the Internet,,which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness.,And because of it,,I can communicate,as well as I ever could.,We are born into a box,of time and space.,We use words and communication,to break out of it,and to reach out to others. 
 For me, the Internet began,as a useful tool,and now has become something I rely on,for my actual daily existence.,I cannot speak;,I can only type so fast.,Computer voices,are sometimes not very sophisticated,,but with my computer,,I can communicate more widely,than ever before.,I feel as if my blog,,my email, Twitter and Facebook,have given me a substitute,for everyday conversation.,They aren't an improvement,,but they're the best I can do.,They give me a way to speak.,Not everybody has the patience,of my wife, Chaz.,But online,,everybody speaks at the same speed. 
 This whole adventure,has been a learning experience.,Every time there was a surgery that failed,,I was left with a little less flesh and bone.,Now I have no jaw left at all.,While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders,,the surgeries left me with back pain,and reduced my ability to walk easily.,Ironic that my legs are fine,,and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk.,When you see me today,,I look like the Phantom of the Opera. 
 But no you don't. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 It is human nature to look at someone like me,and assume I have lost some of my marbles.,People --,(Applause),People talk loudly -- 
 I'm so sorry.,Excuse me. 
 (Applause) 
 People talk loudly and slowly to me.,Sometimes they assume I am deaf.,There are people who don't want to make eye contact. 
 Believe me, he didn't mean this as --,anyway, let me just read it.,(Laughter),You should never let your wife read something like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is human nature,to look away from illness.,We don't enjoy a reminder,of our own fragile mortality.,That's why writing on the Internet,has become a lifesaver for me.,My ability to think and write,have not been affected.,And on the Web, my real voice finds expression.,I have also met many other disabled people,who communicate this way.,One of my Twitter friends,can type only with his toes.,One of the funniest blogs on the Web,is written by a friend of mine,named Smartass Cripple.,(Laughter),Google him and he will make you laugh.,All of these people are saying, in one way or another,,that what you see,is not all you get. 
 So I have not come here to complain.,I have much to make me happy and relieved.,I seem, for the time being,,to be cancer-free.,I am writing as well as ever.,I am productive.,If I were in this condition at any point,before a few cosmological instants ago,,I would be as isolated as a hermit.,I would be trapped inside my head.,Because of the rush of human knowledge,,because of the digital revolution,,I have a voice,,and I do not need to scream. 
 RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add.,A guy goes into a psychiatrist.,The psychiatrist says, "You're crazy.",The guy says, "I want a second opinion.",The psychiatrist says, "All right, you're ugly." 
 (Laughter) 
 You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test.,A human judge has a conversation,with a human and a computer.,If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human,,the machine has passed the test.,I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test.,If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke,and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman,,then that's the voice I want. 
 (Applause)Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning,,I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.,It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done,since I became a paratrooper,27 years before.,We went down to the airfield early,because this is the Army and you always go early.,You do some routine refresher training,,and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.,And you put on the T-10 parachute.,And you're very careful how you put the straps,,particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.,And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.,And then a jumpmaster comes,,and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.,He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps,and he tightens everything,so that your chest is crushed,,your shoulders are crushed down,,and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.,Then you sit down, and you wait a little while,,because this is the Army.,Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,,and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,,and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.,And you wait a little bit longer,,because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait. 
 Then you take off.,And it's painful enough now --,and I think it's designed this way --,it's painful enough so you want to jump.,You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.,So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along,,and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.,They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.,You sit there, OK.,Then they give you 10 minutes.,And of course, you're responding with all of these.,And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.,Then they give you, "Get ready.",Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up.",If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.,If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.,And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.,And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?,I'm probably going to jump.,There's no way to get out of this at this point.",You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door. 
 And this was that Tuesday morning in September,,and it was pretty nice outside.,So nice air comes flowing in.,The jumpmasters start to check the door.,And then when it's time to go,,a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go.",The first guy goes, and you're just in line,,and you just kind of lumber to the door.,Jump is a misnomer; you fall.,You fall outside the door,,you're caught in the slipstream.,The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position --,head down in your chest, your arms extended,,put over your reserve parachute.,You do that because, 27 years before,,an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.,I have no idea whether it makes any difference,,but he seemed to make sense,,and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.,And then you wait for the opening shock,for your parachute to open.,If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute --,you've got a whole new problem set.,But typically you do; typically it opens.,And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right,,at that point you get another little thrill.,Boom. 
 So then you look around,,you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good.",Now you prepare for the inevitable.,You are going to hit the ground.,You can't delay that much.,And you really can't decide where you hit very much,,because they pretend you can steer,,but you're being delivered.,So you look around, where you're going to land,,you try to make yourself ready.,And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,,so that it's not on you when you land,,and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.,Now the Army teaches you,to do five points of performance --,the toes of your feet,,your calves, your thighs,,your buttocks and your push-up muscles.,It's this elegant little land, twist and roll.,And that's not going to hurt.,In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.,(Laughter),I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window. 
 (Laughter) 
 And as soon as I hit,,the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.,I'd shake my head,,and I'd ask myself the eternal question:,"Why didn't I go into banking?",(Laughter),And I'd look around,,and then I'd see another paratrooper,,a young guy or girl,,and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine,and they'd be picking up their equipment.,They'd be doing everything,that we had taught them.,And I realized,that, if they had to go into combat,,they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.,And I realized that, if they came out of combat,,it would be because we led them well.,And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did. 
 So now I do that Tuesday morning jump,,but it's not any jump --,that was September 11th, 2001.,And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.,When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.,And what we thought,about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat,as being theoretical,was now very, very real --,and leadership seemed important.,But things had changed;,I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.,I'd been successful,,but things changed so much,that I was going to have to make some significant changes,,and on that morning, I didn't know it. 
 I was raised with traditional stories of leadership:,Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.,And I also was raised,with personal examples of leadership.,This was my father in Vietnam.,And I was raised to believe,that soldiers were strong and wise,and brave and faithful;,they didn't lie, cheat, steal,or abandon their comrades.,And I still believe real leaders are like that.,But in my first 25 years of career,,I had a bunch of different experiences. 
 One of my first battalion commanders,,I worked in his battalion for 18 months,and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal,was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,,and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.,And I'm not sure that was real interaction.,But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,,I went out to the National Training Center.,And we did an operation,,and my company did a dawn attack --,you know, the classic dawn attack:,you prepare all night, move to the line of departure.,And I had an armored organization at that point.,We move forward, and we get wiped out --,I mean, wiped out immediately.,The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.,And after the battle,,they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review",to teach you what you've done wrong.,Sort of leadership by humiliation.,They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:,"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc.",I walked out feeling as low,as a snake's belly in a wagon rut.,And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.,And I went up to apologize to him,,and he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great.",And in one sentence,,he lifted me, put me back on my feet,,and taught me that leaders can let you fail,and yet not let you be a failure. 
 When 9/11 came,,46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.,First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with:,the environment changed --,the speed, the scrutiny,,the sensitivity of everything now is so fast,,sometimes it evolves faster,than people have time to really reflect on it.,But everything we do,is in a different context.,More importantly, the force that I led,was spread over more than 20 countries.,And instead of being able to get all the key leaders,for a decision together in a single room,and look them in the eye and build their confidence,and get trust from them,,I'm now leading a force that's dispersed,,and I've got to use other techniques.,I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat,,I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls --,I've got to use everything I can,,not just for communication,,but for leadership.,A 22-year-old individual,operating alone,,thousands of miles from me,,has got to communicate to me with confidence.,I have to have trust in them and vice versa.,And I also have to build their faith.,And that's a new kind of leadership,for me. 
 We had one operation,where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.,An emerging opportunity came --,didn't have time to get everybody together.,So we had to get complex intelligence together,,we had to line up the ability to act.,It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,,convince them that this was the right thing to do,and do all of this,on electronic medium.,We failed.,The mission didn't work.,And so now what we had to do,is I had to reach out,to try to rebuild the trust of that force,,rebuild their confidence --,me and them, and them and me,,and our seniors and us as a force --,all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.,Entirely new requirement. 
 Also, the people had changed.,You probably think that the force that I led,was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists,carrying exotic weapons.,In reality,,much of the force I led,looked exactly like you.,It was men, women, young, old --,not just from military; from different organizations,,many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.,And so instead of giving orders,,you're now building consensus,and you're building a sense of shared purpose.,Probably the biggest change,was understanding that the generational difference,,the ages, had changed so much.,I went down to be with a Ranger platoon,on an operation in Afghanistan,,and on that operation,,a sergeant in the platoon,had lost about half his arm,throwing a Taliban hand grenade,back at the enemy,after it had landed in his fire team.,We talked about the operation,,and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.,I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?",And one young Ranger in the back --,his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown,from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind --,he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade.",And it reminded me,that we're operating a force,that must have shared purpose,and shared consciousness,,and yet he has different experiences,,in many cases a different vocabulary,,a completely different skill set,in terms of digital media,than I do and many of the other senior leaders.,And yet, we need to have that shared sense. 
 It also produced something,which I call an inversion of expertise,,because we had so many changes at the lower levels,in technology and tactics and whatnot,,that suddenly the things that we grew up doing,wasn't what the force was doing anymore.,So how does a leader,stay credible and legitimate,when they haven't done,what the people you're leading are doing?,And it's a brand new leadership challenge.,And it forced me to become a lot more transparent,,a lot more willing to listen,,a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.,And yet, again, you're not all in one room.,Then another thing.,There's an effect on you and on your leaders.,There's an impact, it's cumulative.,You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time. 
 I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq,with one of my senior officers,and we watched a firefight from one of our forces.,And I remembered his son was in our force.,And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?",And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking.",I said, "Where is he now?",And he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight.",Think about watching your brother, father,,daughter, son, wife,in a firefight in real time,and you can't do anything about it.,Think about knowing that over time.,And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders. 
 And you have to watch and take care of each other.,I probably learned the most about relationships.,I learned they are the sinew,which hold the force together.,I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.,And every morning in the Ranger regiment,,every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them --,says a six-stanza Ranger creed.,You may know one line of it, it says,,"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.",And it's not a mindless mantra,,and it's not a poem.,It's a promise.,Every Ranger promises every other Ranger,,"No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me,,if you need me, I'm coming.",And every Ranger gets that same promise,from every other Ranger.,Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.,It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.,And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.,And so the organizational relationship that bonds them,is just amazing. 
 And I learned personal relationships,were more important than ever.,We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,,and an old friend of mine,,that I had spent many years,at various points of my career with --,godfather to one of their kids --,he sent me a note, just in an envelope,,that had a quote from Sherman to Grant,that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,,that you would come, if alive.",And having that kind of relationship, for me,,turned out to be critical at many points in my career. 
 And I learned that you have to give that,in this environment,,because it's tough.,That was my journey.,I hope it's not over.,I came to believe,that a leader isn't good because they're right;,they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.,This isn't easy stuff.,It's not like that electronic abs machine,where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.,(Laughter),And it isn't always fair.,You can get knocked down,,and it hurts,and it leaves scars.,But if you're a leader,,the people you've counted on,will help you up.,And if you're a leader,,the people who count on you need you on your feet. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is Revolution 2.0.,No one was a hero. No one was a hero.,Because everyone was a hero.,Everyone has done something.,We all use Wikipedia.,If you think of the concept of Wikipedia,where everyone is collaborating on content,,and at the end of the day,you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.,From just an idea that sounded crazy,,you have the largest encyclopedia in the world. 
 And in the Egyptian revolution,,the Revolution 2.0,,everyone has contributed something,,small or big. They contributed something --,to bring us,one of the most inspiring stories,in the history of mankind,when it comes to revolutions.,It was actually really inspiring,to see all these Egyptians completely changing.,If you look at the scene,,Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill --,going into a downhill.,Everything was going bad.,Everything was going wrong.,We only ranked high when it comes to poverty,,corruption,,lack of freedom of speech,,lack of political activism.,Those were the achievements,of our great regime.,Yet, nothing was happening.,And it's not because people were happy,or people were not frustrated.,In fact, people were extremely frustrated.,But the reason why everyone was silent,is what I call the psychological barrier of fear.,Everyone was scared.,Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians,that I have to thank for being so brave --,going into protests as a couple of hundred,,getting beaten up and arrested.,But in fact, the majority were scared.,Everyone did not want really,to get in trouble. 
 A dictator cannot live without the force.,They want to make people live in fear.,And that psychological barrier of fear,had worked for so many years,,and here comes the Internet,,technology, BlackBerry, SMS.,It's helping all of us to connect.,Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook,were helping us a lot,because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone.,There are a lot of people who are frustrated.",There are lots of people who are frustrated.,There are lots of people who actually share the same dream.,There are lots of people who care about their freedom.,They probably have the best life in the world.,They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas.,They are happy. They don't have problems.,But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian. 
 A lot of us, we're not really happy,when we see a video of an Egyptian man,who's eating the trash,while others are stealing,billions of Egyptian pounds,from the wealth of the country.,The Internet has played a great role,,helping these people to speak up their minds,,to collaborate together, to start thinking together.,It was an educational campaign. 
 Khaled Saeed was killed,in June 2010.,I still remember the photo.,I still remember every single detail of that photo.,The photo was horrible.,He was tortured,,brutally tortured to death.,But then what was the answer of the regime?,"He choked on a pile of hash" --,that was their answer:,"He's a criminal.,He's someone who escaped from all these bad things.",But people did not relate to this.,People did not believe this.,Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed,and everyone knew the truth.,And everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother.",He was a middle-class guy.,His photo was remembered by all of us. 
 A page was created.,An anonymous administrator,was basically inviting people to join the page,,and there was no plan.,"What are we going to do?" "I don't know.",In a few days, tens of thousands of people there --,angry Egyptians,who were asking the ministry of interior affairs,,"Enough.,Get those who killed this guy.,To just bring them to justice.",But of course, they don't listen.,It was an amazing story --,how everyone started feeling the ownership.,Everyone was an owner in this page.,People started contributing ideas.,In fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas,was, "Hey, let's have a silent stand.,Let's get people to go in the street,,face the sea, their back to the street,,dressed in black, standing up silently for one hour,,doing nothing and then just leaving,,going back home.",For some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand.,And next time it's going to be vibration.",People were making fun of the idea.,But actually when people went to the street --,the first time it was thousands of people,in Alexandria --,it felt like -- it was amazing. It was great,because it connected people from the virtual world,,bringing them to the real world,,sharing the same dream,,the same frustration, the same anger,,the same desire for freedom.,And they were doing this thing.,But did the regime learn anything? Not really.,They were actually attacking them.,They were actually abusing them,,despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were --,they were not even protesting.,And things had developed,until the Tunisian revolution. 
 This whole page was, again,,managed by the people.,In fact, the anonymous admin job,was to collect ideas,,help people to vote on them,and actually tell them what they are doing.,People were taking shots and photos;,people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt;,people were suggesting ideas,,they were actually voting on ideas,,and then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos.,Everything was done by the people to the people,,and that's the power of the Internet.,There was no leader.,The leader was everyone on that page.,The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying,,inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.,Yes we can. We can do it.,We have the same problems;,we can just go in the streets. 
 And when I saw the street on the 25th,,I went back and said,,"Egypt before the 25th,is never going to be Egypt after the 25th.,The revolution is happening.,This is not the end,,this is the beginning of the end.",I was detained on the 27th night.,Thank God I announced the locations and everything.,But they detained me.,And I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me.,I was detained for 12 days,,blindfolded, handcuffed.,And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything.,I was not allowed to speak with anyone.,And I went out.,The next day I was in Tahrir.,Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square,,I thought it was 12 years.,I never had in my mind,to see this Egyptian,,the amazing Egyptian.,The fear is no longer fear.,It's actually strength -- it's power.,People were so empowered.,It was amazing how everyone was so empowered,and now asking for their rights.,Completely opposite.,Extremism became tolerance. 
 Who would [have] imagined before the 25th,,if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray,and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them,,and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray,and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them --,this is amazing.,All the stereotypes,that the regime was trying to put on us,through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media,,are proven wrong.,This whole revolution showed us,how ugly such a regime was,and how great and amazing,the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman,,how simple and amazing these people are,whenever they have a dream. 
 When I saw that,,I went back and I wrote on Facebook.,And that was a personal belief,,regardless of what's going on,,regardless of the details.,I said that, "We are going to win.,We are going to win because we don't understand politics.,We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.,We're going to win because we don't have an agenda.,We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes,actually come from our hearts.,We're going to win because we have dreams.,We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams.",And that's actually what happened. We won.,And that's not because of anything,,but because we believed in our dream.,The winning here is not,the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene.,The winning is the winning of the dignity,of every single Egyptian. 
 Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me,,"Listen, I am breathing freedom.,I feel that I have dignity,that I have lost for so many years.",For me that's winning,,regardless of all the details. 
 My last word to you is a statement I believe in,,which Egyptians have proven to be true,,that the power of the people,is much stronger than the people in power. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 (Applause)The story I want to tell you about, started to me,,in 1996 when I was studying in England.,One day, I was glancing through my bank statementn(I didn't have much to look at),and I've noticed that in the upper corner there wasna symbol, that I'm going to show you,,saying that document had been made innplain language, for me to understand it.,The idea interested me; I tried to find outnwhat that was,and I found out that there was a campaign for thensimplification of language,,which was the "Plain English Campaign".,I thought it was a fabulous idea, for about none day or two,,and I've never thought about it since.,When I came back to Portugal, for good,,I came across with several documents - for example, nmy work contract,,the papers I had to sign to buy a house, nthe electricity bill --,a series of documents that reminded me of nthat bank statement.,Not because they were equally clear and simple,,but because they were the exact opposite.,Because I had to read everything twice or thrice, nto begin to understand what was written there.,And then, that little seed that had been sownnin 1996, started germinating.,And one day, I found myself,entering through my boss' office and quitting nmy job to dedicate myself to this.,And so, what did I find out, right off the start?,I found out that it was a much more severe problem nthan I thought.,It wasn't only about these documents being ncomplex and annoying,,it was the fact that Portuguese people's literacy --,literacy is the hability to understand written documents --,is extremely low. I'm going to show you a chart about Portuguese people's literacy [rate].,You know that about 10, 11\% of people, in Portugal, 
 don't know how to read nor write at all, yet.,Over there are those who know, or say they know, nhow to read and write. So, what do we have?,We have that group of red people in level 1, nwhich is the lowest in literacy [rate].,They are persons who are able to join letters,,but they can't, actually, understand.,For example, if a person, from that red group, nhas to pick up,the package leaflet of a medicinal product, nto give a dose of medicine to his/her child,,he/she can't, can't understand the information.,50\% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30\% more, nthose yellow ones,,over there, people who get bynon the daily basis.,That is, if they don't have to read anything too new nor too different, they will manage.,But, for example, if they work in a factory and na new machine arrives,and they have to read the machine's manual nto be able to work with it, they can't do it anymore.,And there they go, 80\% of the Portuguese people.,Then we have a few more that can handle documents,,as long as they are not too complex,,and we have 5\% of the population that ncan handle really complex documents.,Now, just so you don't think this is normal, nthat over there is Sweden.,While we have 20\% of people with the literacy nconsidered essential for a daily basis,,Sweden has 75\%.,And looking at that, what did I realize?,I realized we live in an apartheid of information.,I realized that there's a small minority of people nwho has indeed access to information,and can use it to their advantage and na huge majority that can't.,And because they can't, they are excluded nand they are impaired.,Let me give you an example.,That one is Mr. Domingos, my building's doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27,,so, he falls in that yellow group that nwe have seen a little while ago.,From time to time, I'm arriving home and he says:,"Miss Sandra!"; "Yes, Mr. Domingos.","Here is a little letter." So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood,receives something that they don't understand, nthey come to me and I help them to translate it.,And so, that time he said to me like this:,"Oh, Miss Sandra, I'm about to throw this away, nbut check it if this is important.",It was very important. He had been waiting, nfor quite a while, to have a knee surgery,and that was the letter of the famous surgery-banknchecks. When a person is waiting for a long time,,they get a bank check and with that bank check nthey can have that surgery in the private sector.,It was almost thrown away into the garbage, nMr. Domingos' letter.,In that same year, I've found out,,only 20\% of people had used these nsurgery-bank checks.,The other 80\%, I don't believe they had been curednwhile they were waiting.,They most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos:,"Ah! What's this? I'm not understanding, nit's going to the garbage".,They lost the opportunity to have the surgery nthey needed.,What happens here? When people don't understand,this has severe consequences -- to the individual, nbut also for the country.,When I don't understand which are my rights, nthe benefits I can have access to,,I can't understand my duties and I'm not nan active and participative citizen either.,Now, maybe, you are sitting there and thinking:,"Yeah, poor Mr. Domingos... Bad luck, isn't it? nMe?! I'm in the green ones.","I'm absolutely sure that I'm one of the green ones. nI was selected to come to TED! Hum?" (Laughter),So the deal is: I have here some texts to read to you,and I'm going to see what color are you nwhen I finish reading.,So, come on, this is an automobile insurance ncontract. It says this:,"Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided,,in case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last,,in case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary,,to the heirs of the last". Hum? (Laughter),Next, there's another one, from the medicines' npackage leaflet, that says the following:,"Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema, nvesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria.",Hum? Are you clear?,And this one is really good. This one, I signedna renting contract to the new office on Friday,and I laughed my head off.,So, it said: "I, as a cosigner, assume the opportune npayment of the rents,,waiving the benefits of the division nand prior foreclosure.",When I heard "opportune payment" ["storm payment" nin Portuguese], I imagined myself bursting in there,,slamming the door and saying: "Here's the money!!!"n(Laughter),But it's not! (Laughter) (Applause),But it's not! (Applause),(Applause),(Applause),So, it's this: when we leave our area of expertise --,and it only takes a little; there is no need to go nto the string theory or something like that,,it only takes a little... (Laughter),What happens?,We get as lost as Mr. Domingos.,And these documents are not written nby experts to experts,,as the ones from the string theory.,No! These are documents written for me, nthese are the public documents,,the public documents I need to understand nin my daily life,,to govern myself, to live my life.,These are the renting contracts, the package leaflet nof the medicines.,It's all this. The electricity bills.,This has to be clear, so that I can understand.,Because, if I can't understand, what happens?,I make mistakes, I get wrong.,I'm going to give you an example of mistakes that nwere committed, bad decisions made,for not being able to understand documents.,Do you remember the subprime crisis that ntook place in the United States?,What happened?,People signed those loans to buy houses,,without truly understanding what they were signing.,Because if they knew what they were signing,,they'd know that as soon as the interest rate startednto rise, the monthly payment would also increase,,they wouldn't be able to pay anymore and nthey would end up without a house.,So, the rest, after that, next, everything ncrumbled down and we know the rest.,Do you think that if there was a culture of clarity nin the financial sector,things would have got up to where they've got?,I don't think so. So,,how do you solve this problem,,this such big difference between the nliteracy [rate] of the Portuguese,,that is down here, and the complexity nof the public documents,,those ones we need to understandnin our daily lives, sorry,,that are up here?,So, the first think that comes to mind is,,"If literacy is down here, let's make it rise" -- isn't it?,Let's educate people.,Let's, let's... of course we will, nof course we will educate people.,The thing is, it's hard and it's slow. nAnd I don't even want to imagine,how many generations it will take until we are nat Sweden's level.,But, besides that, it's not only because it is slow. nThere is another problem.,If the language of the documents nisn't simpler,,we've already seen that people, even with na high literacy level, like you,,if the language is hard, they don't get cleared,,they continue to be unable to understandnthese documents.,So, besides increasing literacy [rate], and for now,,it's much more important to reduce nthe complexity of documents,and simplify the language.,I'm going to show you an example.,When I talk about simplifying the language. nNotice!,On the left side of a contract:,"It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla, nbla bla bla, bla bla...",This is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language?,It's communicating in a simple and clear way, nenabling our reader to understand it at first glance.,What do you prefer? Before or after?,There isn't much doubt, is there?,So, how is this achieved? How can you make nthe State and companies communicate,with citizens in a language they can understand nat first glance?,There are several ways. There are countries nthat are going by the path of legislation.,For example, Sweden and the United States nintroduced, last year, a legislation that forces,the State to communicate with people in na language they can understand.,And you think, "Well, that's normal. nThey are countries that are a bit ahead.,"Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States.,"But they are countries that are a bit ahead.,"It would be nice if in our country there was also nlegislation towards that, wouldn't it be?",So it would. And there is! Since 1999.,The Law of the Administrative Modernization nsays that,the communication between the State and the people,should be simple, clear, concise, meaningful, nwithout acronyms, bla bla bla...,But the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question,,the path of going through legislation, nenforcing through legislation,,works in those countries where laws nare made to be applied.,Now, there is another way, the way of marketing.,How does that work? It's like this:,private companies change their language; ncommunicate in a clearer and simpler way,,they make a big fuss about it, consumers love it,,the sales rise, it works beautifully.,But it works for the private sector.,Now, what is the third path, and to me, nthe most important one?,It's the path of civil movements,,that are based in a mentality shift.,In countries where this really went forward --,do you remember the English label, of then"Plain English Campaign"? --,this is all based on a consumers' movement.,So, what does it take for that civic movement nto happen?,We need to understand two very important things:,First, wanting to understand these npublic documents is not a whim,,is not an intellectual curiosity.,It is a necessity that I have in my daily life.,And above all, it is a right, it is everyone's right.,On this side we have: understanding is a right.,And we have to understand another thing too,,which is: he who writes, has to write in order nto be understood.,How do we get there?,First of all: we have to become demanding nconsumers and citizens.,Think it this way: next time someone ngives you a document,that you just simply don't understand, don't be shy,,don't keep quiet, pretending that you are nunderstanding everything.,No! Demand to understand. Ask.,I know that this is not easy. Turn to the gentleman nin the little suite and say:,"Look here, this contract, this part, nwhat does this mean?",It's not easy, and perhaps it's even a bit nembarrassing, isn't it?,But it is not. It's a sign of intelligence.,What do you teach your children when nthey have doubts in school?,"Don't say nothing to anyone, shut up really good nand act smart.",No, you don't, right? You say:,"Look, when you don't understand, you put your hand nup in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared.",And that is exactly what we have to do, nas consumers and citizens.,So, next time you come across with na document you don't understand,,demand to understand, put aside your pride and ask,until you get completely cleared.,Then, there's the other side, which is:n"Okay, these awful documents,"which are in circulation, they don't grow on trees.,"Someone wrote them." Hum?,Maybe, among this big group, some persons...,I don't know, some lawyers, some public employees --nI'm not asking you to identify yourselves,,but I ask you to search your own conscience.,How many times do you write documents nfor the general public,,for people that don't share your language,,and you write them in a language that nonly you will understand?,And you'll say: "Ah, that's because nthere is a reason, here!",Dear friends, I already heard all the reasons.,There are thousands of reasons. They go like these:,"Ah, it's the house's culture"; "Oh, my boss!","Oh, the judge! And what if this goes to court?","What you want is to destroy language. nWe have to educate people.","We can't lower the level"; bla, bla, bla...,I've seen all of this. These are excuses.,A while ago, they told us about Einstein.,Einstein said this: "If you can't write about a subject,,in a simple way, it's because, in fact, nyou don't understand it.",So, if you... (Applause),To Einstein... (Applause),To Einstein...(Applause),So -- ah, ah, I don't have time! --,so, if you do know what you want to say -- ndon't you? --,you are aware of what you want to say,,you just have to do one thing: believe that it is npossible to write in a simple way.,And how do you do that?,It's very easy. You write to your grandmother. nHum?,You write to your grandmother. I'm going nto show grandma to you.,(Laughter),You write with respect and without paternalism.,And you use three techniques that I'm going nto teach you. First of all:,Start by the most important.,Grandma has a lot to do. She is not going to readnthree pages to get to the main idea.,Start by the most important.,Next, use short sentences, because grandma,,like anyone of us,,if you make very long sentences,,she gets to the end and she can't remember what nyou said in the beginning, anymore.,And lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones nthat grandma knows.,Alright? It's easy!,Before I leave,,I would like to talk to you about "Clara" (Clear). n"Clara" is a project of social responsibility.,It has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made.,What do we do?,We are going to launch this year na collection of "Claro" guides,,that is, we are going to pick very, very, nvery complex subjects and put them simple.,We are going to start with the n"Claro" Guide of Justice.,I think it is an area... that comes in handy. n(Applause),And now I'm going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]'s advise. nIf it's time to ask,,whoever wants to sponsor the n"Claro" Guide of Justice -- I don't know...,for example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? --,come talk to me later.,Another thing we will do is to grant prizes nto the worse and best documents,,because, indeed, there are people who are workingnto communicate in a clearer way,,and that have to be rewarded,,and there are lazy people that do nothing nabout it and need to be humiliated.,So, we'll give prizes to the worst and to the best.,I'm counting on your help. (Applause),(Applause),We are going to launch... we are going to launchnthe campaign via Clara's Facebook,,so, send your friendship request and nyou'll be up to date.,But, lastly, above all, what does "Clara" want?,It wants to put two little things in your heads.,The first one: demand to understand. Don't be shy.,And write in order to be understood. nWrite to your grandma.,And if you don't have a grandmother, write to nMr. Domingos, he will like it.,Thank you. (Applause)Meet Inook. He's a pretty happy guy.,And I'd be pretty happy, too,,if this was the first time my communitynhad just gained access to fresh water.,Inook is from the country of Malawi,,the small sliver of a countrynin Southern Africa,,known as "The Warm Heart of Africa.",Over the past 10 years, five millionnmore people like Inook in Malawi,have gained access to fresh water.,But what's unfortunatenis that this picture is a lie.,I'll come back to that in a second. 
 Ten years ago, two Waterloo engineersnsparked a movement across Canada,,"Engineers Without Borders.",This movement was based on the conceptnthat it was completely unacceptable,that 5 million people in Malawindid not have access to fresh water,,when us engineers back in Canadanwere working on problems,such as making a photocopiernincrease its speed,from 149 pages a minutento 151 pages per minute.,We needed to worknon problems that mattered.,I was fortunate, I foundednthe Calgary chapter here.,I got to be the first directornof overseas programs,for Engineers Without Borders in Africa,,where I worked for four years.,And I got to worknwith hundreds of businesses,,non-government organizations, governments,,all working in this field of development.,It was really fantastic workingnfor Engineers Without Borders,because even though we workednon hundred-million-dollar projects,,we had this philosophy,that if we were really going to understandnthe problems in local Africa,,we needed to live like local Africans.,So, as a lot of ex-patriotsnwould spend most of the time,in the capital cities and boardrooms,,we'd spend our time in villagesnlearning local languages,,traveling on public transports. 
 And what this allowed us to donwas to get a really deep understanding,of what was going on at the field level.,Combined with this experience,and hundreds of other EngineersnWithout Borders experiences,,we got a really interesting perspectivenof what's going on in this aid industry.,The aid industry has gottenna lot of attention lately.,A lot of economists have become authorsnand have written about it.,There's a lot of controversynabout its effectiveness,,some even askingnthe question, "Has aid failed?",It's a very interesting question.,Now, I can confidently say,on behalf of EngineersnWithout Borders staff members,that, failed or not, we definitely feelnthat the aid system is broken.,And when I say broken,,I'm not talking aboutnwhat the media usually talks about.,It's not about corrupt dictatorsnor about corruption.,Those issues still happen in Africa,,but they're much more the minoritynthan they are the mainstream today.,I'm talking about aid being broken,in democratically elected,nstable governments with no civil unrest,,countries like Ghana, Malawi and Zambia. 
 So, I talked about Malawi.,The World Bank has statednthat 80\% of the people in Malawi,have access to fresh water sources.,So one of our staff membersnin Malawi, this is Owen,,was visiting one of those water points.,It was a gravity-fed system,that was commissionednby the Canadian government,and finished about a year and a half ago.,A gravity-fed systemnbasically is a bunch of pipes,that pipe water downnfrom an elevated region,down into a number of communitiesnwhere there are taps,,and people can access that water.,And he was going aroundnturning on some of those taps,,and some weren't working.,So he asked the community,,"How many of these aren't working?",And they said, "Well, out of 113, 81.",81? What's the problem? What's going on? 
 He found out that a lot of the pipesnhad sprung leaks and broken down.,All right, not a big deal,npipes break down everywhere.,But the problemnwith this project was that,,even though the infrastructure was built,,there was no thinking aboutnwho was going to maintain the system.,Some people really took initiativenand tried to fix the pipes themselves,,but there was a lacknof affordable spare parts available.,This situation is typical.,This is a graphic showing one areanof Malawi, I think it's an urban area,,where the green dotsnare functional water points,,yellow, are ones that are workingnbut breaking down,,and red are not functional.,Hardly eighty percent.,Actually, Engineers Without Bordersnhas done some work,and found out that even though there's 80\%ncoverage of water points,,40\% are not working.,See, this issue is ...,A lot of donors and projectsnend up focusing on,the hardware side of the issue,and not really realizing the importancenof the software side of things.,At first it's like, software --nof course you have to do maintenance.,But when you think about itnas people donating to charities,,it makes you feel a lot better,if you know that your money wentnto something tangible,,something like a well,nsomething like a school,,something like giving a family a goat.,It's not as sexy and easynto tell your friends about,how you helped fund a water committeenor paid for teacher salaries.,So when I say thatnthis picture of Inook is a lie,,it's not a lie when the picture is taken.,It only becomes a liena year or two afterwards. 
 When looking at these pictures,none of my great colleagues said,,"Everything people seenfrom Africa doesn't matter.,And everything that mattersnfrom Africa, people don't get to see.",And this problem goes a lot furthernthat just broken down water points.,Owen, after seeing this water point,ndiscovered not more than 30 feet away:,"Hey there's another set of tapsnthat look really broken down, too,,but they're not attached to the system.",And he asked the community, "What's that?",They said: "Oh, that's the Americanngovernment gravity-fed water system.",It was built over ten years ago.,He said, "What happened to that?",They said, "Oh, it also broke downnabout a year and a half later.",How is it that a projectnthat failed ten years ago,was rebuilt with almostnthe same technology, same process,,and had exactly the same failurenten years later? 
 I've recently joined a start-up companynthat sells goods online,,a lot of them from Africa,nfair-trade goods --,it's sort of like the ethicalneBay or Amazon.,And what we've learnednbeing a private sector start-up is,,if we don't serve our customers,and we don't provide themnthe product they need,,they won't buy it.,And then if we don't innovate, changenand adapt to their needs,,we go out of business.,They have a power to hold us accountable.,If we look to the public sector,,it doesn't adapt and changenquite as fast as the private sector,,but at the end of the day,,if the elected government doesn't meetnthe needs of its constituents,,they have a chancento vote them out of power,,therefore holding them accountable. 
 But in the development sector,,if they don't serve the needsnof their beneficiaries --,and they're not just NGOs, but governmentsnand businesses as well --,the beneficiaries have no powernto vote them out or to fire them.,The people who have that powernare the donors.,And when you look at the system,nyou can see some of the challenges.,Development is the sectornthat focuses more on pleasing the donors,and making them happynand communicating to them,,as opposed to understandingnthe needs of the beneficiaries.,Because of that, systematic challengenis very slow to innovate,,there's very little change,,and you get exactly the same projectnbuilt ten years later,that fails in exactly the same way. 
 So what we do about this?,First answer is easy:,we invest in the privatenand public sectors,in the developing world.,They're inherently structurally builtnto be more sustainable,and to allow beneficiariesnto hold them accountable.,However, 70\% of peoplenin sub-Saharan Africa,still make less than two dollarsna day and are still in poverty.,And a lot of that reason is becausenthe private and the public sector,are not serving them appropriately.,So we do need to invest in businessesnand governments in Africa,,but it's still going to take a long timenfor the problems to be fixed.,Therefore, that leaves us with one option,and we need to work with this system.,Therefore, we have to fix it. 
 We need to make it more accountable,nmore creative and more transparent.,We need to start innovating,ncoming up with really neat ideas --,ideas like giving beneficiariesna chance to rate their projects,using their mobile phones --,that donors and NGOs can understand.,Or moving our donorsncloser to our beneficiaries.,Currently, only 20\%,of the Canadian InternationalnDevelopment Agency's African staff,are based in Africa.,Ideas like funding development sectorsnlike VCs fund businesses:,What would it be like if a donornfunded ten projects,and expected four of them to do OK,,one of them to do fantastic,and five of them to fail?,And not all of the solutionsnneed to be that complex.,Engineers Without Borders is working onnone that's actually quite simple;,it's admitting failure. 
 My first project with EngineersnWithout Borders was in India.,I worked with a bunch of schools,,the poorest schools in India,nthe untouchable caste.,This is Bani, she was a girlnwho was in one of those schools,and she and her classmates had to spendntwo to three hours a day,walking to collect waternto bring it back to the school,so they could have fresh waternto drink and for cooking,and for going to the bathroom.,My job in Engineers Without Bordersnwas to help solve the problem.,I worked with the communities;,we came up with rainwaternharvesting solutions,to collect water from the rooftopsnduring the monsoons,,bring it through gutters, filternand store it for the dry season.,I worked there for a numbernof months, and by the time I left,,we had the project fundednand being implemented.,I returned back homento Canada almost a hero.,My friends and familynwere like, "Wow, that's fantastic!,You gave up your job in the oilnand gas sector to go volunteer in India.,That's really inspiring." 
 A year later, I contacted my NGOnto see how everything was going,with the rainwater harvesting systems.,And they told me that not a single onenwas still operating.,The reason was because a lotnof them had been built,,but some of them had broken down,because there was no maintenancenschedule put in place.,I had made the exact same mistakenthat I criticized earlier.,When I thought of my friendsnand family back home,who thought I was such a hero,,I felt like an impostor.,I thought of Bani,nI didn't help her at all. 
 Admitting failure is actually quite hard,,and I didn't tell many people about this.,And one of the only thingsnthat helped me feel better about this --,and it's a bit of a shame to say this —,was that I started to learn,that other people in EngineersnWithout Borders had failed, too.,But Engineers Without Borders hasnthis culture of embracing failure openly,and letting us talk about it.,And it was only through a bunchnof us talking about failure,that we really got to seenwe're making a lot of mistakes,,and we're making the same mistakesnand can learn from them.,And we started to innovate and change. 
 Engineers Without Bordersnis drastically different now,,10 years later than what we thoughtnEngineers should be doing in development.,We don't build water points anymore;nin fact, we don't build anything,other than spreadsheets.,We now have this innovativenmarketing campaign,,"Sponsor an African spreadsheet,",because we understand thatnthe problems are not hardware problems;,it's all aboutnthat software side of things.,But it's a hard conceptnto get across to people;,they want to fund wells and schools.,But it's really aboutnthe software side of things,,and it's a lot longer a processnto fund those things.,And it's not sexy, but it works.,Our staff members were really exitednto share this failure internally,,but we still were not doing a good jobnof letting other people know.,And some very courageous field staffnwere getting upset at the management,because other projects werengoing to make the same failures;,they weren't learning.,So they pushed our management staff.,And we were nervousnpublishing our failures,,but for the last three years,,Engineers Without Borders has publishednan annual failure report,citing our biggest failures. 
 At first, I was asked,n"What do your donors think?",and I think, "How would my donors feel,if they knew the money they had spentnand saved up and generously donated,had had no impact?",And you know, that's tough.,And our donors felt that, too.,But once they startednreading the failures,,they understood the powernof those lessons learned,and realized it's an injusticennot to be sharing these.,Then we realized that notneveryone reads reports,,so we built a website,nadmittingfailure.com.,This is for all organizations to comenand start admitting their failures,,and to start havingna discussion about failure.,The concept is catching on. 
 The Harvard Business Review, just lastnmonth, published their first review,focused on failure.,Two big companies latelynhave also dealt with failure.,I talk to my friendsnin other sectors and they're like,,"It's not just the development sectornthat has this challenge,,it crosses into a lot of other sectors.",Two companies had big failures lately.,What's interesting about them is,none of them publicly admitted the failure,and talked about what they learnednfrom it and what they'll do next time.,The other one kind of triednto not talk about it at all.,It will be interesting looking forwardnto see which of those strategies works.,I'd like to ask people to, first of all,,think about: How does your organizationnthink about and share failure?,Maybe ask the person next to you,,because I think it can generatensome really interesting conversations. 
 And lastly, I'd like to turn backnto this question, "Has aid failed?",I think I'll say that, for me,nthe answer is "Yes,",but only because it hasn't failed enough. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How many of you had to fill out a web form,where you've been asked to read,a distorted sequencenof characters like this?,How many of you found it really annoying? 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, outstanding. So I invented that. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or I was one of the people who did it.,That thing is called a CAPTCHA.,And it is there to make surenyou, the entity filling out the form,,are a human and not a computer program,that was written to submitnthe form millions of times.,The reason it works is because humans,nat least non-visually-impaired humans,,have no trouble readingnthese distorted characters,,whereas programs can't do it as well yet.,In the case of Ticketmaster,,the reason you havento type these characters,is to prevent scalpersnfrom writing a program,that can buy millionsnof tickets, two at a time. 
 CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.,And since they're used so often,,a lot of times the sequencenof random characters shown to the user,is not so fortunate.,So this is an examplenfrom the Yahoo registration page.,The random charactersnthat happened to be shown to the user,were W, A, I, T,nwhich, of course, spell a word.,But the best part is the message,that the Yahoo help deskngot about 20 minutes later. 
 [Help! I've been waitingnfor over 20 minutes and nothing happens.] 
 (Laughter) 
 This person thought they needed to wait.,This, of course,nis not as bad as this poor person. 
 (Laughter) 
 CAPTCHA Project is something that we didnat Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,,and it's been used everywhere.,Let me now tell you about a projectnthat we did a few years later,,which is sort ofnthe next evolution of CAPTCHA.,This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,,which is something that we startednhere at Carnegie Mellon,,then we turned it into a start-up company.,And then about a year and a half ago,nGoogle actually acquired this company. 
 Let me tell you what this project started.,This project startednfrom the following realization:,It turns out that approximatelyn200 million CAPTCHAs,are typed everydaynby people around the world.,When I first heard this,nI was quite proud of myself.,I thought, look at the impactnmy research has had.,But then I started feeling bad.,Here's the thing:neach time you type a CAPTCHA,,essentially, you wasten10 seconds of your time.,And if you multiply that by 200 million,,you get that humanity is wastingnabout 500,000 hours every day,typing these annoying CAPTCHAs. 
 (Laughter) 
 So then I started feeling bad. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I started thinking, of course,nwe can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs,,because the security of the webndepends on them.,But then I started thinking,ncan we use this effort,for something that is good for humanity?,So see, here's the thing.,While you're typing a CAPTCHA,nduring those 10 seconds,,your brain is doing something amazing.,Your brain is doing somethingnthat computers cannot yet do.,So can we get you to do useful worknfor those 10 seconds?,Is there some humongous problemnthat we cannot yet get computers to solve,,yet we can splitninto tiny 10-second chunks,such that each timensomebody solves a CAPTCHA,,they solve a little bit of this problem?,And the answer to that is "yes,"nand this is what we're doing now. 
 Nowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA,,not only are you authenticatingnyourself as a human,,but in addition you're helping usnto digitize books.,Let me explain how this works.,There's a lot of projectsntrying to digitize books.,Google has one.nThe Internet Archive has one.,Amazon, with the Kindle,nis trying to digitize books.,Basically, the way this worksnis you start with an old book.,You've seen those things, right?,Like a book? 
 (Laughter) 
 So you start with a booknand then you scan it. 
 Now, scanning a book,is like taking a digitalnphotograph of every page.,It gives you an image for every page.,This is an image with textnfor every page of the book.,The next step in the processnis that the computer needs to be able,to decipher the words in this image.,That's using a technology called OCR,nfor optical character recognition,,which takes a picture of text,and tries to figure outnwhat text is in there.,Now, the problemnis that OCR is not perfect.,Especially for older books,where the ink has fadednand the pages have turned yellow,,OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.,For things that were writtennmore than 50 years ago,,the computer cannot recognizenabout 30 percent of the words.,So now we're taking all of the wordsnthat the computer cannot recognize,and we're getting peoplento read them for us,while they're typingna CAPTCHA on the Internet. 
 So the next time you type a CAPTCHA,nthese words that you're typing,are actually words from booksnthat are being digitized,that the computer could not recognize.,The reason we haventwo words nowadays instead of one,is because one of the words,is a word that the systemnjust got out of a book,,it didn't know what it wasnand it's going to present it to you.,But since it doesn't know the answer,nit cannot grade it.,So we give you another word,,for which the system does know the answer.,We don't tell you which one's whichnand we say, please type both.,And if you type the correct word,for the one for whichnthe system knows the answer,,it assumes you are human,and it also gets some confidencenthat you typed the other word correctly.,And if we repeat this processnto 10 different people,and they agree on what the new word is,,then we get one more wordndigitized accurately. 
 So this is how the system works.,And since we released itnabout three or four years ago,,a lot of websites have startednswitching from the old CAPTCHA,,where people wasted their time,,to the new CAPTCHA where peoplenare helping to digitize books.,So every time you buyntickets on Ticketmaster,,you help to digitize a book.,Facebook: Every timenyou add a friend or poke somebody,,you help to digitize a book.,Twitter and about 350,000 other sitesnare all using reCAPTCHA.,And the number of sitesnthat are using reCAPTCHA is so high,that the number of wordsnwe're digitizing per day is really large.,It's about 100 million a day,,which is the equivalent of aboutntwo and a half million books a year.,And this is all being donenone word at a time,by just people typingnCAPTCHAs on the Internet. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, of course,,since we're doing so many words per day,,funny things can happen.,This is especially truenbecause now we're giving people,two randomly chosen English wordsnnext to each other.,So funny things can happen.,For example, we presented this word.,It's the word "Christians";nthere's nothing wrong with it.,But if you present it alongnwith another randomly chosen word,,bad things can happen.,So we get this. 
 [bad Christians] 
 But it's even worse, becausenthe website where we showed this,actually happened to be callednThe Embassy of the Kingdom of God. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oops. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's another really bad one.,JohnEdwards.com 
 [Damn liberal] 
 (Laughter) 
 So we keep on insulting peoplenleft and right everyday.,Of course, we're notnjust insulting people.,Here's the thing. Since we're presentingntwo randomly chosen words,,interesting things can happen.,So this actually has given risento a really big Internet meme,that tens of thousands of peoplenhave participated in,,which is called CAPTCHA art.,I'm sure some of you have heard about it.,Here's how it works.,Imagine you're using the Internetnand you see a CAPTCHA,that you think is somewhat peculiar,,like this CAPTCHA. 
 [invisible toaster] 
 What you're supposed to donis you take a screenshot of it.,Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHAnbecause you help us digitize a book.,But first you take a screenshot,and then you draw somethingnthat is related to it. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's how it works. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are tens of thousands of these.,Some of them are very cute. 
 [clenched it] 
 (Laughter) 
 Some of them are funnier. 
 [stoned Founders] 
 (Laughter) 
 And some of them,nlike paleontological shvisle ... 
 (Laughter) 
 they contain Snoop Dogg. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so this is my favoritennumber of reCAPTCHA.,So this is the favorite thingnthat I like about this whole project.,This is the number of distinct people,that have helped us digitize at leastnone word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:,750 million, a little over 10 percentnof the world's population,,has helped us digitize human knowledge.,And it is numbers like thesenthat motivate my research agenda.,So the question that motivatesnmy research is the following:,If you look at humanity'snlarge-scale achievements,,these really big things,that humanity has gotten togethernand done historically --,like, for example,nbuilding the pyramids of Egypt,or the Panama Canal,or putting a man on the Moon --,there is a curious fact about them,,and it is that they were all donenwith about the same number of people.,It's weird; they were all donenwith about 100,000 people.,And the reason for that is because,nbefore the Internet,,coordinating more than 100,000 people,,let alone paying them,nwas essentially impossible.,But now with the Internet,nI've just shown you a project,where we've gotten 750 million peoplento help us digitize human knowledge.,So the questionnthat motivates my research is,,if we can put a mannon the Moon with 100,000,,what can we do with 100 million? 
 So based on this question,,we've had a lot of different projectsnthat we've been working on.,Let me tell you about onenthat I'm most excited about.,This is something that we've beennsemiquietly working on,for the last year and a half or so.,It hasn't yet been launched.nIt's called Duolingo.,Since it hasn't been launched, shhh! 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, I can trust you'll do that.,So this is the project.nHere's how it started.,It started with me posing a questionnto my graduate student, Severin Hacker.,OK, that's Severin Hacker.,So I posed the questionnto my graduate student.,By the way, you did hear me correctly;nhis last name is Hacker. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I posed this question to him:nHow can we get 100 million people,translating the webninto every major language for free?,There's a lot of thingsnto say about this question.,First of all, translating the web.,Right now, the webnis partitioned into multiple languages.,A large fraction of it is in English.,If you don't know English,nyou can't access it.,But there's large fractionsnin other different languages,,and if you don't know them,nyou can't access it.,So I would like to translatenall of the web,,or at least most of it,ninto every major language.,That's what I would like to do. 
 Now, some of you may say,nwhy can't we use computers to translate?,Machine translationnis starting to translate,some sentences here and there.,Why can't we use it to translate the web?,The problem with thatnis it's not yet good enough,and it probably won't benfor the next 15 to 20 years.,It makes a lot of mistakes.nEven when it doesn't,,since it makes so many mistakes,nyou don't know whether to trust it or not. 
 So let me show you an example,of something that wasntranslated with a machine.,Actually, it was a forum post.,It was somebody who was tryingnto ask a question about JavaScript.,It was translatednfrom Japanese into English.,So I'll just let you read.,This person starts apologizing,for the fact thatnit's translated with a computer.,So the next sentence is going to benthe preamble to the question.,So he's just explaining something.,Remember, it's a questionnabout JavaScript. 
 [At often, the goat-timeninstall a error is vomit.] 
 (Laughter) 
 Then comes the first part of the question. 
 [How many times like the wind,na pole, and the dragon?] 
 (Laughter) 
 Then comes my favorite partnof the question. 
 [This insult to father's stones?] 
 (Laughter) 
 And then comes the ending,,which is my favorite partnof the whole thing. 
 [Please apologize for your stupidity.nThere are a many thank you.] 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so computer translation,nnot yet good enough.,So back to the question.,So we need peoplento translate the whole web.,So now the next question you may have is,,well, why can't we justnpay people to do this?,We could pay professional translatorsnto translate the whole web.,We could do that.,Unfortunately, it would benextremely expensive.,For example, translating a tiny fractionnof the whole web, Wikipedia,,into one other language, Spanish.,OK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish,,but it's very smallncompared to the size of English.,It's about 20 percentnof the size of English.,If we wanted to translatenthe other 80 percent into Spanish,,it would cost at leastn50 million dollars --,and this is even at the most exploited,noutsourcing country out there.,So it would be very expensive.,So what we want to do is,nwe want to get 100 million people,translating the webninto every major language for free. 
 If this is what you want to do,nyou quickly realize,you're going to runninto two big hurdles, two big obstacles.,The first one is a lack of bilinguals.,So I don't even know,if there exists 100 million peoplenout there using the web,who are bilingual enoughnto help us translate.,That's a big problem.,The other problem you're going to run intonis a lack of motivation.,How are we going to motivate peoplento actually translate the web for free?,Normally, you have to paynpeople to do this.,So how are we going to motivate themnto do it for free?,When we were starting to think about this,nwe were blocked by these two things.,But then we realized, there's a way,to solve both these problemsnwith the same solution.,To kill two birds with one stone.,And that is to transformnlanguage translation,into something that millionsnof people want to do,and that also helpsnwith the problem of lack of bilinguals,,and that is language education. 
 So it turns out that today,,there are over 1.2 billion peoplenlearning a foreign language.,People really wantnto learn a foreign language.,And it's not just becausenthey're being forced to do so in school.,In the US alone,nthere are over five million people,who have paid over $500nfor software to learn a new language.,So people really wantnto learn a new language.,So what we've been working onnfor the last year and a half,is a new website --nit's called Duolingo --,where the basic idea isnpeople learn a new language for free,while simultaneously translating the web.,And so basically,nthey're learning by doing. 
 So the way this works,is whenever you're a just a beginner,nwe give you very simple sentences.,There's a lot of very simplensentences on the web.,We give you very simple sentencesnalong with what each word means.,And as you translate them,and as you see how other peoplentranslate them,,you start learning the language.,And as you get more advanced,,we give you more complexnsentences to translate.,But at all times,nyou're learning by doing. 
 Now, the crazy thing about this methodnis that it actually really works.,People are really learning a language.,We're mostly done building itnand now we're testing it.,People really cannlearn a language with it.,And they learn it about as wellnas the leading language learning software.,So people really do learn a language.,And not only do they learn it as well,nbut actually it's more interesting.,Because with Duolingo,npeople are learning with real content.,As opposed to learningnwith made-up sentences,,people are learning with real content,nwhich is inherently interesting.,So people really do learn a language. 
 But perhaps more surprisingly,,the translations that we getnfrom people using the site,,even though they're just beginners,,the translations that we get,are as accurate as thosenof professional language translators,,which is very surprising.,So let me show you one example.,This is a sentence that was translatednfrom German into English.,The top is the German.nThe middle is an English translation,that was done by a professional translator,who we paid 20 cents a wordnfor this translation.,And the bottom is a translationnby users of Duolingo,,none of whom knew any Germannbefore they started using the site.,If you can see, it's pretty much perfect.,Of course, we play a trick here,to make the translations as goodnas professional language translators.,We combine the translationsnof multiple beginners,to get the qualitynof a single professional translator. 
 Now, even thoughnwe're combining the translations,,the site actuallyncan translate pretty fast.,So let me show you,,this is our estimatesnof how fast we could translate Wikipedia,from English into Spanish.,Remember, this isn50 million dollars' worth of value.,So if we wanted to translatenWikipedia into Spanish,,we could do it in five weeksnwith 100,000 active users.,And we could do it in about 80 hoursnwith a million active users.,Since all the projectsnmy group has worked on so far,have gotten millions of users,,we're hopeful that we'll be ablento translate extremely fast. 
 Now, the thing thatnI'm most excited about with Duolingo,is I think this provides a fairnbusiness model for language education.,So here's the thing:,The current business modelnfor language education,is the student pays,,and in particular, the studentnpays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's the current business model.,The problem with this business model,is that 95 percent of the world'snpopulation doesn't have 500 dollars.,So it's extremely unfair towards the poor.,This is totally biased towards the rich.,Now, see, in Duolingo,,because while you learn,nyou're actually creating value,,you're translating stuff --,which, for example, we couldncharge somebody for translations,,so this is how we could monetize this.,Since people are creating valuenwhile they're learning,,they don't have to pay with their money,nthey pay with their time.,But the magical thing here,is that is time that would have hadnto have been spent anyways,learning the language.,So the nice thing about Duolingo,is, I think, it providesna fair business model --,one that doesn't discriminatenagainst poor people. 
 So here's the site. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We haven't yet launched,,but if you go there, you can sign upnto be part of our private beta,,which is probably going to startnin three or four weeks.,We haven't yet launched it. 
 By the way, I'm the one talking here,,but Duolingo is the worknof a really awesome team, 
 some of whom are here. So thank you. 
 (Applause)A couple of years ago,,when I was attendingnthe TED conference in Long Beach,,I met Harriet.,We'd actually met online before --nnot the way you're thinking.,We were introducednbecause we both knew Linda Avey,,one of the founders of the firstnonline personal genomic companies.,And because we sharednour genetic information with Linda,,she could see that Harriet and I shared,a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA,nhaplotype K1a1b1a,,which meant we were distantly related.,We actually share the samengenealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.,So -- Ötzi, Harriet and me.,And being the current day, of course,nwe started our own Facebook group.,You're all welcome to join.,When I met Harriet in personnthe next year at the TED conference,,she'd gone online and orderednour own happy haplotype T-shirts. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why am I telling you this story?,What does it have to donwith the future of health?,Well, the way I met Harriet is an example,of how leveraging cross-disciplinary,nexponentially growing technologies,is affecting our futurenof health and wellness --,from low-cost gene analysis,to the ability to donpowerful bioinformatics,to the connection of the Internetnand social networking.,What I'd like to talk about today,is understandingnthese exponential technologies.,We often think linearly.,But if you think about it,nif you have a lily pad,and it just divided every single day --,two, four, eight, sixteen --nin 15 days, you'd have 32,000.,What do you think you'd have in a month?,We're at a billion.,If we start to think exponentially,,we can see how this is starting to affectnall the technologies around us. 
 Many of these technologies,nspeaking as a physician and innovator,,we can start to leverage,nto impact the future of our own health,and of health care,,and to address many of the majornchallenges in health care today,,ranging from the exponential costsnto the aging population,,the way we really don't useninformation very well today,,the fragmentation of care,and the often very difficult coursenof adoption of innovation.,And one of the major things we can donis move the curve to the left.,We spend most of our moneynon the last 20 percent of life.,What if we could incentivize physiciansnin the health care system,and our own selves,to move the curve to the leftnand improve our health,,leveraging technology as well?,Now my favorite examplenof exponential technology,,we all have in our pocket.,If you think about it,nthese are really dramatically improving.,I mean, this is the iPhone 4.,Imagine what the iPhone 8nwill be able to do. 
 Now, I've gained some insight into this.,I've been the track sharenfor the medicine portion,of a new institutionncalled Singularity University,,based in Silicon Valley.,We bring together each summernabout 100 very talented students,from around the world.,And we look at these exponentialntechnologies from medicine,,biotech, artificial intelligence,nrobotics, nanotechnology, space,,and address how we can cross-trainnand leverage these,to impact major unmet goals.,We also have seven-day executive programs.,And coming up next month is FutureMed,,a program to help cross-trainnand leverage technologies into medicine. 
 Now, I mentioned the phone.,These mobile phones have over 20,000ndifferent mobile apps available.,There's one out of the UKnwhere you can pee on a little chip,,connect it to your iPhone,,and check for an STD.,I don't know if I'd try that,nbut it's available.,There are other sorts of applications.,Merging your phonenand diagnostics, for example,,measuring your blood glucosenon your iPhone,and sending that to your physician,,so they can better understandnand you can better understand,your blood sugars as a diabetic.,So let's see how exponentialntechnologies are taking health care.,Let's start with faster.,It's no secret that computers,nthrough Moore's law,,are speeding up faster and faster. 
 We can do more powerful things with them.,They're really approaching --nin many cases, surpassing --,the ability of the human mind.,But where I think computational speednis most applicable is in imaging.,The ability now to lookninside the body in real time,with very high resolution,is really becoming incredible.,And we're layering multiplentechnologies -- PET scans, CT scans,and molecular diagnostics --,to find and seek thingsnat different levels.,Here you're going to see the very highestnresolution MRI scan done today,,of Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.,And now we can see inside of the brain,at a resolution and abilitynnever before available,,and essentially learn how to reconstructnand maybe even reengineer,or backwards engineer the brain,,so we can better understandnpathology, disease and therapy.,We can look inside with real-timenfMRI in the brain at real time.,And by understanding these sortsnof processes and these connections,,we're going to understand the effectsnof medication or meditation,and better personalizenand make effective, for example,,psychoactive drugs. 
 The scanners for these are gettingnsmaller, less expensive,and more portable.,And this sort of data explosionnavailable from these,is really almost becoming a challenge.,The scan of today takes upnabout 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.,The scan in a couple of yearsnwill be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.,How do you leverage that information?,Let's get personal.,I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy,nbut if you're over age 50,,it's time for your screening colonoscopy.,How'd you like to avoidnthe pointy end of the stick?,Now there's essentiallynvirtual colonoscopy.,Compare those two pictures.,As a radiologist, you can basicallynfly through your patient's colon,,and augmenting thatnwith artificial intelligence,,potentially identify a lesionnthat we might have missed,,but using AI on top of radiology,,we can find lesionsnthat were missed before.,Maybe this will encouragenpeople to get colonoscopies,that wouldn't have otherwise. 
 This is an example of this paradigm shift.,We're moving to this integrationnof biomedicine, information technology,,wireless and, I would say, mobile now --nthis era of digital medicine.,Even my stethoscope is now digital,nand of course, there's an app for that.,We're moving, obviously,nto the era of the tricorder.,So the handheld ultrasoundnis basically surpassing,and supplanting the stethoscope.,These are now at a price pointnof what used to be 100,000 euros,or a couple hundred-thousand dollars.,For about 5,000 dollars,,I can have the power of a very powerfulndiagnostic device in my hand.,Merging this now with the adventnof electronic medical records --,in the US, we're stillnless than 20 percent electronic;,here in the Netherlands,nI think it's more than 80 percent. 
 Now that we're switchingnto merging medical data,,making it available electronically,,we can crowd-source the information,nand as a physician,,I can access my patients' datanfrom wherever I am,,just through my mobile device.,And now, of course, we're in the eranof the iPad, even the iPad 2.,Just last month,,the first FDA-approvednapplication was approved,to allow radiologists to do actualnreading on these sorts of devices.,So certainly, the physiciansnof today, including myself,,are completely reliable on these devices.,And as you saw just about a month ago,,Watson from IBM beatnthe two champions in "Jeopardy.",So I want you to imaginenwhen, in a couple of years,,we've started to applynthis cloud-based information,,when we really have the AI physiciannand leverage our brains to connectivity,to make decisions and diagnosticsnat a level never done.,Already today, you don't need to gonto your physician in many cases.,Only in about 20 percent of visitsndo you need to lay hands on the patient.,We're now in the era of virtual visits.,From Skype-type visitsnyou can do with American Well,,to Cisco, that's developed a very complexnhealth presence system, 
 the ability to interact withnyour health care provider is different.,And these are being augmentedneven by our devices, again, today.,My friend Jessica sent mena picture of her head laceration,,so I can save her a tripnto the emergency room,,and do diagnostics that way.,Or maybe we can leveragentoday's gaming technology,,like the Microsoft Kinect,,hack that to enable diagnostics,nfor example, in diagnosing stroke,,using simple motion detection,nusing $100 devices.,We can actually now visitnour patients robotically.,This is the RP7;,if I'm a hematologist,nI can visit another clinic or hospital.,These are being augmentednby a whole suite of tools,actually in the home now.,We already have wireless scales.,You step on the scale,ntweet your weight to your friends,,they can keep you in line. 
 We have wireless blood pressure cuffs.,A whole gamut of technologiesnare being put together.,Instead of wearing kludgy devices,nwe put on a simple patch.,This was developed at Stanford.,It's called iRhythm; it completelynsupplants the prior technology,at a much lower price point,nwith much more effectivity.,We're also in the era todaynof quantified self.,Consumers now can basically buyn$100 devices, like this little Fitbit.,I can measure my steps,nmy caloric outtake.,I can get insight into thatnon a daily basis,and share it with my friends or physician.,There's watches that measurenyour heart rate, Zeo sleep monitors,,a suite of toolsnthat enable you to leverage,and have insight into your own health. 
 As we start to integrate this information,,we'll know better what to do with it,nand have better insight,into our own pathologies,nhealth and wellness.,There's even mirrorsnthat can pick up your pulse rate.,And I would argue, in the future,,we'll have wearable devicesnin our clothes, monitoring us 24/7.,And just like the OnStar systemnin cars, your red light might go on.,It won't say "check engine";nit'll be a "check your body" light,,and you'll go get it taken care of.,Probably in a few years,,you'll look in your mirrornand it'll be diagnosing you. 
 (Laughter) 
 For those of you with kiddos at home,,how would you like a wirelessndiaper that supports your -- 
 (Laughter) 
 More information, I think,nthan you might need,,but it's going to be here. 
 Now, we've heard a lot todaynabout technology and connection.,And I think some of these technologies,will enable us to be more connectednwith our patients, to take more time,and do the importantnhuman-touch elements of medicine,,as augmented by these technologies.,Now, we've talked aboutnaugmenting the patient.,How about augmenting the physician?,We're now in the eranof super-enabling the surgeon,,who can now go into the body and donrobotic surgery, which is here today,,at a level that was not really possibleneven five years ago.,And now this is being augmentednwith further layers of technology,,like augmented reality.,So the surgeon can seeninside the patient, through their lens,,where the tumor is,nwhere the blood vessels are.,This can be integratednwith decision support.,A surgeon in New York can helpna surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.,And we're entering an eranof truly scarless surgery called NOTES,,where the robotic endoscopencan come out the stomach,and pull out that gallbladder,,all in a scarless way and robotically.,This is called NOTES, and it's coming --nbasically scarless surgery,,as mediated by robotic surgery. 
 Now, how about controlling other elements?,For those who havendisabilities -- the paraplegic,,there's the brain-computerninterface, or BCI,,where chips have been putnon the motor cortex,of completely quadriplegic patients,,and they can controlna cursor or a wheelchair,or, potentially, a robotic arm.,These devices are getting smaller,and going into more and morenof these patients.,Still in clinical trials,,but imagine when we can connectnthese, for example,,to the amazing bionic limb,,such as the DEKA Arm,nbuilt by Dean Kamen and colleagues,,which has 17 degreesnof motion and freedom,,and can allow the person who's lost a limb,to have much higher dexterity or controlnthan they've had in the past. 
 So we're really entering the eranof wearable robotics, actually.,If you haven't lost a limbnbut had a stroke,,you can wear these augmented limbs.,Or if you're a paraplegic -- I've visitednthe folks at Berkeley Bionics --,they've developed eLEGS.,I took this video last week.,Here's a paraplegic patient, walkingnby strapping on these exoskeletons.,He's otherwise completelynwheelchair-bound.,This is the early eranof wearable robotics.,And by leveragingnthese sorts of technologies,,we're going to changenthe definition of disability,to, in some cases, be superability,nor super-enabling.,This is Aimee Mullins, who lostnher lower limbs as a young child,,and Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT,,who lost his limbs in a climbing accident.,And now both of them can climb better,nmove faster, swim differently,with their prostheticsnthan us normal-abled persons. 
 How about other exponentials?,Clearly the obesity trend is exponentiallyngoing in the wrong direction,,including with huge costs.,But the trend in medicinenis to get exponentially smaller.,A few examples: we're now in the eranof "Fantastic Voyage," the iPill.,You can swallow thisncompletely integrated device.,It can take pictures of your GI system,,help diagnose and treatnas it moves through your GI tract.,We get into even smaller micro-robots,that will eventually, autonomously,nmove through your system,,and be able to do things surgeons can't do,in a much less invasive manner.,Sometimes these mightnself-assemble in your GI system,,and be augmented in that reality. 
 On the cardiac side,npacemakers are getting smaller,and much easier to place,,so no need to train an interventionalncardiologist to place them.,And they'll be wirelessly telemeterednto your mobile devices,,so you can go placesnand be monitored remotely.,These are shrinking even further.,This one is in prototypingnby Medtronic; it's smaller than a penny.,Artificial retinas, the ability to putnarrays on the back of the eyeball,and allow the blind to see --,also in early trials,nbut moving into the future.,These are going to be game-changing.,Or for those of us who are sighted,,how about havingnthe assisted-living contact lens?,Bluetooth, Wi-Fi available --nbeams back images to your eye. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, if you have troublenmaintaining your diet,,it might help to have some extra imagery,to remind you how many caloriesnare going to be coming at you. 
 How about enabling the pathologistnto use their cell phone,to see at a microscopic level,and to lumber that data back to the cloudnand make better diagnostics?,In fact, the whole eranof laboratory medicine,is completely changing.,We can now leverage microfluidics,,like this chip madenby Steve Quake at Stanford.,Microfluidics can replacenan entire lab of technicians;,put it on a chip, enable thousandsnof tests at the point of care,,anywhere in the world.,This will really leverage technologynto the rural and the underserved,and enable what used to be thousand-dollarntests to be done for pennies,,and at the point of care.,If we go down the smallnpathway a little bit further,,we're entering the era of nanomedicine,,the ability to make devices super-small,,to the point where we canndesign red blood cells,or microrobots that monitornour blood system or immune system,,or even those that might clear outnthe clots from our arteries. 
 Now how about exponentially cheaper?,Not something we usually thinknabout in the era of medicine,,but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollarsnfor 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper.,In genomics now, the genomencost about a billion dollars,about 10 years ago,nwhen the first one came out.,We're now approaching essentiallyna $1,000 genome, probably next year.,And in two years, a $100 genome.,What will we do with $100 genomes?,Soon we'll have millionsnof these tests available.,Then it gets interesting, when we startnto crowd-source that information,,and enter the eranof true personalized medicine:,the right drug for the right personnat the right time,,instead of what we're doing now,nwhich is the same drug for everybody,,blockbuster drug medications,nwhich don't work for the individual.,Many different companies are workingnon leveraging these approaches. 
 I'll show you a simple example,nfrom 23andMe again.,My data indicatesnI've got about average risk,for developing macular degeneration,na kind of blindness.,But if I take that same data,nupload it to deCODEme,,I can look at my risk for type 2 diabetes;nI'm at almost twice the risk.,I might want to watch how much dessertnI have at lunch, for example.,It might change my behavior.,Leveraging my knowledgenof my pharmacogenomics:,how my genes modulate,nwhat my drugs do and what doses I need,will become increasingly important,,and once in the handsnof individuals and patients,,will make better drug dosingnand selection available. 
 So again, it's not just genes,nit's multiple details --,our habits, our environmental exposures.,When was the last time your doctornasked where you've lived?,Geomedicine: where you live,nwhat you've been exposed to,,can dramatically affect your health.,We can capture that information.,Genomics, proteomics, the environment --,all this data streaming at usnindividually and as physicians:,How do we manage it?,We're now entering the eranof systems medicine, systems biology,,where we can start to integratenall this information.,And by looking at the patterns,nfor example, in our blood,,of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test,,we can look at patterns and detect diseasenat a much earlier stage.,This is called by Lee Hood,nthe father of the field, P4 Medicine.,We'll be predictive and knownwhat you're likely to have.,We can be preventative;nthat prevention can be personalized.,More importantly,nit'll be increasingly participatory.,Through websites like PatientsLikeMe,or managing your data on MicrosoftnHealthVault or Google Health,,leveraging this togethernin participatory ways,will be increasingly important. 
 I'll finish up with exponentially better.,We'd like to get therapiesnbetter and more effective.,Today we treat high blood pressurenmostly with pills.,What if we take a new device,,knock out the nerve vesselsnthat help mediate blood pressure,,and in a single therapy,nbasically cure hypertension?,This is a new devicendoing essentially that.,It should be on the marketnin a year or two.,How about more targetedntherapies for cancer?,I'm an oncologist and know that mostnof what we give is essentially poison.,We learned at Stanford and other placesnthat we can discover cancer stem cells,,the ones that seem to be reallynresponsible for disease relapse.,So if you think of cancer as a weed,,we often can whack the weed awaynand it seems to shrink,,but it often comes back.,So we're attacking the wrong target.,The cancer stem cells remain,,and the tumor can returnnmonths or years later.,We're now learning to identifynthe cancer stem cells,and identify those as targetsnand go for the long-term cure.,We're entering the eranof personalized oncology,,the ability to leveragenall of this data together,,analyze the tumor,and come up with a real, specific cocktailnfor the individual patient. 
 I'll close with regenerative medicine.,I've studied a lot about stem cells.,Embryonic stem cellsnare particularly powerful.,We have adult stem cellsnthroughout our body;,we use those in bone marrowntransplantation.,Geron, last year, started the first trialnusing human embryonic stem cells,to treat spinal cord injuries.,Still a phase I trial, but evolving.,We've been using adult stem cellsnin clinical trials for about 15 years,to approach a whole range of topics,nparticularly cardiovascular disease.,If we take our own bone marrow cellsnand treat a patient with a heart attack,,we can see much improvednheart function and better survival,using our own bone marrow derived cellsnafter a heart attack. 
 I invented a devicencalled the MarrowMiner,,a much less invasive waynfor harvesting bone marrow.,It's now been FDA approved;nhopefully on the market in the next year.,Hopefully you can appreciate the device,going through the patient's body removingnbone marrow, not with 200 punctures,,but with a single puncture,nunder local anesthesia. 
 Where is stem-cell therapy going?,If you think about it,,every cell in your body has the same DNAnyou had when you were an embryo.,We can now reprogram your skin cells,to actually act like a pluripotentnembryonic stem cell,and utilize those, potentially, to treatnmultiple organs in the same patient,,making personalized stem cell lines.,I think there'll be a new eranof your own stem cell banking,to have in the freezer your own cardiacncells, myocytes and neural cells,to use them in the future,nshould you need them.,We're integrating this nownwith a whole era of cellular engineering,,and integrating exponential technologiesnfor essentially 3D organ printing,,replacing the ink with cells,,and essentially buildingnand reconstructing a 3D organ. 
 That's where things are heading.,Still very early days,,but I think, as integrationnof exponential technologies,,this is the example.,So in closing, as you thinknabout technology trends,and how to impact health and medicine,,we're entering an era of miniaturization,,decentralization and personalization.,And by pulling these things together,,if we start to think aboutnhow to understand and leverage them,,we're going to empower the patient,nenable the doctor, enhance wellness,and begin to cure the wellnbefore they get sick.,Because I know as a doctor, if someonencomes to me with stage I disease,,I'm thrilled; we can often cure them.,But often it's too late,,and it's stage III or IVncancer, for example.,So by leveragingnthese technologies together,,I think we'll enter a new eranthat I like to call stage 0 medicine.,And as a cancer doctor,nI'm looking forward to being out of a job. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Host: Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Take a bow, take a bow.It's an amazing thing,that we're here to talknabout the year of patients rising.,You heard stories earlier today,about patients who are takingncontrol of their cases,,patients who are saying,,"You know what, I know what the odds are,,but I'm going to looknfor more information.,I'm going to definenwhat the terms of my success are.",I'm going to be sharing with younhow, four years ago, I almost died --,found out I was, in fact,nalready almost dead --,and what I then found out,about what's callednthe e-Patient movement.,I'll explain what that term means.,I had been bloggingnunder the name "Patient Dave,",and when I discovered this,,I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave. 
 Regarding the word "patient":,When I first started a few years agongetting involved in health care,and attending meetingsnas just a casual observer,,I noticed that peoplenwould talk about patients,as if it was somebodynwho's not in the room here --,somebody out there.,Some of our talks today,nwe still act like that.,But I'm here to tell you:,"patient" is not a third-person word.,All right?,You yourself will findnyourself in a hospital bed --,or your mother, your child --,there are heads nodding, people who say,,"Yes, I know exactly what you mean." 
 So when you hear what I'm goingnto talk about here today,,first of all, I want to say that I am here,on behalf of all the patientsnthat I have ever met,,all the ones I haven't met.,This is about letting patientsnplay a more active role,in helping health care,nin fixing health care.,One of the senior doctors at my hospital,,Charlie Safran,nand his colleague, Warner Slack,,have been saying for decades,that the most underutilizednresource in all of health care,is the patient.,They have been saying thatnsince the 1970s. 
 Now, I'm going to step back in history.,This is from July, 1969.,I was a freshman in college,,and this was when we firstnlanded on the Moon.,And it was the first time,we had ever seen from another surface --,that's the placenwhere you and I are right now,,where we live.,The world was changing.,It was about to changenin ways that nobody could foresee.,A few weeks later, Woodstock happened.,Three days of fun and music.,Here, just for historical authenticity,,is a picture of me in that year. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes --,it was really something. 
 That fall of 1969,,the Whole Earth Catalog came out.,It was a hippie journalnof self-sufficiency.,We think of hippiesnof being just hedonists,,but there's a very strong component --nI was in that movement --,a very strong componentnof being responsible for yourself.,This book's title's subtitlenis "Access to Tools.",It talked about how to buildnyour own house,,how to grow your own food,nall kinds of things.,In the 1980s,,this young doctor, Tom Ferguson,,was the medical editornof the Whole Earth Catalog.,He saw that the great majoritynof what we do in medicine and health care,is taking care of ourselves.,In fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent,of how we actuallyntake care of our bodies.,Well, he also saw that when health carenturns to medical care,because of a more serious disease,,the key thing that holds us backnis access to information.,And when the Web came along,nthat changed everything,,because not onlyncould we find information,,we could find other people like ourselves,who could gather,nwho could bring us information.,And he coined this term "e-Patients" --,equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.,Obviously, at this stage of life,he was in a somewhat more dignifiednform than he was back then. 
 Now, I was an engaged patientnlong before I ever heard of the term.,In 2006, I went to my doctornfor a regular physical,,and I had said, "I have a sore shoulder.",Well, I got an X-ray,,and the next morning --,you may have noticed, those of younwho have been through a medical crisis,will understand this.,This morning, some of the speakersnnamed the date when they found out,about their condition.,For me, it was 9am,on January 3, 2007.,I was at the office; my desk was clean.,I had the blue partitionncarpet on the walls.,The phone rang and it was my doctor.,He said, "Dave, I pullednup the X-ray image,on the screen on the computer at home.",He said, "Your shouldernis going to be fine,,but Dave, there's something in your lung.",And if you look in that red oval,,that shadow was not supposed to be there.,To make a long story short,,I said, "So you need mento get back in there?",He said, "Yeah, we're going to neednto do a CT scan of your chest.",In parting, I said,n"Is there anything I should do?",He said -- think about this one,,this is the advice your doctor gives you:,"Just go home and have a glassnof wine with your wife." 
 I went in for the CAT scan.,It turns out there werenfive of these things in both my lungs.,So at that point we knewnthat it was cancer.,We knew it wasn't lung cancer.,That meant it was metastasizednfrom somewhere.,The question was, where from?,So I went in for an ultrasound.,I got to do what many women have --,the jelly on the belly and the, "Bzzzz!",My wife came with me.,She's a veterinarian,,so she's seen lots of ultrasounds.,I mean, she knows I'm not a dog. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is an MRI image.,This is much sharpernthan an ultrasound would be.,What we saw in that kidney,was that big blob there.,There were actually two of these:none was growing out the front,and had already eruptednand latched onto the bowel.,One was growing out the backnand it attached to the psoas muscle,,which is a big muscle in the backnthat I'd never heard of,,but all of a sudden I cared about it. 
 (Laughter) 
 I went home. 
 Now, I've been Googling --,I've been online since 1989,non CompuServe.,I went home, and I knownyou can't read the details here;,that's not important.,My point is, I went to a respectednmedical website, WebMD,,because I know how to filter out junk.,I also found my wife online.,Before I met her,,I went through some suboptimalnsearch results. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I looked for quality information.,There's so much about trust --,what sources of information can we trust?,Where does my body endnand an invader start?,A cancer, a tumor, is somethingnyou grow out of your own tissue.,How does that happen?,Where does medical ability end and start?,Well, so what I read on WebMD:,"The prognosis is poornfor progressing renal cell cancer.,Almost all patients are incurable.",I've been online long enough to knownif I don't like the first results I get,,I go look for more.,And what I found on other websites was,,even by the third page of Google results:,"Outlook is bleak.","Prognosis is grim.",And I'm thinking, "What the heck?",I didn't feel sick at all.,I mean, I'd been gettingntired in the evening,,but I was 56 years old, you know?,I was slowly losing weight,,but for me, that was whatnthe doctor told me to do.,It was really something. 
 And this is the diagramnof stage 4 kidney cancer,from the drug I eventually got.,Totally by coincidence,nthere's that thing in my lung.,In the left femur, the left thigh bone,nthere's another one.,I had one. My leg eventually snapped.,I fainted and landed on it, and it broke.,There's one in the skull,,and then for good measure,nI had these other tumors,,including, by the timenmy treatment started,,one was growing out of my tongue.,I had kidney cancerngrowing out of my tongue.,And what I read,was that my median survival was 24 weeks.,This was bad.,I was facing the grave.,I thought, "What's my mother's facengoing to look like,on the day of my funeral?",I had to sit down with my daughternand say, "Here's the situation.",Her boyfriend was with her.,I said, "I don't want you guysnto get married prematurely,,just so you can do itnwhile Dad's still alive.",It's really serious.,If you wonder why patientsnare motivated and want to help,,think about this. 
 Well, my doctor prescribedna patient community, ACOR.org,,a network of cancer patients,nof all amazing things.,Very quickly they told me,,"Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease.,Get yourself to a specialist center.,There is no cure, but there's somethingnthat sometimes works --,it usually doesn't --,called high-dosage interleukin.,Most hospitals don't offer it,,so they won't even tell you it exists.,Don't let them give younanything else first.,And by the way, here are four doctorsnin your part of the United States,who offer it, and their phone numbers.",How amazing is that? 
 (Applause) 
 Here's the thing:,Here we are, four years later --,you can't find a websitenthat gives patients that information.,Government-approved,nAmerican Cancer Society,,but patients knownwhat patients want to know.,It's the power of patient networks.,This amazing substance --nagain, I mentioned:,Where does my body end?,My oncologist and I talk a lot these days,because I try to keep my talksntechnically accurate.,And he said, "You know, the immunensystem is good at detecting invaders,,bacteria coming from outside,,but when it's your own tissuenthat you've grown,,it's a whole different thing.",And I went throughna mental exercise, actually,,because I started a patient supportncommunity of my own on a website,,and one of my friends --none of my relatives, actually -- said,,"Look, Dave, who grew this thing?,Are you going to set yourself upnas mentally attacking yourself?",So we went into it.,The story of how all thatnhappened is in the book. 
 Anyway, this is the waynthe numbers unfolded.,Me being me, I put the numbersnfrom my hospital's website,,for my tumor sizes,,into a spreadsheet.,Don't worry about the numbers.,You see, that's the immune system.,Amazing thing, those two yellow lines,are where I got the two dosesnof interleukin two months apart.,And look at how the tumor sizesnplummeted in between.,Just incredible.,Who knows what we'll be able to donwhen we learn to make more use of it? 
 The punch line is that a yearnand a half later,,I was there when this magnificentnyoung woman, my daughter,,got married.,And when she came down those steps,,and it was just her and menfor that moment,,I was so glad that she didn't havento say to her mother,,"I wish Dad could have been here.",And this is what we're doingnwhen we make health care better. 
 Now, I want to talk brieflynabout a couple of other patients,who are doing everythingnin their power to improve health care.,This is Regina Holliday,,a painter in Washington DC,nwhose husband died of kidney cancer,a year after my disease.,She's painting, here, a mural,of his horriblenfinal weeks in the hospital.,One of the things that she discovered,was that her husband's medical recordnin this paper folder,was just disorganized.,And she thought, "You know,nif I have a nutrition facts label,on the side of a cereal box,,why can't there be something that simple,telling every new nurse who comes on duty,,every new doctor,,the basics about my husband's condition?",So she painted this medical facts muralnwith a nutrition label,,something like that,,in a diagram of him.,She then, last year, painted this diagram. 
 She studied health care like me.,She came to realizenthere were a lot of people,who'd written patient-advocate books,that you just don't hearnabout at medical conferences.,Patients are suchnan underutilized resource.,Well, as it said in my introduction,,I've gotten somewhat known for saying,that patients should havenaccess to their data.,I actually said at one conferencena couple of years ago,,"Give me my damn data,,because you peoplencan't be trusted to keep it clean.",And here, she has our "damned" data --,it's a pun --,which is starting to break out,nstarting to break through --,the water symbolizes our data. 
 And in fact,,I want to do a little somethingnimprovisational for you.,There's a guy on Twitter that I know,na health IT guy outside Boston,,and he wrote the e-Patient rap.,And it goes like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Beatboxing) 
 (Rapping) Gimme my damn data,I wanna be an e-Patient just like Dave,Gimme my damn data,n'cause it's my life to save,(Normal voice) Now, I'm not goingnto go any further -- 
 (Applause) (Cheering) 
 Well, thank you. That shot the timing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Think about the possibility.,Why is it that iPhones and iPadsnadvance far faster,than the health toolsnthat are available to you,to help take care of your family?,Here's a website, VisibleBody.com,nthat I stumbled across.,And I thought, "You know,nI wonder what my psoas muscle is?",So you can click on things and remove it.,And I saw, "Aha! That's the kidneynand the psoas muscle.",I was rotating it in 3Dnand saying, "I understand now.",And then I realizednit reminded me of Google Earth,,where you can fly to any address.,And I thought, "Why not take thisnand connect it to my digital scan data,and have Google Earth for my body?",What did Google come out with this year?,Now there's Google Body browser.,But you see, it's still generic.,It's not my data.,But if we can get that datanout from behind the dam,so software innovators can pounce on it,the way software innovators like to do,,who knows what we'll be ablento come up with. 
 One final story.,This is Kelly Young, a rheumatoidnarthritis patient from Florida.,This is a live story,nunfolding just in the last few weeks.,RA patients, as they call themselves --nher blog is "RA Warrior" --,have a big problem,,because 40 percent of themnhave no visible symptoms.,And that makes it really hardnto tell how the disease is going,,and some doctors think,n"Yeah right, you're really in pain.",Well, she found,nthrough her online research,,a nuclear bone scannthat's usually used for cancer,,but it can also reveal inflammation.,And she saw thatnif there is no inflammation,,then the scan is a uniform gray.,So she took it.,And the radiologist's reportnsaid, "No cancer found.",Well, that's not whatnhe was supposed to do with it.,So she wanted to have it read again,,and her doctor fired her.,She pulled up the CD.,He said, "If you don't want to follownmy instructions, go away.",So she pulled up the CDnof the scan images,,and look at all those hot spots.,And she's now actively engaged on her blog,in looking for assistancenin getting better care.,See, that is an empowerednpatient -- no medical training. 
 We are, you are,,the most underusednresource in health care.,What she was able to do,was because she had accessnto the raw data.,How big a deal was this?,Well at TED2009,,Tim Berners-Lee himself,ninventor of the Web,,gave a talk where he saidnthe next big thing,is not to have your browser findnother people's articles about the data,,but the raw data.,And he got them chantingnby the end of the talk,,"Raw data now! Raw data now!",And I ask you,,three words, please,nto improve health care:,Let patients help!,Let patients help!,Let patients help!,Let patients help! 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 For all the patients around the worldnwatching this on the Webcast,,God bless you, everyone.nLet patients help. 
 Host: And bless yourself.nThank you very much.I would like to talk to younabout why many ehealth projects fail.,And I really thinknthat the most important thing of it,is that we stopped listening to patients.,And one thing we did at Radboud University,is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.,Not in a very scientific way --,she puts up a little cupnof coffee or a cup of tea,and asks patients, family, relatives,,"What's up?,How could we help you?",And we think, we like to think,,that this is one of the major problems,why all -- maybe not all --,but most of the ehealth projects fail,,since we stopped listening. 
 This is my weight scale.,It's a very simple thing.nIt's got one knob, on/off.,And every morning I hop on it.,And yes, I've got a challenge,,as you might see.,And I put my challenge on 95 kg.,But the thing is thatnit's made this simple,that whenever I hop on,,it sends my data to Google Health as well.,And it's collectednby my general practitioner as well,,so he can see what's my problem in weight,,not on the very momentnthat I need cardiologic support,or something like it,,but also looking backward.,But there's another thing.,As some of you might know,,I've got more than 4000nfollowers on Twitter.,So every morning, I hop on my weight scale,and before I'm in my car,,people start talking to me,,"I think you needna light lunch today, Lucien." 
 (Laughter) 
 But that's the nicest thingnthat could happen,,since this is peer pressure.,Peer pressure used to help patients --,since this could be used for obesity,,it could be usednto stop patients from smoking.,But on the other hand,,it also could be usednto get people out of their chairs,and try to work togethernin some kind of gaming activity,to get more control of their health. 
 As of next week,nit will soon be available,,there will be this littlenblood-pressure meter,connected to an iPhonenor something or other.,And people will be able, from their homes,,to take their blood pressure,,send it to their doctor,and eventually share itnwith others, for instance,,for over a 100 dollars.,And this is the pointnwhere patients get into position,and can collect,nnot only their own control again,,be captain of their own ship,,but also can help us in health care,due to the challenges that we face,,like health-care cost explosion,,doubled demand and things like that,,make techniques that are easy to use,and start with thisnto embrace patients in the team. 
 And you can do thisnwith techniques like this,,but also by crowdsourcing.,And one of the things we did,,that I would like to share with younintroduced by a little video. 
 (Music) 
 (Heart-beat) 
 We've all gotnnavigation controls in our car.,We maybe even have it in our cellphone.,We perfectly know where all the ATMs are,,just about the city of Maastricht.,The other thing is we knownwhere all the gas stations are.,And sure, we could find fast food chains.,But where would be the nearest AEDnto help this patient?,We asked around, and nobody knew.,Nobody knew wherenthe nearest lifesaving AED,was to be obtained right now. 
 So what we did,nwe crowdsourced the Netherlands.,We set up a website, and asked the crowd,,"If you see an AED, please submit it,,tell us where it is,ntell us when it's open,",since sometimes in office hoursnit's closed, of course.,And over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands,already have been submitted.,The next step we tooknwas to find the applications for it.,And we built an iPad application.,We made an applicationnfor Layar: Augmented Reality,,to find these AEDs.,And whenever you arenin a city like Maastricht,,and somebody collapses,nyou can use your iPhone,,and within the next weeksnalso your Microsoft cellphone,,to find the nearest AED,,which can save lives. 
 And as of today,,we would like to introduce this,nnot only as AED4EU,,which is what the product is called,,but also AED4US.,And we would like to start thisnon a worldwide level.,And ask all of our colleaguesnin the rest of the world,,colleague universities, to help us,to find and work and act like a hub,to crowdsource all these AEDsnall around the world,,that whenever you're on holidaynand somebody collapses,,might it be your own relativenor someone just in front of you,,you can find this. 
 The other thing we would like to ask,is of companies also all over the world,that will be able to help usnvalidate these AEDs.,These might be courier services,or cable guys, for instance,,just to see whethernthe AED that is submitted,is still in place. 
 So please help us on this one,and try to make not onlynhealth a little bit better,,but take control of it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Singing) I see the moon.nThe moon sees me.,The moon sees somebody that I don't see.,God bless the moon, and God bless me.,And God bless the somebodynthat I don't see.,If I get to heaven, before you do,,I'll make a hole and pull you through.,And I'll write your name on every star,,and that way the world,won't seem so far. 
 The astronaut will not be at work today.,He has called in sick.,He has turned off his cell phone,nhis laptop, his pager, his alarm clock.,There is a fat yellow catnasleep on his couch,,raindrops against the window,and not even the hintnof coffee in the kitchen air.,Everybody is in a tizzy.,The engineers on the 15th floor havenstopped working on their particle machine.,The anti-gravity room is leaking,,and even the freckled kid with glasses,,whose only job is to takenout the trash, is nervous,,fumbles the bag, spillsna banana peel and a paper cup.,Nobody notices.,They are too busy recalculatingnwhat this all mean for lost time.,How many galaxiesnare we losing per second?,How long before next rocketncan be launched?,Somewhere an electronnflies off its energy cloud.,A black hole has erupted.,A mother finishes settingnthe table for dinner.,A Law &amp; Order marathon is starting.,The astronaut is asleep.,He has forgotten to turn off his watch,,which ticks, like a metalnpulse against his wrist.,He does not hear it.,He dreams of coral reefs and plankton.,His fingers findnthe pillowcase's sailing masts.,He turns on his side,nopens his eyes at once.,He thinks that scuba divers must haventhe most wonderful job in the world.,So much water to glide through! 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 When I was little, I couldnnot understand the concept,that you could only live one life.,I don't mean this metaphorically.,I mean, I literally thoughtnthat I was going to get to do,everything there was to do,and be everything there was to be.,It was only a matter of time.,And there was no limitationnbased on age or gender,or race or even appropriate time period.,I was sure that I was goingnto actually experience,what it felt like to be a leadernof the civil rights movement,or a ten-year old boy livingnon a farm during the dust bowl,or an emperor of the Tangndynasty in China.,My mom says that when people asked me,what I wanted to be when I grew up,nmy typical response was:,princess-ballerina-astronaut.,And what she doesn't understandnis that I wasn't trying to invent,some combined super profession.,I was listing things I thoughtnI was gonna get to be:,a princess and a ballerinanand an astronaut.,and I'm pretty sure the listnprobably went on from there.,I usually just got cut off.,It was never a questionnof if I was gonna get to do something,so much of a question of when. 
 And I was sure that if I was goingnto do everything,,that it probably meant I hadnto move pretty quickly,,because there was a lotnof stuff I needed to do.,So my life was constantlynin a state of rushing.,I was always scarednthat I was falling behind.,And since I grew upnin New York City, as far as I could tell,,rushing was pretty normal.,But, as I grew up, I hadnthis sinking realization,,that I wasn't gonna get to livenany more than one life.,I only knew what it felt likento be a teenage girl,in New York City,,not a teenage boy in New Zealand,,not a prom queen in Kansas.,I only got to see through my lens.,And it was around this timenthat I became obsessed with stories,,because it was through storiesnthat I was able to see,through someone else's lens,nhowever briefly or imperfectly.,And I started craving hearingnother people's experiences,because I was so jealousnthat there were entire lives,that I was never gonna get to live,,and I wanted to hearnabout everything that I was missing.,And by transitive property,,I realized that some peoplenwere never gonna get to experience,what it felt like to be a teenage girlnin New York city.,Which meant that they weren't gonna know,what the subway ridenafter your first kiss feels like,,or how quiet it gets when its snows.,And I wanted them to know,nI wanted to tell them. 
 And this became the focus of my obsession.,I busied myself telling storiesnand sharing stories and collecting them.,And it's not until recently,that I realized thatnI can't always rush poetry.,In April for National Poetry Month,nthere's this challenge,that many poets in the poetryncommunity participate in,,and its called the 30/30 Challenge.,The idea is you write a new poem,every single daynfor the entire month of April.,And last year, I tried itnfor the first time,and was thrilled by the efficiencynat which I was able to produce poetry.,But at the end of the month, I lookednback at these 30 poems I had written,and discovered that they werenall trying to tell the same story,,it had just taken me 30 tries to figurenout the way that it wanted to be told.,And I realized that this is probably truenof other stories on an even larger scale.,I have stories that I haventried to tell for years,,rewriting and rewriting and constantlynsearching for the right words. 
 There's a French poet and essayistnby the name of Paul Valéry,who said a poem is nevernfinished, it is only abandoned.,And this terrifies me,because it implies that I could keepnre-editing and rewriting forever,and its up to me to decidenwhen a poem is finished,and when I can walk away from it.,And this goes directly againstnmy very obsessive nature,to try to find the right answernand the perfect words and the right form.,And I use poetry in my life,,as a way to help me navigatenand work through things.,But just because I end the poem,ndoesn't mean that I've solved,what it was I was puzzling through.,I like to revisit old poetry,because it shows me exactlynwhere I was at that moment,and what it was I was trying to navigate,and the words that I chose to help me. 
 Now, I have a story,that I've been stumblingnover for years and years,and I'm not sure if I've foundnthe prefect form,,or whether this is just one attempt,and I will try to rewrite it laternin search of a better way to tell it.,But I do know that later, when I look back,I will be able to know thatnthis is where I was at this moment,and this is what I was trying to navigate,,with these words, here,nin this room, with you. 
 So --,Smile. 
 It didn't always work this way.,There's a time you hadnto get your hands dirty.,When you were in the dark,nfor most of it, fumbling was a given.,If you needed morencontrast, more saturation,,darker darks and brighter brights,,they called it extended development.,It meant you spent longer inhalingnchemicals, longer up to your wrist.,It wasn't always easy.,Grandpa Stewart was a Navy photographer.,Young, red-facednwith his sleeves rolled up,,fists of fingers like fat rolls of coins,,he looked like Popeyenthe sailor man come to life.,Crooked smile, tuft of chest hair,,he showed up to World War II,nwith a smirk and a hobby.,When they asked him if he knewnmuch about photography,,he lied, learned to readnEurope like a map,,upside down, from the heightnof a fighter plane,,camera snapping, eyelids flapping,the darkest darks and brightest brights.,He learned war like he couldnread his way home. 
 When other men returned,nthey would put their weapons out to rest,,but he brought the lensesnand the cameras home with him.,Opened a shop, turned itninto a family affair.,My father was born into thisnworld of black and white.,His basketball hands learnednthe tiny clicks and slides,of lens into frame, film into camera,,chemical into plastic bin.,His father knew the equipmentnbut not the art.,He knew the darks but not the brights.,My father learned the magic,nspent his time following light.,Once he traveled across the countrynto follow a forest fire,,hunted it with his camera for a week.,"Follow the light," he said.,"Follow the light." 
 There are parts of menI only recognize from photographs.,The loft on Wooster Streetnwith the creaky hallways,,the twelve-foot ceilings,nwhite walls and cold floors.,This was my mother's home,nbefore she was mother.,Before she was wife, she was artist.,And the only two rooms in the house,,with walls that reachednall the way up to the ceiling,,and doors that opened and closed,,were the bathroom and the darkroom.,The darkroom she built herself,,with custom-made stainless steel sinks,nan 8x10 bed enlarger,that moved up and downnby a giant hand crank,,a bank of color-balanced lights,,a white glass wall for viewing prints,,a drying rack that movednin and out from the wall.,My mother built herself a darkroom.,Made it her home.,Fell in love with a mannwith basketball hands,,with the way he looked at light. 
 They got married. Had a baby.,Moved to a house near a park.,But they kept the loft on Wooster Street,for birthday parties and treasure hunts.,The baby tipped the grayscale,,filled her parents' photo albumsnwith red balloons and yellow icing.,The baby grew into a girlnwithout freckles,,with a crooked smile,,who didn’t understand why her friendsndid not have darkrooms in their houses,,who never saw her parents kiss,,who never saw them hold hands. 
 But one day, another baby showed up.,This one with perfect straightnhair and bubble gum cheeks.,They named him sweet potato.,When he laughed, he laughed so loudly,he scared the pigeons on the fire escape,And the four of them livednin that house near the park.,The girl with no freckles,nthe sweet potato boy,,the basketball father and darkroom mother,and they lit their candlesnand said their prayers,,and the corners of the photographs curled. 
 One day, some towers fell.,And the house near the parknbecame a house under ash, so they escaped,in backpacks, on bicycles to darkrooms,But the loft of Wooster Streetnwas built for an artist,,not a family of pigeons,,and walls that do not reach the ceilingndo not hold in the yelling,and the man with basketball handsnput his weapons out to rest.,He could not fight this war,nand no maps pointed home.,His hands no longer fit his camera,,no longer fit his wife's,,no longer fit his body.,The sweet potato boy mashednhis fists into his mouth,until he had nothing more to say. 
 So, the girl without frecklesnwent treasure hunting on her own.,And on Wooster Street, in a buildingnwith the creaky hallways,and the loft with the 12-foot ceilings,and the darkroom with too many sinks,under the color-balanced lights,nshe found a note,,tacked to the wall with a thumb-tack,nleft over from a time before towers,,from the time before babies.,And the note said: "A guy sure lovesnthe girl who works in the darkroom.",It was a year before my fathernpicked up a camera again.,His first time out, he followednthe Christmas lights,,dotting their way throughnNew York City's trees,,tiny dots of light, blinking out at himnfrom out of the darkest darks. 
 A year later he travelednacross the country to follow a forest fire,stayed for a week huntingnit with his camera,,it was ravaging the West Coast,eating 18-wheeler trucks in its stride.,On the other side of the country,,I went to class and wrote a poemnin the margins of my notebook.,We have both learned the art of capture.,Maybe we are learningnthe art of embracing.,Maybe we are learningnthe art of letting go. 
 (Applause)I started Improv Everywherenabout 10 years ago,when I moved to New York Citynwith an interest in acting and comedy.,Because I was new to the city,nI didn't have access to a stage,,so I decided to createnmy own in public places. 
 So the first projectnwe're going to take a look at,is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.,Now, this took place in January of 2002.,And this woman is the star of the video.,She doesn't know she's being filmed.,She's being filmed with a hidden camera.,This is on the 6 train in New York City.,And this is the first stop along the line.,These are two Danish guys,who come in and sit downnnext to the hidden camera.,And that's me right there in a brown coat.,It's about 30 degrees outside.,I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.,And the girl's goingnto notice me right here. 
 (Laughter) 
 And as you'll see now,nI'm not wearing pants. 
 (Laughter) 
 At this point --,at this point she's noticed me,,but in New York there's weirdosnon any given train car.,One person's not that unusual.,She goes back to reading her book,nwhich is unfortunately titled "Rape." 
 (Laughter) 
 So she's noticed the unusual thing,nbut she's gone back to her normal life. 
 Now, in the meantime, I have six friends,who are waitingnat the next six consecutive stops,in their underwear as well.,They're going to be enteringnthis car one by one.,We'll act as thoughnwe don't know each other.,And we'll act as if it's justnan unfortunate mistake we've made,,forgetting our pantsnon this cold January day. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter continues) 
 So at this point,,she decides to put the rape book away. 
 (Laughter) 
 And she decides to be a little bitnmore aware of her surroundings.,In the meantime, the two Danish guysnto the left of the camera,,they're cracking up.,They think this is the funniest thingnthey've ever seen before.,And watch her make eye contactnwith them right about now. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I love that moment in this video,,because before it becamena shared experience,,it was somethingnthat was maybe a little bit scary,,or something that wasnat least confusing to her.,And then, once it becamena shared experience,,it was funny and somethingnthat she could laugh at. 
 So the train is now pullingninto the third stop along the 6 line. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the video won't show everything.,This goes on for another four stops.,A total of seven guysnenter anonymously in their underwear.,At the eighth stop,na girl came in with a giant duffel bag,and announced she hadnpants for sale for a dollar --,like you might sell batteriesnor candy on the train.,We all very matter-of-factlynbought a pair of pants, put them on,and said, "Thank you.nThat's exactly what I needed today,",and then exited withoutnrevealing what had happened,and went in all different directions. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So that's a still from the video there.,And I love that girl's reaction so much.,And watching that videotape later that day,inspired me to keep doing what I do.,And really one of the pointsnof Improv Everywhere,is to cause a scene in a public place,that is a positive experiencenfor other people.,It's a prank, but it's a pranknthat gives somebody a great story to tell.,And her reaction inspired me,to do a second annualnNo Pants Subway Ride.,And we've continued to do it every year.,This January, we didnthe 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride,where a diverse group of 3,500 people,rode the train in theirnunderwear in New York --,almost every singlentrain line in the city.,And also in 50 other citiesnaround the world,,people participated. 
 (Laughter) 
 As I started taking improv classnat the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater,and meeting other creative peoplenand other performers and comedians,,I started amassingna mailing list of people,who wanted to do these types of projects.,So I could do more large-scale projects.,Well, one day I was walkingnthrough Union Square,,and I saw this building,nwhich had just been built in 2005.,There was a girl in one of the windowsnand she was dancing.,It was very peculiar,nbecause it was dark out,,but she was backlitnwith florescent lighting.,She was very much onstage,and I couldn't figure outnwhy she was doing it.,After about 15 seconds,nher friend appeared --,she had been hiding behind a display.,They laughed, huggedneach other and ran away.,Maybe she had been dared to do this.,So I got inspired by that.,Looking at the entire facade --nthere were 70 total windows --,and I knew what I had to do. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this project is called Look Up More.,We had 70 actors dress in black.,This was completely unauthorized.,We didn't let the stores knownwe were coming.,And I stood in the park giving signals.,The first signal was for everybodynto hold up these four-foot tall letters,that spelled out "Look Up More,",the name of the project.,The second signal was for everybodynto do jumping jacks together.,You'll see that start right here. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then we had dancing.nWe had everyone dance.,And then we had dance solos,where only one person would dancenand everybody would point to them. 
 (Laughter) 
 So then I gave a new hand signal,,which signaled the next soloistndown below in Forever 21,,and he danced.,There were several other activities.,We had people jumping up and down,npeople dropping to the ground.,And I was standingnjust anonymously in a sweatshirt,,putting my hand on and off of a trashcannto signal the advancement.,And because it was in Union Square Park,nright by a subway station,,there were hundreds of people by the endnwho stopped and looked up,and watched what we were doing.,There's a better photo of it. 
 So that particular eventnwas inspired by a moment,that I happened to stumble upon.,The next project I want to show,was given to menin an email from a stranger.,A high school kid in Texasnwrote me in 2006,and said, "You should getnas many people as possible,to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants,and go into a Best Buy and stand around." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So I wrote this high school kidnback immediately,and I said, "Yes, you are correct.,I think I'll try to do thatnthis weekend. Thank you.",So here's the video. 
 So again, this is 2005.,This is the Best Buy in New York City.,We had about 80 peoplenshow up to participate,,entering one by one.,There was an eight-year-old girl,na 10-year-old girl.,There was also a 65-year-old mannwho participated.,So a very diverse group of people. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I told people,n"Don't work. Don't actually do work.,But also, don't shop.,Just stand aroundnand don't face products.",Now you can see the regular employees,by the ones that haventhe yellow tags on their shirt.,Everybody else is one of our actors. 
 (Laughter) 
 The lower-level employeesnthought it was very funny.,Several of them wentnto go get their camera from the break room,and took photos with us.,A lot of them made jokesnabout trying to get us to go to the back,to get heavy television setsnfor customers.,The managers and the security guards,non the other hand,,did not find it particularly funny.,You can see them in this footage.,They're wearing eitherna yellow shirt or a black shirt.,And we were there probably 10 minutes,before the managers decided to dial 911. 
 (Laughter) 
 So they started running around,telling everybody the cops were coming,n"Watch out, the cops are coming.",And you can see the copsnin this footage right here.,That's a cop wearing black right there,nbeing filmed with a hidden camera.,Ultimately, the policenhad to inform Best Buy management,that it was not, in fact, illegalnto wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So we had been there for 20 minutes;nwe were happy to exit the store.,One thing the managers were trying to donwas to track down our cameras.,And they caught a couple of my guysnwho had hidden cameras in duffel bags.,But the one camera guy they never caught,was the guy that went innjust with a blank tape,and went over to the Best Buyncamera department,and just put his tapenin one of their cameras,and pretended to shop.,So I like that concept of usingntheir own technology against them. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think our best projectsnare ones that are site-specific,and happen at a particularnplace for a reason.,And one morning, I was riding the subway.,I had to make a transfernat the 53rd St. stop,where there arenthese two giant escalators.,And it's a very depressing placento be in the morning, it's very crowded.,So I decided to try and stage something,that could make it as happynas possible for one morning.,So this was in the winter of 2009 --n8:30 in the morning.,It's morning rush hour.,It's very cold outside.,People are coming in from Queens,,transferring from the E trainnto the 6 train.,And they're going upnthese giant escalators,on their way to their jobs. 
 [Rob wants],[to give you] 
 (Laughter) 
 [a high five!] 
 (Laughter) 
 [Get ready!] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,So there's a photographnthat illustrates it a little bit better.,He gave 2,000 high fives that day,,and he washed his handsnbefore and afterward,and did not get sick.,And that was done also without permission,,although no one seemed to care. 
 So I'd say over the years,,one of the most common criticismsnI see of Improv Everywhere,left anonymously on YouTube comments,is: "These peoplenhave too much time on their hands.",And you know, not everybody'sngoing to like everything you do,,and I've certainly developed a thick skinnthanks to Internet comments,,but that one's always bothered me,,because we don't haventoo much time on our hands.,The participantsnin Improv Everywhere events,have just as much leisure timenas any other New Yorkers,,they just occasionally choosento spend it in an unusual way. 
 You know, every Saturday and Sunday,,hundreds of thousands of people each fall,gather in football stadiumsnto watch games.,And I've never seen anybody comment,nlooking at a football game,,"All those people in the stands,nthey have too much time on their hands.",And of course they don't.,It's a perfectly wonderful waynto spent a weekend afternoon,,watching a football game in a stadium.,But I think it's alsona perfectly valid way,to spend an afternoonnfreezing in place with 200 people,in the Grand Central terminal,or dressing up like a ghostbuster,and running throughnthe New York Public Library. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or listening to the same MP3nas 3,000 other people,and dancing silently in a park,,or bursting into song in a grocery store,as part of a spontaneous musical,,or diving into the ocean in Coney Islandnwearing formal attire. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, as kids, we're taught to play.,And we're never given a reasonnwhy we should play.,It's just acceptablenthat play is a good thing.,And I think that's sort ofnthe point of Improv Everywhere.,It's that there is no pointnand that there doesn't have to be a point.,We don't need a reason.nAs long as it's fun,and it seems likenit's going to be a funny idea,and it seems like the peoplenwho witness it,will also have a fun time,,then that's enough for us.,And I think, as adults, we need to learn,that there's no rightnor wrong way to play. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)When I was seven years oldnand my sister was just five years old,,we were playing on top of a bunk bed.,I was two years oldernthan my sister at the time --,I mean, I'm two yearsnolder than her now --,but at the time it meant she had to doneverything that I wanted to do,,and I wanted to play war.,So we were up on top of our bunk beds.,And on one side of the bunk bed,,I had put out all of my G.I. Joensoldiers and weaponry.,And on the other side werenall my sister's My Little Ponies,ready for a cavalry charge. 
 There are differing accountsnof what actually happened that afternoon,,but since my sister is notnhere with us today,,let me tell you the true story -- 
 (Laughter) 
 which is my sister's a littlenon the clumsy side.,Somehow, without any help or pushnfrom her older brother at all,,Amy disappearednoff of the top of the bunk bed,and landed with this crash on the floor.,I nervously peerednover the side of the bed,to see what had befallen my fallen sister,and saw that she had landednpainfully on her hands and knees,on all fours on the ground. 
 I was nervous becausenmy parents had charged me,with making sure that my sister and I,played as safelynand as quietly as possible.,And seeing as how I hadnaccidentally broken Amy's arm,just one week before -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter ends) 
 heroically pushing her out of the waynof an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet, 
 (Laughter),for which I have yet to be thanked,nI was trying as hard as I could --,she didn't even see it coming --,I was trying hardnto be on my best behavior. 
 And I saw my sister's face,,this wail of painnand suffering and surprise,threatening to erupt from her mouthnand wake my parents,from the long winter's napnfor which they had settled.,So I did the only thing,my frantic seven year-old brainncould think to do to avert this tragedy.,And if you have children,nyou've seen this hundreds of times.,I said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry.nDid you see how you landed?,No human lands on all fours like that.,Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, that was cheating,,because there was nothingnshe would want more,than not to be Amynthe hurt five year-old little sister,,but Amy the special unicorn.,Of course, this optionnwas open to her brain,at no point in the past.,And you could see how my poor,nmanipulated sister faced conflict,,as her little brain attemptednto devote resources,to feeling the pain and sufferingnand surprise she just experienced,,or contemplating her new-foundnidentity as a unicorn.,And the latter won.,Instead of crying or ceasing our play,,instead of waking my parents,,with all the negative consequences for me,,a smile spread across her face,and she scrambled back upnonto the bunk bed,with all the grace of a baby unicorn -- 
 (Laughter) 
 with one broken leg. 
 What we stumbled across,at this tender agenof just five and seven --,we had no idea at the time --,was was going be at the vanguardnof a scientific revolution,occurring two decades later in the waynthat we look at the human brain.,We had stumbled acrossnsomething called positive psychology,,which is the reason I'm here today,and the reason that I wake upnevery morning. 
 When I started talking about this research,outside of academia,nwith companies and schools,,the first thing they said to never donis to start with a graph.,The first thing I want to donis start with a graph.,This graph looks boring,,but it is the reason I get excitednand wake up every morning.,And this graph doesn't even meannanything; it's fake data.,What we found is -- 
 (Laughter) 
 If I got this data studying you,nI would be thrilled,,because there's a trend there,,and that means that I can get published,,which is all that really matters.,There is one weird red dotnabove the curve,,there's one weirdo in the room --,I know who you are, I saw you earlier --,that's no problem.,That's no problem, as most of you know,nbecause I can just delete that dot.,I can delete that dot becausenthat's clearly a measurement error.,And we know that's a measurement errornbecause it's messing up my data. 
 (Laughter) 
 So one of the first things we teach people,in economics, statistics,nbusiness and psychology courses,is how, in a statistically valid way,ndo we eliminate the weirdos.,How do we eliminate the outliersnso we can find the line of best fit?,Which is fantasticnif I'm trying to find out,how many Advil the averagenperson should be taking -- two. 
 But if I'm interested in your potential,,or for happiness or productivitynor energy or creativity,,we're creating the cultnof the average with science.,If I asked a question like,,"How fast can a child learnnhow to read in a classroom?",scientists change the answer to,"How fast does the average childnlearn how to read in that classroom?",and we tailor the classntowards the average.,If you fall below the average,,then psychologists get thrilled,,because that means you'rendepressed or have a disorder,,or hopefully both.,We're hoping for bothnbecause our business model is,,if you come into a therapynsession with one problem,,we want to make sure younleave knowing you have ten,,so you keep coming back.,We'll go back into yournchildhood if necessary,,but eventually we wantnto make you normal again.,But normal is merely average. 
 And positive psychology positsnthat if we study what is merely average,,we will remain merely average.,Then instead of deletingnthose positive outliers,,what I intentionally do is comeninto a population like this one,and say, why?,Why are some of you high above the curve,in terms of intellectual,nathletic, musical ability,,creativity, energy levels,,resiliency in the facenof challenge, sense of humor?,Whatever it is, instead of deletingnyou, what I want to do is study you.,Because maybe we can glean information,,not just how to movenpeople up to the average,,but move the entire average upnin our companies and schools worldwide. 
 The reason this graph is important to me,is, on the news, the majoritynof the information is not positive.,in fact it's negative.,Most of it's about murder, corruption,ndiseases, natural disasters.,And very quickly, my brain starts to think,that's the accurate rationof negative to positive in the world.,This createsn"the medical school syndrome.",During the first year of medical training,,as you read through a list of allnthe symptoms and diseases,,suddenly you realize you have all of them. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have a brother in-law named Bobo,nwhich is a whole other story.,Bobo married Amy the unicorn.,Bobo called me on the phone -- 
 (Laughter) 
 from Yale Medical School,,and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy." 
 (Laughter) 
 Which, even at Yale,nis extraordinarily rare.,But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo,because he had just gottennover an entire week of menopause. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're finding it's not necessarilynthe reality that shapes us,,but the lens through which your brainnviews the world that shapes your reality.,And if we can change the lens,nnot only can we change your happiness,,we can change every single educationalnand business outcome at the same time. 
 I applied to Harvard on a dare.,I didn't expect to get in, and my familynhad no money for college.,When I got a military scholarshipntwo weeks later, they let me go.,Something that wasn'tneven a possibility became a reality.,I assumed everyone therenwould see it as a privilege as well,,that they'd be excited to be there.,Even in a classroomnfull of people smarter than you,,I felt you'd be happy just to benin that classroom.,But what I found is,nwhile some people experience that,,when I graduated after my four years,and then spent the next eight yearsnliving in the dorms with the students --,Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was an officer to counsel studentsnthrough the difficult four years.,And in my research and my teaching,,I found that these students,nno matter how happy they were,with their original successnof getting into the school,,two weeks later their brains were focused,nnot on the privilege of being there,,nor on their philosophy or physics,,but on the competition, the workload,,the hassles, stresses, complaints. 
 When I first went in there, I walkedninto the freshmen dining hall,,which is where my friends from Waco,nTexas, which is where I grew up --,I know some of you know this.,When they'd visit, they'd look around,,and say, "This dining hall looks likensomething out of Hogwart's.",It does, because that was Hogwart'snand that's Harvard.,And when they see this,,they say, "Why do you waste your timenstudying happiness at Harvard?,What does a Harvard studentnpossibly have to be unhappy about?" 
 Embedded within that question,is the key to understandingnthe science of happiness.,Because what that question assumes,is that our external worldnis predictive of our happiness levels,,when in reality, if I know everythingnabout your external world,,I can only predict 10\%nof your long-term happiness.,90 percent of your long-term happinessnis predicted not by the external world,,but by the way your brainnprocesses the world.,And if we change it,,if we change our formulanfor happiness and success,,we can change the waynthat we can then affect reality.,What we found is that only 25\%nof job successes are predicted by IQ,,75 percent of job successes,are predicted by your optimismnlevels, your social support,and your ability to see stressnas a challenge instead of as a threat. 
 I talked to a New England boarding school,nprobably the most prestigious one,,and they said, "We already know that.,So every year, instead of just teachingnour students, we have a wellness week.,And we're so excited. Monday nightnwe have the world's leading expert,will speak about adolescent depression.,Tuesday nightnit's school violence and bullying.,Wednesday night is eating disorders.,Thursday night is illicit drug use.,And Friday night we're trying to decidenbetween risky sex or happiness." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "That's most people'snFriday nights." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Which I'm glad you liked,nbut they did not like that at all.,Silence on the phone.,And into the silence, I said,n"I'd be happy to speak at your school,,but that's not a wellness week,nthat's a sickness week.,You've outlined all the negativenthings that can happen,,but not talked about the positive." 
 The absence of disease is not health.,Here's how we get to health:,We need to reverse the formulanfor happiness and success.,In the last three years,nI've traveled to 45 countries,,working with schools and companiesnin the midst of an economic downturn.,And I found thatnmost companies and schools,follow a formulanfor success, which is this:,If I work harder, I'll be more successful.,And if I'm more successful,nthen I'll be happier.,That undergirds mostnof our parenting and managing styles,,the way that we motivate our behavior. 
 And the problem is it's scientificallynbroken and backwards for two reasons.,Every time your brain has a success,,you just changed the goalpostnof what success looked like.,You got good grades,nnow you have to get better grades,,you got into a good schoolnand after you get into a better one,,you got a good job,nnow you have to get a better job,,you hit your sales target,nwe're going to change it.,And if happiness is on the opposite sidenof success, your brain never gets there.,We've pushed happinessnover the cognitive horizon, as a society.,And that's because we thinknwe have to be successful,,then we'll be happier. 
 But our brains work in the opposite order.,If you can raise somebody's levelnof positivity in the present,,then their brain experiences what we nowncall a happiness advantage,,which is your brain at positivenperforms significantly better,than at negative, neutral or stressed.,Your intelligence rises, your creativitynrises, your energy levels rise.,In fact, we've found that every singlenbusiness outcome improves.,Your brain at positivenis 31\% more productive,than your brain at negative,nneutral or stressed.,You're 37\% better at sales.,Doctors are 19 percentnfaster, more accurate,at coming up with the correct diagnosis,when positive insteadnof negative, neutral or stressed. 
 Which means we can reverse the formula.,If we can find a way of becomingnpositive in the present,,then our brains workneven more successfully,as we're able to work harder,nfaster and more intelligently.,We need to be able to reverse this formula,so we can start to see what our brainsnare actually capable of.,Because dopamine, which floodsninto your system when you're positive,,has two functions.,Not only does it make you happier,,it turns on all of the learningncenters in your brain,allowing you to adaptnto the world in a different way. 
 We've found there are waysnthat you can train your brain,to be able to become more positive.,In just a two-minute span of timendone for 21 days in a row,,we can actually rewire your brain,,allowing your brain to actually worknmore optimistically and more successfully.,We've done these things in research now,in every company that I've worked with,,getting them to write down three newnthings that they're grateful for,for 21 days in a row,nthree new things each day.,And at the end of that,,their brain starts to retain a pattern,of scanning the world not fornthe negative, but for the positive first. 
 Journaling about one positive experiencenyou've had over the past 24 hours,allows your brain to relive it.,Exercise teaches your brainnthat your behavior matters.,We find that meditation allows your brain,to get over the cultural ADHDnthat we've been creating,by trying to do multiple tasks at once,and allows our brainsnto focus on the task at hand.,And finally, random acts of kindnessnare conscious acts of kindness.,We get people,nwhen they open up their inbox,,to write one positive email,praising or thanking somebodynin their support network. 
 And by doing these activities,and by training your brainnjust like we train our bodies,,what we've found is we can reversenthe formula for happiness and success,,and in doing so, not only createnripples of positivity,,but a real revolution. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm actually going to sharensomething with you,I haven't talked aboutnprobably in more than 10 years.,So bear with me as I take younthrough this journey.,When I was 22 years old,,I came home from work,nput a leash on my dog,and went for my usual run.,I had no idea that at that moment,,my life was going to change forever.,While I was preparing my dog for the run,,a man was finishing drinking at a bar,,picked up his car keys, got into a car,and headed south,,or wherever he was.,I was running across the street,,and the only thingnthat I actually remember,is feeling like a grenadenwent off in my head.,And I remembernputting my hands on the ground,and feeling my life's blood,emptying out of my neck and my mouth. 
 What had happened is, he ran a red light,and hit me and my dog.,She ended up underneath the car.,I flew out in front of the car,,and then he ran over my legs.,My left leg got caught upnin the wheel well --,spun it around.,The bumper of the car hit my throat,,slicing it open.,I ended up with blunt chest trauma.,Your aorta comes up behind your heart,nit's your major artery --,and it was severed, so my bloodnwas gurgling out of my mouth.,It foamed, and ... horrible thingsnwere happening to me.,I had no idea what was going on,,but strangers intervened,,kept my heart moving, beating.,I say "moving," because it was quivering,,and they were trying to putna beat back into it. 
 Somebody was smartnand put a Bic pen in my neck,to open up my airway,nso I could get some air in there.,And my lung collapsed,,so somebody cut me opennand put a pen in there as well,,to stop that catastrophicnevent from happening.,Somehow I ended up at the hospital.,I was wrapped in ice,,and then eventually putninto a drug-induced coma. 
 Eighteen months later, I woke up.,I was blind, I couldn't speak,and I couldn't walk.,I was 64 pounds.,The hospital really has no ideanwhat to do with people like that.,And in fact, they startednto call me a "gomer.",That's another storynwe won't even get into.,I had so many surgeriesnto put my neck back together,,to repair my heart a few times. 
 Some things worked, some things didn't.,I had lots of titanium put in me;,cadaver bones,,to try to get my feetnmoving the right way.,And I ended up with a plastic nose,,porcelain teethnand all kinds of other things.,But eventually,nI started to look human again.,But ...,It's hard sometimesnto talk about these things,,so bear with me.,I had more than 50 surgeries.,But who's counting? 
 (Laughter) 
 So eventually, the hospital decidednit was time for me to go.,They needed to open upnspace for somebody else,that they thought could come back,from whatever they were going through.,Everybody lost faith in menbeing able to recover.,So they basically put a mapnup on the wall, threw a dart,,and it landed at a senior home,nhere in Colorado.,And I know all of younare scratching your head:,"A senior citizens' home?,What in the worldnare you going to do there?",But if you think aboutnall of the skills and talent,that are in this room right now,,that's what a senior home has.,So there were all these skills and talents,that these seniors had.,The one advantagenthey had over most of you,is wisdom,,because they had a long life.,And I needed that wisdomnat that moment in my life. 
 But imagine what it was like for them,when I showed up at their doorstep.,At that point, I had gainednfour pounds, so I was 68 pounds.,I was bald.,I was wearing hospital scrubs.,And somebody donated tennis shoes for me.,And I had a white cane in one hand,and a suitcase full of medicalnrecords in another hand.,So the senior citizens realized,that they needed to havenan emergency meeting. 
 (Laughter) 
 So they pulled backnand they were looking at each other,,and they were going, "OK,nwhat skills do we have in this room?,This kid needs a lot of work." 
 So they eventually startednmatching their talents and skills,to all of my needs.,But one of the first thingsnthey needed to do,was assess what I needed right away.,I needed to figure out how to eatnlike a normal human being,,since I'd been eatingnthrough a tube in my chest,and through my veins.,So I had to gonthrough trying to eat again.,And they went through that process.,And then they had to figure out:,"Well, she needs furniture.,She is sleeping in the cornernof this apartment.",So they went to their storage lockers,and all gathered their extra furniture --,gave me pots and pans, blankets --,everything. 
 And then the next thing that I needed,was a makeover. 
 (Laughter) 
 So out went the green scrubs,,and in came the polyesternand floral prints. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're not going to talknabout the hairstyles,they tried to force on menonce my hair grew back.,But I did say no to the blue hair. 
 (Laughter) 
 So eventually, what went on is,,they decided that, well,nI need to learn to speak.,You can't be an independent person,if you're not able to speaknand you can't see.,So they figured not being ablento see is one thing,,but they need to get me to talk.,So while Sally, the office manager,,was teaching me to speak in the day --,it's hard, because when you're a kid,nyou take things for granted.,You learn things unconsciously.,But for me, I was an adultnand it was embarrassing,,and I had to learn how to coordinatenmy new throat with my tongue,and my new teeth and my lips,,and capture the air and get the word out.,So, I acted like a two-year-old,,and refused to work. 
 But the men had a better idea.,They were going to make it fun for me.,So they were teaching mencuss-word Scrabble at night. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then, secretly,nhow to swear like a sailor. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm going to just leave itnto your imagination,as to what my first words were -- 
 (Laughter) 
 when Sally finally gotnmy confidence built. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I moved on from there.,And a former teachernwho happened to have Alzheimer's,took on the task of teaching me to write.,The redundancy was actually good for me.,So, we'll just keep moving on. 
 (Laughter) 
 One of the pivotal times for me,was actually learningnto cross the street again,as a blind person.,So close your eyes.,Now imagine you have to cross a street.,You don't know how far that street is,,and you don't knownif you're going straight.,And you hear cars whizzing back and forth,,and you had a horrible accident,that landed you in this situation.,So there were two obstaclesnI had to get through.,One was post-traumatic stress disorder.,Every time I approachednthe corner or the curb,,I would panic.,And the second one,was actually trying to figure outnhow to cross that street. 
 So one of the seniors just came up to me,,and she pushed menup to the corner and said,,"When you think it's time to go,njust stick the cane out there.,If it's hit, don't cross the street." 
 (Laughter) 
 Made perfect sense. 
 (Laughter) 
 But by the third canenthat went whizzing across the road -- 
 (Laughter) 
 they realized that they needednto put their resources together,,and they raised funds,so that I could gonto the Braille Institute,and actually gain the skillsnto be a blind person,,and also to go get a guide dog,,who transformed my life.,And I was able to return to college,because of the senior citizensnwho invested in me,,and also the guide dognand skill set I had gained. 
 Ten years later, I gained my sight back.,Not magically --,I opted in for three surgeries,,and one of them was experimental.,It was actually robotic surgery,that removed a hematomanfrom behind my eye. 
 The biggest change for menwas that the world moved forward,,that there were innovationsnand all kinds of new things --,cellphones, laptops,,all these thingsnthat I had never seen before.,And as a blind person,,your visual memory fades,,and is replaced with how younfeel about things,and how things sound,and how things smell. 
 So one day, I was in my room,and I saw this thing sitting in my room.,I thought it was a monster,,so I was walking around it.,And I go, "I'm just going to touch it.",And I touched it and I went,,"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket." 
 (Laughter) 
 Everything is differentnwhen you're a sighted person,,because you take that for granted.,But when you're blind,nyou have the tactile memory for things. 
 The biggest change for menwas looking down at my hands,and seeing that I'd lostn10 years of my life.,I thought that timenhad stood still for some reason,and moved on for family and friends.,But when I looked down,,I realized that timenmarched on for me, too,,and that I needed to get caught up.,So I got going on it. 
 We didn't have words like "crowdsourcing"nand "radical collaboration",when I had my accident.,But the concept held true --,people working with people to rebuild me;,people working with peoplento reeducate me.,I wouldn't be standing here today,if it wasn't for extremenradical collaboration. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)Power.,That is the word that comes to mind.,We're the new technologists.,We have a lot of data, so we have a lot of power.,How much power do we have?,Scene from a movie: "Apocalypse Now" -- great movie.,We've got to get our hero, Captain Willard, to the mouth of the Nung River,so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz.,The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off.,So the scene:,the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in.,And there's this loud, thrilling music in the background,,this wild music.,♫ Dum da ta da dum ♫,♫ Dum da ta da dum ♫,♫ Da ta da da ♫,That's a lot of power.,That's the kind of power I feel in this room.,That's the kind of power we have,because of all of the data that we have. 
 Let's take an example.,What can we do,with just one person's data?,What can we do,with that guy's data?,I can look at your financial records.,I can tell if you pay your bills on time.,I know if you're good to give a loan to.,I can look at your medical records; I can see if your pump is still pumping --,see if you're good to offer insurance to.,I can look at your clicking patterns.,When you come to my website, I actually know what you're going to do already,because I've seen you visit millions of websites before.,And I'm sorry to tell you,,you're like a poker player, you have a tell.,I can tell with data analysis what you're going to do,before you even do it.,I know what you like. I know who you are,,and that's even before I look at your mail,or your phone. 
 Those are the kinds of things we can do,with the data that we have.,But I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do.,I'm here to talk about what we should do.,What's the right thing to do? 
 Now I see some puzzled looks,like, "Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do?,We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it.",Fair enough.,But it brings me back.,I think about World War II --,some of our great technologists then,,some of our great physicists,,studying nuclear fission and fusion --,just nuclear stuff.,We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos,to see what they'll build.,We want the people building the technology,thinking about what we should be doing with the technology. 
 So what should we be doing with that guy's data?,Should we be collecting it, gathering it,,so we can make his online experience better?,So we can make money?,So we can protect ourselves,if he was up to no good?,Or should we respect his privacy,,protect his dignity and leave him alone?,Which one is it?,How should we figure it out? 
 I know: crowdsource. Let's crowdsource this.,So to get people warmed up,,let's start with an easy question --,something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about:,iPhone versus Android.,Let's do a show of hands -- iPhone.,Uh huh.,Android.,You'd think with a bunch of smart people,we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones.,(Laughter),Next question,,a little bit harder.,Should we be collecting all of that guy's data,to make his experiences better,and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good?,Or should we leave him alone?,Collect his data.,Leave him alone.,You're safe. It's fine.,(Laughter),Okay, last question --,harder question --,when trying to evaluate,what we should do in this case,,should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework,,or should we use a Millian consequentialist one?,Kant.,Mill.,Not as many votes.,(Laughter),Yeah, that's a terrifying result.,Terrifying, because we have stronger opinions,about our hand-held devices,than about the moral framework,we should use to guide our decisions. 
 How do we know what to do with all the power we have,if we don't have a moral framework?,We know more about mobile operating systems,,but what we really need is a moral operating system.,What's a moral operating system?,We all know right and wrong, right?,You feel good when you do something right,,you feel bad when you do something wrong.,Our parents teach us that: praise with the good, scold with the bad.,But how do we figure out what's right and wrong?,And from day to day, we have the techniques that we use.,Maybe we just follow our gut.,Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource.,Or maybe we punt --,ask the legal department, see what they say.,In other words, it's kind of random,,kind of ad hoc,,how we figure out what we should do.,And maybe, if we want to be on surer footing,,what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there,,that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place,,and how would we know in a given situation what to do. 
 So let's get a moral framework.,We're numbers people, living by numbers.,How can we use numbers,as the basis for a moral framework?,I know a guy who did exactly that.,A brilliant guy --,he's been dead 2,500 years.,Plato, that's right.,Remember him -- old philosopher?,You were sleeping during that class.,And Plato, he had a lot of the same concerns that we did.,He was worried about right and wrong.,He wanted to know what is just.,But he was worried that all we seem to be doing,is trading opinions about this.,He says something's just. She says something else is just.,It's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too.,I'm just going back and forth; I'm not getting anywhere.,I don't want opinions; I want knowledge.,I want to know the truth about justice --,like we have truths in math.,In math, we know the objective facts.,Take a number, any number -- two.,Favorite number. I love that number.,There are truths about two.,If you've got two of something,,you add two more, you get four.,That's true no matter what thing you're talking about.,It's an objective truth about the form of two,,the abstract form.,When you have two of anything -- two eyes, two ears, two noses,,just two protrusions --,those all partake of the form of two.,They all participate in the truths that two has.,They all have two-ness in them.,And therefore, it's not a matter of opinion. 
 What if, Plato thought,,ethics was like math?,What if there were a pure form of justice?,What if there are truths about justice,,and you could just look around in this world,and see which things participated,,partook of that form of justice?,Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't.,It wouldn't be a matter,of just opinion or just appearances.,That's a stunning vision.,I mean, think about that. How grand. How ambitious.,That's as ambitious as we are.,He wants to solve ethics.,He wants objective truths.,If you think that way,,you have a Platonist moral framework. 
 If you don't think that way,,well, you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy,,because the tidy idea, you know, people criticized it.,Aristotle, in particular, he was not amused.,He thought it was impractical.,Aristotle said, "We should seek only so much precision in each subject,as that subject allows.",Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math.,He thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here-and-now,using our best judgment,to find the right path.,If you think that, Plato's not your guy.,But don't give up.,Maybe there's another way,that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework. 
 How about this:,What if in any situation you could just calculate,,look at the choices,,measure out which one's better and know what to do?,That sound familiar?,That's a utilitarian moral framework.,John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this --,nice guy besides --,and only been dead 200 years.,So basis of utilitarianism --,I'm sure you're familiar at least.,The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this.,But here's the way it works.,What if morals, what if what makes something moral,is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure,and minimizes pain?,It does something intrinsic to the act.,It's not like its relation to some abstract form.,It's just a matter of the consequences.,You just look at the consequences,and see if, overall, it's for the good or for the worse.,That would be simple. Then we know what to do. 
 Let's take an example.,Suppose I go up,and I say, "I'm going to take your phone.",Not just because it rang earlier,,but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation.,I thought, that guy looks suspicious.,And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout --,or whoever took over after Bin Laden --,and he's actually like a terrorist, a sleeper cell.,I'm going to find that out, and when I find that out,,I'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause.,That has a very high utility to prevent that damage.,And compared to the little pain that it's going to cause --,because it's going to be embarrassing when I'm looking on his phone,and seeing that he has a Farmville problem and that whole bit --,that's overwhelmed,by the value of looking at the phone.,If you feel that way,,that's a utilitarian choice. 
 But maybe you don't feel that way either.,Maybe you think, it's his phone.,It's wrong to take his phone,because he's a person,and he has rights and he has dignity,,and we can't just interfere with that.,He has autonomy.,It doesn't matter what the calculations are.,There are things that are intrinsically wrong --,like lying is wrong,,like torturing innocent children is wrong.,Kant was very good on this point,,and he said it a little better than I'll say it.,He said we should use our reason,to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct,,and then it is our duty to follow those rules.,It's not a matter of calculation. 
 So let's stop.,We're right in the thick of it, this philosophical thicket.,And this goes on for thousands of years,,because these are hard questions,,and I've only got 15 minutes.,So let's cut to the chase.,How should we be making our decisions?,Is it Plato, is it Aristotle, is it Kant, is it Mill?,What should we be doing? What's the answer?,What's the formula that we can use in any situation,to determine what we should do,,whether we should use that guy's data or not?,What's the formula?,There's not a formula.,There's not a simple answer. 
 Ethics is hard.,Ethics requires thinking.,And that's uncomfortable.,I know; I spent a lot of my career,in artificial intelligence,,trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us,,that could give us answers.,But they can't.,You can't just take human thinking,and put it into a machine.,We're the ones who have to do it.,Happily, we're not machines, and we can do it.,Not only can we think,,we must.,Hannah Arendt said,,"The sad truth,is that most evil done in this world,is not done by people,who choose to be evil.,It arises from not thinking.",That's what she called the "banality of evil.",And the response to that,is that we demand the exercise of thinking,from every sane person. 
 So let's do that. Let's think.,In fact, let's start right now.,Every person in this room do this:,think of the last time you had a decision to make,where you were worried to do the right thing,,where you wondered, "What should I be doing?",Bring that to mind,,and now reflect on that,and say, "How did I come up that decision?,What did I do? Did I follow my gut?,Did I have somebody vote on it? Or did I punt to legal?",Or now we have a few more choices.,"Did I evaluate what would be the highest pleasure,like Mill would?,Or like Kant, did I use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right?",Think about it. Really bring it to mind. This is important.,It is so important,we are going to spend 30 seconds of valuable TEDTalk time,doing nothing but thinking about this.,Are you ready? Go. 
 Stop. Good work.,What you just did,,that's the first step towards taking responsibility,for what we should do with all of our power. 
 Now the next step -- try this.,Go find a friend and explain to them,how you made that decision.,Not right now. Wait till I finish talking.,Do it over lunch.,And don't just find another technologist friend;,find somebody different than you.,Find an artist or a writer --,or, heaven forbid, find a philosopher and talk to them.,In fact, find somebody from the humanities.,Why? Because they think about problems,differently than we do as technologists.,Just a few days ago, right across the street from here,,there was hundreds of people gathered together.,It was technologists and humanists,at that big BiblioTech Conference.,And they gathered together,because the technologists wanted to learn,what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective.,You have someone from Google,talking to someone who does comparative literature.,You're thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater --,how does that bear upon venture capital?,Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking.,And when you think in that way,,you become more sensitive to the human considerations,,which are crucial to making ethical decisions. 
 So imagine that right now,you went and you found your musician friend.,And you're telling him what we're talking about,,about our whole data revolution and all this --,maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music.,♫ Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum ♫,Well, your musician friend will stop you and say,,"You know, the theme music,for your data revolution,,that's an opera, that's Wagner.,It's based on Norse legend.,It's Gods and mythical creatures,fighting over magical jewelry.",That's interesting.,Now it's also a beautiful opera,,and we're moved by that opera.,We're moved because it's about the battle,between good and evil,,about right and wrong.,And we care about right and wrong.,We care what happens in that opera.,We care what happens in "Apocalypse Now.",And we certainly care,what happens with our technologies. 
 We have so much power today,,it is up to us to figure out what to do,,and that's the good news.,We're the ones writing this opera.,This is our movie.,We figure out what will happen with this technology.,We determine how this will all end. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Space,,we all know what it looks like.,We've been surrounded by images of space,our whole lives,,from the speculative images,of science fiction,to the inspirational visions of artists,to the increasingly beautiful pictures,made possible by complex technologies.,But whilst we have,an overwhelmingly vivid,visual understanding of space,,we have no sense of what space sounds like. 
 And indeed, most people associate space with silence.,But the story of how,we came to understand the universe,is just as much a story of listening,as it is by looking.,And yet despite this,,hardly any of us have ever heard space.,How many of you here,could describe the sound,of a single planet or star?,Well in case you've ever wondered,,this is what the Sun sounds like. 
 (Static),(Crackling),(Static),(Crackling) 
 This is the planet Jupiter. 
 (Soft crackling) 
 And this is the space probe Cassini,pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn. 
 (Crackling) 
 This is a a highly condensed clump,of neutral matter,,spinning in the distant universe. 
 (Tapping) 
 So my artistic practice,is all about listening,to the weird and wonderful noises,emitted by the magnificent celestial objects,that make up our universe.,And you may wonder,,how do we know what these sounds are?,How can we tell the difference,between the sound of the Sun,and the sound of a pulsar?,Well the answer,is the science of radio astronomy.,Radio astronomers,study radio waves from space,using sensitive antennas and receivers,,which give them precise information,about what an astronomical object is,and where it is in our night sky.,And just like the signals,that we send and receive here on Earth,,we can convert these transmissions into sound,using simple analog techniques.,And therefore, it's through listening,that we've come to uncover,some of the universe's most important secrets --,its scale, what it's made of,and even how old it is. 
 So today, I'm going to tell you a short story,of the history of the universe through listening.,It's punctuated,by three quick anecdotes,,which show how accidental encounters,with strange noises,gave us some of the most important information,we have about space.,Now this story doesn't start,with vast telescopes,or futuristic spacecraft,,but a rather more humble technology --,and in fact, the very medium,which gave us the telecommunications revolution,that we're all part of today:,the telephone. 
 It's 1876, it's in Boston,,and this is Alexander Graham Bell,who was working with Thomas Watson,on the invention of the telephone.,A key part of their technical set up,was a half-mile long length of wire,,which was thrown across the rooftops,of several houses in Boston.,The line carried the telephone signals,that would later make Bell a household name.,But like any long length of charged wire,,it also inadvertently became,an antenna.,Thomas Watson,spent hours listening,to the strange crackles and hisses,and chirps and whistles,that his accidental antenna detected.,Now you have to remember,,this is 10 years before,Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves --,15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit --,nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.,So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.,We didn't have the technology,to transmit. 
 So what were these strange noises?,Watson was in fact listening,to very low-frequency radio emissions,caused by nature.,Some of the crackles and pops were lightning,,but the eerie whistles,and curiously melodious chirps,had a rather more exotic origin.,Using the very first telephone,,Watson was in fact,dialed into the heavens.,As he correctly guessed,,some of these sounds were caused,by activity on the surface of the Sun.,It was a solar wind,interacting with our ionosphere,that he was listening to --,a phenomena which we can see,at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet,as the aurora.,So whilst inventing the technology,that would usher in the telecommunications revolution,,Watson had discovered,that the star at the center of our solar system,emitted powerful radio waves.,He had accidentally been the first person,to tune in to them. 
 Fast-forward 50 years,,and Bell and Watson's technology,has completely transformed,global communications.,But going from slinging some wire,across rooftops in Boston,to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable,on the Atlantic Ocean seabed,is no easy matter.,And so before long,,Bell were looking to new technologies,to optimize their revolution.,Radio could carry sound without wires.,But the medium is lossy --,it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.,So Bell employed an engineer,to study those noises,,to try and find out where they came from,,with a view towards building,the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them,so they could think about using radio,for the purposes of telephony. 
 Most of the noises,that the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated,were fairly prosaic in origin.,They turned out to be lightning,or sources of electrical power.,But there was one persistent noise,that Jansky couldn't identify,,and it seemed to appear,in his radio headset,four minutes earlier each day.,Now any astronomer will tell you,,this is the telltale sign,of something that doesn't originate from Earth.,Jansky had made a historic discovery,,that celestial objects could emit radio waves,as well as light waves.,Fifty years on,from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,,Jansky's careful listening,ushered in a new age of space exploration:,the radio astronomy age.,Over the next few years,,astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers,and learned about our radio sky,,about Jupiter and the Sun,,by listening. 
 Let's jump ahead again.,It's 1964,,and we're back at Bell Labs.,And once again,,two scientists have got a problem with noise.,Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson,were using the horn antenna,at Bell's Holmdel laboratory,to study the Milky Way,with extraordinary precision.,They were really listening,to the galaxy in high fidelity.,There was a glitch in their soundtrack.,A mysterious persistent noise,was disrupting their research.,It was in the microwave range,,and it appeared to be coming,from all directions simultaneously.,Now this didn't make any sense,,and like any reasonable engineer or scientist,,they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,,it must be the dish.,There were pigeons roosting in the dish.,And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,,get the disk kind of operational again,,normal operations would resume. 
 But the noise didn't disappear.,The mysterious noise,that Penzias and Wilson were listening to,turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound,that anyone had ever heard.,It was cosmic radiation,left over from the very birth of the universe.,This was the first experimental evidence,that the Big Bang existed,and the universe was born at a precise moment,some 14.7 billion years ago.,So our story ends,at the beginning --,the beginning of all things, the Big Bang.,This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard --,the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,,the cosmic microwave background radiation,left over from the Big Bang. 
 (Fuzz) 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Do you know,how many species of flowering plants there are?,There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about --,a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.,And flowers are a real bugger.,They're really difficult for plants to produce.,They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.,Why would they go to that bother?,And the answer of course, like so many things in the world,,is sex.,I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.,And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important --,there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.,You can take cuttings;,they can sort of have sex with themselves;,they can pollinate themselves.,But they really need to spread their genes,to mix with other genes,so that they can adapt to environmental niches.,Evolution works that way. 
 Now the way that plants transmit that information,is through pollen.,Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.,As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope,to be able to see these.,And there is as many different kinds of pollen,as there are flowering plants.,And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.,Most pollen that causes hay fever for us,is from plants that use the wind,to disseminate the pollen,,and that's a very inefficient process,,which is why it gets up our noses so much.,Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it,,hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells,,which are held within the pollen,,will somehow reach another flower just by chance.,So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops,,and most of the trees,have wind-borne pollen.,But most species,actually use insects to do their bidding,,and that's more intelligent in a way,,because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.,The insects,and other species,can take the pollen,,transfer it directly to where it's required. 
 So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship,between insects and plants.,There's a symbiotic relationship there,,whether it's flies or birds or bees,,they're getting something in return,,and that something in return is generally nectar.,Sometimes that symbiosis,has led to wonderful adaptations --,the hummingbird hawk-moth,is beautiful in its adaptation.,The plant gets something,,and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.,Plants have evolved,to create little landing strips here and there,for bees that might have lost their way.,There are markings on many plants,that look like other insects.,These are the anthers of a lily,,cleverly done,so that when the unsuspecting insect,lands on it,,the anther flips up and whops it on the back,with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.,And there's an orchid,that might look to you as if it's got jaws,,and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out,,getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else. 
 Orchids: there are 20,000, at least,,species of orchids --,amazingly, amazingly diverse.,And they get up to all sorts of tricks.,They have to try and attract pollinators,to do their bidding.,This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid,,because it's one that he studied,and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it --,you can see that there's a very long nectar tube,that descends down,from the orchid.,And basically what the insect has to do --,we're in the middle of the flower --,it has to stick its little proboscis,right into the middle of that,and all the way down that nectar tube,to get to the nectar.,And Darwin said, looking at this flower,,"I guess something has coevolved with this.",And sure enough,,there's the insect.,And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away,,but in its erect form,,that's what it looks like. 
 Now you can imagine,that if nectar,is such a valuable thing,and expensive for the plant to produce,and it attracts lots of pollinators,,then, just as in human sex,,people might start to deceive.,They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?",Now this is a plant.,This is a plant here,that insects in South Africa just love,,and they've evolved with a long proboscis,to get the nectar at the bottom.,And this is the mimic.,So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.,And here is the long-probosced fly,that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic,,because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.,So not only has the fly,not got the nectar from the mimic plant,,it's also -- if you look very closely,just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen,that it would be transmitting to another plant,,if only some botanist hadn't come along,and stuck it to a blue piece of card. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.,This flower with its black dots:,they might look like black dots to us,,but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species,,that looks like two females,who are really, really hot to trot.,(Laughter),And when the insect gets there and lands on it,,dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant,,if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture,,you can see that there are actually some patterning there,,which is three-dimensional.,So it probably even feels good for the insect,,as well as looking good. 
 And these electron microscope pictures --,here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect --,you can see that different parts of the structure,have different colors and different textures to our eye,,have very, very different textures,to what an insect might perceive.,And this one is evolved to mimic,a glossy metallic surface,you see on some beetles.,And under the scanning electron microscope,,you can see the surface there --,really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.,Sometimes the whole plant,mimics an insect, even to us.,I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.,It's a wonderful, amazing thing. 
 This one's clever. It's called obsidian.,I think of it as insidium sometimes.,To the right species of bee,,this looks like another very aggressive bee,,and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away,,and, of course, covers itself with pollen.,The other thing it does,is that this plant mimics another orchid,that has a wonderful store,of food for insects.,And this one doesn't have anything for them.,So it's deceiving on two levels --,fabulous. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here we see ylang ylang,,the component of many perfumes.,I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.,And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.,They're sending out a fantastic array of scent,to any insect that'll have it.,This one doesn't smell so good.,This is a flower,that really, really smells pretty nasty,and is designed, again, evolved,,to look like carrion.,So flies love this.,They fly in and they pollinate.,This, which is helicodiceros,,is also known as dead horse arum.,I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like,,but this one probably smells pretty much like it.,It's really horrible.,And blowflies just can't help themselves.,They fly into this thing,,and they fly all the way down it.,They lay their eggs in it,,thinking it's a nice bit of carrion,,and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die,,but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited,,because the bristles release,and the flies disappear,to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic. 
 Here's arum, arum maculatum,,"lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.,I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.,This thing heats up,by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature --,amazing.,And if you look down into it,,there's this sort of dam past the spadix,,flies get attracted by the heat --,which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges --,and they get trapped underneath in this container.,They drink this fabulous nectar,and then they're all a bit sticky.,At night they get covered in pollen,,which showers down over them,,and then the bristles that we saw above,,they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen --,fabulous thing. 
 Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.,This is the philodendron selloum.,For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.,This is the most amazing thing.,That sort of phallic bit there,is about a foot long.,And it does something,that no other plant that I know of does,,and that is that when it flowers --,that's the spadix in the middle there --,for a period of about two days,,it metabolizes in a way,which is rather similar to mammals.,So instead of having starch,,which is the food of plants,,it takes something rather similar to brown fat,and burns it at such a rate,that it's burning fat, metabolizing,,about the rate of a small cat.,And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight,,than a hummingbird --,absolutely astonishing.,This thing does something else which is unusual.,Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit,,43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days,,but it keeps constant temperature.,There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there,that keeps constant temperature.,"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.,Now wouldn't you know it,,there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.,And they get inside, and they get it all on.,(Laughter),And the plant showers them with pollen,,and off they go and pollinate.,And what a wonderful thing it is. 
 Now most pollinators,that we think about are insects,,but actually in the tropics,,many birds and butterflies pollinate.,And many of the tropical flowers are red,,and that's because butterflies and birds,see similarly to us, we think,,and can see the color red very well.,But if you look at the spectrum,,birds and us, we see red, green and blue,and see that spectrum.,Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet,,and they see various shades of ultraviolet.,So there's something that goes on off the end there.,"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.,Well yes we can.,So what is an insect seeing?,Last week I took these pictures of rock rose,,helianthemum, in Dorset.,These are little yellow flowers like we all see,,little yellow flowers all over the place.,And this is what it looks like with visible light.,This is what it looks like if you take out the red.,Most bees don't perceive red.,And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera,and took a very, very long exposure,with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light,and this is what I got.,And that's a real fantastic bull's eye. 
 Now we don't know,exactly what a bee sees,,any more than you know what I'm seeing,when I call this red.,We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's --,another human being's mind.,But the contrast will look something like that,,so standing out a lot from the background.,Here's another little flower --,different range of ultraviolet frequencies,,different filters,to match the pollinators.,And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.,Just in case you think,that all yellow flowers have this property --,no flower was damaged in the process of this shot;,it was just attached to the tripod,,not killed --,then under ultraviolet light,,look at that.,And that could be the basis of a sunscreen,because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.,So maybe the chemical in that would be useful. 
 Finally, there's one of evening primrose,that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me --,fantastic hidden pattern.,And I love the idea of something hidden.,I think there's something poetic here,,that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter,,the main use of that filter,is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus --,actually the clouds of Venus.,That's the main use of that filter.,Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility,,which is the flower story.,And just as flowers spend a lot of effort,trying to get pollinators to do their bidding,,they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them,and give them to each other,at times of birth and death,,and particularly at marriage,,which, when you think of it,,is the moment that encapsulates,the transfer of genetic material,from one organism to another. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So historically there has,been a huge divide between what people,consider to be non-living systems on one,side, and living systems on the other side.,So we go from, say, this beautiful and,complex crystal as non-life, and this rather,beautiful and complex cat on the other side.,Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,,science has kind of blurred this distinction,between non-living and living systems, and,now we consider that there may be a kind,of continuum that exists between the two.,We'll just take one example here:,a virus is a natural system, right?,But it's very simple. It's very simplistic.,It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,,it doesn't have all the characteristics,of living systems and is in fact a parasite,on other living systems in order to, say,,reproduce and evolve. 
 But what we're going to be talking about here,tonight are experiments done on this sort of,non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually,doing chemical experiments in the laboratory,,mixing together nonliving ingredients,to make new structures, and that these,new structures might have some of the,characteristics of living systems.,Really what I'm talking about here is,trying to create a kind of artificial life. 
 So what are these characteristics that I'm,talking about? These are them.,We consider first that life has a body.,Now this is necessary to distinguish the self,from the environment.,Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a,process by which life can convert resources,from the environment into building blocks,so it can maintain and build itself.,Life also has a kind of inheritable information.,Now we, as humans, we store our information,as DNA in our genomes and we pass this,information on to our offspring.,If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism --,we can come up with a system that could,perhaps move and replicate, and if we,coupled these now to inheritable information,,we can come up with a system that would be,more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.,And so these are the things we will try to do,in the lab, make some experiments that have,one or more of these characteristics of life. 
 So how do we do this? Well, we use,a model system that we term a protocell.,You might think of this as kind of like a,primitive cell. It is a simple chemical,model of a living cell, and if you consider,for example a cell in your body may have,on the order of millions of different types,of molecules that need to come together,,play together in a complex network,to produce something that we call alive.,In the laboratory what we want to do,is much the same, but with on the order of,tens of different types of molecules --,so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still,trying to produce something that looks lifelike.,And so what we do is, we start simple,and we work our way up to living systems.,Consider for a moment this quote by,Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a,kind of synthetic biology:,"The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,,will not be the sensational discovery which we,usually associate with the idea.",That's his first statement. So if we actually,create life in the laboratories, it's,probably not going to impact our lives at all. 
 "If we accept the theory of evolution, then,the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist,in the production of forms intermediate,between the inorganic and the organic,world, or between the non-living,and living world, forms which possess,only some of the rudimentary attributes of life",-- so, the ones I just discussed --,"to which other attributes will be slowly added,in the course of development by the,evolutionary actions of the environment.",So we start simple, we make some structures,that may have some of these characteristics,of life, and then we try to develop that,to become more lifelike.,This is how we can start to make a protocell.,We use this idea called self-assembly.,What that means is, I can mix some,chemicals together in a test tube in my lab,,and these chemicals will start to self-associate,to form larger and larger structures.,So say on the order of tens of thousands,,hundreds of thousands of molecules will,come together to form a large structure,that didn't exist before.,And in this particular example,,what I took is some membrane molecules,,mixed those together in the right environment,,and within seconds it forms these rather,complex and beautiful structures here.,These membranes are also quite similar,,morphologically and functionally,,to the membranes in your body,,and we can use these, as they say,,to form the body of our protocell. 
 Likewise,,we can work with oil and water systems.,As you know, when you put oil and water together,,they don't mix, but through self-assembly,we can get a nice oil droplet to form,,and we can actually use this as a body for,our artificial organism or for our protocell,,as you will see later.,So that's just forming some body stuff, right?,Some architectures.,What about the other aspects of living systems?,So we came up with this protocell model here,that I'm showing.,We started with a natural occurring clay,called montmorillonite.,This is natural from the environment, this clay.,It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.,It could run a metabolism on it.,Certain kind of molecules like to associate,with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red,-- this is a relative of DNA,,it's an informational molecule --,it can come along and it starts to associate,with the surface of this clay.,This structure, then, can organize the,formation of a membrane boundary around,itself, so it can make a body of,liquid molecules around itself, and that's,shown in green here on this micrograph.,So just through self-assembly, mixing things,together in the lab, we can come up with, say,,a metabolic surface with some,informational molecules attached,inside of this membrane body, right? 
 So we're on a road towards living systems.,But if you saw this protocell, you would not,confuse this with something that was actually alive.,It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,,it doesn't really do anything.,So, something is missing.,Some things are missing.,So some things that are missing is,,for example, if you had a flow of energy,through a system, what we'd want,is a protocell that can harvest,some of that energy in order to maintain itself,,much like living systems do.,So we came up with a different protocell,model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.,In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,,but a chemical metabolism inside,that allows this protocell to use energy,to do something, to actually become dynamic,,as we'll see here.,You add the droplet to the system.,It's a pool of water, and the protocell,starts moving itself around in the system.,Okay? Oil droplet forms,through self-assembly, has a chemical,metabolism inside so it can use energy,,and it uses that energy to move itself,around in its environment. 
 As we heard earlier, movement is very,important in these kinds of living systems.,It is moving around, exploring its environment,,and remodeling its environment, as you see,,by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.,So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system,trying to preserve itself.,We take this same moving protocell here,,and we put it in another experiment,,get it moving. Then I'm going,to add some food to the system,,and you'll see that in blue here, right?,So I add some food source to the system.,The protocell moves. It encounters the food.,It reconfigures itself and actually then,is able to climb to the highest concentration,of food in that system and stop there.,Alright? So not only do we have this system,that has a body, it has a metabolism,,it can use energy, it moves around.,It can sense its local environment,and actually find resources,in the environment to sustain itself. 
 Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have,a neural system. This is just a sack of,chemicals that is able to have this interesting,and complex lifelike behavior.,If we count the number of chemicals,in that system, actually, including the water,that's in the dish, we have five chemicals,that can do this.,So then we put these protocells together in a,single experiment to see what they would do,,and depending on the conditions, we have,some protocells on the left that are,moving around and it likes to touch the other,structures in its environment.,On the other hand we have two moving,protocells that like to circle each other,,and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.,Right? So not only do individual protocells,have behavior, what we've interpreted as,behavior in this system, but we also have,basically population-level behavior,similar to what organisms have.,So now that you're all experts on protocells,,we're going to play a game with these protocells.,We're going to make two different kinds.,Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry,inside that, when activated, the protocell,starts to vibrate around, just dancing.,So remember, these are primitive things,,so dancing protocells, that's very,interesting to us. (Laughter) 
 The second protocell has a different,chemistry inside, and when activated,,the protocells all come together and they fuse,into one big one. Right?,And we just put these two together,in the same system.,So there's population A,,there's population B, and then,we activate the system,,and protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,,they all come together. They fuse together,to form one big blob, and the other protocell,just dances around. And this just happens,until all of the energy in the system is,basically used up, and then, game over.,So then I repeated this experiment,a bunch of times, and one time,something very interesting happened.,So, I added these protocells together,to the system, and protocell A and protocell B,fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.,That didn't happen before. There it goes.,There's a protocell AB now in this system.,Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,,while protocell B does the fusing, okay? 
 But then something even more interesting happens.,Watch when these two large protocells,,the hybrid ones, fuse together.,Now we have a dancing protocell,and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter),Just with blobs of chemicals, again.,So the way this works is, you have,a simple system of five chemicals here,,a simple system here. When they hybridize,,you then form something that's different than,before, it's more complex than before,,and you get the emergence of another kind of,lifelike behavior which,in this case is replication. 
 So since we can make some interesting,protocells that we like, interesting colors and,interesting behaviors, and they're very easy,to make, and they have interesting lifelike,properties, perhaps these protocells have,something to tell us about the origin of life,on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an,easily accessible step, one of the first steps,by which life got started on the early Earth.,Certainly, there were molecules present on,the early Earth, but they wouldn't have been,these pure compounds that we worked with,in the lab and I showed in these experiments.,Rather, they'd be a real complex mixture of,all kinds of stuff, because,uncontrolled chemical reactions produce,a diverse mixture of organic compounds.,Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?,And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully,characterize, even by modern methods, and,the product looks brown, like this tar here,on the left. A pure compound,is shown on the right, for contrast. 
 So this is similar to what happens when you,take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,,you put them in a pan, and you apply energy.,You turn up the heat, you start making,or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,,forming a brownish caramel, right?,If you let that go unregulated, you'll,continue to make and break chemical bonds,,forming an even more diverse mixture of,molecules that then forms this kind of black,tarry stuff in your pan, right, that's,difficult to wash out. So that's what,the origin of life would have looked like.,You needed to get life out of this junk that,is present on the early Earth,,four, 4.5 billion years ago.,So the challenge then is,,throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab,,and try to make some protocells with lifelike,properties from this kind of primordial ooze. 
 So we're able to then see the self-assembly,of these oil droplet bodies again,that we've seen previously,,and the black spots inside of there,represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse,,very complex, organic black tar.,And we put them into one of these,experiments, as you've seen earlier, and then,we watch lively movement that comes out.,They look really good, very nice movement,,and also they appear to have some kind of,behavior where they kind of circle,around each other and follow each other,,similar to what we've seen before -- but again,,working with just primordial conditions,,no pure chemicals.,These are also, these tar-fueled protocells,,are also able to locate resources,in their environment.,I'm going to add some resource from the left,,here, that defuses into the system,,and you can see, they really like that.,They become very energetic, and able,to find the resource in the environment,,similar to what we saw before.,But again, these are done in these primordial,conditions, really messy conditions,,not sort of sterile laboratory conditions.,These are very dirty little protocells,,as a matter of fact. (Laughter),But they have lifelike properties, is the point. 
 So, doing these artificial life experiments,helps us define a potential path between,non-living and living systems.,And not only that, but it helps us,broaden our view of what life is,and what possible life there could be,out there -- life that could be very different,from life that we find here on Earth.,And that leads me to the next,term, which is "weird life.",This is a term by Steve Benner.,This is used in reference to a report,in 2007 by the National Research Council,in the United States, wherein,they tried to understand how we can,look for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,,especially if that life is very different from life,on Earth. If we went to another planet and,we thought there might be life there,,how could we even recognize it as life? 
 Well, they came up with three very general,criteria. First is -- and they're listed here.,The first is, the system has to be in,non-equilibrium. That means the system,cannot be dead, in a matter of fact.,Basically what that means is, you have,an input of energy into the system that life,can use and exploit to maintain itself.,This is similar to having the Sun shining,on the Earth, driving photosynthesis,,driving the ecosystem.,Without the Sun, there's likely to be,no life on this planet.,Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form,,so that means even if we had some,interesting structures, interesting molecules,together but they were frozen solid,,then this is not a good place for life.,And thirdly, we need to be able to make,and break chemical bonds. And again,this is important because life transforms,resources from the environment into,building blocks so it can maintain itself. 
 Now today, I told you about very strange,and weird protocells -- some that contain clay,,some that have primordial ooze in them,,some that have basically oil,instead of water inside of them.,Most of these don't contain DNA,,but yet they have lifelike properties.,But these protocells satisfy,these general requirements of living systems.,So by making these chemical, artificial,life experiments, we hope not only,to understand something fundamental,about the origin of life and the existence,of life on this planet, but also,what possible life there could be,out there in the universe. Thank you.,(Applause)When I was little --,and by the way, I was little once --,my father told me a story,about an 18th century watchmaker.,And what this guy had done:,he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.,And one day, one of his customers came into his workshop,and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought.,And the guy took it apart,,and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.,And as he did so, his customer noticed,that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving,,were words.,And he said to the guy,,"Why have you put stuff on the back,that no one will ever see?",And the watchmaker turned around and said,,"God can see it.",Now I'm not in the least bit religious,,neither was my father,,but at that point, I noticed something happening here.,I felt something,in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,,and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.,But I felt something.,And it was a physiological response.,And from that point on, from my age at the time,,I began to think of things in a different way. 
 And as I took on my career as a designer,,I began to ask myself the simple question:,Do we actually think beauty,,or do we feel it?,Now you probably know the answer to this already.,You probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is,,but I think it's about feeling beauty.,And so I then moved on into my design career,and began to find some exciting things.,One of the most early work was done in automotive design --,some very exciting work was done there.,And during a lot of this work,,we found something, or I found something,,that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.,Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off,,click click, when you closed the door in a car?,And then somebody, I think it was BMW,,introduced a light that went out slowly.,Remember that?,I remember it clearly.,Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?,I remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.,In fact, I've never found anybody,that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.,I thought, well what the hell's that about? 
 So I started to ask myself questions about it.,And the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes.","Why?" And they'd say, "Oh, it feels so natural,",or, "It's nice.",I thought, well that's not good enough.,Can we cut down a little bit further,,because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,,of how this actually works.,And so I did some experiments.,And I suddenly realized,that there was something that did exactly that --,light to dark in six seconds --,exactly that.,Do you know what it is? Anyone? 
 You see, using this bit, the thinky bit,,the slow bit of the brain -- using that.,And this isn't a think, it's a feel.,And would you do me a favor?,For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is,,will you feel stuff? 
 I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.,I felt a sense of relaxation,tempered with anticipation.,And that thing that I found,was the cinema or the theater.,It's actually just happened here --,light to dark in six seconds.,And when that happens, are you sitting there going,,"No, the movie's about to start,",or are you going, "That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.,I get a sense of anticipation"?,Now I'm not a neuroscientist.,I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.,But it might be.,Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere,that used to go in the cinema get this.,And some of the people I speak to,that have never seen a movie or been to the theater,don't get it in the same way.,Everybody likes it,,but some like it more than others. 
 So this leads me to think of this in a different way.,We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system --,if that's not an outmoded idea.,These are the bits, the pleasure centers,,and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling,is bypassing my thinking.,The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits,is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.,They arrive first.,So how do we make that actually work?,And how much of that reactive side of it,is due to what we already know,,or what we're going to learn, about something? 
 This is one of the most beautiful things I know.,It's a plastic bag.,And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.,Then I found out,,post exposure,,that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle,or a stream filled with coliforms,and all sorts of disgusting stuff,,that that filthy water,will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis,and end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.,And all of a sudden, this plastic bag,was extremely beautiful to me. 
 Now I'm going to ask you again,to switch on the emotional bit.,Would you mind taking the brain out,,and I just want you to feel something.,Look at that. What are you feeling about it?,Is it beautiful? Is it exciting?,I'm watching your faces very carefully.,There's some rather bored-looking gentlemen,and some slightly engaged-looking ladies,who are picking up something off that.,Maybe there's an innocence to it.,Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?,This is the last act on this Earth,of a little girl called Heidi, five years old,,before she died of cancer to the spine.,It's the last thing she did,,the last physical act.,Look at that picture.,Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.,Is it beautiful now? 
 Stop. Stop. How do you feel?,Where are you feeling this?,I'm feeling it here. I feel it here.,And I'm watching your faces,,because your faces are telling me something.,The lady over there is actually crying, by the way.,But what are you doing?,I watch what people do.,I watch faces.,I watch reactions.,Because I have to know how people react to things.,And one of the most common faces,on something faced with beauty,,something stupefyingly delicious,,is what I call the OMG.,And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.,It's not a "this is wonderful!",The eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,,and the mouth is hanging open.,That's not the expression of joy.,There's something else in that.,There's something weird happening.,So pleasure seems to be tempered,by a whole series of different things coming in. 
 Poignancy is a word I love as a designer.,It means something triggering a big emotional response,,often quite a sad emotional response,,but it's part of what we do.,It isn't just about nice.,And this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.,Sensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things --,mixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening --,to come up with that sensorial exposure,,that sensation of what's going on.,Pathos appears obviously,as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.,And also triumph, this sense of transcendence,,this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new.",And that's packed in there as well.,And as we assemble these tools,,from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,,because these are things, as we've already said,,they're arriving at the brain, it would seem,,before cognition, before we can manipulate them --,electrochemical party tricks. 
 Now what I'm also interested in is:,Is it possible to separate,intrinsic and extrinsic beauty?,By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,,just something that's exquisitely beautiful,,that's universally beautiful.,Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it.,Very hard to find something that, to everybody,,is a very beautiful thing,,without a certain amount of information packed in there before.,So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.,It's mediated by information before the comprehension.,Or the information's added on at the back,,like that little girl's drawing that I showed you. 
 Now when talking about beauty,you can't get away from the fact,that a lot experiments have been done in this way,with faces and what have you.,And one of the most tedious ones, I think,,was saying that beauty was about symmetry.,Well it obviously isn't.,This is a more interesting one,where half faces were shown to some people,,and then to add them into a list,of most beautiful to least beautiful,and then exposing a full face.,And they found that it was almost exact coincidence.,So it wasn't about symmetry.,In fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,,of which both sides are beautiful.,But they're both different. 
 And as a designer, I can't help meddling with this,,so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,,and tried to understand what the individual elements were,,but feeling it as I go.,Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty,if I look at that eye.,I'm not getting it off the eyebrow.,And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.,So I don't know how much this is helping me,,but it's helping to guide me to the places,where the signals are coming off.,And as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist,,but to understand how I can start to assemble things,that will very quickly bypass,this thinking part,and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements. 
 Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again,that we see things not as they are, but as we are.,So I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you,,which is beautiful to me.,And this is the F1 MV Agusta.,Ahhhh.,It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you,how exquisite this object is.,But I also know why it's exquisite to me,,because it's a palimpsest of things.,It's masses and masses of layers.,This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.,It's something much bigger.,Layer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.,I mean, if I just go through some of them now --,I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,,and that does it consummately well, you can see it can.,So that's getting me excited.,And I feel that here. 
 This bit, the big secret of automotive design --,reflection management.,It's not about the shapes,,it's how the shapes reflect light.,Now that thing, light flickers across it as you move,,so it becomes a kinetic object,,even though it's standing still --,managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.,This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider,means there's something going on underneath it --,in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,,taking the power from the engine.,I'm getting terribly excited,as my mind and my eyes flick across these things. 
 Titanium lacquer on this.,I can't tell you how wonderful this is.,That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.,I'm really getting into this now.,And of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand,,but this one, because it's a road bike,,it all goes away and it folds into this little gap.,So it disappears.,And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.,Why would you do that?,Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.,So it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.,And to cap it all,,brand royalty --,Agusta, Count Agusta,,from the great histories of this stuff. 
 The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.,Massimo Tamburini.,They call him "The Plumber" in Italy,,as well as "Maestro,",because he actually is engineer,and craftsman and sculptor at the same time.,There's so little compromise on this, you can't see it. 
 But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me,have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.,We have to deal with it.,So I have to work with a supply chain, and I've got to work with the technologies,,and I've got to work with everything else all the time,,and so compromises start to fit into it.,And so look at her.,I've had to make a bit of a compromise there.,I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.,No one's noticed, have they yet?,Did you see what I did?,I moved three things by a millimeter.,Pretty? Yes.,Beautiful? Maybe lesser.,But then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.,So that's okay, isn't it?,Another millimeter?,No one's going to notice those split lines and changes.,It's that easy to lose beauty,,because beauty's incredibly difficult to do.,And only a few people can do it.,And a focus group cannot do it.,And a team rarely can do it.,It takes a central cortex, if you like,,to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time. 
 This is a beautiful water bottle --,some of you know of it --,done by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.,This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,,as long as you know what water is like,then you can experience this.,It's lovely because it is an embodiment,of something refreshing and delicious.,I might like it more than you like it,,because I know how bloody hard it is to do it.,It's stupefyingly difficult,to make something that refracts light like that,,that comes out of the tool correctly,,that goes down the line without falling over.,Underneath this, like the story of the swan,,is a million things very difficult to do.,So all hail to that.,It's a fantastic example, a simple object.,And the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.,And they're working in beauty,in slightly different ways because of it. 
 You all, I guess, like me,,enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.,And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.,You also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful.,Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes,when they come out of the points?,While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,,something horrible's going on down here.,The comprehension of it,leads us to a greater and heightened sense,of the beauty of what's actually going on. 
 Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here,,so please ignore me.,But what I have to do now, feeling again,,what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,,of these triggers into something early on in the process,,that you pick it up,,not through your thinking, but through your feeling.,So we're going to have a little experiment.,Right, are you ready? I'm going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.,Are you ready? Okay.,Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?,It's not.,Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.,Did you think it was modern? Yes you did.,That blip, that information, shot into you before that.,And because your brain starter motor began there,,now it's got to deal with it.,And the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way,specifically to engender a sense,that it's green technology and it's good for you,and it's light and it's all part of the future. 
 So is that wrong?,Well in this case it isn't,,because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.,But you're a slave of that first flash.,We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second --,and that's where much of my work,has to win or lose,,on a shelf in a shop.,It wins or loses at that point.,You may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf,as you walk down it,,but I have to work within that domain,,to ensure that it gets you there first. 
 And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.,Some of you, I'm sure, will be familiar with this.,What's incredible about this,,and the way I love to come back to it,,is this is taking something that you hate or bores you,,folding clothes,,and if you can actually do this --,who can actually do this? Anybody try to do this?,Yeah?,It's fantastic, isn't it?,Look at that. Do you want to see it again?,No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.,But just go to the Web, YouTube,,pull it down, "folding T-shirt.",That's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.,You didn't maybe know it.,But how do you feel about it?,It feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,,and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have --,you look really smart.,The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,,the stuff that costs nothing,,because that knowledge is free --,bundle that together and where do we come out? 
 Form follows function?,Only sometimes. Only sometimes.,Form is function. Form is function.,It informs, it tells us,,it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.,And so I've stopped using words like "form,",and I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.,What I try to pursue now,is the emotional functionality of things.,Because if I can get that right,,I can make them wonderful, and I can make them repeatedly wonderful.,And you know what those products and services are,,because you own some of them.,They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire.,Forming the emotional bond,between this thing and you,is an electrochemical party trick,that happens before you even think about it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)If your life were a book,and you were the author,,how would you want your story to go?,That's the questionnthat changed my life forever.,Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,,all I wanted was to be free.,I would daydream aboutntraveling the world,,living in a place where it snowed,,and I would picture all of the stories,that I would go on to tell. 
 At the age of 19,,the day after I graduated high school,,I moved to a place where it snowed,and I became a massage therapist.,With this job all I needed were my hands,and my massage table by my side,and I could go anywhere.,For the first time in my life,,I felt free, independent,and completely in control of my life.,That is, until my life took a detour.,I went home from work early one day,with what I thought was the flu,,and less than 24 hours later,I was in the hospital,on life support,with less than a two percent chance of living.,It wasn't until days later,as I lay in a coma,that the doctors diagnosed me,with bacterial meningitis,,a vaccine-preventable blood infection.,Over the course of two and a half months,I lost my spleen, my kidneys,,the hearing in my left ear,and both of my legs below the knee. 
 When my parentsnwheeled me out of the hospital,I felt like I had beennpieced back together,like a patchwork doll.,I thought the worst was over,until weeks later when I saw my new legs,for the first time.,The calves were bulky blocks of metal,with pipes bolted together for the ankles,and a yellow rubber foot,with a raised rubber linenfrom the toe to the ankle,to look like a vein.,I didn't know what to expect,,but I wasn't expecting that. 
 With my mom by my side,and tears streaming down our faces,,I strapped on these chunky legs,and I stood up.,They were so painful and so confining,that all I could think was,,how am I ever going to travel the world,in these things?,How was I ever going to live,the life full of adventure and stories,,as I always wanted?,And how was I going to snowboard again? 
 That day, I went home, I crawled into bed,and this is what my life looked like,for the next few months:,me passed out, escaping from reality,,with my legs resting by my side.,I was absolutely physicallynand emotionally broken. 
 But I knew that in order to move forward,,I had to let go of the old Amy,and learn to embrace the new Amy.,And that is when it dawned on me,that I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.,I could be as tall as I wanted!,(Laughter) (Applause),Or as short as I wanted,ndepending on who I was dating.,(Laughter),And if I snowboarded again,,my feet aren't going to get cold.,(Laughter),And best of all, I thought,,I can make my feet the sizenof all the shoes,that are on the sales rack.n(Laughter),And I did!,So there were benefits here. 
 It was this moment that I asked myself,that life-defining question:,If my life were a book,and I were the author,,how would I want the story to go?,And I began to daydream.,I daydreamed like I did as a little girl,and I imagined myself,walking gracefully,,helping other people through my journey,and snowboarding again.,And I didn't just see myself,carving down a mountain of powder,,I could actually feel it.,I could feel the wind against my face,and the beat of my racing heart,as if it were happeningnin that very moment.,And that is when a new chapternin my life began. 
 Four months laternI was back up on a snowboard,,although things didn't gonquite as expected:,My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend,and at one point I traumatizednall the skiers on the chair lift,when I fell and my legs,,still attached to my snowboard —,(Laughter) —,went flying down the mountain,,and I was on top of the mountain still.,I was so shocked,,I was just as shocked as everybody else,nand I was so discouraged,,but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet,that I would be able to do this again.,And this is when I learnednthat our borders,and our obstaclesncan only do two things:,one, stop us in our tracks,or two, force us to get creative. 
 I did a year of research,nstill couldn't figure out,what kind of legs to use,,couldn't find any resourcesnthat could help me.,So I decided to make a pair myself.,My leg maker and Input random parts together,and we made a pair of feetnthat I could snowboard in.,As you can see,,rusted bolts, rubber,nwood and neon pink duct tape.,And yes, I can change my toenail polish.,It was these legs,and the best 21st birthday giftnI could ever receive —,a new kidney from my dad —,that allowed me to follow my dreams again.,I started snowboarding,,then I went back to work,nthen I went back to school. 
 Then in 2005 I cofoundedna nonprofit organization,for youth and young adultsnwith physical disabilities,so they could get involvednwith action sports.,From there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,,where I helped to put shoesnon thousands of children's feet,so they could attend school. 
 And just this past February,,I won two back-to-backnWorld Cup gold medals —,(Applause) —,which made me,the highest rankednadaptive female snowboarder,in the world. 
 Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs,,I had no idea what to expect.,But if you ask me today,,if I would ever want tonchange my situation,,I would have to say no.,Because my legs haven't disabled me,,if anything they've enabled me.,They've forced me to rely on my imagination,and to believe in the possibilities,,and that's why I believe,that our imaginations can be used as tools,for breaking through borders,,because in our minds,nwe can do anything,and we can be anything. 
 It's believing in those dreams,and facing our fears head-on,that allows us to live our lives,beyond our limits.,And although today is aboutninnovation without borders,,I have to say that in my life,,innovation has only been possible,because of my borders.,I've learned that borders are where the actual ends,,but also where the imagination,and the story begins. 
 So the thought that I would like nto challenge you with today,is that maybe instead of looking at nour challenges and our limitations,as something negative or bad,,we can begin to look at them as blessings,,magnificent gifts that can be usednto ignite our imaginations,and help us go furthernthan we ever knew we could go.,It's not about breaking down borders.,It's about pushing off of them,and seeing what amazing places,they might bring us.,Thank you.I, like many of you,,am one of the two billion peoplenon Earth who live in cities.,And there are days --nI don't know about the rest of you --,but there are days when I palpably feel,how much I rely on other people,for pretty much everything in my life.,And some days, that can evennbe a little scary.,But what I'm herento talk to you about today,is how that same interdependence,is actually an extremelynpowerful social infrastructure,that we can actually harness,to help heal somenof our deepest civic issues,,if we apply open-source collaboration. 
 A couple of years ago,,I read an article by New York Timesnwriter Michael Pollan,,in which he argued that growingneven some of our own food,is one of the best thingsnthat we can do for the environment.,Now at the time that I was reading this,,it was the middle of the winter,and I definitely did not have roomnfor a lot of dirt,in my New York City apartment.,So I was basically just willing to settle,for just reading the next Wired magazine,and finding out how the expertsnwere going to figure out,how to solve all these problemsnfor us in the future.,But that was actually exactly the point,that Michael Pollannwas making in this article --,it's precisely when we hand over,the responsibilitynfor all these things to specialists,that we cause the kind of messesnthat we see with the food system. 
 So, I happen to knowna little bit from my own work,about how NASA has been using hydroponics,to explore growing food in space.,And that you can actuallynget optimal nutritional yield,by running a kind of high-qualitynliquid soil over plants' root systems.,Now to a vegetable plant,,my apartment has got to benabout as foreign as outer space.,But I can offer some natural light,and year-round climate control. 
 Fast-forward two years later:,we now have window farms,,which are vertical, hydroponic platforms,for food-growing indoors.,And the way it worksnis that there's a pump at the bottom,,which periodically sends this liquidnnutrient solution up to the top,,which then trickles downnthrough plants' root systems,that are suspended in clay pellets --,so there's no dirt involved.,Now light and temperature varynwith each window's microclimate,,so a window farm requires a farmer,,and she must decide,what kind of crops she is goingnto put in her window farm,,and whether she is goingnto feed her food organically. 
 Back at the time,,a window farm was no morenthan a technically complex idea,that was going to requirena lot of testing.,And I really wanted itnto be an open project,,because hydroponics,is one of the fastestngrowing areas of patenting,in the United States right now,,and could possibly becomenanother area like Monsanto,,where we have a lot of corporatenintellectual property,in the way of people's food.,So I decided that,ninstead of creating a product,,what I was going to do,was open this upnto a whole bunch of codevelopers. 
 The first few systems that we created,nthey kind of worked.,We were actually able to grownabout a salad a week,in a typical New York Citynapartment window.,And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes,and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.,But the first few systems,were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers,that Martha Stewartnwould definitely never have approved. 
 (Laughter) 
 So to bring on more codevelopers,,what we did was we createdna social media site,on which we published the designs,,we explained how they worked,,and we even went so far,as to point out everythingnthat was wrong with these systems.,And then we invited peoplenall over the world,to build them and experiment with us.,So actually now on this website,,we have 18,000 people.,And we have window farmsnall over the world. 
 What we're doingnis what NASA or a large corporation,would call R&D,nor research and development.,But what we call it is R&D-I-Y,,or "research and develop it yourself." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, for example, Jackson came along,and suggested that we use air pumpsninstead of water pumps.,It took building a whole bunchnof systems to get it right,,but once we did, we were able to cutnour carbon footprint nearly in half.,Tony in Chicago has been taking onngrowing experiments,,like lots of other window farmers,,and he's been able to getnhis strawberries to fruit,for nine months of the yearnin low-light conditions,by simply changing outnthe organic nutrients.,And window farmers in Finlandnhave been customizing their window farms,for the dark days of the Finnish winters,by outfitting them with LED grow lights,that they're now makingnopen source and part of the project. 
 So window farms have been evolving,through a rapid versioning processnsimilar to software.,And with every open source project,,the real benefit is the interplay,between the specific concernsnof people customizing their systems,for their own particular concerns,,and the universal concerns.,So my core team and I,are able to concentratenon the improvements,that really benefit everyone.,And we're able to look outnfor the needs of newcomers. 
 So for do-it-yourselfers,,we provide free,nvery well-tested instructions,so that anyone, anywhere around the world,,can build one of these systems for free.,And there's a patent pendingnon these systems as well,that's held by the community.,And to fund the project,,we partner to create products,that we then sellnto schools and to individuals,who don't have timento build their own systems. 
 Now within our community,na certain culture has appeared.,In our culture,nit is better to be a tester,who supports someone else's idea,than it is to be just the idea guy.,What we get out of this projectnis support for our own work,,as well as an experiencenof actually contributing,to the environmental movement,in a way other than justnscrewing in new light bulbs.,But I think that Eleen expresses best,what we really get out of this,,which is the actual joy of collaboration.,So she expresses here what it's like,to see someone halfway across the world,having taken your idea, built upon it,and then acknowledgingnyou for contributing.,If we really want to seenthe kind of wide consumer behavior change,that we're all talking aboutnas environmentalists and food people,,maybe we just neednto ditch the term "consumer",and get behind the peoplenwho are doing stuff. 
 Open source projectsntend to have a momentum of their own.,And what we're seeing is that R&D-I-Y,has moved beyondnjust window farms and LEDs,into solar panels and aquaponic systems.,And we're building upon innovationsnof generations who went before us.,And we're looking ahead at generations,who really need usnto retool our lives now.,So we ask that you join us,in rediscovering the valuenof citizens united,,and to declarenthat we are all still pioneers. 
 (Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.,I would love to share with you a story. 
 Once upon a time,in 19th century Germany,,there was the book.,Now during this time,,the book was the king of storytelling.,It was venerable.,It was ubiquitous.,But it was a little bit boring.,Because in its 400 years of existence,,storytellers never evolved the book,as a storytelling device.,But then one author arrived,,and he changed the game forever.,(Music),His name was Lothar,,Lothar Meggendorfer.,Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,,and he said, "Genug ist genug!",He grabbed his pen,,he snatched his scissors.,This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy,and just decided to fold.,History would know Lothar Meggendorfer,as -- who else? --,the world's first true inventor,of the children's pop-up book.,(Music),For this delight and for this wonder,,people rejoiced.,(Cheering),They were happy because the story survived,,and that the world would keep on spinning. 
 Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first,to evolve the way a story was told,,and he certainly wasn't the last.,Whether storytellers realized it or not,,they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit,when they moved opera to vaudville,,radio news to radio theater,,film to film in motion,to film in sound, color, 3D,,on VHS and on DVD.,There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis. 
 And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.,(Laughter),Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,,but they could do so,using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.,For example, one company,would tell a story of love,through its very own search engine.,One Taiwanese production studio,would interpret American politics in 3D.,(Laughter),And one man would tell the stories of his father,by using a platform called Twitter,to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. 
 And after all this, everyone paused;,they took a step back.,They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,,they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls,to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.,And this was a cause for celebration.,The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.,And for the most part, the stories are recycled.,But the way that humans tell the stories,has always evolved,with pure, consistent novelty. 
 And they remembered a man,,one amazing German,,every time a new storytelling device,popped up next.,And for that,,the audience --,the lovely, beautiful audience --,would live happily ever after.,(Applause)My name is Joshua Walters.,I'm a performer. 
 (Beatboxing) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But as far as being a performer,,I'm also diagnosed,bipolar.,I reframe that as a positive,because the crazier I get onstage,,the more entertaining I become.,When I was 16 in San Francisco,,I had my breakthrough manic episode,in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.,Maybe you thought that was scary,,but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take,that can get you as high,as if you think you're Jesus Christ. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was sent to a place,,a psych ward,,and in the psych ward,,everyone is doing their own one-man show.,(Laughter),There's no audience like this,to justify their rehearsal time.,They're just practicing.,One day they'll get here.,Now when I got out,,I was diagnosed,and I was given medications,by a psychiatrist.,"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some --,why don't we give you some Zyprexa.,Okay? Mmhmm?,At least that's what it says on my pen.",(Laughter),Some of you are in the field, I can see.,I can feel your noise.,The first half of high school,was the struggle of the manic episode,,and the second half,was the overmedications of these drugs,,where I was sleeping through high school.,The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.,When I got out,I had a choice.,I could either deny,my mental illness,or embrace,my mental skillness. 
 (Bugle sound) 
 There's a movement going on right now,to reframe mental illness as a positive --,at least the hypomanic edge part of it.,Now if you don't know what hypomania is,,it's like an engine that's out of control,,maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.,Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,,have that creative edge,,if you know what I'm talking about.,You're driven to do something,that everyone has told you is impossible. 
 And there's a book -- John Gartner.,John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge",in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs,and all these business minds,have this edge to compete.,A different book was written not too long ago,in the mid-90s,called "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison,in which it was looked at in a creative sense,in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh,all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.,Some of them committed suicide.,So it wasn't all,the good side of the illness. 
 Now recently,,there's been development in this field.,And there was an article written in the New York Times,,September 2010,,that stated:,"Just Manic Enough.",Just be manic enough,in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs,that have this kind of spectrum --,you know what I'm talking about --,not maybe full bipolar,,but they're in the bipolar spectrum --,where on one side,,maybe you think you're Jesus,,and on the other side,maybe they just make you a lot of money.,(Laughter),Your call. Your call.,And everyone's somewhere in the middle.,Everyone's somewhere in the middle. 
 So maybe, you know,,there's no such thing,as crazy,,and being diagnosed with a mental illness,doesn't mean you're crazy.,But maybe it just means,you're more sensitive,to what most people can't see,or feel.,Maybe no one's really crazy.,Everyone is just a little bit mad.,How much,depends on where you fall in the spectrum.,How much,depends on how lucky you are. 
 Thank you.

 (Applause)I moved to Bostonn10 years ago from Chicago,,with an interest in cancernand in chemistry.,You might know that chemistrynis the science of making molecules,or, to my taste,,new drugs for cancer.,And you might also know that,nfor science and medicine,,Boston is a bit of a candy store.,You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridgenwithout hitting a graduate student.,The bar is called the Miracle of Science.,The billboards say "Lab Space Available." 
 And it's fair to saynthat in these 10 years,,we've witnessed absolutely the startnof a scientific revolution --,that of genome medicine.,We know more about the patientsnthat enter our clinic now,than ever before.,And we're able, finally,nto answer the question,that's been so pressing for so many years:,Why do I have cancer?,This informationnis also pretty staggering.,You might know that, so far,nin just the dawn of this revolution,,we know that there are perhapsn40,000 unique mutations,affecting more than 10,000 genes,,and that there are 500 of these genesnthat are bona-fide drivers,,causes of cancer. 
 Yet comparatively,,we have about a dozenntargeted medications.,And this inadequacy of cancer medicine,really hit home when my fathernwas diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.,We didn't fly him to Boston.,We didn't sequence his genome.,It's been known for decadesnwhat causes this malignancy.,It's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.,This is old informationnwe've known since about the 80s,,yet there's no medicine I can prescribe,to a patient with thisnor any of the numerous solid tumors,caused by these three ...,Horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.,There's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug. 
 And you might fairly ask: Why is that?,And the very unsatisfyingnyet scientific answer is:,it's too hard.,That for whatever reason,,these three proteins have enteredna space, in the language of our field,,that's called the undruggable genome --,which is like callingna computer unsurfable,or the Moon unwalkable.,It's a horrible term of trade.,But what it means,is that we've failed to identifyna greasy pocket in these proteins,,into which we, like molecular locksmiths,,can fashion an active, small,norganic molecule or drug substance. 
 Now, as I was trainingnin clinical medicine,and hematology and oncologynand stem-cell transplantation,,what we had instead,,cascading through the regulatorynnetwork at the FDA,,were these substances:,arsenic,,thalidomide,,and this chemical derivativenof nitrogen mustard gas.,And this is the 21st century.,And so, I guess you'd say,,dissatisfied with the performancenand quality of these medicines,,I went back to school, in chemistry,,with the idea that perhaps by learningnthe trade of discovery chemistry,and approaching it in the contextnof this brave new world,of the open source,,the crowd source,,the collaborative networknthat we have access to within academia,,that we might more quickly bringnpowerful and targeted therapies,to our patients. 
 And so, please considernthis a work in progress,,but I'd like to tell you today a story,about a very rare cancerncalled midline carcinoma,,about the undruggable protein targetnthat causes this cancer,,called BRD4,,and about a molecule developed at my labnat Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,,called JQ1,,which we affectionately named for Jun Qi,,the chemist that made this molecule.,Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein. 
 You might ask: with all the thingsncancer's trying to do to kill our patient,,how does it remember it's cancer?,When it winds up its genome,,divides into two cells and unwinds again,,why does it not turnninto an eye, into a liver,,as it has all the genesnnecessary to do this?,It remembers that it's cancer.,And the reason is that cancer,nlike every cell in the body,,places little molecular bookmarks,,little Post-it notes,,that remind the cell, "I'm cancer;nI should keep growing.",And those Post-it notes involve thisnand other proteins of its class --,so-called bromodomains.,So we developed an idea, a rationale,,that perhaps if we made a molecule,that preventednthe Post-it note from sticking,by entering into the little pocket,at the base of this spinning protein,,then maybe we could convince cancer cells,,certainly those addictednto this BRD4 protein,,that they're not cancer. 
 And so we started to work on this problem.,We developed libraries of compounds,and eventually arrivednat this and similar substances,called JQ1.,Now, not being a drug company,,we could do certain things,nwe had certain flexibilities,,that I respect that a pharmaceuticalnindustry doesn't have.,We just started mailing it to our friends.,I have a small lab.,We thought we'd just send it to peoplenand see how the molecule behaves.,We sent it to Oxford, England,,where a group of talentedncrystallographers provided this picture,,which helped us understand exactlynhow this molecule is so potent,for this protein target.,It's what we call a perfect fitnof shape complementarity,,or hand in glove. 
 Now, this is a very rare cancer,,this BRD4-addicted cancer.,And so we worked with samples of material,that were collected by young pathologistsnat Brigham and Women's Hospital.,And as we treated these cellsnwith this molecule,,we observed something really striking.,The cancer cells --,small, round and rapidly dividing,,grew these arms and extensions.,They were changing shape.,In effect,,the cancer cellnwas forgetting it was cancer,and becoming a normal cell. 
 This got us very excited.,The next step would be to putnthis molecule into mice.,The only problem was there's nonmouse model of this rare cancer.,And so at the timenwe were doing this research,,I was caring for a 29-year-oldnfirefighter from Connecticut,who was very much at the end of life,with this incurable cancer.,This BRD4-addicted cancernwas growing throughout his left lung.,And he had a chest tube innthat was draining little bits of debris.,And every nursing shift,nwe would throw this material out.,And so we approached this patient,and asked if he would collaborate with us.,Could we take this preciousnand rare cancerous material,from this chest tube,and drive it across townnand put it into mice,and try to do a clinical trialnat a stage that with a prototype drug,,well, that would be, of course, impossible,and, rightly, illegal to do in humans.,And he obliged us.,At the Lurie Family Centernfor Animal Imaging,,our colleague, Andrew Kung,ngrew this cancer successfully in mice,without ever touching plastic. 
 And you can see this PET scannof a mouse -- what we call a pet PET.,The cancer is growing,as this red, huge massnin the hind limb of this animal.,And as we treat it with our compound,,this addiction to sugar,,this rapid growth, faded.,And on the animal on the right,,you see that the cancer was responding.,We've completed, now, clinical trials,in four mouse models of this disease.,And every time, we see the same thing.,The mice with this cancernthat get the drug live,,and the ones that don't rapidly perish. 
 So we started to wonder,,what would a drug companyndo at this point?,Well, they probablynwould keep this a secret,until they turn the prototype drug,into an active pharmaceutical substance.,So we did just the opposite.,We published a papernthat described this finding,at the earliest prototype stage.,We gave the world the chemicalnidentity of this molecule,,typically a secret in our discipline.,We told people exactly how to make it.,We gave them our email address,,suggesting that if they write us,,we'll send them a free molecule. 
 (Laughter) 
 We basically tried to createnthe most competitive environment,for our lab as possible.,And this was, unfortunately, successful. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because now, we've shared this molecule,,just since December of last year,,with 40 laboratories in the United States,and 30 more in Europe --,many of them pharmaceutical companies,,seeking now to enter this space,,to target this rare cancernthat, thankfully right now,,is quite desirablento study in that industry.,But the science that's coming backnfrom all of these laboratories,about the use of this molecule,has provided us insightsnwe might not have had on our own.,Leukemia cells treated with this compound,turn into normal white blood cells.,Mice with multiple myeloma,,an incurable malignancynof the bone marrow,,respond dramatically,to the treatment with this drug.,You might know that fat has memory.,I'll nicely demonstrate that for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, this molecule,prevents this adipocyte,nthis fat stem cell,,from remembering how to make fat,,such that mice on a high-fat diet,,like the folksnin my hometown of Chicago -- 
 (Laughter) 
 fail to develop fatty liver,,which is a major medical problem. 
 What this research taught us --,not just my lab, but our institute,,and Harvard Medical Schoolnmore generally --,is that we have uniquenresources in academia,for drug discovery;,that our center, which has testednperhaps more cancer molecules,in a scientific way,than any other,,never made one of its own.,For all the reasons you see listed here,,we think there's a greatnopportunity for academic centers,to participate in this earliest,nconceptually tricky,and creative discipline,of prototype drug discovery. 
 So what next?,We have this molecule,nbut it's not a pill yet.,It's not orally bioavailable.,We need to fix it so we canndeliver it to our patients.,And everyone in the lab,,especially following the interactionnwith these patients,,feels quite compellednto deliver a drug substance,based on this molecule.,It's here where I'd say,that we could use your helpnand your insights,,your collaborative participation.,Unlike a drug company,nwe don't have a pipeline,that we can deposit these molecules into.,We don't have a teamnof salespeople and marketeers,to tell us how to positionnthis drug against the other.,What we do have is the flexibilitynof an academic center,to work with competent, motivated,,enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people,to carry these moleculesnforward into the clinic,while preserving our abilitynto share the prototype drug worldwide. 
 This molecule will soon leave our benches,and go into a small start-up companyncalled Tensha Therapeutics.,And, really, this is the fourthnof these molecules,to kind of "graduate"nfrom our little pipeline,of drug discovery,,two of which -- a topical drugnfor lymphoma of the skin,and an oral substance for the treatmentnof multiple myeloma --,will actually come to the bedsidenfor the first clinical trial,in July of this year -- for us,na major and exciting milestone.,I want to leave you with just two ideas.,The first is: if anything is uniquenabout this research,,it's less the science than the strategy.,This, for us, was a social experiment --,an experiment in "What would happennif we were as open and honest,at the earliest phasenof discovery chemistry research,as we could be?" 
 This string of letters and numbers,and symbols and parentheses,that can be texted, I suppose,,or Twittered worldwide,,is the chemical identitynof our pro compound.,It's the information that we most neednfrom pharmaceutical companies,,the information on how these earlynprototype drugs might work.,Yet this information is largely a secret.,And so we seek, really, to download,from the amazing successesnof the computer-science industry,,two principles -- that of open sourcenand that of crowdsourcing --,to quickly, responsibly acceleratenthe delivery of targeted therapeutics,to patients with cancer. 
 Now, the business modelninvolves all of you.,This research is funded by the public.,It's funded by foundations.,And one thing I've learned in Boston,is that you people will do anythingnfor cancer, and I love that.,You bike across the state,nyou walk up and down the river. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've never seen, really, anywhere,,this unique support for cancer research.,And so I want to thank you,for your participation, your collaboration,and most of all,,for your confidence in our ideas. 
 (Applause)What I'm going to show younare the astonishing molecular machines,that create the livingnfabric of your body.,Now molecules are really, really tiny.,And by tiny, I mean really.,They're smallernthan a wavelength of light,,so we have no waynto directly observe them.,But through science,nwe do have a fairly good idea,of what's going onndown at the molecular scale.,So what we can do is actuallyntell you about the molecules,,but we don't really have a direct waynof showing you the molecules. 
 One way around this is to draw pictures.,And this idea is actually nothing new.,Scientists have always created pictures,as part of their thinkingnand discovery process.,They draw picturesnof what they're observing with their eyes,,through technologynlike telescopes and microscopes,,and also what they're thinkingnabout in their minds.,I picked two well-known examples,,because they're very well-knownnfor expressing science through art. 
 And I start with Galileo,nwho used the world's first telescope,to look at the Moon.,And he transformednour understanding of the Moon.,The perception in the 17th century,was the Moon was a perfectnheavenly sphere.,But what Galileo sawnwas a rocky, barren world,,which he expressednthrough his watercolor painting. 
 Another scientist with very big ideas,,the superstar of biologynis Charles Darwin.,And with this famous entrynin his notebook,,he begins in the top left-handncorner with, "I think,",and then sketches outnthe first tree of life,,which is his perceptionnof how all the species,,all living things on Earth are connectednthrough evolutionary history --,the origin of speciesnthrough natural selection,and divergencenfrom an ancestral population. 
 Even as a scientist,,I used to go to lecturesnby molecular biologists,and find them completely incomprehensible,,with all the fancy technicalnlanguage and jargon,that they would usenin describing their work,,until I encounterednthe artworks of David Goodsell,,who is a molecular biologistnat the Scripps Institute.,And his pictures -- everything's accuratenand it's all to scale.,And his work illuminated for me,what the molecular worldninside us is like. 
 So this is a transection through blood.,In the top left-hand corner,nyou've got this yellow-green area.,The yellow-green area is the fluidnof blood, which is mostly water,,but it's also antibodies, sugars,nhormones, that kind of thing.,And the red region is a sliceninto a red blood cell.,And those red molecules are hemoglobin.,They are actually red;nthat's what gives blood its color.,And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge,to soak up the oxygen in your lungs,and then carry itnto other parts of the body. 
 I was very much inspirednby this image many years ago,,and I wondered whethernwe could use computer graphics,to represent the molecular world.,What would it look like?,And that's how I really began.,So let's begin. 
 This is DNA in its classicndouble helix form.,And it's from X-ray crystallography,nso it's an accurate model of DNA.,If we unwind the double helixnand unzip the two strands,,you see these things that look like teeth.,Those are the letters of genetic code,,the 25,000 genesnyou've got written in your DNA.,This is what they typically talk about --nthe genetic code --,this is what they're talking about.,But I want to talk aboutna different aspect of DNA science,,and that is the physical nature of DNA.,It's these two strandsnthat run in opposite directions,for reasons I can't go into right now.,But they physically runnin opposite directions,,which creates a number of complicationsnfor your living cells,,as you're about to see,,most particularlynwhen DNA is being copied. 
 And so what I'm about to show you,is an accurate representationnof the actual DNA replication machine,that's occurring right nowninside your body,,at least 2002 biology.,So DNA's entering the production linenfrom the left-hand side,,and it hits this collection,nthese miniature biochemical machines,,that are pulling apart the DNA strandnand making an exact copy.,So DNA comes in and hits this blue,ndoughnut-shaped structure,and it's ripped apartninto its two strands.,One strand can be copied directly,,and you can see these thingsnspooling off to the bottom there.,But things aren't so simplenfor the other strand,because it must be copied backwards.,So it's thrown outnrepeatedly in these loops,and copied one section at a time,ncreating two new DNA molecules. 
 Now you have billions of this machinenright now working away inside you,,copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.,It's an accurate representation,,and it's pretty much at the correct speednfor what is occurring inside you.,I've left out error correctionnand a bunch of other things. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was work from a number of years ago--,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 This is work from a number of years ago,,but what I'll show you nextnis updated science,,it's updated technology.,So again, we begin with DNA.,And it's jiggling and wiggling there,because of the surroundingnsoup of molecules,,which I've stripped awaynso you can see something.,DNA is about two nanometers across,nwhich is really quite tiny.,But in each one of your cells,,each strand of DNA is aboutn30 to 40 million nanometers long.,So to keep the DNA organizednand regulate access to the genetic code,,it's wrapped around thesenpurple proteins --,or I've labeled them purple here.,It's packaged up and bundled up.,All this field of viewnis a single strand of DNA.,This huge package of DNAnis called a chromosome.,And we'll come backnto chromosomes in a minute. 
 We're pulling out, we're zooming out,,out through a nuclear pore,,which is the gateway to this compartmentnthat holds all the DNA,,called the nucleus.,All of this field of viewnis about a semester's worth of biology,,and I've got seven minutes,,So we're not going to benable to do that today?,No, I'm being told, "No." 
 This is the way a living cellnlooks down a light microscope.,And it's been filmed under time-lapse,nwhich is why you can see it moving.,The nuclear envelope breaks down.,These sausage-shaped thingsnare the chromosomes,,and we'll focus on them.,They go through this very striking motionnthat is focused on these little red spots.,When the cell feels it's ready to go,nit rips apart the chromosome.,One set of DNA goes to one side,,the other side getsnthe other set of DNA --,identical copies of DNA.,And then the cell splits down the middle.,And again, you have billions of cellsnundergoing this process,right now inside of you. 
 Now we're going to rewindnand just focus on the chromosomes,,and look at its structure and describe it.,So again, here we arenat that equator moment.,The chromosomes line up.,And if we isolate just one chromosome,,we're going to pull it outnand have a look at its structure.,So this is one of the biggestnmolecular structures that you have,,at least as far as we've discoverednso far inside of us.,So this is a single chromosome.,And you have two strands of DNAnin each chromosome.,One is bundled up into one sausage.,The other strand is bundled upninto the other sausage. 
 These things that look like whiskersnthat are sticking out from either side,are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.,They're called microtubules,nthat name's not important.,But we're going to focus onnthe region labeled red here --,and it's the interface betweennthe dynamic scaffolding,and the chromosomes.,It is obviously centralnto the movement of the chromosomes.,We have no idea, really,nas to how it's achieving that movement. 
 We've been studying this thingnthey call the kinetochore,for over a hundred yearsnwith intense study,,and we're still just beginningnto discover what it's about.,It is made up of aboutn200 different types of proteins,,thousands of proteins in total.,It is a signal broadcasting system.,It broadcasts through chemical signals,,telling the rest of the cellnwhen it's ready,,when it feels that everythingnis aligned and ready to go,for the separation of the chromosomes.,It is able to couple onto the growingnand shrinking microtubules. 
 It's involved with the growingnof the microtubules,,and it's able to transientlyncouple onto them.,It's also an attention-sensing system.,It's able to feel when the cell is ready,,when the chromosomenis correctly positioned.,It's turning green here because it feelsnthat everything is just right.,And you'll see,nthere's this one little last bit,that's still remaining red.,And it's walked awayndown the microtubules.,That is the signal broadcasting systemnsending out the stop signal.,And it's walked away --nI mean, it's that mechanical.,It's molecular clockwork. 
 This is how you worknat the molecular scale.,So with a little bitnof molecular eye candy, 
 (Laughter) 
 we've got kinesins, the orange ones.,They're little molecular couriernmolecules walking one way.,And here are the dynein,nthey're carrying that broadcasting system.,And they've got their long legs,so they can step aroundnobstacles and so on.,So again, this is all derivednaccurately from the science.,The problem is we can't show itnto you any other way. 
 Exploring at the frontier of science,nat the frontier of human understanding,,is mind-blowing.,Discovering this stuff,is certainly a pleasurablenincentive to work in science.,But most medical researchers --,discovering the stuff is simply stepsnalong the path to the big goals,,which are to eradicate disease,nto eliminate the suffering,and the misery that disease causes,and to lift people out of poverty. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I graduated UCLA, I moved to northern California,,and I lived in a little town called Elk,on the Mendocino coast,,and I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had U.S. mail,,and life was good back then, if you could remember it.,I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee,and a brownie, and I'd ship my film,to San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later,,it would end up on my front door,,which was way better than having to fight the traffic,of Hollywood. (Music),I didn't have much money,,but I had time and a sense of wonder. (Music) 
 So I started shooting time-lapse photography.,It would take me a month to shoot a four-minute,roll of film, because that's all I could afford. 
 I've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously,,non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,,for over 30 years, and to see them move,is a dance I'll never get tired of.,Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.,It also provides a third of the food we eat.,(Music),Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival,,because we protect what we fall in love with.,It opens our hearts, and makes us realize,we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it.,When we see ourselves in nature, it also connects us,to every one of us, because it's clear,that it's all connected in one. 
 When people see my images, a lot of times they'll say,,"Oh my God." Have you ever wondered what that meant?,The "oh" means it caught your attention,,makes you present, makes you mindful.,The "my" means it connects with something deep,inside your soul.,It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up,and be heard. And "God"?,God is that personal journey we all want to be on,,to be inspired, to feel like we're connected to a universe,that celebrates life. 
 Did you know that 80 percent,of the information we receive comes through our eyes?,And if you compare light energy to musical scales,,it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see,,which is right in the middle?,And aren't we grateful for our brains that can, you know,,take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy,to create images in order for us to explore our world?,And aren't we grateful that we have hearts,that can feel these vibrations,in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure,and the beauty of nature?,(Music) 
 Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates,appreciation and gratitude.,(Music),So I have a gift I want to share with you today,,a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed,,and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective,from the point of view of a child and an elderly man,of that world. 
 Child: When I watch TV,,it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend,,and when you explore, you get,more imagination than you already had,,and when you get more imagination,,it makes you want to go deeper in,so you can get more and see beautifuller things,,like the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach,,or something, and it could be beautiful.,(Music) 
 Elderly Man: You think this is just another day in your life?,It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you,today.,It's given to you. It's a gift.,It's the only gift that you have right now,,and the only appropriate response,is gratefulness.,If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response,to the great gift that this unique day is,,if you learn to respond,as if it were the first day in your life,and the very last day,,then you will have spent this day very well. 
 Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised,that you have eyes you can open,,that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us,for pure enjoyment.,Look at the sky.,We so rarely look at the sky.,We so rarely note how different it is,from moment to moment, with clouds coming and going.,We just think of the weather,,and even with the weather, we don't think of,all the many nuances of weather.,We just think of good weather and bad weather.,This day, right now, has unique weather,,maybe a kind that will never exactly,in that form come again.,That formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same,as it is right now.,Open your eyes. Look at that. 
 Look at the faces of people whom you meet.,Each one has an incredible story behind their face,,a story that you could never fully fathom,,not only their own story, but the story of their ancestors.,We all go back so far,,and in this present moment, on this day,,all the people you meet, all that life from generations,and from so many places all over the world,flows together and meets you here,like a life-giving water, if you only open your heart and drink.,(Music) 
 Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization,gives to us.,You flip a switch and there is electric light.,You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water,,and drinkable water.,It's a gift that millions and millions in the world,will never experience. 
 So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts,to which we can open your heart.,And so I wish you that you will open your heart,to all these blessings, and let them flow through you,,that everyone whom you will meet on this day,will be blessed by you,,just by your eyes,,by your smile,,by your touch,,just by your presence.,Let the gratefulness overflow,into blessing all around you,,and then it will really be a good day. (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you.,Thank you very much. (Applause)For as long as I can remember,,I have felt a very deep connectionnto animals and to the ocean.,And at this age, my personal idolnwas Flipper the dolphin.,And when I first learnednabout endangered species,,I was truly distressed to knownthat every day,,animals were being wipednoff the face of this Earth forever.,And I wanted to do something to help,nbut I always wondered:,What could one person possibly donto make a difference?,And it would be 30 years,,but I would eventually getnthe answer to that question. 
 When these heartbreakingnimages of oiled birds,finally began to emergenfrom the Gulf of Mexico last year,during the horrific BP oil spill,,a German biologist by the namenof Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying,,"We should just euthanize all oiled birds,,because studies have shown,that fewer than one percent of themnsurvive after being released.",And I could not disagree more.,In addition,,I believe that every oiled animalndeserves a second chance at life.,And I want to tell you whynI feel so strongly about this. 
 On June 23, 2000,,a ship named the Treasure sanknoff the coast of Cape Town, South Africa,,spilling 1,300 tons of fuel,,which polluted the habitatsnof nearly half the entire world population,of African penguins.,Now, the ship sanknbetween Robben Island to the south,,and Dassen Island to the north --,two of the penguins' mainnbreeding islands.,And exactly six yearsnand three days earlier,,on June 20, 1994,,a ship named the Apollo Seansank near Dassen Island,,oiling 10,000 penguins,nhalf of which died. 
 Now when the Treasure sank in 2000,,it was the heightnof the best breeding season,scientists had ever recordednfor the African penguin,,which at the time, was listednas a threatened species.,And soon, nearly 20,000 penguins,were covered with this toxic oil.,The local seabird rescuencenter, named SANCCOB,,immediately launchedna massive rescue operation,,and this soon would becomenthe largest animal rescue ever undertaken. 
 At the time, I was workingndown the street.,I was a penguin aquaristnat the New England Aquarium.,And exactly 11 years ago yesterday,,the phone rang in the penguin office.,And with that call,nmy life would change forever.,It was Estelle van Der Merwencalling from SANCCOB,,saying, "Please come help.,We have thousands of oiled penguins,and thousands of willingnbut completely inexperienced volunteers.,And we need penguin expertsnto come train and supervise them.",So two days later,,I was on a plane headed for Cape Town,with a team of penguin specialists. 
 And the scene inside of this buildingnwas devastating and surreal.,In fact, many peoplencompared it to a war zone.,Last week, a 10-year-old girl asked me:,"What did it feel likenwhen you first walked into that building,and saw so many oiled penguins?",And this is what happened.,I was instantly transportednback to that moment in time.,Penguins are very vocal birdsnand really, really noisy,,so I expected to walk into this building,and be met with this cacophonynof honking and braying and squawking.,But instead,,when we stepped throughnthose doors and into the building,,it was eerily silent.,So it was very clear,these were stressed,nsick, traumatized birds. 
 The other thing that was so striking,was the sheer number of volunteers.,Up to 1,000 people a dayncame to the rescue center.,Eventually, over the coursenof this rescue,,more than 12-and-a-halfnthousand volunteers,came from all over the world to Cape Town,,to help save these birds.,And the amazing thingnwas that not one of them had to be there.,Yet they were.,So for the few of us that were therenin a professional capacity,,this extraordinary volunteer responsento this animal crisis,was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring. 
 So the day after we arrived,,two of us from the aquariumnwere put in charge of room two.,Room two had morenthan 4,000 oiled penguins in it.,Now, mind you --,three days earlier,nwe had 60 penguins under our care,,so we were definitely overwhelmed,and just a bit terrified --nat least I was.,Personally, I really didn't know,if I was capable of handlingnsuch a monstrous task.,And collectively,,we really didn't knownif we could pull this off.,Because we all knewnthat just six years earlier,,half as many penguinsnhad been oiled and rescued,,and only half of them had survived.,So would it be humanly possiblento save this many oiled penguins?,We just did not know. 
 But what gave us hope,were these incredibly dedicatednand brave volunteers,,three of whom herenare force-feeding penguins.,You may notice they're wearingnvery thick gloves.,And what you should knownabout African penguins,is that they have razor-sharp beaks.,And before long,,our bodies were covered head to toe,with these nasty woundsninflicted by the terrified penguins. 
 Now the day after we arrived,na new crisis began to unfold.,The oil slick was now movingnnorth towards Dassen Island,,and the rescuers despaired,,because they knew if the oil hit,,it would not be possiblento rescue any more oiled birds.,And there really were no good solutions.,But then finally,,one of the researchersnthrew out this crazy idea.,He said, "OK, why don't we trynand collect the birds,at the greatest risk of getting oiled" --,they collected 20,000 --,"and we'll ship them 500 milesnup the coast to Port Elizabeth,in these open-air trucks,,and release themninto the clean waters there,and let them swim back home?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So three of those penguins --nPeter, Pamela and Percy --,wore satellite tags,,and the researchers crossed their fingers,and hoped that by the timenthey got back home,,the oil would be cleaned upnfrom their islands.,And luckily, the day they arrived, it was.,So it had been a huge gamble,nbut it had paid off.,And so they know nownthat they can use this strategy,in future oil spills. 
 So in wildlife rescue as in life,,we learn from each previous experience,,and we learn from bothnour successes and our failures.,And the main thing learnednduring the Apollo Sea rescue in '94,was that most of those penguinsnhad died due to the unwitting use,of poorly ventilatedntransport boxes and trucks,,because they just had not been prepared,to deal with so manynoiled penguins at once.,So in these six yearsnbetween these two oil spills,,they've built thousandsnof these well-ventilated boxes.,And as a result,nduring the Treasure rescue,,just 160 penguins diednduring the transport process,,as opposed to 5,000.,So this alone was a huge victory. 
 Something else learnednduring the Apollo rescue,was how to train the penguins,to take fish freely from their hands,,using these training boxes.,And we used this technique againnduring the Treasure rescue.,But an interesting thing was notednduring the training process.,The first penguins to makenthat transition to free feeding,were the ones that hadna metal band on their wing,from the Apollo Sea spillnsix years earlier.,So penguins learnnfrom previous experience, too. 
 So all of those penguins had to haventhe oil meticulously cleaned,from their bodies.,It would take two people at least an hournjust to clean one penguin.,When you clean a penguin,,you first have to spray itnwith a degreaser.,And this brings me to my favorite storynfrom the Treasure rescue.,About a year prior to this oil spill,,a 17-year-old studentnhad invented a degreaser.,And they'd been using itnat SANCCOB with great success,,so they began using itnduring the Treasure rescue.,But partway through, they ran out.,So in a panic, Estellenfrom SANCCOB called the student,and said, "Please, you have to make more!",So he raced to the lab,and made enough to cleannthe rest of the birds.,So I just think it is the coolest thing,that a teenager invented a product,that helped save the livesnof thousands of animals. 
 So what happenednto those 20,000 oiled penguins?,And was Silvia Gaus right?,Should we routinely euthanizenall oiled birds,because most of themnare going to die anyway?,Well, she could not be more wrong.,After half a million hoursnof grueling volunteer labor,,more than 90 percentnof those oiled penguins,were successfully returned to the wild.,And we know from follow-up studies,that they have lived just as longnas never-oiled penguins,,and bred nearly as successfully. 
 And in addition,,about 3,000 penguin chicksnwere rescued and hand raised.,And again, we knownfrom long-term monitoring,that more of these hand-raised chicksnsurvive to adulthood and breeding age,than do parent-raised chicks.,Armed with this knowledge,nSANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project,,and every year, they rescuenand raise abandoned chicks,,and they have a very impressive,n80 percent success rate.,This is critically important,,because one year ago,,the African penguinnwas declared endangered.,And they could be extinctnin less than 10 years,if we don't do somethingnnow to protect them. 
 So what did I learn,from this intensenand unforgettable experience?,Personally, I learned that I am capablenof handling so much more,than I ever dreamed possible.,And I learned that one personncan make a huge difference.,Just look at that 17-year-old.,And when we come together and work as one,,we can achieve extraordinary things.,And truly, to be a part of somethingnso much larger than yourself,is the most rewarding experiencenyou can possibly have. 
 So I'd like to leave younwith one final thought,and a challenge, if you will.,My mission as The Penguin Ladynis to raise awareness and funding,to protect penguins.,But why should any of youncare about penguins?,Well, you should carenbecause they're an indicator species.,And simply put: if penguins are dying,nit means our oceans are dying.,And we ultimately will be affected,,because, as Sylvia Earle says,,"The oceans are our life-support system.",And the two main threats to penguins today,are overfishing and global warming.,And these are two things,that each one of us actually hasnthe power to do something about.,So if we each do our part, together,nwe can make a difference,,and we can help keepnpenguins from going extinct.,Humans have always been the greatestnthreat to penguins,,but we are now their only hope. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to talk to you about,,or share with you, anbreakthrough new approach,for managing items ofninventory inside of a warehouse.,We're talking about a pick,npack and ship setting here. 
 So as a hint,,this solution involvesnhundreds of mobile robots,,sometimes thousandsnof mobile robots,,moving around a warehouse.nAnd I'll get to the solution.,But for a moment, just think,about the last time thatnyou ordered something online.,You were sittingnon your couch,and you decided that younabsolutely had to have this red t-shirt.,So — click! — you put itninto your shopping cart.,And then you decidednthat green pair of pants,looks pretty good too — click!,And maybe a bluenpair of shoes — click!,So at this point you'venassembled your order.,You didn't stop to think nfor a moment that,that might not be a great outfit.,But you hitn"submit order.",And two days later, this packagenshows up on your doorstep.,And you open the box and you'renlike, wow, there's my goo. 
 Did you ever stop to think aboutnhow those items of inventory,actually found their way insidenthat box in the warehouse?,So I'm here to tell you nit's that guy right there.,So deep in thenmiddle of that picture,,you see a classicnpick-pack worker,in a distribution ornorder fulfillments setting.,Classically these pick workers will nspend 60 or 70 percent of their day,wandering aroundnthe warehouse.,They'll often walknas much as 5 or 10 miles,in pursuit ofnthose items of inventory.,Not only is this annunproductive way to fill orders,,it also turns out to be annunfulfilling way to fill orders. 
 So let me tell you where Infirst bumped into this problem.,I was out in the Bay area nin '99, 2000, the dot com boom.,I worked for a fabulouslynspectacular flame-out called Webvan.,(Laughter),This company raised hundreds ofnmillions of dollars with the notion that,we will deliverngrocery orders online.,And it really came down to the factnthat we couldn't do it cost effectively.,Turns out e-commerce was somethingnthat was very hard and very costly.,In this particular instance we were tryingnto assemble 30 items of inventory,into a few totes, onto a vannto deliver to the home.,And when you think about it,nit was costing us 30 dollars.,Imagine, we had ann89¢ can of soup,that was costing us one dollar tonpick and pack into that tote.,And that's before we actuallyntried to deliver it to the home. 
 So long story short,nduring my one year at Webvan,,what I realized by talking to nall the material-handling providers,was that there was no solution designednspecifically to solve each base picking.,Red item, green, blue, gettingnthose three things in a box.,So we said, there's justngot to be a better way to do this.,Existing material handlingnwas set up to pump,pallets and cases ofngoo to retail stores. 
 Of course Webvan went out of business,nand about a year and a half later,,I was still noodling on this problem.nIt was still nagging at me.,And I startednthinking about it again.,And I said, let me just focus brieflynon what I wanted as a pick worker,,or my vision fornhow it should work.,(Laughter),I said, let's focusnon the problem.,I have an order here and whatnI want to do is I want to put,red, green and bluenin this box right here.,What I need is a system where I put outnmy hand and — poof! —,the product shows up nand I pack it into the order,,and now we're thinking,,this would be a very operator-centricnapproach to solving the problem.,This is what I need. What technologynis available to solve this problem?,But as you can see, orders can comenand go, products can come and go.,It allows us to focus on making thenpick worker the center of the problem,,and providing them the tools to makenthem as productive as possible. 
 So how did Inarrive at this notion?,Well, actually it came fromna brainstorming exercise,,probably a techniquenthat many of you use,,It's this notion ofntesting your ideas.,Take a blank sheet, of course,,but then test your ideasnat the limits — infinity, zero.,In this particular case, wenchallenged ourselves with the idea:,What if we had to build andistribution center in China,,where it's a very,nvery low-cost market?,And say, labor is cheap,nland is cheap.,And we said specifically,,"What if it was zero dollarsnan hour for direct labor,and we could build a million-nsquare-foot distribution center?",So naturally thatnled to ideas that said,,"Let's put lots of peoplenin the warehouse.",And I said, "Hold on,nzero dollars per hour,,what I would do is 'hire',10,000 workers to come to thenwarehouse every morning at 8 a.m.,,walk into the warehouse andnpick up one item of inventory,and then just stand there.,So you hold Captain Crunch,nyou hold the Mountain Dew,,you hold the Diet Coke.,If I need it, I'll call you,notherwise just stand there.,But when I need Diet Coke and I call it,nyou guys talk amongst yourselves.,Diet Coke walks up to the front —npick it, put it in the tote, away it goes.",Wow, what if the productsncould walk and talk on their own?,That's a very interesting,nvery powerful way,that we could potentiallynorganize this warehouse. 
 So of course,nlabor isn't free,,on that practicalnversus awesome spectrum.,(Laughter),So we said mobile shelving —nWe'll put them on mobile shelving.,We'll use mobile robots andnwe'll move the inventory around.,And so we got underway on that andnthen I'm sitting on my couch in 2008.,Did any of you see the BeijingnOlympics, the opening ceremonies?,I about fell out of myncouch when I saw this.,I'm like, that was the idea!,(Laughter and Applause),We'll put thousands of people onnthe warehouse floor, the stadium floor.,But interestingly enough, thisnactually relates to the idea,in that these guys were creating somenincredibly powerful, impressive digital art,,all without computers,nI'm told,,it was all peer-to-peerncoordination and communication.,You stand up,nI'll squat down.,And they madensome fabulous art.,It speaks to thenpower of emergence,in systems when you let thingsnstart to talk with each other.,So that was a littlenbit of the journey. 
 So of course, now what becamenthe practical reality of this idea?,Here is a warehouse.,It's a pick, pack and ship centernthat has about 10,000 different SKUs.,We'll call them red pens,ngreen pens, yellow Post-It Notes.,We send the little orange robotsnout to pick up the blue shelving pods.,And we deliver themnto the side of the building.,So all the pick workers nownget to stay on the perimeter.,And the game here isnto pick up the shelves,,take them down the highway andndeliver them straight to the pick worker.,This pick worker's lifenis completely different.,Rather than wandering aroundnthe warehouse, she gets to stay still,in a pick station like this,and every product in thenbuilding can now come to her. 
 So the processnis very productive.,Reach in, pick an item,nscan the bar code, pack it out.,By the timenyou turn around,,there's another product therenready to be picked and packed.,So what we've done is takenout all of the non-value added,walking, searching,nwasting, waited time,,and we've developed a very nhigh-fidelity way to pick these orders,,where you point at it withna laser, scan the UPC barcode,,and then indicate with a lightnwhich box it needs to go into.,So more productive, morenaccurate and, it turns out,,it's a more interesting officenenvironment for these pick workers.,They actually completenthe whole order.,So they do red, green and blue,nnot just a part of the order.,And they feel a little bit morenin control of their environment. 
 So the side effectsnof this approach,are what really surprised us.,We knew it was going nto be more productive.,But we didn't realize just hownpervasive this way of thinking,extended to othernfunctions in the warehouse.,But what effectively this approachnis doing inside of the DC,is turning it into a massivelynparallel processing engine.,So this is again ancross-fertilization of ideas.,Here's a warehousenand we're thinking about,parallel processingnsupercomputer architectures.,The notion here is that you have,10 workers on nthe right side of the screen,that are now all independentnautonomous pick workers.,If the worker in station three decidesnto leave and go to the bathroom,,it has no impact on thenproductivity of the other nine workers.,Contrast that, for a moment, with thentraditional method of using a conveyor.,When one personnpasses the order to you,,you put something innand pass it downstream.,Everyone has to be in placenfor that serial process to work.,This becomes a more robustnway to think about the warehouse. 
 And then underneath the hoods getsninteresting in that we're tracking,the popularitynof the products.,And we're using dynamicnand adaptive algorithms,to tune the floornof the warehouse.,So what you see here potentiallynthe week leading up to Valentine's Day.,All that pink chalky candy hasnmoved to the front of the building,and is now being picked into anlot of orders in those pick stations.,Come in two days after Valentine's Day,nand that candy, the leftover candy,,has all drifted to thenback of the warehouse,and is occupying the coolernzone on the thermal map there.,One other side effect of thisnapproach using the parallel processing,is these things cannscale to ginormous.,(Laughter),So whether you're doingntwo pick stations, 20 pick stations,,or 200 pick stations, thenpath planning algorithms,and all of the inventorynalgorithms just work.,In this example younsee that the inventory,has now occupied all thenperimeter of the building,because that's wherenthe pick stations were.,They sorted itnout for themselves. 
 So I'll conclude withnjust one final video,that shows hownthis comes to bear,on the pick worker's actualnday in the life of.,So as we mentioned, the process isnto move inventory along the highway,and then find your wayninto these pick stations.,And our software in the background,understands what's going on nin each station,,we direct the podsnacross the highway,and we're attempting tonget into a queuing system,to present the worknto the pick worker.,What's interesting is we can evennadapt the speed of the pick workers.,The faster pickers get more podsnand the slower pickers get few.,But this pick worker now isnliterally having that experience,that we described before.,She puts out her hand.nThe product jumps into it.,Or she has to reach in and get it.,She scans it and nshe puts it in the bucket.,And all of the rest of the technologynis kind of behind the scenes.,So she gets to now focus on thenpicking and packing portion of her job.,Never has any idle time,nnever has to leave her mat.,And actually we thinknnot only a more productive,and more accuratenway to fill orders.,We think it's a morenfulfilling way to fill orders. 
 The reason we can saynthat, though, is that workers,in a lot of thesenbuildings now compete,for the privilege of workingnin the Kiva zone that day.,And sometimes we'll catchnthem on testimonial videos,saying such things as,,they have more energy after thenday to play with their grandchildren,,or in one case a guy said, "thenKiva zone is so stress-free,that I've actually stopped takingnmy blood pressure medication.",(Laughter),That was at a pharmaceutical distributor,nso they told us not to use that video.,(Laughter) 
 So what I wanted to leave younwith today is the notion that,when you let things startnto think and walk,and talk on their own, interestingnprocesses and productivities can emerge.,And now I think next timenyou go to your front step,and pick up that box thatnyou just ordered online,,you break it open andnthe goo is in there,,you'll have some wondermentnas to whether a robot,assisted in the pickingnand packing of that order. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen,,I present to you the human genome. 
 (Applause) 
 Chromosome one -- top left,nbottom right -- are the sex chromosomes.,Women have two copiesnof that big X chromosome;,men have the X and, of course,nthat small copy of the Y.,Sorry boys, but it's just a tinynlittle thing that makes you different.,So if you zoom in on this genome,,then what you see, of course,nis this double-helix structure --,the code of life spelled outnwith these four biochemical letters,,or we call them bases: A, C, G and T.,How many are therenin the human genome? Three billion.,Is that a big number?,Well, everybodyncan throw around big numbers.,But in fact, if I were to place one base,on each pixel of thisn1280x800-resolution screen,,we would need 3,000 screensnto take a look at the genome.,So it's really quite big. 
 And perhaps because of its size,,a group of people -- all,nby the way, with Y chromosomes --,decided they would want to sequence it. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so 15 years, actually,nand about four billion dollars later,,the genome was sequenced and published.,In 2003, the final version was published,nand they keep working on it.,That was all done on a machine like this.,It costs about a dollar for each base --na very slow way of doing it. 
 Well, folks, I'm here to tell you,that the world has completely changed,,and none of you know about it.,So now what we do is take a genome,,we make maybe 50 copies of it,,we cut all those copies upninto little 50-base reads,,and then we sequence them,nmassively parallel.,Then we bring that into softwarenand reassemble it,,and tell you what the story is.,So to give you a picturenof what this looks like,,the Human Genome Project:n3 gigabases, right?,One run on one of these modern machines:n200 gigabases in a week.,And that 200 is goingnto change to 600 this summer,,and there's no sign of this pace slowing.,The price of a base, to sequence a base,,has fallen 100 million times.,That's the equivalent of you filling upnyour car with gas in 1998,,waiting until 2011,,and now you can drivento Jupiter and back twice. 
 (Laughter) 
 World population,,PC placements,,the archive of all of medical literature,,Moore's law,,the old way of sequencing,,and here's all the new stuff.,Guys, this is a long scale;,you don't typically seenlines that go up like that.,So the worldwide capacitynto sequence human genomes,is something like 50,000 to 100,000nhuman genomes this year.,We know this based on the machinesnthat are being placed.,This is expected to double,ntriple or maybe quadruple,year over year for the foreseeable future.,In fact, there's one lab in particular,that represents 20 percentnof all that capacity:,It's called the BeijingnGenomics Institute.,The Chinese are absolutely winningnthis race to the new Moon, by the way.,What does this mean for medicine? 
 So a woman, age 37,,presents with stage 2 estrogennreceptor-positive breast cancer.,She is treated with surgery,nchemotherapy and radiation.,She goes home.,Two years later,,she comes back with stage 3Cnovarian cancer, unfortunately;,treated again with surgerynand chemotherapy.,She comes back three years later at age 42,with more ovarian cancer,nmore chemotherapy.,Six months later,,she comes backnwith acute myeloid leukemia.,She goes into respiratory failurenand dies eight days later. 
 So first: the way in whichnthis woman was treated,,in as little as 10 years,nwill look like bloodletting.,And it's because of peoplenlike my colleague, Rick Wilson,,at the Genome Institutenat Washington University,,who decided to take a looknat this woman postmortem.,And he took skin cells, healthy skin,and cancerous bone marrow,,and sequenced the wholengenomes of both of them,in a couple of weeks, no big deal.,Then he compared those twongenomes in software,,and what he found, among other things,,was a deletion -- a 2,000-base deletionnacross three billion bases,in a particular gene called TP53.,If you have this deleteriousnmutation in this gene,,you're 90 percent likelynto get cancer in your life. 
 So unfortunately,nthis doesn't help this woman,,but it does have severe --nprofound, if you will --,implications to her family.,I mean, if they have the same mutation,,and they get this genetic testnand they understand it,,then they can get regular screensnand can catch cancer early,,and potentially livena significantly longer life. 
 Let me introduce you to the Beery twins,,diagnosed with cerebral palsynat the age of two.,Their mom is a very brave womannwho didn't believe it;,the symptoms weren't matching up.,And through some heroic effortsnand a lot of Internet searching,,she was able to convincenthe medical community,that, in fact, they had something else.,They had dopa-responsive dystonia.,And so they were given L-Dopa,,and their symptoms did improve,,but they weren't totally asymptomatic.,Significant problems remained. 
 Turns out the gentleman in this picturenis a guy named Joe Beery,,who was lucky enough to be the CIO,of a company called Life Technologies.,They're one of two companies,that makes these massivenwhole-genome sequencing tools.,And so he got his kids sequenced.,What they found was a series of mutationsnin a gene called SPR,,which is responsible for producingnserotonin, among other things.,So on top of L-Dopa, they gaventhese kids a serotonin precursor drug,,and they're effectively normal now.,Guys, this would never have happenednwithout whole-genome sequencing.,At the time -- this wasna few years ago -- it cost $100,000.,Today it's $10,000, next year, $1,000,,the year after, $100, give or take a year.,That's how fast this is moving. 
 So here's little Nick --,likes Batman and squirt guns.,And it turns out Nicknshows up at the children's hospital,with this distended belly,nlike a famine victim.,And it's not that he's not eating;nit's that when he eats,,his intestine basically opens upnand feces spill out into his gut.,So a hundred surgeries later,,he looks at his mom and says,n"Mom, please pray for me.,I'm in so much pain.",His pediatrician happens to havena background in clinical genetics,and he has no idea what's going on,,but he says, "Let's getnthis kid's genome sequenced.",And what they findnis a single-point mutation,in a gene responsible for controllingnprogrammed cell death.,So the theory is that he's havingnsome immunological reaction,to what's going on --nto the food, essentially.,And that's a natural reaction,nwhich causes some programmed cell death,,but the gene that regulatesnthat down is broken.,And so this informs,namong other things, of course,,a treatment for bone marrow transplant,nwhich he undertakes.,And after nine monthsnof grueling recovery,,he's now eating steak with A1 sauce. 
 (Laughter) 
 The prospect of using the genomenas a universal diagnostic,is upon us today.,Today. It's here.,And what it means for all of us,is that everybody in this roomncould live an extra 5, 10, 20 years,,just because of this one thing.,Which is a fantastic story,,unless you think aboutnhumanity's footprint on the planet,,and our ability to keep upnfood production.,So it turns out,that the very same technologynis also being used to grow new lines,of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops,that are highly tolerantnof drought, of flood,,of pests and pesticides.,Now, look --,as long as we continuento increase the population,,we'll have to continue to grow and eatngenetically modified foods.,And that's the only positionnI'll take today.,Unless there's anybody in the audience,who'd like to volunteer to stop eating?,None, not one. 
 This is a typewriter,,a staple of every desktop for decades.,And, in fact, the typewriternwas essentially deleted by this thing.,And then more general versionsnof word processors came about.,But ultimately, it was a disruptionnon top of a disruption.,It was Bob Metcalfeninventing the Ethernet,,and the connection of all these computers,that fundamentally changed everything.,Suddenly we had Netscape, we had Yahoo.,And we had, indeed,nthe entire dot-com bubble. 
 (Laughter) 
 Not to worry though,,that was quickly rescuednby the iPod, Facebook,and, indeed, Angry Birds. 
 (Laughter) 
 Look, this is where we are today.,This is the genomic revolution today.nThis is where we are.,What I'd like you to consider is:,What does it mean,when these dots don't representnthe individual bases of your genome,,but they connect to genomesnall across the planet?,I just recently had to buy life insurance,nand I was required to answer:,A. I have never had a genetic test;,B. I've had one, here you go;,or C. I've had one and I'm not telling.,Thankfully, I was able to answer A,,and I say that honestly, in casenmy life insurance agent is listening.,But what would have happenednif I had said C? 
 Consumer applicationsnfor genomics will flourish.,Do you want to seenif you're genetically compatible,with your girlfriend?,DNA sequencing on your iPhone?nThere's an app for that. 
 (Laughter) 
 Personalized genomic massage, anyone?,There's already a lab today that testsnfor allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,,the so-called cheating gene. 
 (Laughter) 
 So anybody who's here todaynwith your significant other,,just turn over to them,nswab their mouth, send it to the lab,and you'll know for sure. 
 (Laughter) 
 Do you really want to elect a president,whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?,Think of it -- it's 2016,,and the leading candidate releases,not only her four yearsnof back-tax returns,,but also her personal genome.,And it looks really good.,Then she challenges allnher competitors to do the same.,Do you think that's not going to happen?,Do you think it would havenhelped John McCain? 
 (Laughter) 
 How many people in the audiencenhave the last name Resnick, like me?,Raise your hand.,Anybody? Nobody.,Typically, there's one or two.,So my father's fathernwas one of 10 Resnick brothers.,They all hated each other, and all movednto different parts of the planet.,So it's likely I'm relatednto every Resnick that I ever meet,,but I don't know.,So imagine if my genomenwere De-identified, sitting in software,,And a third cousin's genomenwas also sitting there,,and there was softwarenthat could compare the two,and make these associations.,Not hard to imagine. My companynhas software that does this right now.,Imagine one more thing,,that that software is able to asknboth parties for mutual consent:,"Would you be willingnto meet your third cousin?",And if we both say yes -- voilà!,Welcome to Chromosomally LinkedIn. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now this is probably a good thing, right?,Bigger clan gatherings and so on.,But maybe it's a bad thing as well.,How many fathers in the room?nRaise your hands.,OK, so experts thinknthat one to three percent of you,are not actually the father of your child. 
 (Laughter) 
 Look -- 
 (Laughter) 
 These genomes, these 23 chromosomes,,they don't in any way representnthe quality of our relationships,or the nature of our society --nat least not yet.,And like any new technology,,it's really in humanity's hands,to wield it for the betterment of mankind,or not.,And so I urge you allnto wake up and to tune in,and to influence the genomic revolutionnthat's happening all around you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)By the end of this year,,there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet,that actively use social networking sites.,The one thing that all of them have in common,is that they're going to die.,While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,,I think it has some really profound implications,that are worth exploring. 
 What first got me thinking about this,was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,,who was a science and technology journalist,who died of cancer.,And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post,that went out shortly after he died.,Here's what he wrote in starting that out.,He said, "Here it is. I'm dead,,and this is my last post to my blog.,In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down,from the punishments of my cancer,,then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote --,the first part of the process,of turning this from an active website to an archive." 
 Now, while as a journalist,,Miller's archive may have been better written,and more carefully curated than most,,the fact of the matter is that all of us today,are creating an archive,that's something completely different,than anything that's been created,by any previous generation. 
 Consider a few stats for a moment.,Right now there are 48 hours of video,being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.,There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.,And the average Facebook user,is creating 90 pieces of content each month.,So when you think about your parents or your grandparents,,at best they may have created,some photos or home videos,,or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.,But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive,that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,,years after we're gone.,And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities,for technologists. 
 Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,,so what I'd like to do briefly,is paint a picture,of what the present and the future are going to look like.,Now we're already seeing some services,that are designed to let us decide,what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts,after we die.,One of them actually, fittingly enough,,found me when I checked into a deli,at a restaurant in New York,on foursquare. 
 (Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.,Death: Adam?,AO: Yeah.,Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,,even at the Organic.,AO: Who is this?,Death: Go to ifidie.net,before it's too late. 
 (Laughter) 
 Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?,So what that service does, quite simply,,is let you create a message or a video,that can be posted to Facebook after you die.,Another service right now,is called 1,000 Memories.,And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,,complete with photos and videos and stories,that they can post after you die.,But what I think comes next is far more interesting. 
 Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy,who, back in March,,demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.,I think as machines' ability,to understand human language and process vast amounts of data,continues to improve,,it's going to become possible,to analyze an entire life's worth of content --,the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts --,that we're producing in such massive numbers.,And I think as that happens,,it's going to become possible for our digital personas,to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone,thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating,and technology's ability to make sense of it all. 
 Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.,One service called My Next Tweet,analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,,to make some predictions as to what you might say next.,Well right now, as you can see,,the results can be somewhat comical.,You can imagine what something like this might look like,five, 10 or 20 years from now,as our technical capabilities improve.,Taking it a step further,,MIT's media lab is working on robots,that can interact more like humans.,But what if those robots were able to interact,based on the unique characteristics of a specific person,based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content,that person produces in their lifetime? 
 Finally, think back to this famous scene,from election night 2008,back in the United States,,where CNN beamed a live hologram,of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio,for an interview with Anderson Cooper.,What if we were able to use that same type of technology,to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms --,interacting in a very lifelike way,based on all the content they created while they were alive?,I think that's going to become completely possible,as the amount of data we're producing,and technology's ability to understand it,both expand exponentially.,Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about,is if we want that to become our reality --,and if so,,what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Well we all know the World Wide Web,has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,,commerce and social connectivity,,but where did it all come from?,And I'll quote three people:,Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.,So let's just run through these guys. 
 This is Vannevar Bush.,Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.,And in 1945,,he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.,And the article was called "As We May Think.",And what Vannevar Bush was saying,was the way we use information is broken.,We don't work in terms of libraries,and catalog systems and so forth.,The brain works by association.,With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.,And the way information is structured,is totally incapable of keeping up with this process. 
 And so he suggested a machine,,and he called it the memex.,And the memex would link information,,one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.,Now this was in 1945.,A computer in those days,was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.,And nobody knew anything about it.,So this was before the computer was invented.,And he proposed this machine called the memex.,And he had a platform where you linked information to other information,,and then you could call it up at will. 
 So spinning forward,,one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,,and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.,And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.,And he was so inspired by this article,,it kind of directed the rest of his life.,And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action,when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.,He built a system.,The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.,And in a premonition of today's world,of cloud computing and softwares of service,,his system was called NLS,for oN-Line System. 
 And this is Doug Engelbart.,He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference,in 1968.,What he showed --,he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.,He had his head mic like I've got.,And he works this system.,And you can see, he's working between documents,and graphics and so forth.,And he's driving it all,with this platform here,,with a five-finger keyboard,and the world's first computer mouse,,which he specially designed in order to do this system.,So this is where the mouse came from as well. 
 So this is Doug Engelbart.,The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system,was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.,So for a personal computer,,a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;,it wasn't really very practical. 
 But spin on to the 80s,when personal computers did arrive,,then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.,And my company, OWL,built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.,And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.,And this began to get a head of steam.,Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard,,and they made a bit of a fuss about it.,They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.,The magazines started to cover it.,Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM,had special issues covering hypertext.,We developed a PC version of this product,as well as the Macintosh version.,And our PC version became quite mature. 
 These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.,You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.,We developed a system such,that it had a markup language based on html.,We called it hml: hypertext markup language.,And the system was capable of doing,very, very large documentation systems over computer networks. 
 So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris,in late November 1990.,And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee,who said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah.",And he said, "I need to talk to you.",And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.,And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,,especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.,But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web,would take over the world one day.,And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,,because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;,it was just plain text.,I thought, well, you know, interesting,,but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.,So we didn't do it. 
 In the next couple of years,,the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.,In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.,In 1993,,there was a table at the conference in Seattle,,and a guy called Marc Andreessen,was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.,And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.,And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,,and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker. 
 So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.,There was a guy called Dick Rowe,who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.,There was a guy called Gary Kildall,who went flying his plane,when IBM came looking for an operating system,for the IBM PC,,and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.,And the 12 publishers,who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess. 
 On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen,who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.,And according to Fortune magazine,,he's worth 700 million dollars.,But is he happy? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)We are losing our listening.,We spend roughly 60 percentnof our communication time listening,,but we're not very good at it.,We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.,Now -- not you, not this talk,,but that is generally true. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's define listeningnas making meaning from sound.,It's a mental process,,and it's a process of extraction. 
 We use some pretty coolntechniques to do this.,One of them is pattern recognition.,(Crowd noises) So in a cocktailnparty like this,,if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" --nsome of you just sat up.,We recognize patternsnto distinguish noise from signal,,and especially our name.,Differencing is another technique we use.,If I left this pink noise onnfor more than a couple of minutes,,(Pink noise) you would literallyncease to hear it.,We listen to differences;nwe discount sounds that remain the same. 
 And then there is a wholenrange of filters.,These filters take us from all sound,down to what we pay attention to.,Most people are entirelynunconscious of these filters.,But they actually createnour reality in a way,,because they tell us whatnwe're paying attention to right now.,I'll give you one example of that.,Intention is very importantnin sound, in listening.,When I married my wife,,I promised her I would listennto her every day,as if for the first time.,Now that's somethingnI fall short of on a daily basis. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's a great intentionnto have in a relationship. 
 (Laughter) 
 But that's not all.,Sound places us in space and in time.,If you close your eyesnright now in this room,,you're aware of the size of the room,from the reverberation and the bouncingnof the sound off the surfaces;,you're aware of how manynpeople are around you,,because of the micro-noisesnyou're receiving.,And sound places us in time as well,,because sound always hasntime embedded in it.,In fact, I would suggestnthat our listening is the main way,that we experience the flow of time,from past to future.,So, "Sonority is timenand meaning" -- a great quote. 
 I said at the beginning,nwe're losing our listening.,Why did I say that?,Well, there are a lot of reasons for this.,First of all, we inventednways of recording --,first writing, then audio recordingnand now video recording as well.,The premium on accurate and carefulnlistening has simply disappeared.,Secondly, the world is now so noisy,,(Noise) with this cacophonyngoing on visually and auditorily,,it's just hard to listen;,it's tiring to listen.,Many people take refuge in headphones,,but they turn big,npublic spaces like this,,shared soundscapes,,into millions of tiny,nlittle personal sound bubbles.,In this scenario,nnobody's listening to anybody. 
 We're becoming impatient.,We don't want oratory anymore;nwe want sound bites.,And the art of conversation is beingnreplaced -- dangerously, I think --,by personal broadcasting.,I don't know how much listeningnthere is in this conversation,,which is sadly very common,nespecially in the UK.,We're becoming desensitized.,Our media have to scream at usnwith these kinds of headlines,in order to get our attention.,And that means it's hardernfor us to pay attention,to the quiet, the subtle, the understated. 
 This is a serious problemnthat we're losing our listening.,This is not trivial,,because listening is our accessnto understanding.,Conscious listeningnalways creates understanding,,and only without conscious listening,can these things happen.,A world where we don't listennto each other at all,is a very scary place indeed.,So I'd like to share with younfive simple exercises,,tools you can take away with you,,to improve your own conscious listening.,Would you like that? 
 Audience: Yes! 
 Good. The first one is silence.,Just three minutes a day of silencenis a wonderful exercise,to reset your ears and to recalibrate,,so that you can hear the quiet again.,If you can't get absolute silence,,go for quiet, that's absolutely fine. 
 Second, I call this "the mixer.",(Noise) So even if you'renin a noisy environment like this --,and we all spend a lot of timenin places like this --,listen in the coffee barnto how many channels of sound can I hear?,How many individual channelsnin that mix am I listening to?,You can do it in a beautiful placenas well, like in a lake.,How many birds am I hearing?,Where are they? Where are those ripples?,It's a great exercise for improvingnthe quality of your listening. 
 Third, this exercise I call "savoring,"nand this is a beautiful exercise.,It's about enjoying mundane sounds.,This, for example, is my tumble dryer. 
 (Dryer) 
 It's a waltz -- one, two, three;none, two, three; one, two, three.,I love it!,Or just try this one on for size. 
 (Coffee grinder) 
 Wow!,So, mundane soundsncan be really interesting --,if you pay attention.,I call that the "hidden choir" --nit's around us all the time. 
 The next exercise is probablynthe most important of all of these,,if you just take one thing away.,This is listening positions --,the idea that you can movenyour listening position,to what's appropriatento what you're listening to.,This is playing with those filters.,Remember I gave you those filters?,It's starting to play with them as levers,,to get conscious about themnand to move to different places.,These are just somenof the listening positions,,or scales of listeningnpositions, that you can use.,There are many.,Have fun with that. It's very exciting. 
 And finally, an acronym.,You can use this in listening,nin communication.,If you're in any one of those roles --,and I think that probably is everybodynwho's listening to this talk --,the acronym is RASA,,which is the Sanskrit wordnfor "juice" or "essence.",And RASA stands for "Receive,"nwhich means pay attention to the person;,"Appreciate," making little noisesnlike "hmm," "oh," "OK";,"Summarize" -- the word "so"nis very important in communication;,and "Ask," ask questions afterwards. 
 Now sound is my passion, it's my life.,I wrote a whole book about it.nSo I live to listen.,That's too much to ask for most people.,But I believe that every human beingnneeds to listen consciously,in order to live fully --,connected in space and in timento the physical world around us,,connected in understanding to each other,,not to mention spiritually connected,,because every spiritual pathnI know of has listening and contemplation,at its heart. 
 That's why we need to teach listeningnin our schools as a skill.,Why is it not taught? It's crazy.,And if we can teach listeningnin our schools,,we can take our listeningnoff that slippery slope,to that dangerous, scary worldnthat I talked about,,and move it to a place where everybodynis consciously listening all the time,,or at least capable of doing it. 
 Now, I don't know how to do that,,but this is TED,,and I think the TED communitynis capable of anything.,So I invite you to connect with me,nconnect with each other,,take this mission out.,And let's get listening taught in schools,,and transform the world in one generation,to a conscious, listening world --na world of connection,,a world of understanding,and a world of peace. 
 Thank you for listening to me today. 
 (Applause)Planetary systems outside our own,are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,,but whose streets we can't walk.,By studying those twinkling lights though,,we can learn about how stars and planets interact,to form their own ecosystem,and make habitats that are amenable to life. 
 In this image of the Tokyo skyline,,I've hidden data,from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,,the Kepler Mission.,Can you see it?,There we go.,This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,,where it searches for planets,by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,,all at once, every half hour,,and very precisely. 
 And what we're looking for,is the tiny dimming of light,that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars,and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.,In just over two years of operations,,we've found over 1,200,potential new planetary systems around other stars.,To give you some perspective,,in the previous two decades of searching,,we had only known about 400,prior to Kepler. 
 When we see these little dips in the light,,we can determine a number of things.,For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,,but also how big that planet is,and how far it is away from its parent star.,That distance is really important,because it tells us,how much light the planet receives overall.,And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important,because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:,You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,,but not so close,that you're too toasty and you get burned. 
 However, there's more to know about your parent star,than just how much light you receive overall.,And I'll tell you why.,This is our star. This is our Sun.,It's shown here in visible light.,That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.,You'll notice that it looks pretty much,like the iconic yellow ball --,that Sun that we all draw when we're children.,But you'll notice something else,,and that's that the face of the Sun,has freckles.,These freckles are called sunspots,,and they are just one of the manifestations,of the Sun's magnetic field.,They also cause the light from the star to vary.,And we can measure this,very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects. 
 However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.,If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,,we would really see,the dynamic and dramatic effects,of our Sun's magnetic activity --,the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.,Just think, even when it's cloudy outside,,these kind of events are happening,in the sky above you all the time.,So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,,whether it might be amenable to life,,we want to know not only how much total light it receives,and how warm it is,,but we want to know about its space weather --,this high-energy radiation,,the UV and the X-rays,that are created by its star,and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation. 
 And so, we can't really look,at planets around other stars,in the same kind of detail,that we can look at planets in our own solar system.,I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars --,three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,,but only one of which,is really a good place to live.,But what we can do in the meantime,is measure the light from our stars,and learn about this relationship,between the planets and their parent stars,to suss out clues,about which planets might be good places,to look for life in the universe. 
 Kepler won't find a planet,around every single star it looks at.,But really, every measurement it makes,is precious,,because it's teaching us about the relationship,between stars and planets,,and how it's really the starlight,that sets the stage,for the formation of life in the universe.,While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,,it's we, life, who are searching. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 What you just heard,are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings,that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.,The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.,Every single bead, every single colored band,,represents a weather element,that can also be read as a musical note.,I find weather extremely fascinating.,Weather is an amalgam of systems,that is inherently invisible to most of us.,So I use sculpture and music,to make it, not just visible,,but also tactile and audible. 
 All of my work begins very simple.,I extract information from a specific environment,using very low-tech data collecting devices --,generally anything I can find in the hardware store.,I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet --,satellite images, weather data,from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.,That's both historical as well as real data.,And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.,These clipboards are filled with numbers.,And from all of these numbers,,I start with only two or three variables.,That begins my translation process. 
 My translation medium is a very simple basket.,A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.,When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements,,I can use the changes of those data points over time,to create the form.,I use natural reed,,because natural reed has a lot of tension in it,that I cannot fully control.,That means that it is the numbers that control the form,,not me.,What I come up with are forms like these.,These forms are completely made up,of weather data or science data.,Every colored bead, every colored string,,represents a weather element.,And together, these elements, not only construct the form,,but they also reveal behavioral relationships,that may not come across,through a two-dimensional graph. 
 When you step closer, you actually see,that it is indeed all made up of numbers.,The vertical elements,are assigned a specific hour of the day.,So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline.,But it's also used to assign a temperature range.,On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings,,water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases.,I also translate weather data into musical scores.,And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way,of translating information,without compromising it. 
 So all of these scores are made up of weather data.,Every single color, dot, every single line,,is a weather element.,And together, these variables construct a score.,I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.,This is the 1913 Trio,performing one of my pieces,at the Milwaukee Art Museum.,Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints,to translate into sculptural forms like this,,that function still in the sense,of being a three-dimensional weather visualization,,but now they're embedding,the visual matrix of the musical score,,so it can actually be read as a musical score. 
 What I love about this work,is that it challenges our assumptions,of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.,This piece here is read very differently,depending on where you place it.,You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.,You place it in a science museum,,it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.,You place it in a music hall,,it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.,And I really like that,,because the viewer is really challenged,as to what visual language,is part of science versus art versus music. 
 The other reason why I really like this,is because it offers an alternative entry point,into the complexity of science.,And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science.,So for me, that was my way into it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Climate change is already a heavy topic,,and it's getting heavier,because we're understanding,that we need to do more than we are.,We're understanding, in fact,,that those of us who live in the developed world,need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.,That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.,And it tends to feel a little overwhelming,when we look at what is there in reality today,and the magnitude of the problem that we face.,And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,,we tend to seek simple answers.,And I think this is what we've done with climate change.,We look at where the emissions are coming from --,they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,,and we say, okay, well the problem is,that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning,,so therefore, the answer must be,to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.,And while, of course, we do need clean energy,,I would put to you that it's possible,that by looking at climate change,as a clean energy generation problem,,we're in fact setting ourselves up,not to solve it. 
 And the reason why,is that we live on a planet,that is rapidly urbanizing.,That shouldn't be news to any of us.,However, it's hard sometimes,to remember the extent of that urbanization.,By mid-century,,we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people,living in cities or within a day's travel of one.,We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.,In order to provide,the kind of energy that it would take,for eight billion people living in cities,that are even somewhat like the cities,that those of us in the global North live in today,,we would have to generate,an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.,It may be possible,that we are not even able,to build that much clean energy.,So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change,on an urbanizing planet,,we need to look somewhere else for the solution. 
 The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,,because all of those cities we're building,are opportunities.,Every city determines to a very large extent,the amount of energy used by its inhabitants.,We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing --,I choose to turn this light switch on --,but really, enormous amounts of our energy use,are predestined,by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.,I won't show you very many graphs today,,but if I can just focus on this one for a moment,,it really tells us a lot of what we need to know --,which is, quite simply,,that if you look, for example, at transportation,,a major category of climate emissions,,there is a direct relationship,between how dense a city is,and the amount of climate emissions,that its residents spew out into the air.,And the correlation, of course,,is that denser places tend to have lower emissions --,which isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it. 
 Basically,,we substitute, in our lives,,access to the things we want.,We go out there and we hop in our cars,and we drive from place to place.,And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.,But when we live in a denser community,,suddenly what we find, of course,,is that the things we need are close by.,And since the most sustainable trip,is the one that you never had to make in the first place,,suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.,And it is possible, of course,,to increase the density of the communities around us. 
 Some places are doing this with new eco districts,,developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods,,which is nice work if you can get it,,but most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact,,reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.,So we're talking about things like infill development:,really sharp little changes,to where we have buildings, where we're developing.,Urban retrofitting:,creating different sorts of spaces and uses,out of places that are already there.,Increasingly, we're realizing,that we don't even need to densify an entire city.,What we need instead is an average density,that rises to a level,where we don't drive as much and so on.,And that can be done,by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.,So you can think of it as tent poles,that actually raise the density of the entire city. 
 And we find that when we do that,,we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense,within a wider fabric of places,that are perhaps a little more comfortable,and achieve the same results.,Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense,and still hold onto their cars,,but the reality is that, by and large,,what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions,is a threshold effect,,where people simply stop driving as much,,and increasingly, more and more people,,if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home,,give up their cars altogether.,And this is a huge, huge energy savings,,because what comes out of our tailpipe,is really just the beginning of the story,with climate emissions from cars.,We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,,all of the parking and freeways and so on.,When you can get rid of all of those,because somebody doesn't use any of them really,,you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions,as much as 90 percent. 
 And people are embracing this.,All around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.,People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home,to the dream neighborhood.,And when you layer that over,with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see,,what you find is, in fact,,even more access suffused into spaces.,Some of it's transportation access.,This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,,how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes,using public transportation.,Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.,This is Google Walking Maps.,I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,,and it told me to go via Guernsey.,It did tell me that this route,maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.,(Laughter),But the technologies are getting better,,and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.,And as we just heard earlier,,of course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.,Things that don't have any wiring in them at all,,we're learning how to include,in these systems of notation and navigation. 
 Part of what we're finding with this,is that what we thought,was the major point,of manufacturing and consumption,,which is to get a bunch of stuff,,is not, in fact,,how we really live best in dense environments.,What we're finding is that what we want,is access to the capacities of things.,My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?,Okay. I do too.,The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes,in its entire lifetime,,depending on who you ask.,And so what we do is we buy these drills,that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,,use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.,Our cities, I would put to you,,are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.,And while we could try and figure out,new ways to use those capacities --,such as cooking or making ice sculptures,or even a mafia hit --,what we probably will find,is that, in fact, turning those products into services,that we have access to when we want them,,is a far smarter way to go. 
 And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.,We're finding that people can share the same spaces,,do stuff with vacant space.,Buildings are becoming bundles of services.,So we have new designs,that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on --,like heating, cooling etc. --,and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.,So we light our buildings with daylight.,We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.,In fact, when we use all these things,,what we've found is that, in some cases,,energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.,Which brings on another threshold effect,I like to call furnace dumping,,which is, quite simply,,if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace,,you save a whole bunch of money up front.,These things actually become cheaper to build,than the alternatives. 
 Now when we look at being able,to slash our product use, slash our transportation use,,slash our building energy use,,all of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.,And if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities,,we need to think a little differently.,This is one way to do it.,This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.,And certainly lots of people have taken to heart,this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.,So we have visions like this.,We have visions like this. We have visions like this. 
 Now all of these are fine projects,,but they really have missed an essential point,,which is it's not about the leaves above,,it's about the systems below.,Do they, for instance, capture rainwater,so that we can reduce water use?,Water is energy intensive.,Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,,so that we can take runoff,and water that's going out of our houses,and clean it and filter it,and grow urban street trees?,Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us,by, for example, connecting us to rivers,and allowing for restoration?,Do they allow for pollination,,pollinator pathways,that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?,Do they even take the very waste matter,that we have from food and fiber and so forth,,and turn it back into soil,and sequester carbon --,take carbon out of the air,in the process of using our cities? 
 I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,,they're being done right now,,and that it's a darn good thing.,Because right now, our economy by and large,operates as Paul Hawken said,,"by stealing the future, selling it in the present,and calling it GDP.",And if we have another eight billion,or seven billion,,or six billion, even, people,,living on a planet where their cities also steal the future,,we're going to run out of future really fast.,But if we think differently,,I think that, in fact, we can have cities,that are not only zero emissions,,but have unlimited possibilities as well. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)My subject today is learning.,And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.,Ready?,When does learning begin?,Now as you ponder that question,,maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool,or kindergarten,,the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.,Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase,when children are learning how to walk and talk,and use a fork.,Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,,which asserts that the most important years for learning,are the earliest ones.,And so your answer to my question would be:,Learning begins at birth. 
 Well today I want to present to you,an idea that may be surprising,and may even seem implausible,,but which is supported by the latest evidence,from psychology and biology.,And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do,happens before we're born,,while we're still in the womb.,Now I'm a science reporter.,I write books and magazine articles.,And I'm also a mother.,And those two roles came together for me,in a book that I wrote called "Origins.","Origins" is a report from the front lines,of an exciting new field,called fetal origins.,Fetal origins is a scientific discipline,that emerged just about two decades ago,,and it's based on the theory,that our health and well-being throughout our lives,is crucially affected,by the nine months we spend in the womb.,Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.,I was myself pregnant,while I was doing the research for the book.,And one of the most fascinating insights,I took from this work,is that we're all learning about the world,even before we enter it. 
 When we hold our babies for the first time,,we might imagine that they're clean slates,,unmarked by life,,when in fact, they've already been shaped by us,and by the particular world we live in.,Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things,that scientists are discovering,about what fetuses learn,while they're still in their mothers' bellies. 
 First of all,,they learn the sound of their mothers' voices.,Because sounds from the outside world,have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue,and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,,the voices fetuses hear,,starting around the fourth month of gestation,,are muted and muffled.,One researcher says,that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher,in the old "Peanuts" cartoon.,But the pregnant woman's own voice,reverberates through her body,,reaching the fetus much more readily.,And because the fetus is with her all the time,,it hears her voice a lot.,Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice,and it prefers listening to her voice,over anyone else's. 
 How can we know this?,Newborn babies can't do much,,but one thing they're really good at is sucking.,Researchers take advantage of this fact,by rigging up two rubber nipples,,so that if a baby sucks on one,,it hears a recording of its mother's voice,on a pair of headphones,,and if it sucks on the other nipple,,it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.,Babies quickly show their preference,by choosing the first one.,Scientists also take advantage of the fact,that babies will slow down their sucking,when something interests them,and resume their fast sucking,when they get bored.,This is how researchers discovered,that, after women repeatedly read aloud,a section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant,,their newborn babies recognized that passage,when they hear it outside the womb.,My favorite experiment of this kind,is the one that showed that the babies,of women who watched a certain soap opera,every day during pregnancy,recognized the theme song of that show,once they were born.,So fetuses are even learning,about the particular language that's spoken,in the world that they'll be born into. 
 A study published last year,found that from birth, from the moment of birth,,babies cry in the accent,of their mother's native language.,French babies cry on a rising note,while German babies end on a falling note,,imitating the melodic contours,of those languages.,Now why would this kind of fetal learning,be useful?,It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.,From the moment of birth,,the baby responds most to the voice,of the person who is most likely to care for it --,its mother.,It even makes its cries,sound like the mother's language,,which may further endear the baby to the mother,,and which may give the baby a head start,in the critical task,of learning how to understand and speak,its native language. 
 But it's not just sounds,that fetuses are learning about in utero.,It's also tastes and smells.,By seven months of gestation,,the fetus' taste buds are fully developed,,and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,,are functioning.,The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats,find their way into the amniotic fluid,,which is continuously swallowed,by the fetus.,Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes,once they're out in the world.,In one experiment, a group of pregnant women,was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice,during their third trimester of pregnancy,,while another group of pregnant women,drank only water.,Six months later, the women's infants,were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,,and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.,The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women,ate more carrot-flavored cereal,,and from the looks of it,,they seemed to enjoy it more. 
 A sort of French version of this experiment,was carried out in Dijon, France,where researchers found,that mothers who consumed food and drink,flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy,showed a preference for anise,on their first day of life,,and again, when they were tested later,,on their fourth day of life.,Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy,showed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck.",What this means,is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers,about what is safe and good to eat.,Fetuses are also being taught,about the particular culture that they'll be joining,through one of culture's most powerful expressions,,which is food.,They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices,of their culture's cuisine,even before birth. 
 Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.,But before I get to that,,I want to address something that you may be wondering about.,The notion of fetal learning,may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus --,like playing Mozart through headphones,placed on a pregnant belly.,But actually, the nine-month-long process,of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb,is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.,Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life --,the air she breathes,,the food and drink she consumes,,the chemicals she's exposed to,,even the emotions she feels --,are shared in some fashion with her fetus.,They make up a mix of influences,as individual and idiosyncratic,as the woman herself.,The fetus incorporates these offerings,into its own body,,makes them part of its flesh and blood.,And often it does something more.,It treats these maternal contributions,as information,,as what I like to call biological postcards,from the world outside. 
 So what a fetus is learning about in utero,is not Mozart's "Magic Flute",but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.,Will it be born into a world of abundance,or scarcity?,Will it be safe and protected,,or will it face constant dangers and threats?,Will it live a long, fruitful life,or a short, harried one?,The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular,provide important clues to prevailing conditions,like a finger lifted to the wind.,The resulting tuning and tweaking,of a fetus' brain and other organs,are part of what give us humans,our enormous flexibility,,our ability to thrive,in a huge variety of environments,,from the country to the city,,from the tundra to the desert. 
 To conclude, I want to tell you two stories,about how mothers teach their children about the world,even before they're born.,In the autumn of 1944,,the darkest days of World War II,,German troops blockaded Western Holland,,turning away all shipments of food.,The opening of the Nazi's siege,was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades --,so cold the water in the canals froze solid.,Soon food became scarce,,with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day --,a quarter of what they consumed before the war.,As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,,some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.,By the beginning of May,,the nation's carefully rationed food reserve,was completely exhausted.,The specter of mass starvation loomed.,And then on May 5th, 1945,,the siege came to a sudden end,when Holland was liberated,by the Allies. 
 The "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known,,killed some 10,000 people,and weakened thousands more.,But there was another population that was affected --,the 40,000 fetuses,in utero during the siege.,Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy,were immediately apparent,in higher rates of stillbirths,,birth defects, low birth weights,and infant mortality.,But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.,Decades after the "Hunger Winter,",researchers documented,that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege,have more obesity, more diabetes,and more heart disease in later life,than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.,These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation,seems to have changed their bodies,in myriad ways.,They have higher blood pressure,,poorer cholesterol profiles,and reduced glucose tolerance --,a precursor of diabetes. 
 Why would undernutrition in the womb,result in disease later?,One explanation,is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.,When food is scarce,,they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,,and away from other organs,like the heart and liver.,This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,,but the bill comes due later on in life,when those other organs, deprived early on,,become more susceptible to disease. 
 But that may not be all that's going on.,It seems that fetuses are taking cues,from the intrauterine environment,and tailoring their physiology accordingly.,They're preparing themselves,for the kind of world they will encounter,on the other side of the womb.,The fetus adjusts its metabolism,and other physiological processes,in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.,And the basis of the fetus' prediction,is what its mother eats.,The meals a pregnant woman consumes,constitute a kind of story,,a fairy tale of abundance,or a grim chronicle of deprivation.,This story imparts information,that the fetus uses,to organize its body and its systems --,an adaptation to prevailing circumstances,that facilitates its future survival.,Faced with severely limited resources,,a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements,will, in fact, have a better chance,of living to adulthood. 
 The real trouble comes,when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,,when fetuses are led,to expect a world of scarcity,and are born instead into a world of plenty.,This is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter.",And their higher rates of obesity,,diabetes and heart disease,are the result.,Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie,found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories,of the post-war Western diet.,The world they had learned about while in utero,was not the same,as the world into which they were born. 
 Here's another story.,At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,,there were tens of thousands of people,in the vicinity of the World Trade Center,in New York --,commuters spilling off trains,,waitresses setting tables for the morning rush,,brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.,1,700 of these people were pregnant women.,When the planes struck and the towers collapsed,,many of these women experienced the same horrors,inflicted on other survivors of the disaster --,the overwhelming chaos and confusion,,the rolling clouds,of potentially toxic dust and debris,,the heart-pounding fear for their lives. 
 About a year after 9/11,,researchers examined a group of women,who were pregnant,when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.,In the babies of those women,who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,,following their ordeal,,researchers discovered a biological marker,of susceptibility to PTSD --,an effect that was most pronounced,in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe,in their third trimester.,In other words,,the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome,had passed on a vulnerability to the condition,to their children while they were still in utero. 
 Now consider this:,post-traumatic stress syndrome,appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,,causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.,But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.,What looks like pathology to us,may actually be a useful adaptation,in some circumstances.,In a particularly dangerous environment,,the characteristic manifestations of PTSD --,a hyper-awareness of one's surroundings,,a quick-trigger response to danger --,could save someone's life.,The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive,is still speculative,,but I find it rather poignant.,It would mean that, even before birth,,mothers are warning their children,that it's a wild world out there,,telling them, "Be careful." 
 Let me be clear.,Fetal origins research is not about blaming women,for what happens during pregnancy.,It's about discovering how best to promote,the health and well-being of the next generation.,That important effort must include a focus,on what fetuses learn,during the nine months they spend in the womb.,Learning is one of life's most essential activities,,and it begins much earlier,than we ever imagined. 
 Thank you.

 (Applause)What I want to talk about today is one idea.,It's an idea for a new kind of school,,which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking,about what schools are for and how they work.,And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.,Where it comes from,is an organization called the Young Foundation,,which, over many decades,,has come up with many innovations in education, like the Open University,and things like Extended Schools,,Schools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities,and the School of Everything. 
 And about five years ago, we asked,what was the most important need for innovation,in schooling here in the U.K.,And we felt the most important priority,was to bring together two sets of problems.,One was large numbers of bored teenagers,who just didn't like school,,couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school,and future jobs.,And employers who kept complaining,that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work,,didn't have the right attitudes and experience. 
 And so we try to ask:,What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,,not fighting to stay out?,And after hundreds of conversations,with teenagers and teachers and parents,and employers and schools,from Paraguay to Australia,,and looking at some of the academic research,,which showed the importance,of what's now called non-cognitive skills --,the skills of motivation, resilience --,and that these are as important,as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills --,we came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,,which we called the Studio School.,And we called it a studio school,to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance,where work and learning are integrated.,You work by learning,,and you learn by working.,And the design we came up with had the following characteristics. 
 First of all, we wanted small schools --,about 300, 400 pupils --,14 to 19 year-olds,,and critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done,not through sitting in classrooms,,but through real-life, practical projects,,working on commission,to businesses, NGO's and others.,That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,,who would have timetables,much more like a work environment in a business.,And all of this will be done within the public system,,funded by public money,,but independently run.,And all at no extra cost, no selection,,and allowing the pupils the route into university,,even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs,and have manual jobs as well.,Underlying it was some very simple ideas,that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,,they learn best in teams,and they learn best by doing things for real --,all the opposite of what mainstream schooling,actually does. 
 Now that was a nice idea,,so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase.,We tried it out,,first in Luton --,famous for its airport and not much else, I fear --,and in Blackpool -- famous for its beaches and leisure.,And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong,and then improved them --,but we found that the young people loved it.,They found it much more motivational, much more exciting,than traditional education.,And perhaps most important of all,,two years later when the exam results came through,,the pupils who had been put on these field trials,who were in the lowest performing groups,had jumped right to the top --,in fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance,in terms of GCSE's,,which is the British marking system. 
 Now not surprisingly,,that influenced some people to think we were onto something.,The minister of education,down south in London,described himself as a "big fan.",And the business organizations thought we were onto something,in terms of a way of preparing children much better,for real-life work today.,And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce,is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust,and helping it, not just with big businesses,,but small businesses all over the country. 
 We started with two schools.,That's grown this year to about 10.,And next year, we're expecting about 35 schools,open across England,,and another 40 areas,want to have their own schools opening --,a pretty rapid spread,of this idea.,Interestingly,,it's happened almost entirely without media coverage.,It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it.,It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,,across teachers, parents,,people involved in education.,And it spread because of the power of an idea --,so the very, very simple idea,about turning education on its head,and putting the things which were marginal,,things like working in teams, doing practical projects,,and putting them right at the heart of learning,,rather than on the edges. 
 Now there's a whole set of new schools,opening up this autumn.,This is one from Yorkshire,where, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.,And this one is focused,on creative and media industries.,Other ones have a focus on health care,,tourism, engineering,and other fields. 
 We think we're onto something.,It's not perfect yet,,but we think this is one idea,which can transform the lives,of thousands, possibly millions, of teenagers,who are really bored by schooling.,It doesn't animate them.,They're not like all of you who can sit in rows,and hear things said to you for hour after hour.,They want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,,they want education to be for real.,And my hope is that some of you out there,may be able to help us. 
 We feel we're on the beginning of a journey,of experiment and improvement,to turn the Studio School idea,into something which is present,,not as a universal answer for every child,,but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world.,And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Cities are the crucible of civilization.,They have been expanding,,urbanization has been expanding,,at an exponential rate in the last 200 years,so that by the second part of this century,,the planet will be completely dominated,by cities.,Cities are the origins of global warming,,impact on the environment,,health, pollution, disease,,finance,,economies, energy --,they're all problems,that are confronted by having cities.,That's where all these problems come from.,And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing,in terms of sustainability questions,are actually a reflection,of the exponential increase,in urbanization across the planet. 
 Here's some numbers.,Two hundred years ago, the United States,was less than a few percent urbanized.,It's now more than 82 percent.,The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.,China's building 300 new cities,in the next 20 years.,Now listen to this:,Every week for the foreseeable future,,until 2050,,every week more than a million people,are being added to our cities.,This is going to affect everything.,Everybody in this room, if you stay alive,,is going to be affected,by what's happening in cities,in this extraordinary phenomenon.,However, cities,,despite having this negative aspect to them,,are also the solution.,Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets,that have sucked up creative people,,creating ideas, innovation,,wealth and so on.,So we have this kind of dual nature.,And so there's an urgent need,for a scientific theory of cities. 
 Now these are my comrades in arms.,This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,,and they've done all the work,,and I'm the great bullshitter,that tries to bring it all together. 
 (Laughter) 
 So here's the problem: This is what we all want.,The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050,want to live in places like this,,having things like this,,doing things like this,,with economies that are growing like this,,not realizing that entropy,produces things like this,,this, this,and this.,And the question is:,Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York,are going to look like in 2050,,or is it going to be this?,That's the question.,I must say, many of the indicators,look like this is what it's going to look like,,but let's talk about it. 
 So my provocative statement,is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.,And scientific theory means quantifiable --,relying on underlying generic principles,that can be made into a predictive framework.,That's the quest.,Is that conceivable?,Are there universal laws?,So here's two questions,that I have in my head when I think about this problem.,The first is:,Are cities part of biology?,Is London a great big whale?,Is Edinburgh a horse?,Is Microsoft a great big anthill?,What do we learn from that?,We use them metaphorically --,the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --,is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,,or is there serious substance to it?,And if that is the case,,how come that it's very hard to kill a city?,You could drop an atom bomb on a city,,and 30 years later it's surviving.,Very few cities fail.,All companies die, all companies.,And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict,when Google is going to go bust. 
 So is that just another version,of this?,Well we understand this very well.,That is, you ask any generic question about this --,how many trees of a given size,,how many branches of a given size does a tree have,,how many leaves,,what is the energy flowing through each branch,,what is the size of the canopy,,what is its growth, what is its mortality?,We have a mathematical framework,based on generic universal principles,that can answer those questions.,And the idea is can we do the same for this?,So the route in is recognizing,one of the most extraordinary things about life,,is that it is scalable,,it works over an extraordinary range.,This is just a tiny range actually:,It's us mammals;,we're one of these.,The same principles, the same dynamics,,the same organization is at work,in all of these, including us,,and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.,And that is one of the main reasons,life is so resilient and robust --,scalability.,We're going to discuss that in a moment more. 
 But you know, at a local level,,you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.,That's called growth.,Here's how you grew.,Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.,We're all pretty much the same.,And you see, you're very familiar with this.,You grow very quickly and then you stop.,And that line there,is a prediction from the same theory,,based on the same principles,,that describes that forest.,And here it is for the growth of a rat,,and those points on there are data points.,This is just the weight versus the age.,And you see, it stops growing.,Very, very good for biology --,also one of the reasons for its great resilience.,Very, very bad,for economies and companies and cities,in our present paradigm.,This is what we believe.,This is what our whole economy,is thrusting upon us,,particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:,hockey sticks.,This is a bunch of software companies --,and what it is is their revenue versus their age --,all zooming away,,and everybody making millions and billions of dollars. 
 Okay, so how do we understand this?,So let's first talk about biology.,This is explicitly showing you,how things scale,,and this is a truly remarkable graph.,What is plotted here is metabolic rate --,how much energy you need per day to stay alive --,versus your weight, your mass,,for all of us bunch of organisms.,And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,,otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.,And what you see if you plot it,in this slightly curious way,is that everybody lies on the same line.,Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system,in the universe,,there's an extraordinary simplicity,being expressed by this.,It's particularly astonishing,because each one of these organisms,,each subsystem, each cell type, each gene,,has evolved in its own unique environmental niche,with its own unique history.,And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution,and natural selection,,they've been constrained to lie on a line. 
 Something else is going on.,Before I talk about that,,I've written down at the bottom there,the slope of this curve, this straight line.,It's three-quarters, roughly,,which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.,And here's the point of that.,It says that, if it were linear,,the steepest slope,,then doubling the size,you would require double the amount of energy.,But it's sublinear, and what that translates into,is that, if you double the size of the organism,,you actually only need 75 percent more energy.,So a wonderful thing about all of biology,is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.,The bigger you are systematically,,according to very well-defined rules,,less energy per capita.,Now any physiological variable you can think of,,any life history event you can think of,,if you plot it this way, looks like this.,There is an extraordinary regularity.,So you tell me the size of a mammal,,I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it,in terms of its physiology, life history, etc. 
 And the reason for this is because of networks.,All of life is controlled by networks --,from the intracellular through the multicellular,through the ecosystem level.,And you're very familiar with these networks.,That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.,And here's the summary of what I'm saying.,If you take those networks,,this idea of networks,,and you apply universal principles,,mathematizable, universal principles,,all of these scalings,and all of these constraints follow,,including the description of the forest,,the description of your circulatory system,,the description within cells.,One of the things I did not stress in that introduction,was that, systematically, the pace of life,decreases as you get bigger.,Heart rates are slower; you live longer;,diffusion of oxygen and resources,across membranes is slower, etc. 
 The question is: Is any of this true,for cities and companies?,So is London a scaled up Birmingham,,which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?,Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,,which is a scaled up Santa Fe?,Don't know. We will discuss that.,But they are networks,,and the most important network of cities,is you.,Cities are just a physical manifestation,of your interactions,,our interactions,,and the clustering and grouping of individuals.,Here's just a symbolic picture of that.,And here's scaling of cities.,This shows that in this very simple example,,which happens to be a mundane example,of number of petrol stations,as a function of size --,plotted in the same way as the biology --,you see exactly the same kind of thing. 
 There is a scaling.,That is that the number of petrol stations in the city,is now given to you,when you tell me its size.,The slope of that is less than linear.,There is an economy of scale.,Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.,But here's what's surprising.,It scales in the same way everywhere.,This is just European countries,,but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,,always the same,with the same kind of economy of scale,to the same degree.,And any infrastructure you look at --,whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines --,anything you look at,has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.,It's an integrated system,that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.,But even more surprising,is if you look at socio-economic quantities,,quantities that have no analog in biology,,that have evolved when we started forming communities,eight to 10,000 years ago.,The top one is wages as a function of size,plotted in the same way.,And the bottom one is you lot --,super-creatives plotted in the same way.,And what you see,is a scaling phenomenon.,But most important in this,,the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters,for the metabolic rate,,is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.,Here it is,,which says that the bigger you are,the more you have per capita, unlike biology --,higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,,more patents per capita, more crime per capita. 
 And we've looked at everything:,more AIDS cases, flu, etc.,And here, they're all plotted together.,Just to show you what we plotted,,here is income, GDP --,GDP of the city --,crime and patents all on one graph.,And you can see, they all follow the same line.,And here's the statement.,If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,,from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,,it doesn't matter,,then systematically,you get a 15 percent increase,in wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,,number of police,,anything you can think of.,It goes up by 15 percent,,and you have a 15 percent savings,on the infrastructure.,This, no doubt, is the reason,why a million people a week are gathering in cities.,Because they think that all those wonderful things --,like creative people, wealth, income --,is what attracts them,,forgetting about the ugly and the bad. 
 What is the reason for this?,Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,,but underlying this is the social networks,,because this is a universal phenomenon.,This 15 percent rule,is true,no matter where you are on the planet --,Japan, Chile,,Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.,Always, all the data shows it's the same,,despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.,Something universal is going on.,The universality, to repeat, is us --,that we are the city.,And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.,So there it is, I've said it again.,So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,,unlike biology, which had sublinear scaling,,economies of scale,,you had the slowing of the pace of life,as you get bigger.,If it's social networks with super-linear scaling --,more per capita --,then the theory says,that you increase the pace of life.,The bigger you are, life gets faster.,On the left is the heart rate showing biology.,On the right is the speed of walking,in a bunch of European cities,,showing that increase. 
 Lastly, I want to talk about growth.,This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.,Economies of scale,gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.,You grow fast and then stop --,part of our resilience.,That would be bad for economies and cities.,And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory,is that if you have super-linear scaling,from wealth creation and innovation,,then indeed you get, from the same theory,,a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.,And in fact, if you compare it to data,,it fits very well,with the development of cities and economies.,But it has a terrible catch,,and the catch,is that this system is destined to collapse.,And it's destined to collapse for many reasons --,kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.,And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before. 
 What we do is,,as we grow and we approach the collapse,,a major innovation takes place,and we start over again,,and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.,So there's this continuous cycle of innovation,that is necessary,in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.,The catch, however, to this,is that you have to innovate,faster and faster and faster.,So the image,is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,,but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.,We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.,And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,,avoid a heart attack? 
 So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two,asking about companies.,See companies, they scale.,The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.,It's the same plot.,This happens to be income and assets,versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.,We could use sales, anything you like.,There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,,when companies are innovating,,they scale beautifully.,And we've looked at 23,000 companies,in the United States, may I say.,And I'm only showing you a little bit of this. 
 What is astonishing about companies,is that they scale sublinearly,like biology,,indicating that they're dominated,,not by super-linear,innovation and ideas;,they become dominated,by economies of scale.,In that interpretation,,by bureaucracy and administration,,and they do it beautifully, may I say.,So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,,I could have predicted the size of Walmart.,If it has this sublinear scaling,,the theory says,we should have sigmoidal growth.,There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.,That's what we like, hockey sticks.,But you notice, I've cheated,,because I've only gone up to '94.,Let's go up to 2008.,That red line is from the theory.,So if I'd have done this in 1994,,I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.,And then this is repeated,across the entire spectrum of companies.,There they are. That's 23,000 companies.,They all start looking like hockey sticks,,they all bend over,,and they all die like you and me. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Have you ever wondered,why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries,over the course of the last decade?,Have you ever wondered,how such a situation can be turned around?,Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings,and thought, "How could we have predicted that?",or "How could we have better prepared for that?",Well my personal story, my personal journey,,what brings me to the TED stage here today,,is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening,in Muslim-majority countries,over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond.,I want to share some of that story with you,,but also some of my ideas around change,and the role of social movements in creating change,in Muslim-majority societies. 
 So let me begin,by first of all giving a very, very brief history of time,,if I may indulge.,In medieval societies there were defined allegiances.,An identity was defined,primarily by religion.,And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century,with the rise of a European nation-state,where identities and allegiances were defined,by ethnicity.,So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity,,and the nation-state reflected that.,In the age of globalization, we moved on.,I call it the era of citizenship --,where people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds,,but all be equal as citizens,in a state.,You could be American-Italian; you could be American-Irish;,you could be British-Pakistani. 
 But I believe now,that we're moving into a new age,,and that age The New York Times dubbed recently,as "the age of behavior.",How I define the age of behavior,is a period of transnational allegiances,,where identity is defined more so,by ideas and narratives.,And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders,are increasingly beginning to affect,the way in which people behave.,Now this is not all necessarily good news,,because it's also my belief,that hatred has gone global,just as much as love.,But actually it's my belief,that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior,,up until now, up until recent times,,up until the last six months,,the people who have been capitalizing most,on the age of behavior,and the transnational allegiances,,using digital activism,and other sorts of borderless technologies,,those who've been benefiting from this,have been extremists.,And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on. 
 If we look at Islamists,,if we look at the phenomenon,of far-right fascists,,one thing they've been very good at,,one thing that they've actually been exceeding in,,is communicating across borders,,using technologies to organize themselves,,to propagate their message,and to create truly global phenomena.,Now I should know,,because for 13 years of my life,,I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization.,And I was actually a potent force,in spreading ideas across borders,,and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism,as distinct from Islam the faith,,and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists,across the world. 
 And my story, my personal story,,is truly evidence for the age of behavior,that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here.,I was, by the way -- I'm an Essex lad,,born and raised in Essex in the U.K.,Anyone who's from England,knows the reputation we have from Essex.,But having been born in Essex,,at the age of 16,,I joined an organization.,At the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University,to this organization.,At the age of 19,,I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.,At the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan.,At the age of 22,,I was co-founding this organization in Denmark.,By the age of 24,,I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt,,being blacklisted from three countries in the world,for attempting to overthrow their governments,,being subjected to torture,in Egyptian jails,and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience. 
 Now that journey,,and what took me from Essex all the way across the world --,by the way, we were laughing at democratic activists.,We felt they were from the age of yesteryear.,We felt that they were out of date.,I learned how to use email,from the extremist organization that I used.,I learned how to effectively communicate across borders,without being detected.,Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.,But the way in which I learned,to use technology to my advantage,was because I was within an extremist organization,that was forced to think beyond,the confines of the nation-state.,The age of behavior: where ideas and narratives,were increasingly defining behavior,and identity and allegiances. 
 So as I said, we looked to the status quo,and ridiculed it.,And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this.,But even if you look across,the mood music in Europe of late,,far-right fascism is also on the rise.,A form of anti-Islam rhetoric,is also on the rise,and it's transnational.,And the consequences that this is having,is that it's affecting the political climate,across Europe.,What's actually happening,is that what were previously localized parochialisms,,individual or groupings of extremists,who were isolated from one another,,have become interconnected in a globalized way,and have thus become, or are becoming, mainstream.,Because the Internet and connection technologies,are connecting them across the world. 
 If you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late,,you will see some things that are happening,that are influencing domestic politics,,yet the phenomenon is transnational.,In certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned.,In others, headscarves are being banned.,In others, kosher and halal meat are being banned,,as we speak.,And on the flip side,,we have transnational Islamist extremists,doing the same thing across their own societies.,And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected,in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream.,Now that never would have been possible before.,They would have felt isolated,,until these sorts of technologies came around,and connected them in a way,that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon. 
 Where does that leave democracy aspirants?,Well I believe they're getting left far behind.,And I'll give you an example here at this stage.,If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot:,there's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki.,As an American citizen, ethnically a Yemeni,,in hiding currently in Yemen,,who inspired a Nigerian,,son of the head of Nigeria's national bank.,This Nigerian student studied in London, trained in Yemen,,boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America.,In the meanwhile,,the Old mentality with a capital O,,was represented by his father, the head of the Nigerian bank,,warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack,,and this warning fell on deaf ears.,The Old mentality with a capital O,,as represented by the nation-state,,not yet fully into the age of behavior,,not recognizing the power of transnational social movements,,got left behind.,And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded,in attacking the United States of America.,Again with the example of the far right:,that we find, ironically,,xenophobic nationalists,are utilizing the benefits of globalization. 
 So why are they succeeding?,And why are democracy aspirants falling behind?,Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this.,And a social movement is comprised, in my view,,it's comprised of four main characteristics.,It's comprised of ideas and narratives,and symbols and leaders.,I'll talk you through one example,,and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of,,and that's the example of Al-Qaeda.,If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda,,that's something that comes to your mind immediately.,If I ask you to think of their narratives --,the West being at war with Islam, the need to defend Islam against the West --,these narratives, they come to your mind immediately.,Incidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives:,the idea is the cause that one believes in;,and the narrative is the way to sell that cause --,the propaganda, if you like, of the cause.,So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately. 
 If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders,,they come to your mind immediately.,One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently.,So these symbols and these leaders,come to your mind immediately.,And that's the power of social movements.,They're transnational, and they bond around these ideas and narratives,and these symbols and these leaders.,However,,if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan,,and I ask you to think,of the symbols and the leaders for democracy,in Pakistan today,,you'll be hard pressed,to think beyond perhaps,the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.,Which means, by definition,,that particular leader no longer exists. 
 One of the problems we're facing is, in my view,,that there are no globalized,,youth-led, grassroots social movements,advocating for democratic culture,across Muslim-majority societies.,There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism,,for democracy across Muslim-majority societies.,There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols,advocating the democratic culture on the ground.,So that begs the next question.,Why is it that extremist organizations,,whether of the far-right or of the Islamist extremism --,Islamism meaning those who wish to impose,one version of Islam over the rest of society --,why is it that they are succeeding,in organizing in a globalized way,,whereas those who aspire to democratic culture,are falling behind?,And I believe that's for four reasons.,I believe, number one, it's complacency.,Because those who aspire to democratic culture,are in power,,or have societies,that are leading globalized, powerful societies,,powerful countries.,And that level of complacency means,they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture. 
 The second, I believe,,is political correctness.,That we have a hesitation,in espousing the universality of democratic culture,because we are associating that --,we associate believing in the universality of our values --,with extremists.,Yet actually, whenever we talk about human rights,,we do say that human rights are universal.,But actually going out to propagate that view,is associated with either neoconservativism,or with Islamist extremism.,To go around saying that I believe,democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at,as a form of political organizing,is associated with extremism. 
 And the third,,democratic choice in Muslim-majority societies,has been relegated to a political choice,,meaning political parties,in many of these societies,ask people to vote for them,as the democratic party,,but then the other parties ask them to vote for them,as the military party --,wanting to rule by military dictatorship.,And then you have a third party saying,,"Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy.",So democracy has become merely one political choice,among many other forms,of political choices available in those societies.,And what happens as a result of this,is, when those parties are elected,,and inevitably they fail,,or inevitably they make political mistakes,,democracy takes the blame,for their political mistakes.,And then people say, "We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work.,Let's bring the military back again." 
 And the fourth reason, I believe,,is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance.,What I mean by that is,,if the world superpower today was a communist,,it would be much easier for democracy activists,to use democracy activism,as a form of resistance against colonialism,,than it is today with the world superpower being America,,occupying certain lands,and also espousing democratic ideals.,So roughly these four reasons,make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread,as a civilizational choice,,not merely as a political choice. 
 When talking about those reasons,,let's break down certain preconceptions.,Is it just about grievances?,Is it just about a lack of education?,Well statistically,,the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated.,Statistically, they are educated, on average,,above the education levels,of Western society.,Anecdotally, we can demonstrate,that if poverty was the only factor,,well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.,His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician --,not an ill-educated man.,International aid and development has been going on for years,,but extremism in those societies, in many of those societies,,has been on the rise.,And what I believe is missing,is genuine grassroots activism,on the ground,,in addition to international aid,,in addition to education, in addition to health.,Not exclusive to these things, but in addition to them,,is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground. 
 And this is where I believe,neoconservatism had it upside-down.,Neoconservatism had the philosophy,that you go in with a supply-led approach,to impose democratic values from the top down.,Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations, for decades,,have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots.,They've been building civilizational demand for their values,on the grassroots,,and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition,to societies that are increasingly asking for,a form of Islamism.,Mass movements in Pakistan,have been represented after the Arab uprisings,mainly by organizations,claiming for some form of theocracy,,rather than for a democratic uprising.,Because since pre-partition,,they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground.,And what's needed is a genuine transnational,youth-led movement,that works to actively advocate,for the democratic culture --,which is necessarily more,than just elections.,But without freedom of speech, you can't have free and fair elections.,Without human rights, you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign.,Without freedom of belief,,you don't have the right to join organizations. 
 So what's needed is those organizations on the ground,advocating for the democratic culture itself,to create the demand on the ground for this culture.,What that will do,is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier,,where currently we have political parties presenting democracy,as merely a political choice in those societies,alongside other choices,such as military rule and theocracy.,Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level,,rather than merely on a political level,,a level above politics --,movements that are not political parties,,but are rather creating this civilizational demand,for this democratic culture.,What we'll have in the end,is this ideal that you see on the slide here --,the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy,,not for a democracy.,But to get to that stage,,where democracy builds the fabric of society,and the political choices within that fabric,,but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship --,i.e. you're voting in a democracy,,in an existing democracy,,and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box.,To get to that stage,,we genuinely need to start building demand,in those societies on the ground. 
 Now to conclude, how does that happen?,Well, Egypt is a good starting point.,The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning.,But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt,was particularly cathartic for me.,What happened there was a political coalition,gathered together for a political goal,,and that was to remove the leader.,We need to move one step beyond that now.,We need to see how we can help those societies,move from political coalitions,,loosely based political coalitions,,to civilizational coalitions,that are working for the ideals and narratives,of the democratic culture on the ground.,Because it's not enough to remove a leader,or ruler or dictator.,That doesn't guarantee that what comes next,will be a society built on democratic values. 
 But generally, the trends that start in Egypt,have historically spread across the MENA region,,the Middle East and North Africa region.,So when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region.,In the '80s and '90s when Islamism started in the region,,it spread across the MENA region as a whole. 
 And the aspiration that we have at the moment --,as young Arabs are proving today,and instantly rebranding themselves,as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism --,is that there is a chance,that democratic culture can start in the region,and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that.,But that will require,helping these societies transition,from having merely political coalitions,to building genuinely grassroots-based social movements,that advocate for the democratic culture.,And we've made a start for that in Pakistan,with a movement called Khudi,,where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth,to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.,And it's with that thought that I'll end. 
 And my time is up, and thank you for your time. 
 (Applause)My travels to Afghanistan,began many, many years ago,on the eastern border of my country,,my homeland, Poland.,I was walking through the forests,of my grandmother's tales.,A land where every field hides a grave,,where millions of people,have been deported or killed,in the 20th century. 
 Behind the destruction,,I found a soul of places.,I met humble people.,I heard their prayer,and ate their bread.,Then I have been walking East for 20 years --,from Eastern Europe to Central Asia --,through the Caucasus Mountains,,Middle East,,North Africa,,Russia.,And I ever met more humble people.,And I shared their bread and their prayer.,This is why I went to Afghanistan. 
 One day, I crossed the bridge,over the Oxus River.,I was alone on foot.,And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me,that he forgot to stamp my passport.,But he gave me a cup of tea.,And I understood,that his surprise was my protection. 
 So I have been walking and traveling,,by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking,,from Iran's border,to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.,And in this way,I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.,My only weapon,was my notebook and my Leica.,I heard prayers of the Sufi --,humble Muslims,,hated by the Taliban.,Hidden river,,interconnected with the mysticism,from Gibraltar to India.,The mosque where the respectful foreigner,is showered with blessings,and with tears,,and welcomed as a gift. 
 What do we know,about the country and the people,that we pretend to protect,,about the villages,where the only one medicine,to kill the pain and to stop the hunger,is opium?,These are opium-addicted people,on the roofs of Kabul,10 years after the beginning of our war.,These are the nomad girls,who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen. 
 What do we know about the women,10 years after the war?,Clothed in this nylon bag,,made in China,,with the name of burqa.,I saw one day,,the largest school in Afghanistan,,a girls' school.,13,000 girls,studying here,in the rooms underground,,full of scorpions.,And their love [for studying],was so big that I cried. 
 What do we know,about the death threats by the Taliban,nailed on the doors,of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?,The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban,,and they did it. 
 My aim is to give a voice,to the silent people,,to show the hidden lights,behind the curtain of the great game,,the small worlds ignored by the media,and the prophets of a global conflict. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Hi everyone.,I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.,Thank you.,And I want to share with you my latest art project.,It's a children's book for the iPad.,It's a little quirky and silly.,It's called "Pop-It,",And it's about the things little kids do with their parents. 
 (Music) 
 So this is about potty training --,as most of you, I hope, know.,You can tickle the rug.,You can make the baby poop.,You can do all those fun things.,You can burst bubbles.,You can draw, as everyone should. 
 But you know, I have a problem with children's books:,I think they're full of propaganda.,At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.,It's not the way I was brought up.,So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda.",If you notice carefully,,it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.,You don't like it?,Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.,(Laughter),Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.,You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. 
 I have to tell you about my childhood.,I went to this very proper Christian school,taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.,Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,,and I am.,And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,,which was probably the only Hindu house,in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.,Basically, I celebrated every religious function.,In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,,all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.,I remember we cried profusely,when the little goats we played with in the summer,became biriani.,(Laughter),We all had to fast during Ramadan.,It was a very beautiful time. 
 But I must say,,I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.,Babri Masjid --,one of the most beautiful mosques in India,,built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century --,was demolished by Hindu activists.,This caused major riots in my city.,And for the first time,,I was affected,by this communal unrest.,My little five-year-old kid neighbor,comes running in,,and he says, "Rags, Rags.,You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful.",I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu.",(Laughter),He's like, "Huh!" 
 You know, my work is inspired,by events such as this.,Even in my gallery shows,,I try and revisit historic events,like Babri Masjid,,distill only its emotional residue,and image my own life.,Imagine history being taught differently. 
 Remember that children's book,where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?,I have another idea.,It's a children's book about Indian independence --,very patriotic.,But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.,Shake it again, and you get the British perspective. 
 (Applause) 
 You have to separate fact from bias, right.,Even my books on children,have cute, fuzzy animals.,But they're playing geopolitics.,They're playing out Israel-Palestine,,India-Pakistan.,You know, I'm making a very important argument.,And my argument [is],that the only way for us to teach creativity,is by teaching children perspectives,at the earliest stage.,After all, children's books are manuals on parenting,,so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.,And conversely,,only when you teach perspectives,will a child be able to imagine,and put themselves in the shoes,of someone who is different from them. 
 I'm making an argument that art and creativity,are very essential tools in empathy.,You know, I can't promise my child,a life without bias --,we're all biased --,but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So I begin with an advertisement,inspired by George Orwell,that Apple ran in 1984. 
 (Video) Big Brother: We are one people,with one will, one resolve,,one cause.,Our enemies shall talk themselves to death,,and we will fight them with their own confusion.,We shall prevail.,Narrator: On January 24th,,Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.,And you'll see why 1984,won't be like "1984." 
 Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video,remains very powerful even today.,Technology created by innovative companies,will set us all free.,Fast-forward more than two decades:,Apple launches the iPhone in China,and censors the Dalai Lama out,along with several other politically sensitive applications,at the request of the Chinese government,for its Chinese app store.,The American political cartoonist,Mark Fiore,also had his satire application,censored in the United States,because some of Apple's staff,were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.,His app wasn't reinstated,until he won the Pulitzer Prize.,The German magazine Stern, a news magazine,,had its app censored,because the Apple nannies deemed it,to be a little bit too racy for their users,,and despite the fact that this magazine,is perfectly legal for sale,on newsstands throughout Germany.,And more controversially, recently,,Apple censored a Palestinian protest app,after the Israeli government voiced concerns,that it might be used to organize violent attacks. 
 So here's the thing.,We have a situation where private companies,are applying censorship standards,that are often quite arbitrary,and generally more narrow,than the free speech constitutional standards,that we have in democracies.,Or they're responding to censorship requests,by authoritarian regimes,that do not reflect consent of the governed.,Or they're responding to requests and concerns,by governments that have no jurisdiction,over many, or most, of the users and viewers,who are interacting with the content in question. 
 So here's the situation.,In a pre-Internet world,,sovereignty over our physical freedoms,,or lack thereof,,was controlled almost entirely,by nation-states.,But now we have this new layer,of private sovereignty,in cyberspace.,And their decisions about software coding,,engineering, design, terms of service,all act as a kind of law,that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.,And their sovereignties,,cross-cutting, globally interlinked,,can in some ways,challenge the sovereignties of nation-states,in very exciting ways,,but sometimes also act,to project and extend it,at a time when control,over what people can and cannot do,with information,has more effect than ever,on the exercise of power,in our physical world.,After all, even the leader of the free world,needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan,if he wants to get reelected next year. 
 And these platforms,were certainly very helpful,to activists in Tunisia and Egypt,this past spring and beyond.,As Wael Ghonim,,the Google-Egyptian-executive by day,,secret-Facebook-activist by night,,famously said to CNN,after Mubarak stepped down,,"If you want to liberate a society,,just give them the Internet.",But overthrowing a government is one thing,and building a stable democracy,is a bit more complicated.,On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist,who was part of the storming,of the Egyptian state security offices in March.,And many of the agents,shredded as many of the documents as they could,and left them behind in piles.,But some of the files were left behind intact,,and activists, some of them,,found their own surveillance dossiers,full of transcripts of their email exchanges,,their cellphone text message exchanges,,even Skype conversations.,And one activist actually found,a contract from a Western company,for the sale of surveillance technology,to the Egyptian security forces.,And Egyptian activists are assuming,that these technologies for surveillance,are still being used,by the transitional authorities running the networks there. 
 And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May --,not nearly as extensively,as under President Ben Ali.,But you'll see here a blocked page,of what happens when you try to reach,certain Facebook pages and some other websites,that the transitional authorities,have determined might incite violence.,In protest over this,,blogger Slim Amamou,,who had been jailed under Ben Ali,and then became part of the transitional government,after the revolution,,he resigned in protest from the cabinet.,But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia,about how to handle this kind of problem. 
 In fact, on Twitter,,there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution,who said, "Well actually,,we do want democracy and free expression,,but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds,because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.,But the problem is,,how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions,and how do you make sure,that they do not abuse their power?,As Riadh Guerfali,,the veteran digital activist from Tunisia,,remarked over this incident,,"Before, things were simple:,you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.,Today, things are a lot more subtle.",Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends. 
 The reality is,that even in democratic societies today,,we do not have good answers,for how you balance the need,for security and law enforcement on one hand,and protection of civil liberties,and free speech on the other,in our digital networks.,In fact, in the United States,,whatever you may think of Julian Assange,,even people who are not necessarily big fans of his,are very concerned about the way,in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.,Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer,after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,,despite the fact,that Wikileaks had not been charged,,let alone convicted,,of any crime. 
 So we assume,that the Internet is a border-busting technology.,This is a map of social networks worldwide,,and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world --,which is either a good or a bad thing,,depending on how you like,the way Facebook manages its service.,But borders do persist,in some parts of cyberspace.,In Brazil and Japan,,it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.,But if you look at China, Vietnam,and a number of the former Soviet states,,what's happening there is more troubling.,You have a situation,where the relationship between government,and local social networking companies,is creating a situation,where, effectively,,the empowering potential of these platforms,is being constrained,because of these relationships,between companies and government. 
 Now in China,,you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known,,that blocks Facebook,and Twitter and now Google+,and many of the other overseas websites.,And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.,But that's only half of the story.,The other part of the story,are requirements that the Chinese government places,on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,,known as a system of self-discipline.,In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance,of their users.,And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009,where the Internet Society of China presented awards,to the top 20 Chinese companies,that are best at exercising self-discipline --,i.e. policing their content.,And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,,China's dominant search engine,,was one of the recipients. 
 In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet,and directly censor websites.,But this is a website called Rospil,that's an anti-corruption site.,And earlier this year,,there was a troubling incident,where people who had made donations to Rospil,through a payments processing system,called Yandex Money,suddenly received threatening phone calls,from members of a nationalist party,who had obtained details,about donors to Rospil,through members of the security services,who had somehow obtained this information,from people at Yandex Money.,This has a chilling effect,on people's ability to use the Internet,to hold government accountable.,So we have a situation in the world today,where in more and more countries,the relationship between citizens and governments,is mediated through the Internet,,which is comprised primarily,of privately owned and operated services. 
 So the important question, I think,,is not this debate over whether the Internet,is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.,Of course, it's going to empower,whoever is most skilled at using the technology,and best understands the Internet,in comparison with whoever their adversary is.,The most urgent question we need to be asking today,is how do we make sure,that the Internet evolves,in a citizen-centric manner.,Because I think all of you will agree,that the only legitimate purpose of government,is to serve citizens,,and I would argue,that the only legitimate purpose of technology,is to improve our lives,,not to manipulate or enslave us. 
 So the question is,,we know how to hold government accountable.,We don't necessarily always do it very well,,but we have a sense of what the models are,,politically and institutionally, to do that.,How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace,accountable to the public interest,when most CEO's argue,that their main obligation,is to maximize shareholder profit? 
 And government regulation,often isn't helping all that much.,You have situations, for instance, in France,where president Sarkozy,tells the CEO's of Internet companies,,"We're the only legitimate representatives,of the public interest.",But then he goes and champions laws,like the infamous "three-strikes" law,that would disconnect citizens from the Internet,for file sharing,,which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur,on Freedom of Expression,as being a disproportionate violation,of citizens' right to communications,,and has raised questions amongst civil society groups,about whether,some political representatives,are more interested in preserving,the interests of the entertainment industry,than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.,And here in the United Kingdom,there's also concern over,a law called the Digital Economy Act,that's placing more onus,on private intermediaries,to police citizen behavior. 
 So what we need to recognize,is that if we want to have,a citizen-centric Internet in the future,,we need a broader and more sustained,Internet freedom movement.,After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater,as a matter of course,,or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,,just because executives woke up one day,and decided it was the right thing to do.,It was the result of decades of sustained activism,,shareholder advocacy,and consumer advocacy.,Similarly, governments don't enact,intelligent environmental and labor laws,just because politicians wake up one day.,It's the result of very sustained and prolonged,political activism,that you get the right regulations,,and that you get the right corporate behavior.,We need to make the same approach,with the Internet. 
 We also are going to need,political innovation.,Eight hundred years ago, approximately,,the barons of England decided,that the Divine Right of Kings,was no longer working for them so well,,and they forced King John,to sign the Magna Carta,,which recognized,that even the king,who claimed to have divine rule,still had to abide by a basic set of rules.,This set off a cycle,of what we can call political innovation,,which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed --,which was implemented for the first time,by that radical revolutionary government,in America across the pond.,So now we need to figure out,how to build consent of the networked. 
 And what does that look like?,At the moment, we still don't know.,But it's going to require innovation,that's not only going to need,to focus on politics,,on geopolitics,,but it's also going to need,to deal with questions,of business management, investor behavior,,consumer choice,and even software design and engineering.,Each and every one of us has a vital part to play,in building the kind of world,in which government and technology,serve the world's people and not the other way around. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.,I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive,has been around since before the French Revolution.,What's changed,is we now can look at the evidence,,we can compare societies, more and less equal societies,,and see what inequality does.,I'm going to take you through that data,and then explain why,the links I'm going to be showing you exist. 
 But first, see what a miserable lot we are.,(Laughter),I want to start though,with a paradox.,This shows you life expectancy,against gross national income --,how rich countries are on average.,And you see the countries on the right,,like Norway and the USA,,are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.,And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.,There's no suggestion of a relationship there.,But if we look within our societies,,there are extraordinary social gradients in health,running right across society.,This, again, is life expectancy. 
 These are small areas of England and Wales --,the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.,A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.,Even the people just below the top,have less good health,than the people at the top.,So income means something very important,within our societies,,and nothing between them.,The explanation of that paradox,is that, within our societies,,we're looking at relative income,or social position, social status --,where we are in relation to each other,and the size of the gaps between us.,And as soon as you've got that idea,,you should immediately wonder:,what happens if we widen the differences,,or compress them,,make the income differences bigger or smaller? 
 And that's what I'm going to show you.,I'm not using any hypothetical data.,I'm taking data from the U.N. --,it's the same as the World Bank has --,on the scale of income differences,in these rich developed market democracies.,The measure we've used,,because it's easy to understand and you can download it,,is how much richer the top 20 percent,than the bottom 20 percent in each country.,And you see in the more equal countries on the left --,Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden --,the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich,as the bottom 20 percent.,But on the more unequal end --,U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore --,the differences are twice as big.,On that measure, we are twice as unequal,as some of the other successful market democracies. 
 Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.,We collected data on problems with social gradients,,the kind of problems that are more common,at the bottom of the social ladder.,Internationally comparable data on life expectancy,,on kids' maths and literacy scores,,on infant mortality rates, homicide rates,,proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates,,levels of trust,,obesity, mental illness --,which in standard diagnostic classification,includes drug and alcohol addiction --,and social mobility.,We put them all in one index.,They're all weighted equally.,Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.,And there, you see it,in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,,which I shall use over and over again in the data.,The more unequal countries,are doing worse,on all these kinds of social problems.,It's an extraordinarily close correlation.,But if you look at that same index,of health and social problems,in relation to GNP per capita,,gross national income,,there's nothing there,,no correlation anymore. 
 We were a little bit worried,that people might think,we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument,and just manufactured this evidence,,so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal,on the UNICEF index of child well-being.,It has 40 different components,put together by other people.,It contains whether kids can talk to their parents,,whether they have books at home,,what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.,Everything goes into it.,Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.,Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.,Highly significant relationship.,But once again,,if you look at that measure of child well-being,,in relation to national income per person,,there's no relationship,,no suggestion of a relationship. 
 What all the data I've shown you so far says,is the same thing.,The average well-being of our societies,is not dependent any longer,on national income and economic growth.,That's very important in poorer countries,,but not in the rich developed world.,But the differences between us,and where we are in relation to each other,now matter very much.,I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.,Here, for instance, is trust.,It's simply the proportion of the population,who agree most people can be trusted.,It comes from the World Values Survey.,You see, at the more unequal end,,it's about 15 percent of the population,who feel they can trust others.,But in the more equal societies,,it rises to 60 or 65 percent.,And if you look at measures of involvement in community life,or social capital,,very similar relationships,closely related to inequality. 
 I may say, we did all this work twice.,We did it first on these rich, developed countries,,and then as a separate test bed,,we repeated it all on the 50 American states --,asking just the same question:,do the more unequal states,do worse on all these kinds of measures?,So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government,related to inequality.,Very similar scatter,over a similar range of levels of trust.,Same thing is going on.,Basically we found,that almost anything that's related to trust internationally,is related to trust amongst the 50 states,in that separate test bed.,We're not just talking about a fluke. 
 This is mental illness.,WHO put together figures,using the same diagnostic interviews,on random samples of the population,to allow us to compare rates of mental illness,in each society.,This is the percent of the population,with any mental illness in the preceding year.,And it goes from about eight percent,up to three times that --,whole societies,with three times the level of mental illness of others.,And again, closely related to inequality. 
 This is violence.,These red dots are American states,,and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.,But look at the scale of the differences.,It goes from 15 homicides per million,up to 150.,This is the proportion of the population in prison.,There's a about a tenfold difference there,,log scale up the side.,But it goes from about 40 to 400,people in prison.,That relationship,is not mainly driven by more crime.,In some places, that's part of it.,But most of it is about more punitive sentencing,,harsher sentencing.,And the more unequal societies,are more likely also to retain the death penalty.,Here we have children dropping out of high school.,Again, quite big differences.,Extraordinarily damaging,,if you're talking about using the talents of the population. 
 This is social mobility.,It's actually a measure of mobility,based on income.,Basically, it's asking:,do rich fathers have rich sons,and poor fathers have poor sons,,or is there no relationship between the two?,And at the more unequal end,,fathers' income is much more important --,in the U.K., USA.,And in Scandinavian countries,,fathers' income is much less important.,There's more social mobility.,And as we like to say --,and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here --,if Americans want to live the American dream,,they should go to Denmark. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I've shown you just a few things in italics here.,I could have shown a number of other problems.,They're all problems that tend to be more common,at the bottom of the social gradient.,But there are endless problems with social gradients,that are worse in more unequal countries --,not just a little bit worse,,but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.,Think of the expense,,the human cost of that. 
 I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier,where we put it all together,to make two points.,One is that, in graph after graph,,we find the countries that do worse,,whatever the outcome,,seem to be the more unequal ones,,and the ones that do well,seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.,So what we're looking at,is general social disfunction related to inequality.,It's not just one or two things that go wrong,,it's most things. 
 The other really important point I want to make on this graph,is that, if you look at the bottom,,Sweden and Japan,,they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.,The position of women,,how closely they keep to the nuclear family,,are on opposite ends of the poles,in terms of the rich developed world.,But another really important difference,is how they get their greater equality.,Sweden has huge differences in earnings,,and it narrows the gap through taxation,,general welfare state,,generous benefits and so on.,Japan is rather different though.,It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.,It has lower taxes.,It has a smaller welfare state.,And in our analysis of the American states,,we find rather the same contrast.,There are some states that do well through redistribution,,some states that do well,because they have smaller income differences before tax.,So we conclude,that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,,as long as you get there somehow. 
 I am not talking about perfect equality,,I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.,Another really surprising part of this picture,is that it's not just the poor,who are affected by inequality.,There seems to be some truth in John Donne's,"No man is an island.",And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare,how people do in more and less equal countries,at each level in the social hierarchy.,This is just one example.,It's infant mortality.,Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths,according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.,And so it's anachronistically,a classification by fathers' occupations,,so single parents go on their own.,But then where it says "low social class,",that's unskilled manual occupations.,It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,,then the junior non-manual,,going up high to the professional occupations --,doctors, lawyers,,directors of larger companies. 
 You see there that Sweden does better than Britain,all the way across the social hierarchy.,The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.,But even at the top,,there seems to be a small benefit,to being in a more equal society.,We show that on about five different sets of data,covering educational outcomes,and health in the United States and internationally.,And that seems to be the general picture --,that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,,but has some benefits even at the top. 
 But I should say a few words about what's going on.,I think I'm looking and talking,about the psychosocial effects of inequality.,More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,,of being valued and devalued,,respected and disrespected.,And of course, those feelings,of the status competition that comes out of that,drives the consumerism in our society.,It also leads to status insecurity.,We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,,whether we're regarded as attractive, clever,,all that kind of thing.,The social-evaluative judgments increase,,the fear of those social-evaluative judgments. 
 Interestingly,,some parallel work going on in social psychology:,some people reviewed 208 different studies,in which volunteers had been invited,into a psychological laboratory,and had their stress hormones,,their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.,And in the review,,what they were interested in seeing,is what kind of stresses,most reliably raise levels of cortisol,,the central stress hormone.,And the conclusion was,it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat --,threats to self-esteem or social status,in which others can negatively judge your performance.,Those kind of stresses,have a very particular effect,on the physiology of stress. 
 Now we have been criticized.,Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff,and people who find it very surprising.,I should tell you though,that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,,we never pick and choose data.,We have an absolute rule,that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,,it goes into the analysis.,Our data source decides,whether it's reliable data,,we don't.,Otherwise that would introduce bias. 
 What about other countries?,There are 200 studies,of health in relation to income and equality,in the academic peer-reviewed journals.,This isn't confined to these countries here,,hiding a very simple demonstration.,The same countries,,the same measure of inequality,,one problem after another.,Why don't we control for other factors?,Well we've shown you that GNP per capita,doesn't make any difference.,And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature,have controlled for poverty and education,and so on. 
 What about causality?,Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.,We spend a good bit of time.,And indeed, people know the causal links quite well,in some of these outcomes.,The big change in our understanding,of drivers of chronic health,in the rich developed world,is how important chronic stress from social sources,is affecting the immune system,,the cardiovascular system.,Or for instance, the reason why violence,becomes more common in more unequal societies,is because people are sensitive to being looked down on. 
 I should say that to deal with this,,we've got to deal with the post-tax things,and the pre-tax things.,We've got to constrain income,,the bonus culture incomes at the top.,I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees,in any way we can.,I think the take-home message though,is that we can improve the real quality of human life,by reducing the differences in incomes between us.,Suddenly we have a handle,on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies,,and that's exciting. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My topic,is economic growth in China and India.,And the question I want to explore with you,is whether or not,democracy has helped or has hindered,economic growth.,You may say this is not fair,,because I'm selecting two countries,to make a case against democracy.,Actually, exactly the opposite,is what I'm going to do.,I'm going to use these two countries,to make an economic argument for democracy,,rather than against democracy. 
 The first question there,is why China has grown so much faster,than India.,Over the last 30 years,,in terms of the GDP growth rates,,China has grown at twice the rate of India.,In the last five years,,the two countries have begun to converge somewhat,in economic growth.,But over the last 30 years,,China undoubtedly,has done much better than India.,One simple answer,is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.,Look at the skyline of Shanghai.,This is the Pudong area.,The picture on India,is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai,in India.,The idea there,behind these two pictures,is that the Chinese government,can act above rule of law.,It can plan,for the long-term benefits of the country,and in the process,,evict millions of people --,that's just a small technical issue.,Whereas in India, you cannot do that,,because you have to listen to the public.,You're being constrained by the public's opinion.,Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,agrees with that view.,In an interview,printed in the financial press of India,,He said that he wants to make Mumbai,another Shanghai.,This is an Oxford-trained economist,steeped in humanistic values,,and yet he agrees,with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai. 
 So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,,that emphasizes the following features,for promoting economic development:,infrastructures, airports,,highways, bridges, things like that.,And you need a strong government to do that,,because you cannot respect private property rights.,You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.,You need also state ownership,,especially of land assets,,in order to build and roll out infrastructures,very quickly.,The implication of that model,is that democracy,is a hindrance for economic growth,,rather than a facilitator of economic growth.,Here's the key question.,Just how important are infrastructures,for economic growth?,This is a key issue.,If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,,then you would argue a strong government is necessary,to promote growth.,If you believe,that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,,then you will put less emphasis,on strong government. 
 So to illustrate that question,,let me give you two countries.,And for the sake of brevity,,I'll call one country Country 1,and the other country Country 2.,Country 1,has a systematic advantage over Country 2,in infrastructures.,Country 1 has more telephones,,and Country 1 has a longer system of railways.,So if I were to ask you,,"Which is China,and which is India,,and which country has grown faster?",if you believe in the infrastructure view,,then you will say, "Country 1 must be China.,They must have done better, in terms of economic growth.,And Country 2 is possibly India." 
 Actually the country with more telephones,is the Soviet Union,,and the data referred to 1989.,After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,,the country collapsed.,That's not too good.,The picture there is Khrushchev.,I know that in 1989,he no longer ruled the Soviet Union,,but that's the best picture that I can find.,(Laughter),Telephones, infrastructures,do not guarantee you economic growth.,Country 2, that has fewer telephones,,is China.,Since 1989,,the country has performed at a double-digit rate,every year for the last 20 years.,If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union,other than the fact about their telephones,,you would have made a poor prediction,about their economic growth,in the next two decades. 
 Country 1, that has a longer system of railways,,is actually India.,And Country 2 is China.,This is a very little known fact,about the two countries.,Yes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage,over India.,But for many years,,until the late 1990s,,China had an infrastructure disadvantage,vis-a-vis India.,In developing countries,,the most common mode of transportation,is the railways,,and the British built a lot of railways in India.,India is the smaller of the two countries,,and yet it had a longer system of railways,until the late 1990s.,So clearly,,infrastructure doesn't explain,why China did better before the late 1990s,,as compared with India. 
 In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,,the evidence is more supportive of the view,that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.,The economy grows,,government accumulates more resources,,and the government can invest in infrastructure --,rather than infrastructure being a cause,for economic growth.,And this is clearly the story,of the Chinese economic growth.,Let me look at this question more directly.,Is democracy bad for economic growth?,Now let's turn to two countries,,Country A and Country B.,Country A, in 1990,,had about $300 per capita GDP,as compared with Country B,,which had $460 in per capita GDP.,By 2008,,Country A has surpassed Country B,with $700 per capita GDP,as compared with $650 per capita GDP.,Both countries are in Asia. 
 If I were to ask you,,"Which are the two Asian countries?,And which one is a democracy?",you may argue,,"Well, maybe Country A is China,and Country B is India.",In fact, Country A,is democratic India,,and Country B is Pakistan --,the country that has a long period,of military rule.,And it's very common,that we compare India with China.,That's because the two countries,have about the same population size.,But the more natural comparison,is actually between India and Pakistan.,Those two countries are geographically similar.,They have a complicated, but shared common history.,By that comparison,,democracy looks very, very good,in terms of economic growth. 
 So why do economists fall in love,with authoritarian governments?,One reason is the East Asian Model.,In East Asia,,we have had successful economic growth stories,such as Korea, Taiwan,,Hong Kong and Singapore.,Some of these economies,were ruled by authoritarian governments,in the 60s and 70s,and 1980s.,The problem with that view,is like asking all the winners of lotteries,,"Have you won the lottery?",And they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery.",And then you draw the conclusion,the odds of winning the lottery,are 100 percent.,The reason is you never go,and bother to ask the losers,who also purchased lottery tickets,and didn't end up winning the prize. 
 For each of these successful authoritarian governments,in East Asia,,there's a matched failure.,Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't.,Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.,Burma didn't succeed.,The Philippines didn't succeed.,If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,,there's really no support for the idea,that authoritarian governments,hold a systematic edge over democracies,in terms of economic growth.,So the East Asian model,has this massive selection bias --,it is known as selecting on a dependent variable,,something we always tell our students to avoid. 
 So exactly why did China grow so much faster?,I will take you to the Cultural Revolution,,when China went mad,,and compare that country's performance with India,under Indira Gandhi.,The question there is: Which country did better,,China or India?,China was during the Cultural Revolution.,It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,,China out-perfomed India,in terms of GDP growth,by an average of about 2.2 percent every year,in terms of per capita GDP.,So that's when China was mad.,The whole country went mad.,It must mean that the country,had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth,to overcome the negative effects,of the Cultural Revolution.,The advantage the country had,was human capital --,nothing else but human capital. 
 This is the world development index indicator data,in the early 1990s.,And this is the earliest data that I can find.,The adult literacy rate in China,is 77 percent,as compared with 48 percent in India.,The contrast in literacy rates,is especially sharp,between Chinese women and Indian women.,I haven't told you about the definition of literacy.,In China, the definition of literacy,is the ability to read and write,1,500 Chinese characters.,In India, the definition of literacy,,operating definition of literacy,,is the ability, the grand ability,,to write your own name,in whatever language you happen to speak.,The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy,is much more substantial,than the data here indicated.,If you go to other sources of data,such as Human Development Index,,that data series,,go back to the early 1970s,,you see exactly the same contrast.,China held a huge advantage,in terms of human capital,vis-a-vis India. 
 Life expectancies:,as early as 1965,,China had a huge advantage in life expectancy.,On average, as a Chinese in 1965,,you lived 10 years more,than an average Indian.,So if you have a choice,between being a Chinese and being an Indian,,you would want to become a Chinese,in order to live 10 years longer.,If you made that decision in 1965,,the down side of that,is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.,So you have to always think carefully,about these decisions. 
 If you cannot chose your nationality,,then you will want to become an Indian man.,Because, as an Indian man,,you have about two years of life expectancy advantage,vis-a-vis Indian women.,This is an extremely strange fact.,It's very rare among countries,to have this kind of pattern.,It shows the systematic discrimination and biases,in the Indian society,against women.,The good news is, by 2006,,India has closed the gap,between men and women,in terms of life expectancy.,Today, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge,over Indian men.,So India is reverting to the normal.,But India still has a lot of work to do,in terms of gender equality. 
 These are the two pictures,taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province,and garment factories in India.,In China, it's all women.,60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women,in the coastal part of the country,,whereas in India, it's all men.,Financial Times printed this picture,of an Indian textile factory,with the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile.",By looking at these two pictures,,I say no, it won't overtake China for a while.,If you look at other East Asian countries,,women there play a hugely important role,in terms of economic take-off --,in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle,associated with East Asia.,India still has a long way to go,to catch up with China. 
 Then the issue is,,what about the Chinese political system?,You talk about human capital,,you talk about education and public health.,What about the political system?,Isn't it true that the one-party political system,has facilitated economic growth in China?,Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.,It depends on a distinction that you draw,between statics of the political system,and the dynamics of the political system.,Statically, China is a one-party system,,authoritarian -- there's no question about it.,Dynamically, it has changed over time,to become less authoritarian and more democratic.,When you explain change --,for example, economic growth;,economic growth is about change --,when you explain change,,you use other things that have changed to explain change,,rather than using the constant to explain change.,Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change,,but a fixed effect only explains changes,in interaction with the things that change. 
 In terms of the political changes,,they have introduced village elections.,They have increased the security of proprietors.,And they have increased the security,with long-term land leases.,There are also financial reforms in rural China.,There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.,To me, the pace of political changes,is too slow, too gradual.,And my own view is the country,is going to face some substantial challenges,,because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.,But nevertheless,,the system has moved in a more liberal direction,,moved in a more democratic direction. 
 You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.,In fact, when India was growing,at a Hindu rate of growth --,about one percent, two percent a year --,that was when India was least democratic.,Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.,The Indian government owned and operated,all the TV stations.,A little-known fact about India in the 1990s,is that the country,not only has undertaken economic reforms,,the country has also undertaken political reforms,by introducing village self-rule,,privatization of media,and introducing freedom of information acts.,So the dynamic perspective,fits both with China and in India,in terms of the direction. 
 Why do many people believe,that India is still a growth disaster?,One reason,is they are always comparing India with China.,But China is a superstar,in terms of economic growth.,If you are a NBA player,and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,,you're going to look not so impressive.,But that doesn't mean,that you're a bad basketball player.,Comparing with a superstar,is the wrong benchmark.,In fact, if you compare India,with the average developing country,,even before the more recent period,of acceleration of Indian growth --,now India is growing between eight and nine percent --,even before this period,,India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth,among emerging economies.,This is a very impressive record indeed. 
 Let's think about the future:,the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.,Which country has the growth momentum?,China, I believe, still has,some of the excellent raw fundamentals --,mostly the social capital,,the public health,,the sense of egalitarianism,that you don't find in India.,But I believe that India has the momentum.,It has the improving fundamentals.,The government has invested in basic education,,has invested in basic health.,I believe the government should do more,,but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in,is the right direction.,India has the right institutional conditions,for economic growth,,whereas China is still struggling,with political reforms. 
 I believe that the political reforms are a must for China,to maintain its growth.,And it's very important to have political reforms,,to have widely shared benefits of economic growth.,I don't know whether that's going to happen or not,,but I'm an optimist.,Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal,that political reforms will happen in China. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)One of the most common ways of dividing the world,is into those who believe,and those who don't --,into the religious and the atheists.,And for the last decade or so,,it's been quite clear,what being an atheist means.,There have been some very vocal atheists,who've pointed out,,not just that religion is wrong,,but that it's ridiculous.,These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,,have argued --,they've argued that believing in God,is akin to believing in fairies,and essentially that the whole thing,is a childish game. 
 Now I think it's too easy.,I think it's too easy,to dismiss the whole of religion that way.,And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.,And what I'd like to inaugurate today,is a new way of being an atheist --,if you like, a new version of atheism,we could call Atheism 2.0.,Now what is Atheism 2.0?,Well it starts from a very basic premise:,of course, there's no God.,Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits,or angels, etc.,Now let's move on; that's not the end of the story,,that's the very, very beginning. 
 I'm interested in the kind of constituency,that thinks something along these lines:,that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.,I can't believe in the doctrines.,I don't think these doctrines are right.,But," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.,I really like the art of Mantegna.,I really like looking at old churches.,I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament.",Whatever it may be,,you know the kind of thing I'm talking about --,people who are attracted to the ritualistic side,,the moralistic, communal side of religion,,but can't bear the doctrine.,Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.,It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine,and then you can have all the nice stuff,,or you reject the doctrine and,you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland,under the guidance of CNN and Walmart. 
 So that's a sort of tough choice.,I don't think we have to make that choice.,I think there is an alternative.,I think there are ways --,and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious --,of stealing from religions.,If you don't believe in a religion,,there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,,with taking out the best sides of religion.,And for me, atheism 2.0,is about both, as I say,,a respectful and an impious way,of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?",The secular world is full of holes.,We have secularized badly, I would argue.,And a thorough study of religion,could give us all sorts of insights,into areas of life that are not going too well.,And I'd like to run through a few of these today. 
 I'd like to kick off by looking at education.,Now education is a field,the secular world really believes in.,When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,,we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.,Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,,it's also going to make us better people.,You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,,those lyrical claims,that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education --,will make us into nobler and better human beings.,That's a lovely idea.,Interesting where it came from. 
 In the early 19th century,,church attendance in Western Europe,started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.,They asked themselves the following question.,They said, where are people going to find the morality,,where are they going to find guidance,,and where are they going to find sources of consolation?,And influential voices came up with one answer.,They said culture.,It's to culture that we should look,for guidance, for consolation, for morality.,Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare,,the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.,In there, we'll find a lot of the truths,that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.,Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.,They wanted to replace scripture with culture.,And that's a very plausible idea.,It's also an idea that we have forgotten. 
 If you went to a top university --,let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge --,and you said, "I've come here,because I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;,I want to know how to live,",they would show you the way to the insane asylum.,This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning,are in the business of.,Why? They don't think we need it.,They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.,They see us as adults, rational adults.,What we need is information.,We need data, we don't need help. 
 Now religions start from a very different place indeed.,All religions, all major religions,,at various points call us children.,And like children,,they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.,We're only just holding it together.,Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.,But anyway, we're only just holding it together.,And we need help. Of course, we need help.,And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning. 
 You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,,the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,,who went up and down this country delivering sermons,,advising people how they could live.,He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children,and children to their parents,,the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.,He was trying to tell people how they should live,through the medium of sermons,,the classic medium of delivery of religions. 
 Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.,If you said to a modern liberal individualist,,"Hey, how about a sermon?",they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.,I'm an independent, individual person.",What's the difference between a sermon,and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?,Well a sermon wants to change your life,and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.,And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.,The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,,because we are in need of guidance,,morality and consolation --,and religions know that. 
 Another point about education:,we tend to believe in the modern secular world,that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.,Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato,at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,,and that lesson will stick with them.,Religions go, "Nonsense.,You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.,So get on your knees and repeat it.",That's what all religions tell us:,"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day.",Otherwise our minds are like sieves. 
 So religions are cultures of repetition.,They circle the great truths again and again and again.,We associate repetition with boredom.,"Give us the new," we're always saying.,"The new is better than the old.",If I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.,We're just going to run through all the old ones,and watch them five times because they're so true.,We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times,because what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.,Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset. 
 The other things that religions do,is to arrange time.,All the major religions give us calendars.,What is a calendar?,A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year,you will bump into certain very important ideas.,In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,,at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome,and his qualities of humility and goodness,and his generosity to the poor.,You won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.,Now we don't think that way.,In the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.,I'll just come across it.",Nonsense, says the religious world view.,Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,,we need to synchronize encounters.,This comes across also,in the way in which religions set up rituals,around important feelings. 
 Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.,You know, when you look at the Moon,,you think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?",It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.,We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.,Why don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon.",But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,,you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform,and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,,where you will be given poems to read,in honor of the Moon and the passage of time,and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.,You'll be handed rice cakes.,And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon,will have a secure place in your heart.,That's very good. 
 The other thing that religions are really aware of,is: speak well --,I'm not doing a very good job of this here --,but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.,In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker,and still have a great career.,But the religious world doesn't think that way.,What you're saying needs to be backed up,by a really convincing way of saying it. 
 So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church,in the American South,and you listen to how they talk,,my goodness, they talk well.,After every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen.",At the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,,and they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior.",If we were doing it like they do it --,let's not do it, but if we were to do it --,I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture.",And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen.",And at the end of my talk, you would all stand up,and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen.",And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.,All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there. 
 (Applause) 
 The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,,we are also bodies.,And when they teach us a lesson,,they do it via the body.,So for example,,take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.,Jews are very interested in forgiveness,and how we should start anew and start afresh.,They don't just deliver us sermons on this.,They don't just give us books or words about this.,They tell us to have a bath.,So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.,You immerse yourself in the water,,and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.,We don't tend to do that.,Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.,Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two. 
 Let's look at art now.,Now art is something that in the secular world,,we think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.,A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.,We sometimes hear it said,that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.,You've heard that saying.,Now I think that the potential is there,,but we've completely let ourselves down.,And the reason we've let ourselves down,is that we're not properly studying,how religions handle art. 
 The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world,that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:,The first idea is that art should be for art's sake --,a ridiculous idea --,an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble,and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.,I couldn't disagree more.,The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,,that artists shouldn't say what they're up to,,because if they said it, it might destroy the spell,and we might find it too easy.,That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum --,let's admit it --,is, "I don't know what this is about.",But if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.,But that feeling of puzzlement is structural,to contemporary art. 
 Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.,They have no trouble telling us what art is about.,Art is about two things in all the major faiths.,Firstly, it's trying to remind you,of what there is to love.,And secondly, it's trying to remind you,of what there is to fear and to hate.,And that's what art is.,Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.,So as you walk around a church,,or a mosque or a cathedral,,what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,,through your eyes, through your senses,,truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind. 
 Essentially it's propaganda.,Rembrandt is a propagandist,in the Christian view.,Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.,We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.,Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.,And if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all. 
 My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.,And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum --,if I was a museum curator,,I would make a room for love, a room for generosity.,All works of art are talking to us about things.,And if we were able to arrange spaces,where we could come across works,where we would be told, use these works of art,to cement these ideas in your mind,,we would get a lot more out of art.,Art would pick up the duty that it used to have,and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.,Art should be one of the tools,by which we improve our society.,Art should be didactic. 
 Let's think of something else.,The people in the modern world, in the secular world,,who are interested in matters of the spirit,,in matters of the mind,,in higher soul-like concerns,,tend to be isolated individuals.,They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.,And they tend to be on their own.,They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.,And they get depressed and they get sad on their own.,And they don't really change much. 
 Now think about religions, think about organized religions.,What do organized religions do?,They group together, they form institutions.,And that has all sorts of advantages.,First of all, scale, might.,The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year,according to the Wall Street Journal.,These are massive machines.,They're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,,and they're highly disciplined. 
 These are all very good qualities.,We recognize them in relation to corporations.,And corporations are very like religions in many ways,,except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.,They're selling us shoes and cars.,Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff --,the therapists, the poets --,are on their own and they have no power,,they have no might.,So religions are the foremost example,of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.,Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,,but we can admire the institutional way,in which they're doing it. 
 Books alone, books written by lone individuals,,are not going to change anything.,We need to group together.,If you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.,And that's what religions do.,They are multinational, as I say,,they are branded, they have a clear identity,,so they don't get lost in a busy world.,That's something we can learn from. 
 I want to conclude.,Really what I want to say,is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,,there is something to learn from the example of religion --,even if you don't believe any of it.,If you're involved in anything that's communal,,that involves lots of people getting together,,there are things for you in religion.,If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,,look at pilgrimage.,Look very closely at pilgrimage.,We haven't begun to scratch the surface,of what travel could be,because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.,If you're in the art world,,look at the example of what religions are doing with art.,And if you're an educator in any way,,again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.,You may not agree with the ideas,,but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so. 
 So really my concluding point,is you may not agree with religion,,but at the end of the day,,religions are so subtle, so complicated,,so intelligent in many ways,that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;,they're for all of us. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,,because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways,to be ridiculed in some quarters. 
 AB: You can get shot by both sides.,You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,,and you can get shot by those who fully believe. 
 CA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment. 
 AB: Indeed. 
 CA: But you left out one aspect of religion,that a lot of people might say,your agenda could borrow from,,which is this sense --,that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious --,of spiritual experience,,of some kind of connection,with something that's bigger than you are.,Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0? 
 AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people,who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,,something else?",And I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?",And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,,that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,,need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?,Science and just observation,gives us that feeling without it,,so I don't feel the need.,The universe is large and we are tiny,,without the need for further religious superstructure.,So one can have so-called spiritual moments,without belief in the spirit. 
 CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.,How many people here would say,that religion is important to them?,Is there an equivalent process,by which there's a sort of bridge,between what you're talking about and what you would say to them? 
 AB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life,and these can be plugged.,It's not as though, as I try to suggest,,it's not as though either you have religion,and then you have to accept all sorts of things,,or you don't have religion,and then you're cut off from all these very good things.,It's so sad that we constantly say,,"I don't believe so I can't have community,,so I'm cut off from morality,,so I can't go on a pilgrimage.",One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?",And that's really the spirit of my talk.,There's so much we can absorb.,Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion. 
 CA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community,who are atheists.,But probably most people in the community,certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon,and want to find the language,to have a constructive dialogue,and to feel like we can actually talk to each other,and at least share some things in common.,Are we foolish to be optimistic,about the possibility of a world,where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry,of divide and war,,that there could be bridging? 
 AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.,Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.,It's seen as hypocrisy.,But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist,and someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,",you politely ignore it.,You move on.,Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things,,because you have a shared view on so many things,,and you politely differ.,And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.,They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement. 
 CA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing,that's not a religion but something else,,does it need a leader,,and are you volunteering to be the pope? 
 (Laughter) 
 AB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of,is individual leaders.,It doesn't need it.,What I've tried to lay out is a framework,and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.,I've sketched a sort of broad framework.,But wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.,If you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.,So it's a wiki project. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: Alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later. 
 (Applause)What is going on,in this baby's mind?,If you'd asked people this 30 years ago,,most people, including psychologists,,would have said that this baby was irrational,,illogical, egocentric --,that he couldn't take the perspective of another person,or understand cause and effect.,In the last 20 years,,developmental science has completely overturned that picture.,So in some ways,,we think that this baby's thinking,is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists. 
 Let me give you just one example of this.,One thing that this baby could be thinking about,,that could be going on in his mind,,is trying to figure out,what's going on in the mind of that other baby.,After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do,is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.,And maybe the hardest thing of all,is to figure out that what other people think and feel,isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.,Anyone who's followed politics can testify,to how hard that is for some people to get.,We wanted to know,if babies and young children,could understand this really profound thing about other people.,Now the question is: How could we ask them?,Babies, after all, can't talk,,and if you ask a three year-old,to tell you what he thinks,,what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue,about ponies and birthdays and things like that.,So how do we actually ask them the question? 
 Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.,What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I --,was actually to give the babies two bowls of food:,one bowl of raw broccoli,and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.,Now all of the babies, even in Berkley,,like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.,(Laughter),But then what Betty did,was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.,And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.,So half the time, she acted,as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli --,just like a baby and any other sane person.,But half the time,,what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli,and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.,I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm.",And then she would take a little bit of the crackers,,and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.,I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck.",So she'd act as if what she wanted,was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.,We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.,And then she would simply put her hand out and say,,"Can you give me some?" 
 So the question is: What would the baby give her,,what they liked or what she liked?,And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,,just barely walking and talking,,would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,,but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.,On the other hand,,15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time,if she acted as if she liked the broccoli,,like they couldn't figure this out.,But then after they stared for a long time,,they would just give her the crackers,,what they thought everybody must like.,So there are two really remarkable things about this.,The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies,have already discovered,this really profound fact about human nature,,that we don't always want the same thing.,And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things,to help other people get what they wanted. 
 Even more remarkably though,,the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this,suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned,this deep, profound fact about human nature,in the three months from when they were 15 months old.,So children both know more and learn more,than we ever would have thought.,And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years,that's actually demonstrated it. 
 The question you might ask though is:,Why do children learn so much?,And how is it possible for them to learn so much,in such a short time?,I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,,they seem pretty useless.,And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,,because we have to put so much time and energy,into just keeping them alive.,But if we turn to evolution,for an answer to this puzzle,of why we spend so much time,taking care of useless babies,,it turns out that there's actually an answer.,If we look across many, many different species of animals,,not just us primates,,but also including other mammals, birds,,even marsupials,like kangaroos and wombats,,it turns out that there's a relationship,between how long a childhood a species has,and how big their brains are compared to their bodies,and how smart and flexible they are. 
 And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.,On one side,is a New Caledonian crow.,And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,,are incredibly smart birds.,They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.,And this is a bird on the cover of science,who's learned how to use a tool to get food.,On the other hand,,we have our friend the domestic chicken.,And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys,are basically as dumb as dumps.,So they're very, very good at pecking for grain,,and they're not much good at doing anything else.,Well it turns out that the babies,,the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.,They depend on their moms,to drop worms in their little open mouths,for as long as two years,,which is a really long time in the life of a bird.,Whereas the chickens are actually mature,within a couple of months.,So childhood is the reason,why the crows end up on the cover of Science,and the chickens end up in the soup pot. 
 There's something about that long childhood,that seems to be connected,to knowledge and learning.,Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?,Well some animals, like the chicken,,seem to be beautifully suited,to doing just one thing very well.,So they seem to be beautifully suited,to pecking grain in one environment.,Other creatures, like the crows,,aren't very good at doing anything in particular,,but they're extremely good,at learning about laws of different environments. 
 And of course, we human beings,are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.,We have bigger brains relative to our bodies,by far than any other animal.,We're smarter, we're more flexible,,we can learn more,,we survive in more different environments,,we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.,And our babies and children are dependent on us,for much longer than the babies of any other species.,My son is 23.,(Laughter),And at least until they're 23,,we're still popping those worms,into those little open mouths. 
 All right, why would we see this correlation?,Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,,is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,,but it has one big disadvantage.,And that one big disadvantage,is that, until you actually do all that learning,,you're going to be helpless.,So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you,and be saying to yourself,,"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?",You want to know all that,before the mastodons actually show up.,And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem,is with a kind of division of labor.,So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.,We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.,And then as adults,,we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children,and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world. 
 So one way of thinking about it,is that babies and young children,are like the research and development division of the human species.,So they're the protected blue sky guys,who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,,and we're production and marketing.,We have to take all those ideas,that we learned when we were children,and actually put them to use.,Another way of thinking about it,is instead of thinking of babies and children,as being like defective grownups,,we should think about them,as being a different developmental stage of the same species --,kind of like caterpillars and butterflies --,except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies,who are flitting around the garden and exploring,,and we're the caterpillars,who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path. 
 If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn --,and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,,that's what they're for --,we might expect,that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.,And in fact, the baby's brain,seems to be the most powerful learning computer,on the planet.,But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.,And there's been a revolution,in our understanding of machine learning recently.,And it all depends on the ideas of this guy,,the Reverend Thomas Bayes,,who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.,And essentially what Bayes did,was to provide a mathematical way,using probability theory,to characterize, describe,,the way that scientists find out about the world.,So what scientists do,is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.,They go out and test it against the evidence.,The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.,Then they test that new hypothesis,and so on and so forth.,And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.,And that mathematics is at the core,of the best machine learning programs that we have now.,And some 10 years ago,,I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing. 
 So if you want to know what's going on,underneath those beautiful brown eyes,,I think it actually looks something like this.,This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.,So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations,with conditional probabilities that they're revising,to figure out how the world works.,All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.,Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,,they look extremely stupid.,How could it be that children are doing statistics? 
 So to test this we used a machine that we have,called the Blicket Detector.,This is a box that lights up and plays music,when you put some things on it and not others.,And using this very simple machine,,my lab and others have done dozens of studies,showing just how good babies are,at learning about the world.,Let me mention just one,that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.,If I showed you this detector,,you would be likely to think to begin with,that the way to make the detector go,would be to put a block on top of the detector.,But actually, this detector,works in a bit of a strange way.,Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector,,something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,,the detector will actually activate two out of three times.,Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,,it will only activate two out of six times.,So the unlikely hypothesis,actually has stronger evidence.,It looks as if the waving,is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.,So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,,and we just asked them to make it go.,And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence,to wave the object on top of the detector. 
 Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.,The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.,They're just learning how to count.,But unconsciously,,they're doing these quite complicated calculations,that will give them a conditional probability measure.,And the other interesting thing,is that they're using that evidence,to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,,that seems very unlikely to begin with.,And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,,we've show that four year-olds are actually better,at finding out an unlikely hypothesis,than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.,So in these circumstances,,the children are using statistics to find out about the world,,but after all, scientists also do experiments,,and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.,When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything",or else "playing." 
 And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently,that have shown this playing around,is really a kind of experimental research program.,Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.,What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.,And what she did was show children,that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,,and then she showed them an anomaly.,And what you'll see,is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses,in the space of two minutes. 
 (Video) Boy: How about this?,Same as the other side. 
 Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified. 
 (Laughter) 
 Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing. 
 AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out. 
 Boy: What's making this light up.,(Laughter),I don't know. 
 AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair. 
 (Laughter) 
 Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,,and this needs to be like this. 
 AG: Okay, hypothesis two. 
 Boy: That's why.,Oh. 
 (Laughter) 
 AG: Now this is his next idea.,He told the experimenter to do this,,to try putting it out onto the other location.,Not working either. 
 Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,,not here.,Oh, the bottom of this box,has electricity in here,,but this doesn't have electricity. 
 AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis. 
 Boy: It's lighting up.,So when you put four.,So you put four on this one to make it light up,and two on this one to make it light up. 
 AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis. 
 Now that is a particularly --,that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,,but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.,If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,,what they really do is do a series of experiments.,This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds. 
 Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?,What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies,who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?,Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,,a lot of them have said,that babies and young children were barely conscious,if they were conscious at all.,And I think just the opposite is true.,I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.,Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.,And adults' attention and consciousness,look kind of like a spotlight.,So what happens for adults,is we decide that something's relevant or important,,we should pay attention to it.,Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to,becomes extremely bright and vivid,,and everything else sort of goes dark.,And we even know something about the way the brain does this. 
 So what happens when we pay attention,is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,,sends a signal,that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,,more plastic, better at learning,,and shuts down activity,in all the rest of our brains.,So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.,If we look at babies and young children,,we see something very different.,I think babies and young children,seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness,than a spotlight of consciousness.,So babies and young children are very bad,at narrowing down to just one thing.,But they're very good at taking in lots of information,from lots of different sources at once.,And if you actually look in their brains,,you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters,that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,,and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.,So when we say that babies and young children,are bad at paying attention,,what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.,So they're bad at getting rid,of all the interesting things that could tell them something,and just looking at the thing that's important.,That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,,that we might expect,from those butterflies who are designed to learn. 
 Well if we want to think about a way,of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,,I think the best thing is think about cases,where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before --,when we fall in love with someone new,,or when we're in a new city for the first time.,And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,,it expands,,so that those three days in Paris,seem to be more full of consciousness and experience,than all the months of being,a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.,And by the way, that coffee,,that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,,actually mimics the effect,of those baby neurotransmitters.,So what's it like to be a baby?,It's like being in love,in Paris for the first time,after you've had three double-espressos.,(Laughter),That's a fantastic way to be,,but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now it's good to be a grownup.,I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.,It's good to be a grownup.,We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.,And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort,into making babies think like adults do.,But if what we want is to be like those butterflies,,to have open-mindedness, open learning,,imagination, creativity, innovation,,maybe at least some of the time,we should be getting the adults,to start thinking more like children. 
 (Applause)Humans have long held a fascination,for the human brain.,We chart it, we've described it,,we've drawn it,,we've mapped it.,Now just like the physical maps of our world,that have been highly influenced by technology --,think Google Maps,,think GPS --,the same thing is happening for brain mapping,through transformation. 
 So let's take a look at the brain.,Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,,they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at,when someone shows you a brain.",Typically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.,And this outer layer, this is the vasculature,,which is incredible, around a human brain.,This is the blood vessels.,20 percent of the oxygen,coming from your lungs,,20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart,,is servicing this one organ.,That's basically, if you hold two fists together,,it's just slightly larger than the two fists. 
 Scientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,,learned that they could track blood flow,to map non-invasively,where activity was going on in the human brain.,So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain,,which is just turning around there.,There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.,It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.,On the side here, this is temporal cortex.,This is the area where primary auditory processing --,so you're hearing my words,,you're sending it up into higher language processing centers.,Towards the front of the brain,is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making --,it's the last to mature in late adulthood.,This is where all your decision-making processes are going on.,It's the place where you're deciding right now,you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner. 
 So if you take a deeper look at the brain,,one of the things, if you look at it in cross-section,,what you can see,is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.,But there's actually a lot of structure there.,It's cells and it's wires all wired together.,So about a hundred years ago,,some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.,And that's shown here in the the very light blue.,You can see areas,where neuronal cell bodies are being stained.,And what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there.,So the outer part of that brain,is the neocortex.,It's one continuous processing unit, if you will.,But you can also see things underneath there as well.,And all of these blank areas,are the areas in which the wires are running through.,They're probably less cell dense.,So there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.,And as you can see, they're very non-uniformly distributed.,And how they're distributed really contributes,to their underlying function.,And of course, as I mentioned before,,since we can now start to map brain function,,we can start to tie these into the individual cells. 
 So let's take a deeper look.,Let's look at neurons.,So as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons.,There are also these smaller cells as you'll see.,These are support cells -- astrocytes glia.,And the nerves themselves,are the ones who are receiving input.,They're storing it, they're processing it.,Each neuron is connected via synapses,to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.,And each neuron itself,is largely unique.,The unique character of both individual neurons,and neurons within a collection of the brain,are driven by fundamental properties,of their underlying biochemistry.,These are proteins.,They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.,They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.,And they're controlling,basically everything that the nervous system has to do. 
 So if we zoom in to an even deeper level,,all of those proteins,are encoded by our genomes.,We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.,We get one from mom, one from dad.,And on these chromosomes,are roughly 25,000 genes.,They're encoded in the DNA.,And the nature of a given cell,driving its underlying biochemistry,is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes,are turned on,and at what level they're turned on. 
 And so our project,is seeking to look at this readout,,understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on.,So in order to undertake such a project,,we obviously need brains.,So we sent our lab technician out.,We were seeking normal human brains.,What we actually start with,is a medical examiner's office.,This a place where the dead are brought in.,We are seeking normal human brains.,There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.,We want to make sure,that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,,they died a somewhat natural death,with no injury to the brain,,no history of psychiatric disease,,no drugs on board --,we do a toxicology workup.,And we're very careful,about the brains that we do take.,We're also selecting for brains,in which we can get the tissue,,we can get consent to take the tissue,within 24 hours of time of death.,Because what we're trying to measure, the RNA --,which is the readout from our genes --,is very labile,,and so we have to move very quickly. 
 One side note on the collection of brains:,because of the way that we collect,,and because we require consent,,we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains.,Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life.,And men are much more likely,to have their significant other, spouse, give consent,than the other way around. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the first thing that we do at the site of collection,is we collect what's called an MR.,This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI.,It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.,So we collect this MR.,And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.,The next thing we do,is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.,This maps the large cabling in the brain.,And again, you can think of this,as almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.,The brain is removed from the skull,,and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.,And those are frozen solid,,and they're shipped to Seattle.,And in Seattle, we take these --,this is a whole human hemisphere --,and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.,There's a blade here that's going to cut across,a section of the tissue,and transfer it to a microscope slide.,We're going to then apply one of those stains to it,,and we scan it.,And then what we get is our first mapping. 
 So this is where experts come in,and they make basic anatomic assignments.,You could consider this state boundaries, if you will,,those pretty broad outlines.,From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces,,which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.,And this is just showing this here --,this frozen tissue, and it's being cut.,This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.,And remember, it's frozen.,And so you can see here,,old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.,We take a microscope slide.,Then we very carefully melt onto the slide.,This will then go onto a robot,that's going to apply one of those stains to it.,And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. 
 So again this is what they can see under the microscope.,You can see collections and configurations,of large and small cells,in clusters and various places.,And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments.,And they can make basically what's a reference atlas.,This is a more detailed map. 
 Our scientists then use this,to go back to another piece of that tissue,and do what's called laser scanning microdissection.,So the technician takes the instructions.,They scribe along a place there.,And then the laser actually cuts.,You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off.,You can see on the microscope slide here,,that's what's happening in real time.,There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.,We take that tissue,,we purify the RNA out of it,using some basic technology,,and then we put a florescent tag on it.,We take that tagged material,and we put it on to something called a microarray. 
 Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you,,but each one of these individual dots,is actually a unique piece of the human genome,that we spotted down on glass.,This has roughly 60,000 elements on it,,so we repeatedly measure various genes,of the 25,000 genes in the genome.,And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it,,we get a unique fingerprint, if you will,,quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample. 
 Now we do this over and over again,,this process for any given brain.,We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.,This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.,It's involved in learning and memory.,And it contributes to about 70 samples,of those thousand samples.,So each sample gets us about 50,000 data points,with repeat measurements, a thousand samples. 
 So roughly, we have 50 million data points,for a given human brain.,We've done right now,two human brains-worth of data.,We've put all of that together,into one thing,,and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.,It's basically a large data set of information,that's all freely available to any scientist around the world.,They don't even have to log in to come use this tool,,mine this data, find interesting things out with this.,So here's the modalities that we put together.,You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.,Here's the MR. It provides the framework.,There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn,,it allows you to zoom in,,it allows you to highlight individual structures. 
 But most importantly,,we're now mapping into this anatomic framework,,which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on.,So the red levels,are where a gene is turned on to a great degree.,Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.,And each gene gives us a fingerprint.,And remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome,and have all of that data available. 
 So what can scientists learn about this data?,We're just starting to look at this data ourselves.,There's some basic things that you would want to understand.,Two great examples are drugs,,Prozac and Wellbutrin.,These are commonly prescribed antidepressants.,Now remember, we're assaying genes.,Genes send the instructions to make proteins.,Proteins are targets for drugs.,So drugs bind to proteins,and either turn them off, etc.,So if you want to understand the action of drugs,,you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to,,and also in the ways you don't want them to.,In the side effect profile, etc.,,you want to see where those genes are turned on.,And for the first time, we can actually do that.,We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too. 
 So now we can look throughout the brain.,We can see this unique fingerprint.,And we get confirmation.,We get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on --,for something like Prozac,,in serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected --,but we also get to see the whole thing.,We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before,,and we see these genes turned on there.,It's as interesting a side effect as it could be.,One other thing you can do with such a thing,is you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise,,because there's unique fingerprint,,we can actually scan through the entire genome,and find other proteins,that show a similar fingerprint.,So if you're in drug discovery, for example,,you can go through,an entire listing of what the genome has on offer,to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize. 
 Most of you are probably familiar,with genome-wide association studies,in the form of people covering in the news,saying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes,which affect X.",And so these kinds of studies,are routinely published by scientists,and they're great. They analyze large populations.,They look at their entire genomes,,and they try to find hot spots of activity,that are linked causally to genes.,But what you get out of such an exercise,is simply a list of genes.,It tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where.,And so it's very important for those researchers,that we've created this resource.,Now they can come in,and they can start to get clues about activity.,They can start to look at common pathways --,other things that they simply haven't been able to do before. 
 So I think this audience in particular,can understand the importance of individuality.,And I think every human,,we all have different genetic backgrounds,,we all have lived separate lives.,But the fact is,our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.,We're similar at the genetic level.,And what we're finding,is actually, even at the brain biochemical level,,we are quite similar.,And so this shows it's not 99 percent,,but it's roughly 90 percent correspondence,at a reasonable cutoff,,so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.,And then we find some outliers,,some things that lie beyond the cloud.,And those genes are interesting,,but they're very subtle.,So I think it's an important message,to take home today,that even though we celebrate all of our differences,,we are quite similar,even at the brain level. 
 Now what do those differences look like?,This is an example of a study that we did,to follow up and see what exactly those differences were --,and they're quite subtle.,These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type.,These are two genes that we found as good examples.,One is called RELN -- it's involved in early developmental cues.,DISC1 is a gene,that's deleted in schizophrenia.,These aren't schizophrenic individuals,,but they do show some population variation.,And so what you're looking at here,in donor one and donor four,,which are the exceptions to the other two,,that genes are being turned on,in a very specific subset of cells.,It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell,that's telling us a gene is turned on there.,Whether or not that's due,to an individual's genetic background or their experiences,,we don't know.,Those kinds of studies require much larger populations. 
 So I'm going to leave you with a final note,about the complexity of the brain,and how much more we have to go.,I think these resources are incredibly valuable.,They give researchers a handle,on where to go.,But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.,We're certainly going to be looking at more.,I'll just close by saying,that the tools are there,,and this is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent.,This is the new frontier, if you will.,And so for those who are undaunted,,but humbled by the complexity of the brain,,the future awaits. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)So I'm a doctor, but I kind of slippednsideways into research,,and now I'm an epidemiologist.,And nobody really knowsnwhat epidemiology is.,Epidemiology is the sciencenof how we know in the real world,if something is goodnfor you or bad for you.,And it's best understood through example,as the science of those crazy,nwacky newspaper headlines.,And these are just some of the examples. 
 These are from the Daily Mail.,Every country in the worldnhas a newspaper like this.,It has this bizarre,nongoing philosophical project,of dividing all the inanimatenobjects in the world,into the ones that either causenor prevent cancer.,Here are some of the thingsnthey said cause cancer:,divorce, Wi-Fi, toiletries and coffee.,Some things they say prevent cancer:,crusts, red pepper, licorice and coffee.,So you can see there are contradictions.,Coffee both causes and prevents cancer.,As you start to read on, you can see,that maybe there's somenpolitical valence behind some of this.,For women, houseworknprevents breast cancer,,but for men, shoppingncould make you impotent. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we know that we need to startnunpicking the science behind this.,And what I hope to show is that unpickingnthe evidence behind dodgy claims,isn't a kind of nasty, carping activity;,it's socially useful.,But it's also an extremely valuablenexplanatory tool,,because real science is aboutncritically appraising the evidence,for somebody else's position.,That's what happens in academic journals,,it's what happensnat academic conferences --,the Q&amp;A session after a postdocnpresents data is often a bloodbath.,And nobody minds that;nwe actively welcome it.,It's like a consentingnintellectual S&amp;M activity. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what I'm going to show younis all of the main things,,all of the main features of my discipline,nevidence-based medicine.,And I will talk you through all of thesenand demonstrate how they work,,exclusively using examplesnof people getting stuff wrong. 
 We'll start with the absolute weakestnform of evidence known to man,,and that is authority.,In science, we don't care how many lettersnyou have after your name --,we want to know what your reasons arenfor believing something.,How do you know that somethingnis good for us or bad for us?,But we're also unimpressed by authoritynbecause it's so easy to contrive.,This is somebody callednDr. Gillian McKeith, PhD,,or, to give her fullnmedical title, Gillian McKeith. 
 (Laughter) 
 Again, every countrynhas somebody like this.,She is our TV diet guru.,She has five seriesnof prime-time television,,giving out very lavishnand exotic health advice.,She, it turns out, has a non-accreditedncorrespondence course PhD,from somewhere in America.,She also boasts that she's a certifiednprofessional member,of the American Associationnof Nutritional Consultants,,which sounds very glamorous;nyou get a certificate.,This one belongs to my dead cat, Hettie.nShe was a horrible cat.,You go to the website, fill out the form,,give them $60, it arrives in the post.,That's not the only reasonnwe think this person is an idiot.,She also says things likeneat lots of dark green leaves,,they contain chlorophyllnand really oxygenate your blood.,And anybody who's donenschool biology remembers,that chlorophyll and chloroplastsnonly make oxygen in sunlight,,and it's quite dark in your bowelsnafter you've eaten spinach. 
 Next, we need proper science,nproper evidence.,So: "Red wine can helpnprevent breast cancer.",This is a headlinenfrom The Daily Telegraph in the UK.,"A glass of red wine a day could helpnprevent breast cancer.",So you find this paper, and findnthat it is a real piece of science.,It's a description of the changesnin the behavior of one enzyme,when you drip a chemicalnextracted from some red grape skin,onto some cancer cells,in a dish on a benchnin a laboratory somewhere.,And that's a really useful thingnto describe in a scientific paper.,But on the question of your own personalnrisk of getting breast cancer,if you drink red wine,,it tells you absolutely bugger all.,Actually, it turns outnthat your risk of breast cancer,increases slightly with every amountnof alcohol you drink.,So what we want are studiesnin real human people. 
 And here's another example.,This is from Britain's "leading"ndiet nutritionist in the Daily Mirror,,our second-biggest selling newspaper.,"An Australian study in 2001nfound that olive oil,,in combination with fruits,nvegetables and pulses,,offers measurable protectionnagainst skin wrinklings,",and give the advice:,"If you eat olive oil and vegetables,nyou'll have fewer wrinkles.",They helpfully tell younhow to find the paper,,and what you findnis an observational study.,Obviously, nobody has been ablento go back to 1930,,get all the people bornnin one maternity unit,,and half of them eat lotsnof fruit and veg and olive oil,,half of them eat McDonald's,,and then we see how many wrinklesnyou've got later. 
 You have to take a snapshotnof how people are now.,And what you find is, of course:,people who eat veg and olive oilnhave fewer wrinkles.,But that's because people who eatnfruit and veg and olive oil are freaks --,they're not normal, they're like you;nthey come to events like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 They're posh, they're wealthy,nless likely to have outdoor jobs,,less likely to do manual labor,,they have better social support,nare less likely to smoke;,for a host of fascinating, interlocking,social, political and cultural reasons,,they're less likely to have wrinkles.,That doesn't meannit's the vegetables or olive oil. 
 (Laughter) 
 So ideally, what you wantnto do is a trial.,People think they're familiarnwith the idea of a trial.,Trials are old; the first onenwas in the Bible, Daniel 1:12.,It's straightforward: take a bunchnof people, split them in half,,treat one group one way,nthe other group, the other way.,A while later, you seenwhat happened to each of them.,I'm going to tell you about one trial,,which is probablynthe most well-reported trial,in the UK news media over the past decade.,This is the trial of fish oil pills.,The claim: fish oil pills improvenschool performance and behavior,in mainstream children.,They said, "We did a trial.,All the previous ones were positive,nthis one will be too.",That should ring alarm bells:,if you know the answer to your trial,nyou shouldn't be doing one.,Either you've rigged it by design,,or you've got enough data so there'snno need to randomize people anymore. 
 So this is what they were goingnto do in their trial:,They were taking 3,000 children,,they were going to give them these hugenfish oil pills, six of them a day,,and then, a year later, measurentheir school exam performance,and compare their performance,against what they predictedntheir exam performance would have been,if they hadn't had the pills.,Now, can anybody spotna flaw in this design? 
 (Laughter) 
 And no professorsnof clinical trial methodology,are allowed to answer this question.,So there's no control group.,But that sounds really techie, right?nThat's a technical term.,The kids got the pills,nand their performance improved. 
 What else could it possiblynbe if it wasn't the pills?,They got older; we all develop over time.,And of course, there's the placebo effect,,one of the most fascinating thingsnin the whole of medicine.,It's not just taking a pillnand performance or pain improving;,it's about our beliefs and expectations,nthe cultural meaning of a treatment.,And this has been demonstratednin a whole raft of fascinating studies,comparing one kind of placebonagainst another.,So we know, for example,,that two sugar pills a daynare a more effective treatment,for gastric ulcers,than one sugar pill.,Two sugar pills a day beats one a day.,That's an outrageousnand ridiculous finding, but it's true.,We know from three different studiesnon three different types of pain,that a saltwater injectionnis a more effective treatment,than a sugar pill, a dummy pillnwith no medicine in it,,not because the injection or pillsndo anything physically to the body,,but because an injection feelsnlike a much more dramatic intervention.,So we know that our beliefsnand expectations can be manipulated,,which is why we do trialsnwhere we control against a placebo,,where one half of the peoplenget the real treatment,,and the other half get placebo. 
 But that's not enough.,What I've just shown you are examples,of the very simplenand straightforward ways,that journalists and food supplementnpill peddlers and naturopaths,can distort evidencenfor their own purposes.,What I find really fascinating,is that the pharmaceutical industrynuses exactly the same kinds,of tricks and devices,,but slightly more sophisticatednversions of them,,in order to distort the evidencenthey give to doctors and patients,,and which we use to makenvitally important decisions. 
 So firstly, trials against placebo:,everybody thinks a trialnshould be a comparison,of your new drug against placebo.,But in a lot of situations that's wrong;,often, we already have a good treatmentncurrently available.,So we don't want to knownthat your alternative new treatment,is better than nothing,,but that it's better than the bestnavailable treatment we have.,And yet, repeatedly, you consistentlynsee people doing trials,still against placebo.,And you can get licensednto bring your drug to market,with only data showingnthat it's better than nothing,,which is useless for a doctor like mentrying to make a decision. 
 But that's not the only waynyou can rig your data.,You can also rig your data,by making the thing you comparenyour new drug against,really rubbish.,You can give the competing drugnin too low a dose,,so people aren't properly treated.,You can give the competing drugnin too high a dose,,so people get side effects.,And this is exactly what happened,with antipsychotic medicationnfor schizophrenia.,Twenty years ago, a new generationnof antipsychotic drugs were brought in;,the promise was they would havenfewer side effects.,So people set about doing trialsnof the new drugs against the old drugs.,But they gave the old drugsnin ridiculously high doses:,20 milligrams a day of haloperidol.,And it's a foregone conclusionnif you give a drug at that high a dose,,it will have more side effects,nand your new drug will look better. 
 Ten years ago, history repeated itself,,when risperidone, the firstnof the new-generation antipsychotic drugs,,came off copyright,nso anybody could make copies.,Everybody wanted to show their drugnwas better than risperidone,,so you see trials comparingnnew antipsychotic drugs,against risperidonenat eight milligrams a day.,Again, not an insane dose,nnot an illegal dose,,but very much at the high end of normal.,So you're bound to makenyour new drug look better.,And so it's no surprise that overall,,industry-funded trialsnare four times more likely,to give a positive result,than independently sponsored trials. 
 But -- and it's a big but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 it turns out,,when you look at the methodsnused by industry-funded trials,,that they're actually betternthan independently sponsored trials.,And yet, they always managento get the result that they want.,So how does this work? 
 (Laughter) 
 How can we explainnthis strange phenomenon?,Well, it turns out that what happens,is the negative datangoes missing in action;,it's withheld from doctors and patients.,And this is the most importantnaspect of the whole story.,It's at the topnof the pyramid of evidence.,We need to have all of the datanon a particular treatment,to know whether or notnit really is effective.,There are two different ways you can spotnwhether some data has gone missing.,You can use statisticsnor you can use stories.,I prefer statistics,nso that's what I'll do first. 
 This is a funnel plot.,A funnel plot is a very clevernway of spotting,if small negative trials have disappeared,nhave gone missing in action.,This is a graph of all of the trials donenon a particular treatment.,As you go up towards the top of the graph,,what you see is each dot is a trial.,As you go up, those are bigger trials,nso they've got less error;,they're less likely to be randomly falsenpositives or negatives.,So they all cluster together.,The big trials are closernto the true answer.,Then as you go further down at the bottom,,what you can see is, on this side,nspurious false negatives,,and over on this side,nspurious false positives.,If there is publication bias,,if small negative trialsnhave gone missing in action,,you can see it on one of these graphs.,So you see herenthat the small negative trials,that should be on the bottom leftnhave disappeared.,This is a graph demonstratingnthe presence of publication bias,in studies of publication bias.,And I think that's the funniestnepidemiology joke you will ever hear. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's how you can prove it statistically.,But what about stories?,Well, they're heinous, they really are.,This is a drug called reboxetine.,This is a drug which I, myself,nhave prescribed to patients.,And I'm a very nerdy doctor.,I hope I go out of my way,to try and read and understandnall the literature.,I read the trials on this.,They were all positive,nall well-conducted.,I found no flaw.,Unfortunately, it turned out,nthat many of these trials were withheld.,In fact, 76 percent of all of the trialsnthat were done on this drug,were withheld from doctors and patients.,Now if you think about it,,if I tossed a coin a hundred times,,and I'm allowed to withhold from younthe answers half the times,,then I can convince younthat I have a coin with two heads.,If we remove half of the data,,we can never know what the trueneffect size of these medicines is. 
 And this is not an isolated story.,Around half of all of the trial datanon antidepressants has been withheld,,but it goes way beyond that.,The Nordic Cochrane Group were tryingnto get ahold of the data on that,to bring it all together.,The Cochrane Groups are an internationalnnonprofit collaboration,that produce systematic reviews,of all of the datanthat has ever been shown.,And they need to have accessnto all of the trial data.,But the companies withheldnthat data from them.,So did the European Medicines Agency --,for three years. 
 This is a problem that is currentlynlacking a solution.,And to show how big it goes,nthis is a drug called Tamiflu,,which governments around the world,have spent billionsnand billions of dollars on.,And they spend that moneynon the promise that this is a drug,which will reduce the ratenof complications with flu.,We already have the data,showing it reduces the durationnof your flu by a few hours.,But I don't care about that,ngovernments don't care.,I'm sorry if you have the flu,nI know it's horrible,,but we're not going to spendnbillions of dollars,trying to reduce the durationnof your flu symptoms by half a day.,We prescribe these drugs.,We stockpile them for emergencies,on the understanding they'll reducenthe number of complications,,which means pneumonia and death.,The infectious diseases Cochrane Group,nwhich are based in Italy,,has been trying to getnthe full data in a usable form,out of the drug companies,,so they can make a full decision,about whether this drugnis effective or not,,and they've not been ablento get that information.,This is undoubtedlynthe single biggest ethical problem,facing medicine today.,We cannot make decisionsnin the absence of all of the information. 
 So it's a little bit difficult from there,to spin in some kindnof positive conclusion.,But I would say this:,I think that sunlight,is the best disinfectant.,All of these thingsnare happening in plain sight,,and they're all protectednby a force field of tediousness.,And I think, with allnof the problems in science,,one of the best things that we can do,is to lift up the lid,nfinger around at the mechanics,and peer in. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I am a conductor,,and I'm here today,to talk to you about trust.,My job depends upon it.,There has to be, between me and the orchestra,,an unshakable bond of trust,,born out of mutual respect,,through which we can spin a musical narrative,that we all believe in. 
 Now in the old days, conducting, music making,,was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.,Up to and around about the Second World War,,conductors were invariably dictators --,these tyrannical figures,who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,,within an inch of their lives.,But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on,,music has moved on with it.,We now have a more democratic view and way of making music --,a two-way street.,I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense,of the outer architecture of that music,,within which there is then immense personal freedom,for the members of the orchestra to shine. 
 For myself, of course,,I have to completely trust my body language.,That's all I have at the point of sale.,It's silent gesture.,I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing. 
 (Music) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the Scottish Ensemble. 
 (Applause) 
 So in order for all this to work,,obviously I have got to be in a position of trust.,I have to trust the orchestra,,and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.,Think about it: when you're in a position of not trusting,,what do you do?,You overcompensate.,And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.,You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.,And the bigger your gesture gets,,the more ill-defined, blurry,and, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.,You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore, only ridicule. 
 And I remember at the beginning of my career,,again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,,I would be going completely insane on the podium,,trying to engender a small scale crescendo really,,just a little upsurge in volume.,Bugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.,I spent a lot of time in those early years,weeping silently in dressing rooms.,And how futile seemed the words of advice to me,from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis,who said, "Conducting, Charles,,is like holding a small bird in your hand.,If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.,If you hold it too loosely, it flies away.",I have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird. 
 Now a fundamental,and really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,,has been my adventures in South Africa,,the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,,but a country which, through its musical culture,,has taught me one fundamental lesson:,that through music making,can come deep levels,of fundamental life-giving trust.,Back in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,to form a new opera company.,So I went out there, and I auditioned,,mainly in rural township locations, right around the country.,I heard about 2,000 singers,and pulled together a company,of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,,the majority of whom were black,,but there were a handful of white performers. 
 Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period,that one of those white performers,had, in his previous incarnation,,been a member of the South African police force.,And in the last years of the old regime,,he would routinely be detailed to go into the township,to aggress the community.,Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,,the general atmosphere.,Let's be under no illusions.,In South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trust,is that between a white policeman,and the black community.,So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?,Simply through singing.,We sang, we sang,,we sang,,and amazingly new trust grew,,and indeed friendship blossomed.,And that showed me such a fundamental truth,,that music making and other forms of creativity,can so often go to places,where mere words cannot. 
 So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.,One of them was "Carmen.",We then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen,",which we recorded and shot outside on location,in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.,The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,,which is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.,It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" --,literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha.",I want to play you a tiny clip of it now,for no other reason than to give you proof positive,that there is nothing tiny about South African music making. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Something which I find utterly enchanting,about South African music making,is that it's so free.,South Africans just make music really freely.,And I think, in no small way,,that's due to one fundamental fact:,they're not bound to a system of notation.,They don't read music.,They trust their ears.,You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.,And then, as if by magic,,they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune,because they can.,Now those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,,I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music --,that somehow it's all about skill and systems.,Therefore it's the exclusive preserve,of an elite, talented body.,And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet,probably engages with music on a daily basis. 
 And if I can broaden this out for a second,,I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room,would be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,,about movies, probably about literature.,But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion,about a piece of classical music?,Why is this?,And what I'm going to say to you now,is I'm just urging you to get over,this supreme lack of self-confidence,,to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,,you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,,fiber, DNA,,what makes a great piece of music great.,I've got a little experiment I want to try with you. 
 Did you know,that TED is a tune?,A very simple tune based on three notes -- T, E, D.,Now hang on a minute.,I know you're going to say to me, "T doesn't exist in music.",Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system,,which composers have been using for hundreds of years,,which proves actually that it does.,If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G --,and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:,H, I, J, K, L, M, N,,O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go.,T, see it's the same as F in music.,So T is F.,So T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.,Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session,had enshrined in its heart,the theme, which is TED.,Have a listen. 
 (Music) 
 Do you hear it?,Or do I smell some doubt in the room?,Okay, we'll play it for you again now,,and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.,If you'll pardon the expression. 
 (Music) 
 Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.,I think we should make this even more explicit.,Ladies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea.,Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think?,I think we need to sing for our tea.,We're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D.,Will you have a go for me? 
 Audience: T, E, D. 
 Charles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.,Shall we try that one again?,And look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.,T, E, D. 
 Audience: T, E, D. 
 CH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.) 
 There I am like a bloody windmill again, you see.,Now we're going to put that in the context of the music.,The music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that.,(Music),One more time,,with feeling, ladies and gentlemen.,You won't make the key otherwise.,Well done, ladies and gentlemen.,It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir,,not a bad debut at all. 
 Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment,that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you,,because it is all about changing perceptions,,and, indeed, building a new level of trust.,The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,,which as you can imagine,,if you don't have an experience of it yourself,,is quite a big thing to take on board.,But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,,aside from her very existence,,is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community,that was hitherto hidden,,the community of disabled people.,And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible,how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt,that disability is no barrier,to the highest levels of sporting achievement.,Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth,,which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large,to come to a position of trust,,to really believe that disability and sports can go together,in a convincing and interesting fashion. 
 So I find myself asking:,where is music in all of this?,You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people,,in the U.K. alone,,with massive musical potential.,So I decided to create a platform for that potential.,It's going to be Britain's first ever,national disabled orchestra.,It's called Paraorchestra. 
 I'm going to show you a clip now,of the very first improvisation session that we had.,It was a really extraordinary moment.,Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians.,Normally when you improvise --,and I do it all the time around the world --,there's this initial period of horror,,like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring,,an awful pregnant silence.,Then suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there,and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.,No one's listening. No one's trusting.,No one's responding to each other.,Now in this room with these four disabled musicians,,within five minutes,a rapt listening, a rapt response,and some really insanely beautiful music. 
 (Video) (Music) 
 Nicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.,I'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.,And I was born without my left hand -- right hand.,Can I do that one again? 
 (Music) 
 Lyn: When I'm making music,,I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane.,I become alive. 
 (Music) 
 Clarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument again,than walk.,There's so much joy and things,I could get from playing an instrument and performing.,It's removed some of my paralysis. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,,so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.,Paraorchestra is the name of that project.,If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way,to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,,please let me know.,Now my parting shot,comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,,wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century --,spent the bulk of his life,in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.,Now this prince loved his music,,but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,,which is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,,a place called Esterhazy --,a long way from the big city of Vienna. 
 Now one day in 1772,,the prince decreed that the musicians' families,,the orchestral musicians' families,,were no longer welcome in the castle.,They weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna --,as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.,You can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.,Haydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.,So given the prince loved his music,,Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point. 
 And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.,And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.,I'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tip,from the orchestral performance,,and the musicians were reunited with their families.,But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,,that where there is trust,,there is music -- by extension life.,Where there is no trust,,the music quite simply withers away. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer,and put off aging?,This is a dream of the ages.,But scientists have for a long time,thought this just was never going to be possible.,They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it --,kind of like an old shoe.,But if you look in nature,,you see that different kinds of animals,can have really different lifespans.,Now these animals are different from one another,,because they have different genes.,So that suggests,that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,,are genes for aging,,genes that allow them to have different lifespans.,So if there are genes like that,,then you can imagine that,,if you could change one of the genes in an experiment,,an aging gene,,maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.,And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.,And if they exist and you can find them,,then maybe one could eventually do something about it. 
 So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.,And we didn't study any of these animals.,Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,,which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.,And we were really optimistic that we could find something,because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.,So we started to change genes at random,,looking for long-lived animals.,And we were very lucky to find,that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2,doubled the lifespan of the little worm. 
 So you can see in black, after a month --,they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them,for studies of aging --,in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.,But at that time,,most of the mutant worms are still alive.,And it isn't until twice as long,that they're all dead.,And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.,So the first thing you're going to see,is the normal worm,when it's about college student age -- a young adult.,It's quite a cute little fellow.,And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.,So this animal is going to live twice as long.,Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.,It's active. You can't tell the difference really.,And they can be completely fertile --,have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do. 
 Now get out your handkerchiefs here.,You're going to see, in just two weeks,,the normal worms are old.,You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.,But everything else is just lying there.,The animal's clearly in the nursing home.,And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.,You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans --,which probably most of you haven't seen one --,you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting? 
 So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.,And now here is the daf-2 mutant.,One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.,It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;,it's going skiing.,This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.,It takes this worm two days,to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.,And when I tell people about this,,they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person,who looks really good for being 90 or 80.,But it's really more like this:,let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s --,and you're a bachelor and you're dating people.,And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.,And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?",She says, "I'm 60.",That's what it's like. And you would never know.,You would never know, until she told you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay.,So what is the daf-2 gene?,Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,,they're instructions to make a protein that does something.,And the daf-2 gene,encodes a hormone receptor.,So what you see in the picture there,is a cell with a hormone receptor in red,punching through the edge of the cell.,So part of it is like a baseball glove.,Part of it's on the outside,,and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.,And the other part is on the inside,where it sends signals into the cell. 
 Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor,telling the inside of the cell?,I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,,that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;,the animal lives longer.,So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor,is to speed up aging.,That's what that arrow means.,It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.,So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,,speeding up aging.,So this is altogether really, really interesting.,It says that aging is subject to control by the genes,,and specifically by hormones.,So what kind of hormones are these?,There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.,You know about a lot of them.,These hormones are similar,to hormones that we have in our bodies.,The daf-2 hormone receptor,is very similar to the receptor,for the hormone insulin and IGF-1. 
 Now you've all heard of at least insulin.,Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients,into your tissues after you eat a meal.,And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.,So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,,but our studies suggested,that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about --,maybe they also affect aging.,And it's looking like that's the case. 
 So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,,people who worked on other kinds of animals,started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,,the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,,will they live longer?,And that is the case in flies.,If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.,And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.,So it's an ancient pathway,,because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution,such that it still works in all these animals.,And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people. 
 So maybe it's working in people the same way.,And there are hints of this.,So for example, there was one study that was done,in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.,And just like any population,,most of the people live to be about 70 or 80,,but some live to be 90 or 100.,And what they found,was that people who lived to 90 or 100,were more likely to have daf-2 mutations --,that is, changes in the gene,that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.,And these changes made the gene not act as well,as the normal gene would have acted.,It damaged the gene.,So those are hints,suggesting that humans are susceptible,to the effects of the hormones for aging. 
 So the next question, of course, is:,Is there any effect on age-related disease?,As you age, you're much more likely,to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,,heart disease, all sorts of diseases.,It turns out that these long-lived mutants,are more resistant to all these diseases.,They hardly get cancer,,and when they do it's not as severe.,So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,,that they're still young,,so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?,So it suggests,that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take,to replicate some of these effects in humans,,maybe we would have a way,of combating lots of different age-related diseases,all at once.,So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?,How could that work? 
 Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,,a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA,that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,,and repair damage.,And the way that they're switched on,is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.,So in a daf-2 mutant --,you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.,The receptor isn't working as well.,Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue,has gone into the nucleus --,that little compartment there in the middle of the cell --,and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.,You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.,And it's just sitting on one of them. 
 So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.,And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,,genes I call carrot-giver genes,,whose protein products,actually help other proteins to function well --,to fold correctly and function correctly.,And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell,and recycle them if they're damaged.,DNA repair genes,are more active in these animals.,And the immune system is more active.,And many of these different genes, we've shown,,actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.,So it's really interesting.,These animals have within them,the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.,They have the ability,to protect themselves from many kinds of damage,,which we think makes them live longer. 
 So what about the normal worm?,Well when the daf-2 receptor is active,,then it triggers a series of events,that prevent FOXO,from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.,So it can't turn the genes on.,That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,,until we have the daf-2 mutant.,But what good is this for the worm?,Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones,are hormones that are particularly active,under favorable conditions -- in the good times --,when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.,Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.,You can store the food, use it for energy,,grow, etc. 
 But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,,the levels of these hormones drop --,for example, having limited food supply.,And that, we think,,is registered by the animal as a danger signal,,a signal that things are not okay,and that it should roll out its protective capacity.,So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,,and that triggers the expression of these genes,that improves the ability of the cell,to protect itself and repair itself.,And that's why we think the animals live longer. 
 So you can think of FOXO,as being like a building superintendent.,So maybe he's a little bit lazy,,but he's there, he's taking care of the building.,But it's deteriorating.,And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.,So he doesn't actually do anything himself.,He gets on the telephone --,just like FOXO gets on the DNA --,and he calls up,the roofer, the window person,,the painter, the floor person.,And they all come and they fortify the house.,And then the hurricane comes through,,and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.,And not only that, it can also just last longer,,even if there isn't a hurricane.,So that's the concept here,for how we think this life extension ability exists. 
 Now the really cool thing about FOXO,is that there are different forms of it.,We all have FOXO genes,,but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.,Just like we all have eyes,,but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.,And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene,that have found to be more frequently present,in people who live to be 90 or 100.,And that's the case all over the world,,as you can see from these stars.,And each one of these stars represents a population,where scientists have asked,,"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes,among people who live a really long time?" and there are.,We don't know the details of how this works,,but we do know then,that FOXO genes can impact,the lifespan of people.,And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,,we can increase the health and longevity of people. 
 So this is really exciting to me.,A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms,to affect lifespan,,and here it affects lifespan in people.,So we've been trying in our lab now,to develop drugs,that will activate this FOXO cell,using human cells now,in order to try and come up with drugs,that will delay aging and age-related diseases.,And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work. 
 There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.,And for at least one of them, there is a drug.,There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,,like the insulin pathway.,And mutations that damage the TOR gene --,just like the daf-2 mutations --,extend lifespan in worms,and flies and mice.,But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin,that binds to the TOR protein,and inhibits its activity.,And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse --,even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,,that old for a mouse --,if you give the mouse rapamycin,,it will live longer. 
 Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.,It is a drug for people,,but the reason is it suppresses the immune system.,So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.,So this may not be the perfect drug,for staying young longer.,But still, here in the year 2011,,there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age,that will extend their lifespan,,which comes out of this science,that's been done in all these different animals. 
 So I'm really optimistic,,and I think it won't be too long, I hope,,before this age-old dream begins to come true. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.,Let me get this straight.,Although you're looking for a drug,that can solve aging,in old men like me,,what you could do now pretty well in the lab,,if you were allowed ethically,,is start a human life from scratch,with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer? 
 CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about,would not change the genes,,they would just bind to the protein itself,and change its activity.,So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.,You could change the genes in principle.,There isn't the technology to do that.,But I don't think that's a good idea.,And the reason is,that these hormones,,like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,,they're essential.,If you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.,So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully,to get the benefits without getting any problems.,And I think that's much better,,that kind of control would be much better as a drug.,And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO,that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1,that might even be safer. 
 MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...,(Laughter),There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,,which is a negligible senescence.,There are some creatures on this planet already,that don't really do aging.,Just move to one side for us, if you would. 
 CK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.,For example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.,And they grow to be about this size.,And they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.,And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,,you can't tell the difference, just by looking,,between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.,And the 70 year-old ones,,actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,,and they also have more progeny every year.,And there are other examples of these kinds of animals,,like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.,And nobody knows if they really can live forever,,or what keeps them from aging.,It's not clear. 
 If you look at birds, which live a long time,,cells from the birds tend to be more resistant,to a lot of different environmental stresses,like high temperature,or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.,And our long-lived mutants are too.,They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.,So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,,which are set to run really quickly in the worm,,have a different normal set point,in something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.,And maybe they're even set really differently,in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know. 
 MR: But what you're talking about here,is not extending human lifespan,by preventing death,,so much as extending human youthspan. 
 CK: Yes, that's right.,It's more like, say, if you were a dog.,You notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human,and you think, "Why isn't this human getting old?",They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.,It's more like that.,But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human. 
 MR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon. 
 (Applause)I'm a neuroscientist.,And in neuroscience,,we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain.,But I want to start with the easiest question,and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life,,because it's a fundamental question,if we want to understand brain function.,And that is, why do we and other animals,have brains?,Not all species on our planet have brains,,so if we want to know what the brain is for,,let's think about why we evolved one.,Now you may reason that we have one,to perceive the world or to think,,and that's completely wrong.,If you think about this question for any length of time,,it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain.,We have a brain for one reason and one reason only,,and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements.,There is no other reason to have a brain.,Think about it.,Movement is the only way you have,of affecting the world around you.,Now that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating.,But apart from that,,everything else goes through contractions of muscles. 
 So think about communication --,speech, gestures, writing, sign language --,they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles.,So it's really important to remember,that sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important,,but they're only important,to either drive or suppress future movements.,There can be no evolutionary advantage,to laying down memories of childhood,or perceiving the color of a rose,if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life. 
 Now for those who don't believe this argument,,we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain,,but the clinching evidence is this animal here --,the humble sea squirt.,Rudimentary animal, has a nervous system,,swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life.,And at some point of its life,,it implants on a rock.,And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock, which it never leaves,,is to digest its own brain and nervous system,for food.,So once you don't need to move,,you don't need the luxury of that brain.,And this animal is often taken,as an analogy to what happens at universities,when professors get tenure,,but that's a different subject. 
 (Applause) 
 So I am a movement chauvinist.,I believe movement is the most important function of the brain --,don't let anyone tell you that it's not true.,Now if movement is so important,,how well are we doing,understanding how the brain controls movement?,And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem.,But we can look at how well we're doing,by thinking about how well we're doing building machines,which can do what humans can do. 
 Think about the game of chess.,How well are we doing determining what piece to move where?,If you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail,,against IBM's Deep Blue,,well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win.,And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time.,That problem is solved.,What about the problem,of picking up a chess piece,,dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board?,If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today,,the answer is simple:,the child wins easily.,There's no competition at all. 
 Now why is that top problem so easy,and the bottom problem so hard?,One reason is a very smart five year-old,could tell you the algorithm for that top problem --,look at all possible moves to the end of the game,and choose the one that makes you win.,So it's a very simple algorithm.,Now of course there are other moves,,but with vast computers we approximate,and come close to the optimal solution.,When it comes to being dexterous,,it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous.,And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world,,which has a lot of problems. 
 But let me show you cutting-edge robotics.,Now a lot of robotics is very impressive,,but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages.,So this is the end of a Ph.D. project,from one of the best robotics institutes.,And the student has trained this robot,to pour this water into a glass.,It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it.,But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human.,Now if you want this robot to do a different task,,that's another three-year Ph.D. program.,There is no generalization at all,from one task to another in robotics. 
 Now we can compare this,to cutting-edge human performance.,So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox,winning the world record for cup stacking.,Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.,It's a high school sport,where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack,against the clock in a prescribed order.,And this is her getting the world record in real time.,(Laughter),(Applause),And she's pretty happy.,We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that,,and that's what we'd like to know. 
 So in my group, what we try to do,is reverse engineer how humans control movement.,And it sounds like an easy problem.,You send a command down, it causes muscles to contract.,Your arm or body moves,,and you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on.,The trouble is,these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be.,So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult,is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.,Now by noise, I do not mean sound.,We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense,meaning a random noise corrupting a signal.,So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio,and you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear,,that was the noise.,But more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal. 
 So for example, if you put your hand under a table,and try to localize it with your other hand,,you can be off by several centimeters,due to the noise in sensory feedback.,Similarly, when you put motor output on movement output,,it's extremely noisy.,Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts,,just aim for the same spot over and over again.,You have a huge spread due to movement variability.,And more than that, the outside world, or task,,is both ambiguous and variable.,The teapot could be full, it could be empty.,It changes over time.,So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise. 
 Now this noise is so great,that society places a huge premium,on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise.,So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball,into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick,,our society will be willing to reward you,with hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 Now what I want to convince you of,is the brain also goes through a lot of effort,to reduce the negative consequences,of this sort of noise and variability.,And to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework,which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years,called Bayesian decision theory.,And it's more recently a unifying way,to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty.,And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions. 
 So let's think about the inference.,You want to generate beliefs about the world.,So what are beliefs?,Beliefs could be: where are my arms in space?,Am I looking at a cat or a fox?,But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities.,So we're going to represent a belief,with a number between zero and one --,zero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain.,And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty.,And the key idea to Bayesian inference,is you have two sources of information,from which to make your inference.,You have data,,and data in neuroscience is sensory input.,So I have sensory input, which I can take in to make beliefs.,But there's another source of information, and that's effectively prior knowledge.,You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories.,And the point about Bayesian decision theory,is it gives you the mathematics,of the optimal way to combine,your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence,to generate new beliefs. 
 And I've put the formula up there.,I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.,And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.,And what it really says, and what you want to estimate,,is the probability of different beliefs,given your sensory input.,So let me give you an intuitive example.,Imagine you're learning to play tennis,and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce,as it comes over the net towards you.,There are two sources of information,Bayes' rule tells you.,There's sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information,,and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot.,But you know that your senses are not perfect,,and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land,shown by that cloud of red,,representing numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1. 
 That information is available in the current shot,,but there's another source of information,not available on the current shot,,but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis,,and that's that the ball doesn't bounce,with equal probability over the court during the match.,If you're playing against a very good opponent,,they may distribute it in that green area,,which is the prior distribution,,making it hard for you to return.,Now both these sources of information carry important information.,And what Bayes' rule says,is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green,to get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses,,and that's my belief.,So it's the optimal way of combining information. 
 Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago,,we showed this is exactly what people do,when they learn new movement skills.,And what it means,is we really are Bayesian inference machines.,As we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down,,but we also learn,about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is,,and then combine those,in a real Bayesian way. 
 Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula.,And what this part really says,is I have to predict the probability,of different sensory feedbacks,given my beliefs.,So that really means I have to make predictions of the future.,And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions,of the sensory feedback it's going to get.,And moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions,by what you do.,And to do that, I'll tell you,about how the brain deals with sensory input.,So you send a command out,,you get sensory feedback back,,and that transformation is governed,by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus. 
 But you can imagine looking inside the brain.,And here's inside the brain.,You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator,,of the physics of your body and your senses.,So as you send a movement command down,,you tap a copy of that off,and run it into your neural simulator,to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.,So as I shake this ketchup bottle,,I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.,And if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing. 
 Well why would I bother doing that?,I'm going to get the same feedback anyway.,Well there's good reasons.,Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle,,someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.,Now I get an extra source of sensory information,due to that external act.,So I get two sources.,I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it,,but from my senses' point of view,,that is combined together into one source of information. 
 Now there's good reason to believe,that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events.,Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant,than feeling everything that's going on inside my body.,So one way to reconstruct that,is to compare the prediction --,which is only based on your movement commands --,with the reality.,Any discrepancy should hopefully be external.,So as I go around the world,,I'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off.,Everything left over is external to me. 
 What evidence is there for this?,Well there's one very clear example,where a sensation generated by myself feels very different,then if generated by another person.,And so we decided the most obvious place to start,was with tickling.,It's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself,as well as other people can.,But it hasn't really been shown, it's because you have a neural simulator,,simulating your own body,and subtracting off that sense.,So we can bring the experiments of the 21st century,by applying robotic technologies to this problem.,And in effect, what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot,,and they're going to move that back and forward.,And then we're going to track that with a computer,and use it to control another robot,,which is going to tickle their palm with another stick.,And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things,including ticklishness. 
 I'll show you just one part of our study.,And here I've taken away the robots,,but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward.,And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay.,Either no time delay,,in which case light would just tickle your palm,,or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second.,So the important point here,is the right hand always does the same things -- sinusoidal movement.,The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.,All we're playing with is a tempo causality.,And as we go from naught to 0.1 second,,it becomes more ticklish.,As you go from 0.1 to 0.2,,it becomes more ticklish at the end.,And by 0.2 of a second,,it's equivalently ticklish,to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything.,So whatever is responsible for this cancellation,is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality.,And based on this illustration, we really convinced ourselves in the field,that the brain's making precise predictions,and subtracting them off from the sensations. 
 Now I have to admit, these are the worst studies my lab has ever run.,Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes,,you need large numbers of subjects,with these stars making them significant.,So we were looking for a much more objective way,to assess this phenomena.,And in the intervening years I had two daughters.,And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys,,they get into fights --,which started with one of them doing something to the other, the other retaliating.,It quickly escalates.,And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force.,Now when I screamed at my children to stop,,sometimes they would both say to me,the other person hit them harder. 
 Now I happen to know my children don't lie,,so I thought, as a neuroscientist,,it was important how I could explain,how they were telling inconsistent truths.,And we hypothesize based on the tickling study,that when one child hits another,,they generate the movement command.,They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off.,So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have --,rather like the tickling.,Whereas the passive recipient,doesn't make the prediction, feels the full blow.,So if they retaliate with the same force,,the first person will think it's been escalated. 
 So we decided to test this in the lab.,(Laughter),Now we don't work with children, we don't work with hitting,,but the concept is identical.,We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game.,And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other.,And the game is very simple.,We started with a motor,with a little lever, a little force transfuser.,And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers,for three seconds and then it stops.,And that player's been told, remember the experience of that force,and use your other finger,to apply the same force,down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that.,And player two's been told, remember the experience of that force.,Use your other hand to apply the force back down.,And so they take it in turns,to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward. 
 But critically,,they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms.,So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by.,And what we've measured,is the force as a function of terms.,And if we look at what we start with,,a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns,,perfect would be that red line.,And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this --,a 70 percent escalation in force,on each go.,So it really suggests, when you're doing this --,based on this study and others we've done --,that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences,and underestimating the force it's producing.,So it re-shows the brain makes predictions,and fundamentally changes the precepts.,So we've made inferences, we've done predictions,,now we have to generate actions.,And what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs,,the action should in some sense be optimal. 
 But we've got a problem.,Tasks are symbolic -- I want to drink, I want to dance --,but the movement system has to contract 600 muscles,in a particular sequence.,And there's a big gap,between the task and the movement system.,So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways.,So think about just a point to point movement.,I could choose these two paths,out of an infinite number of paths.,Having chosen a particular path,,I can hold my hand on that path,as infinitely many different joint configurations.,And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration,either very stiff or very relaxed.,So I have a huge amount of choice to make.,Now it turns out, we are extremely stereotypical.,We all move the same way pretty much. 
 And so it turns out we're so stereotypical,,our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry,to decode this stereotyping.,So if I take some dots,and set them in motion with biological motion,,your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on.,Now this is a bunch of dots moving.,You will know what this person is doing,,whether happy, sad, old, young -- a huge amount of information.,If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit,,you would have absolutely no idea what's going on. 
 So why is it,that we move the particular ways we do?,Well let's think about what really happens.,Maybe we don't all quite move the same way.,Maybe there's variation in the population.,And maybe those who move better than others,have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation.,So in evolutionary scales, movements get better.,And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning. 
 So what is it about a movement which is good or bad?,Imagine I want to intercept this ball.,Here are two possible paths to that ball.,Well if I choose the left-hand path,,I can work out the forces required,in one of my muscles as a function of time.,But there's noise added to this.,So what I actually get, based on this lovely, smooth, desired force,,is a very noisy version.,So if I pick the same command through many times,,I will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time.,So what I can show you here,is how the variability of the movement will evolve,if I choose that way.,If I choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example --,then I'll have a different command, different noise,,playing through a noisy system, very complicated.,All we can be sure of is the variability will be different.,If I move in this particular way,,I end up with a smaller variability across many movements.,So if I have to choose between those two,,I would choose the right one because it's less variable. 
 And the fundamental idea,is you want to plan your movements,so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise.,And one intuition to get,is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here,gets bigger as the force gets bigger.,So you want to avoid big forces as one principle.,So we've shown that using this,,we can explain a huge amount of data --,that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements,so as to minimize negative consequences of noise. 
 So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there,and evolved to control movement.,And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that.,But it's also relevant,for disease and rehabilitation.,There are many diseases which effect movement.,And hopefully if we understand how we control movement,,we can apply that to robotic technology.,And finally, I want to remind you,,when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks,,the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain,is really quite dramatic. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan.,So you're a movement -- (DW: Chauvinist.) -- chauvinist.,Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about --,the dreaming, the yearning, the falling in love and all these things --,are a kind of side show, an accident? 
 DW: No, no, actually I think they're all important,to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end.,So I think people who study sensation or memory,without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood.,The fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example,,is probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life.,You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement. 
 CA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally,,could get real insight,by saying, where does movement play in this game? 
 DW: So people have found out for example,that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision,is a mistake.,You have to study vision with the realization,of how the movement system is going to use vision.,And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way. 
 CA: Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed. 
 (Applause)Do you know,that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts,deployed worldwide?,And these are base stations.,And we also have,more than five billion,of these devices here.,These are cellular mobile phones.,And with these mobile phones,,we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data,every month.,This is a 6 with 14 zeroes --,a very large number.,And wireless communications,has become a utility,like electricity and water.,We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now --,in our private lives, in our business lives.,And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly,,to switch off the mobile phone at events like this,for good reasons.,And it's this importance,why I decided to look into the issues,that this technology has,,because it's so fundamental to our lives. 
 And one of the issues is capacity.,The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves --,in particular, radio waves.,And radio waves are limited.,They are scarce; they are expensive;,and we only have a certain range of it.,And it's this limitation,that doesn't cope,with the demand of wireless data transmissions,and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.,And we are simply running out of spectrum.,There's another problem.,That is efficiency.,These 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations,,consume a lot of energy.,And mind you, most of the energy,is not used to transmit the radio waves,,it is used to cool the base stations.,Then the efficiency of such a base station,is only at about five percent.,And that creates a big problem.,Then there's another issue that you're all aware of.,You have to switch off your mobile phone,during flights.,In hospitals, they are security issues.,And security is another issue.,These radio waves penetrate through walls.,They can be intercepted,,and somebody can make use of your network,if he has bad intentions. 
 So these are the main four issues.,But on the other hand,,we have 14 billion of these:,light bulbs, light.,And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.,So let's look at this in the context,of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.,You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.,X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.,Then there's ultraviolet light.,it's good for a nice suntan,,but otherwise dangerous for the human body.,Infrared --,due to eye safety regulations,,can be only used with low power.,And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.,And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.,It's light,,and light has been around for many millions of years.,And in fact, it has created us,,has created life,,has created all the stuff of life.,So it's inherently safe to use.,And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications? 
 Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.,I compared the radio waves spectrum --,the size of it --,with the size of the visible light spectrum.,And guess what?,We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum,,which is there for us to use.,So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum,,let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.,We have 1.4 million,expensively deployed,,inefficient radio cellular base stations.,And multiply that by 10,000,,then you end up at 14 billion.,14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.,So we have the infrastructure there.,Look at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.,Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs. 
 Can we use them for communications?,Yes.,What do we need to do?,The one thing we need to do,is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs,,florescent lights,,with this new technology of LED,,LED light bulbs.,An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.,And it has a very nice acute property.,Its intensity can be modulated,at very high speeds,,and it can be switched off at very high speeds.,And this is a fundamental basic property,that we exploit,with our technology.,So let's show how we do that.,Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum --,go to remote controls.,You all know remote controls have an infrared LED --,basically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.,And it creates a simple, low-speed data stream,in 10,000 bits per second,,20,000 bits per second.,Not usable for a YouTube video. 
 What we have done,is we have developed a technology,with which we can furthermore,replace the remote control of our light bulb.,We transmit with our technology,,not only a single data stream,,we transmit thousands of data streams,in parallel,,at even higher speeds.,And the technology we have developed --,it's called SIM OFDM.,And it's spacial modulation --,these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details --,but this is how we enabled,that light source,to transmit data. 
 You will say, "Okay, this is nice --,a slide created in 10 minutes.",But not only that.,What we've done,is we have also developed a demonstrator.,And I'm showing for the first time in public,this visible light demonstrator.,And what we have here,is no ordinary desk lamp.,We fit in an LED light bulb,,worth three U.S. dollars,,put in our signal processing technology.,And then what we have here is a little hole.,And the light goes through that hole.,There's a receiver.,The receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude,that we create there,into an electrical signal.,And that signal is then converted back,to a high-speed data stream.,In the future we hope,that we can integrate this little hole,into these smart phones.,And not only integrate a photo detector here,,but maybe use the camera inside. 
 So what happens,when I switch on that light?,As you would expect,,it's a light, a desk lamp.,Put your book beneath it and you can read.,It's illuminating the space.,But at the same time, you see this video coming up here.,And that's a video, a high-definition video,that is transmitted through that light beam.,You're critical.,You think, "Ha, ha, ha.,This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here.",But let me do this. 
 (Applause) 
 Once again.,Still don't believe?,It is this light,that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.,And if you look at the light,,it is illuminating as you would expect.,You don't notice with your human eye.,You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude,that we impress onto this light bulb.,It's serving the purpose of illumination,,but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.,And you see,,even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.,It can ignore that constant light,,because all the receiver's interested in,are subtle changes.,You also have a critical question now, and,you say, "Okay,,do I have to have the light on all the time,to have this working?",And the answer is yes.,But, you can dim down the light,to a level that it appears to be off.,And you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible. 
 So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.,Capacity:,We have 10,000 times more spectrum,,10,000 times more LEDs,installed already in the infrastructure there.,You would agree with me, hopefully,,there's no issue of capacity anymore.,Efficiency:,This is data through illumination --,it's first of all an illumination device.,And if you do the energy budget,,the data transmission comes for free --,highly energy efficient.,I don't mention the high energy efficiency,of these LED light bulbs.,If the whole world would deploy them,,you would save hundreds of power plants.,That's aside. 
 And then I've mentioned the availability.,You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.,You need to see what to do.,You have lights in an aircraft.,So it's everywhere in a day there is light.,Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.,It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.,These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission. 
 And then there's security.,You would agree with me,that light doesn't penetrate through walls.,So no one, if I have a light here,,if I have secure data,,no one on the other side of this room through that wall,would be able to read that data.,And there's only data where there is light.,So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data,,then what I could do,,turn it away.,So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.,Now we can in fact see where the data is going to. 
 So for me,,the applications of it,,to me, are beyond imagination at the moment.,We have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.,And you only have to notice, where we have light,,there is a potential way to transmit data.,But I can give you a few examples.,Well you may see the impact already now.,This is a remote operated vehicle,beneath the ocean.,And they use light to illuminate space down there.,And this light can be used to transmit wireless data,that these things [use] to communicate with each other. 
 Intrinsically safe environments,like this petrochemical plant --,you can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks,,but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there.,In hospitals,,for new medical instruments;,in streets for traffic control.,Cars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights,,and cars can communicate with each other,and prevent accidents,in the way that they exchange information.,Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.,And then you have these millions of street lamps,deployed around the world.,And every street lamp could be a free access point.,We call it, in fact, a Li-Fi,,light-fidelity.,And then we have these aircraft cabins.,There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin,,and each of these lights,could be a potential transmitter of wireless data.,So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video,on your long flight back home.,Online life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible. 
 So, all we would need to do,is to fit a small microchip,to every potential illumination device.,And this would then combine,two basic functionalities:,illumination and wireless data transmission.,And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe,could solve the four essential problems,that face us in wireless communication these days.,And in the future,,you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs,,you may have 14 billion Li-Fis,deployed worldwide --,for a cleaner, a greener,,and even a brighter future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a filmmaker.,For the last 8 years,,I have dedicated my life,to documenting the work,of Israelis and Palestinians,who are trying to end the conflict,using peaceful means.,When I travel with my work,across Europe and the United States,,one question always comes up:,Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?,Why aren't Palestinians,using nonviolent resistance? 
 The challenge I face when I hear this question,is that often I have just returned from the Middle East,where I spent my time,filming dozens of Palestinians,who are using nonviolence,to defend their lands,and water resources,from Israeli soldiers and settlers.,These leaders are trying to forge,a massive national nonviolent movement,to end the occupation,and build peace in the region.,Yet, most of you,have probably never heard about them.,This divide between what's happening on the ground,and perceptions abroad,is one of the key reasons,why we don't have yet,a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement,that has been successful. 
 So I'm here today,to talk about the power of attention,,the power of your attention,,and the emergence and development,of nonviolent movements,in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere --,but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.,I believe that what's mostly missing,for nonviolence to grow,is not for Palestinians,to start adopting nonviolence,,but for us to start paying attention,to those who already are.,Allow me to illustrate this point,by taking you to this village,called Budrus. 
 About seven years ago,,they faced extinction,,because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,,and part of this barrier,would be built on top of the village.,They would lose 40 percent of their land,and be surrounded,,so they would lose free access,to the rest of the West Bank.,Through inspired local leadership,,they launched a peaceful resistance campaign,to stop that from happening. 
 Let me show you some brief clips,,so you have a sense,for what that actually looked like on the ground. 
 (Music) 
 Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall,would separate Palestine from Israel.,Here in Budrus,,we realized the wall would steal our land. 
 Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact,,created a solution to terror. 
 Man: Today you're invited,to a peaceful march.,You are joined,by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters. 
 Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army,more than nonviolent opposition. 
 Woman: We saw the men,trying to push the soldiers,,but none of them could do that.,But I think the girls could do it. 
 Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds,of traditional thinking. 
 Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,,and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine. 
 Chanting: One united nation.,Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!,News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue. 
 Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.,They were allowed to use any force necessary. 
 (Gunshots) 
 Man: These are live bullets.,It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere. 
 Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.,But there were others around me who weren't even cowering. 
 Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest,is not going to stop the [unclear]. 
 Protester: This is a peaceful march.,There is no need to use violence. 
 Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!,We can do it! 
 Julia Bacha: When I first heard,about the story of Budrus,,I was surprised,that the international media had failed to cover,the extraordinary set of events,that happened seven years ago,,in 2003.,What was even more surprising,was the fact that Budrus was successful.,The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,,convinced the Israeli government,to move the route of the barrier off their lands,and to the green line,,which is the internationally recognized boundary,between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.,The resistance in Budrus,has since spread,to villages across the West Bank,and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.,Yet the media remains mostly silent,on these stories.,This silence carries profound consequences,for the likelihood,that nonviolence can grow,,or even survive,,in Palestine. 
 Violent resistance,and nonviolent resistance,share one very important thing in common;,they are both a form of theater,seeking an audience to their cause.,If violent actors,are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers,and attracting international attention,to the Palestinian issue,,it becomes very hard,for nonviolent leaders,to make the case to their communities,that civil disobedience,is a viable option,in addressing their plight. 
 The power of attention,is probably going to come as no surprise,to the parents in the room.,The surest way,to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums,is by giving him attention,the first time he throws a fit.,The tantrum will become,what childhood psychologists call,a functional behavior,,since the child has learned,that he can get parental attention out of it.,Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior,simply by giving or withdrawing,attention to their children.,But that's true for adults too.,In fact, the behavior,of entire communities and countries,can be influenced,,depending on where,the international community chooses,to focus its attention. 
 I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East,and bringing peace,is for us,to transform nonviolence,into a functional behavior,by giving a lot more attention,to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.,In the course of taking my film to villages,in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,,I have seen the impact,that even one documentary film can have,in influencing the transformation. 
 In a village called Wallajeh,,which sits very close to Jerusalem,,the community was facing,a very similar plight to Budrus.,They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands,and not have freedom of access,,either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.,They had been using nonviolence for about two years,but had grown disenchanted,since nobody was paying attention.,So we organized a screening.,A week later,,they held the most well-attended,and disciplined,demonstration to date.,The organizers say,that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus,documented in a film,,felt that there were indeed people,following what they were doing,,that people cared.,So they kept on going. 
 On the Israeli side,,there is a new peace movement called Solidariot,,which means solidarity in Hebrew.,The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus,as one of their primary recruiting tools.,They report,that Israelis who had never been active before,,upon seeing the film,,understand the power of nonviolence,and start joining their activities.,The examples of Wallajeh,and the Solidariot movement,show that even a small-budget independent film,can play a role,in transforming nonviolence,into a functional behavior.,Now imagine the power,that big media players could have,if they started covering,the weekly nonviolent demonstrations,happening in villages,like Bil'in, Ni'lin,,Wallajeh,,in Jerusalem neighborhoods,like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan --,the nonviolent leaders,would become more visible,,valued and effective,in their work. 
 I believe,that the most important thing,is to understand,that if we don't pay attention to these efforts,,they are invisible,,and it's as if they never happened.,But I have seen first hand,that if we do,,they will multiply.,If they multiply,,their influence will grow,in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.,And theirs is the kind of influence,that can finally,unblock the situation.,These leaders have proven that nonviolence works,in places like Budrus.,Let's give them attention,so they can prove it works everywhere. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Why can't we solve these problems?,We know what they are.,Something always seems to stop us.,Why?,I remember March the 15th, 2000.,The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.,In the newspaper it said,"it was all part of a normal process.",A little bit further on in the article,it said "a loss that would normally take,the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace.",That same word, "normal,",had two different,,almost opposite meanings. 
 If we walk into the B15 iceberg,when we leave here today,,we're going to bump into something,a thousand feet tall,,76 miles long,,17 miles wide,,and it's going to weigh two gigatons.,I'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this.,And yet I think it's this perspective of us,as humans to look at our world,through the lens of normal,is one of the forces,that stops us developing real solutions.,Only 90 days after this,,arguably the greatest discovery,of the last century occurred.,It was the sequencing for the first time,of the human genome.,This is the code that's in every single one,of our 50 trillion cells,that makes us who we are and what we are.,And if we just take one cell's worth,of this code and unwind it,,it's a meter long,,two nanometers thick.,Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness. 
 And I wondered,,what if the answer to some of our biggest problems,could be found in the smallest of places,,where the difference between what is,valuable and what is worthless,is merely the addition or subtraction,of a few atoms?,And what,if we could get exquisite control,over the essence of energy,,the electron?,So I started to go around the world,finding the best and brightest scientists,I could at universities,whose collective discoveries have the chance,to take us there,,and we formed a company to build,on their extraordinary ideas. 
 Six and a half years later,,a hundred and eighty researchers,,they have some amazing developments,in the lab,,and I will show you three of those today,,such that we can stop burning up our planet,and instead,,we can generate all the energy we need,right where we are,,cleanly, safely, and cheaply.,Think of the space that we spend,most of our time.,A tremendous amount of energy,is coming at us from the sun.,We like the light that comes into the room,,but in the middle of summer,,all that heat is coming into the room,that we're trying to keep cool.,In winter, exactly the opposite is happening.,We're trying to heat up,the space that we're in,,and all that is trying to get out through the window. 
 Wouldn't it be really great,if the window could flick back the heat,into the room if we needed it,or flick it away before it came in?,One of the materials that can do this,is a remarkable material, carbon,,that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction,where graphite is blasted by a vapor,,and when the vaporized carbon condenses,,it condenses back into a different form:,chickenwire rolled up.,But this chickenwire carbon,,called a carbon nanotube,,is a hundred thousand times smaller,than the width of one of your hairs.,It's a thousand times,more conductive than copper.,How is that possible?,One of the things about working at the nanoscale,is things look and act very differently.,You think of carbon as black.,Carbon at the nanoscale,is actually transparent,and flexible.,And when it's in this form,,if I combine it with a polymer,and affix it to your window,when it's in its colored state,,it will reflect away all heat and light,,and when it's in its bleached state,it will let all the light and heat through,and any combination in between.,To change its state, by the way,,takes two volts from a millisecond pulse.,And once you've changed its state, it stays there,until you change its state again. 
 As we were working on this incredible,discovery at University of Florida,,we were told to go down the corridor,to visit another scientist,,and he was working,on a pretty incredible thing.,Imagine,if we didn't have to rely,on artificial lighting to get around at night.,We'd have to see at night, right?,This lets you do it.,It's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials,,a detector and an imager.,The total width of it,is 600 times smaller,than the width of a decimal place.,And it takes all the infrared available at night,,converts it into an electron,in the space of two small films,,and is enabling you to play an image,which you can see through.,I'm going to show to TEDsters,,the first time, this operating.,Firstly I'm going to show you,the transparency.,Transparency is key.,It's a film that you can look through.,And then I'm going to turn the lights out.,And you can see, off a tiny film,,incredible clarity. 
 As we were working on this, it dawned on us:,this is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths,,and converting it into electrons.,What if we combined it,with this?,Suddenly you've converted energy,into an electron on a plastic surface,that you can stick on your window.,But because it's flexible,,it can be on any surface whatsoever.,The power plant of tomorrow,is no power plant.,We talked about generating and using.,We want to talk about storing energy,,and unfortunately,the best thing we've got going,is something that was developed in France,a hundred and fifty years ago,,the lead acid battery.,In terms of dollars per what's stored,,it's simply the best. 
 Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of,these in our basements to store our power,,we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas,,and we gave them this diagram.,It was in actually a diner,outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.,We said, "Could you build this?",And these scientists,,instead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah.",And what they built was eBox.,EBox is testing new nanomaterials,to park an electron on the outside,,hold it until you need it,,and then be able to release it and pass it off.,Being able to do that means,that I can generate energy,cleanly, efficiently and cheaply,right where I am.,It's my energy.,And if I don't need it, I can convert it,back up on the window,to energy, light, and beam it,,line of site, to your place.,And for that I do not need,an electric grid between us. 
 The grid of tomorrow is no grid,,and energy, clean efficient energy,,will one day be free.,If you do this, you get the last puzzle piece,,which is water.,Each of us, every day,,need just eight glasses of this,,because we're human.,When we run out of water,,as we are in some parts of the world,and soon to be in other parts of the world,,we're going to have to get this from the sea,,and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.,19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend.,These also require tremendous amounts of energy.,In fact, it's going to require twice the world's,supply of oil to run the pumps,to generate the water.,We're simply not going to do that.,But in a world where energy is freed,and transmittable,easily and cheaply, we can take any water,wherever we are,and turn it into whatever we need. 
 I'm glad to be working with,incredibly brilliant and kind scientists,,no kinder than,many of the people in the world,,but they have a magic look at the world.,And I'm glad to see their discoveries,coming out of the lab and into the world.,It's been a long time in coming for me.,18 years ago,,I saw a photograph in the paper.,It was taken by Kevin Carter,who went to the Sudan,to document their famine there.,I've carried this photograph with me,every day since then.,It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.,By any standard this is wrong.,It's just wrong.,We can do better than this.,We should do better than this. 
 And whenever I go round,to somebody who says,,"You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult.,It'll never happen. You don't have enough money.,You don't have enough time.,There's something much more interesting around the corner,",I say, "Try saying that to her.",That's what I say in my mind. And I just say,"thank you," and I go on to the next one.,This is why we have to solve our problems,,and I know the answer as to how,is to be able to get exquisite control,over a building block of nature,,the stuff of life:,the simple electron. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,,and I met a 12-year-old boy,who had been tortured,and was denied access to counsel.,And as I looked into his eyes, I realized,that for the hundreds of letters I had written,for political prisoners, that I would never have,written a letter for him,,because he was not a 12-year-old boy who,had done something important for anybody.,He was not a political prisoner.,He was a 12-year-old boy who had,stolen a bicycle.,What I also realized at that point was that,it was not only Cambodia, but,of the 113,developing countries that torture,,93 of these countries have all passed laws,that say you have a right to a lawyer,and you have a right not to be tortured. 
 And what I recognized was that there was an,incredible window of opportunity for us,as a world community to come together,and end torture as an investigative tool.,We often think of torture as being,political torture or reserved for,just the worst, but, in fact,,95 percent of torture today,is not for political prisoners.,It is for people who are,in broken-down legal systems,,and unfortunately because torture is,the cheapest form of investigation --,it's cheaper than having a legal system,,cheaper than having a lawyer,and early access to counsel --,it is what happens most of the time.,I believe today that it is possible for us,as a world community, if we make a decision,,to come together and end torture,as an investigative tool in our lifetime,,but it will require three things.,First is the training, empowerment,,and connection of defenders worldwide. 
 The second is insuring that there is,systematic early access to counsel.,And the third is commitment.,So in the year 2000,,I began to wonder,,what if we came together?,Could we do something,for these 93 countries?,And I founded International Bridges to Justice,which has a specific mission of,ending torture as an investigative tool,and implementing due process rights,in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers,at an early stage in police stations,and in courtrooms.,My first experiences, though, did come,from Cambodia, and at the time I remember,first coming to Cambodia and there were,,in 1994, still less than,10 attorneys in the country because,the Khmer Rouge had killed them all. 
 And even 20 years later, there was only,10 lawyers in the country, so consequently,you'd walk into a prison and,not only would you meet 12-year-old boys,,you'd meet women and you'd say,,"Why are you here?" Women would say,,"Well I've been here for 10 years because,my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him.",So it's just a place where there was no rule of law. 
 The first group of defenders came together,and I still remember, as I was training, I said,,"Okay, what do you do for an investigation?",And there was silence in the class, and finally,one woman stood up, [inaudible name],,and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher.",She said, "I have defended more than,a hundred people, and I've never had to do,any investigation,,because they all come with confessions." 
 And we talked about, as a class, the fact that,number one, the confessions,might not be reliable, but number two,,we did not want to encourage the police,to keep doing this, especially,as it was now against the law.,And it took a lot of courage for these,defenders to decide that they would,begin to stand up and support each other,in implementing these laws.,And I still remember the first cases where,they came, all 25 together, she would,stand up, and they were in the back, and,they would support her, and the judges kept,saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things,the exact same way we've been doing them." 
 But one day the perfect case came, and it,was a woman who was a vegetable seller,,she was sitting outside of a house.,She said she actually saw the person,run out who she thinks stole,whatever the jewelry was, but the police,came, they got her, there was nothing on her.,She was pregnant at the time. She had,cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.,And when they brought her case,to the judge, for the first time he stood up,and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence,except for your torture confession,and you will be released." 
 And the defenders began to take cases,over and over again and,you will see, they have step by step began,to change the course of history in Cambodia.,But Cambodia is not alone.,I used to think, well is it Cambodia?,Or is it other countries?,But it is in so many countries. 
 In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't,a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy,for stealing a mobile phone.,Or a woman, I picked up her baby,,really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute.",It wasn't a baby, she was three.,And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here,",because she was accused of stealing,two diapers and an iron for her baby and,still had been in prison.,And when I walked up to the prison director,,I said, "You've got to let her out.,A judge would let her out.",And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it,,but look at my prison. Eighty percent,of the two thousand people here,are without a lawyer. What can we do?",So lawyers began to courageously,stand up together to organize a system,where they can take cases.,But we realized that it's not only the training,of the lawyers, but the connection,of the lawyers that makes a difference. 
 For example, in Cambodia, it was that,[inaudible name] did not go alone,but she had 24 lawyers with her,who stood up together. And in the same way,,in China, they always tell me,,"It's like a fresh wind in the desert,when we can come together.",Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,,after coming out of a prison where everybody,stood up and said, "I've been here,for one year, eight years, 12 years,without a lawyer,",he came and we had a training together,and he said, "I have heard it said" --,because he had heard people mumbling,and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that,we cannot help to create justice,because we do not have the resources.",And then he said, "But I want you to know,that the lack of resources,is never an excuse for injustice.",And with that, he successfully,organized 68 lawyers who have been,systematically taking the cases. 
 The key that we see, though, is training,and then early access.,I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired,to meet with another group of lawyers,,and what they told me is that they said,,"Hey, look, we don't have police,on the streets now. The police are,one of the main reasons why we had,the revolution. They were torturing everybody,all the time.",And I said, "But there's been tens of millions,of dollars that have recently gone in,to the development of the legal system here.,What's going on?",I met with one of the development agencies,,and they were training prosecutors,and judges, which is the normal bias,,as opposed to defenders.,And they showed me a manual which,actually was an excellent manual.,I said, "I'm gonna copy this.",It had everything in it. Lawyers can come,at the police station. It was perfect.,Prosecutors were perfectly trained.,But I said to them, "I just have one question,,which is, by the time that everybody got to,the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?",And after a pause, they said,,"They had been tortured." 
 So the pieces are,,not only the training of the lawyers, but,us finding a way to systematically implement,early access to counsel, because they are,the safeguard in the system,for people who are being tortured.,And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the,fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds,like we could do it, but can we really do it?",Because it sounds big.,And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.,The first reason is the people on the ground,who find ways of creating miracles,because of their commitment.,It's not only Innocent, who I told you about,in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world,who are looking for these pieces.,We have a program called JusticeMakers,,and we realized there are people that are,courageous and want to do things, but,how can we support them?,So it's an online contest where it's only,five thousand dollars if you come up with,and innovative way of implementing justice.,And there are 30 JusticeMakers,throughout the world, from Sri Lanka,to Swaziland to the DRC, who with,five thousand dollars do amazing things,,through SMS programs,,through paralegal programs,,through whatever they can do. 
 And it's not only these JusticeMakers,,but people we courageously see,figure out who their networks are,and how they can move it forward. 
 So in China, for instance, great laws,came out where it says police cannot,torture people or they will be punished.,And I was sitting side by side with one of our,very courageous lawyers, and said,,"How can we get this out? How can we,make sure that this is implemented?,This is fantastic." And he said to me,,"Well, do you have money?" And I said,,"No." And he said, "That's okay,,we can still figure it out.",And on December 4, he organized,three thousand members,of the Youth Communist League,,from 14 of the top law schools,,who organized themselves, developed,posters with the new laws, and went,to the police stations and began what he says,is a non-violent legal revolution,to protect citizen rights.,So I talked about the fact that we need,to train and support defenders.,We need to systematically implement,early access to counsel.,But the third and most important thing is that,we make a commitment to this. 
 And people often say to me, "You know,,this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.,Never going to happen.",And the reason that I think that,those words are interesting is because,those were the same kinds of words,that were used for people who decided,they would end slavery, or end apartheid.,It began with a small group of people,who decided they would commit. 
 Now, there's one of our favorite poems,from the defenders, which they share,from each other, is:,"Take courage friends, the road is often long,,the path is never clear,,and the stakes are very high,,but deep down, you are not alone.",And I believe that if we can come together,as a world community to support not only,defenders, but also everyone in the system,who is looking towards it,,we can end torture as an investigative tool.,I end always, because I'm sure the questions are --,and I'd be happy to talk to you,at any point -- "But what can I really do?",Well, I would say this. First of all,,you know what you can do. But second of all,,I would leave you with the story of Vishna,,who actually was my inspiration,for starting International Bridges to Justice. 
 Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him,who was born in a Cambodian prison,in Kandal Province. But because he was,born in the prison, everybody loved him,,including the guards, so he was the only one,who was allowed to come,in and out of the bars.,So, you know, there's bars. And by the time,that Vishna was getting bigger,,which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.,So he would come to the first bar,,the second bar and then the third bar,,and then really slowly move his head,so he could fit through, and come back,,third, second, first. And he would,grab my pinkie, because what he wanted,to do every day is he wanted to go visit.,You know, he never quite made it to,all of them every day, but he wanted to visit,all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,,and he would put his fingers through.,Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron,corrugated, and he would put his fingers through. 
 And most of the prisoners said that he was,their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they,looked forward to him. And I was like,,here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.,He was born in a prison with almost nothing,,no material goods, but he had a sense of,his own heroic journey, which I believe,we are all born into. He said,,"Probably I can't do everything.,But I'm one. I can do something.,And I will do the one thing that I can do.",So I thank you for having the prophetic,imagination to imagine the shaping,of a new world with us together,,and invite you into this journey with us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a photograph,by the artist Michael Najjar,,and it's real,,in the sense that he went there to Argentina,to take the photo.,But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.,And what he's done,is he's actually reshaped, digitally,,all of the contours of the mountains,to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.,So what you see,,that precipice, that high precipice with the valley,,is the 2008 financial crisis.,The photo was made,when we were deep in the valley over there.,I don't know where we are now.,This is the Hang Seng index,for Hong Kong.,And similar topography.,I wonder why. 
 And this is art. This is metaphor.,But I think the point is,that this is metaphor with teeth,,and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today,that we rethink a little bit,about the role of contemporary math --,not just financial math, but math in general.,That its transition,from being something that we extract and derive from the world,to something that actually starts to shape it --,the world around us and the world inside us.,And it's specifically algorithms,,which are basically the math,that computers use to decide stuff.,They acquire the sensibility of truth,because they repeat over and over again,,and they ossify and calcify,,and they become real. 
 And I was thinking about this, of all places,,on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago,,because I happened to be seated,next to a Hungarian physicist about my age,and we were talking,about what life was like during the Cold War,for physicists in Hungary.,And I said, "So what were you doing?" 
 And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth." 
 And I said, "That's a good job. That's interesting.,How does that work?",And to understand that,,you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.,And so -- this is an over-simplification --,but basically, it's not like,you can just pass a radar signal,right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.,It's not just going to disappear.,But if you can take this big, massive thing,,and you could turn it into,a million little things --,something like a flock of birds --,well then the radar that's looking for that,has to be able to see,every flock of birds in the sky.,And if you're a radar, that's a really bad job. 
 And he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that's if you're a radar.,So we didn't use a radar;,we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,,electronic communication.,And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication,,we thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'" 
 And I said, "Yeah.,That's good.,So you've effectively negated,60 years of aeronautic research.,What's your act two?,What do you do when you grow up?",And he said,,"Well, financial services.",And I said, "Oh.",Because those had been in the news lately.,And I said, "How does that work?",And he said, "Well there's 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now,,and I'm one of them.",And I said, "What's the black box for Wall Street?" 
 And he said, "It's funny you ask that,,because it's actually called black box trading.,And it's also sometimes called algo trading,,algorithmic trading.",And algorithmic trading evolved in part,because institutional traders have the same problems,that the United States Air Force had,,which is that they're moving these positions --,whether it's Proctor & Gamble or Accenture, whatever --,they're moving a million shares of something,through the market.,And if they do that all at once,,it's like playing poker and going all in right away.,You just tip your hand.,And so they have to find a way --,and they use algorithms to do this --,to break up that big thing,into a million little transactions.,And the magic and the horror of that,is that the same math,that you use to break up the big thing,into a million little things,can be used to find a million little things,and sew them back together,and figure out what's actually happening in the market. 
 So if you need to have some image,of what's happening in the stock market right now,,what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms,that are basically programmed to hide,,and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.,And all of that's great, and it's fine.,And that's 70 percent,of the United States stock market,,70 percent of the operating system,formerly known as your pension,,your mortgage. 
 And what could go wrong?,What could go wrong,is that a year ago,,nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,,and they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.,All of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,,and nobody to this day,can even agree on what happened,because nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.,Nobody had any control over what was actually happening.,All they had,was just a monitor in front of them,that had the numbers on it,and just a red button,that said, "Stop." 
 And that's the thing,,is that we're writing things,,we're writing these things that we can no longer read.,And we've rendered something,illegible,,and we've lost the sense,of what's actually happening,in this world that we've made.,And we're starting to make our way.,There's a company in Boston called Nanex,,and they use math and magic,and I don't know what,,and they reach into all the market data,and they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms.,And when they find them they pull them out,and they pin them to the wall like butterflies.,And they do what we've always done,when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand --,which is that they give them a name,and a story.,So this is one that they found,,they called the Knife,,the Carnival,,the Boston Shuffler,,Twilight. 
 And the gag is,that, of course, these aren't just running through the market.,You can find these kinds of things wherever you look,,once you learn how to look for them.,You can find it here: this book about flies,that you may have been looking at on Amazon.,You may have noticed it,when its price started at 1.7 million dollars.,It's out of print -- still ...,(Laughter),If you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.,A few hours later, it had gone up,to 23.6 million dollars,,plus shipping and handling.,And the question is:,Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?,And you see this behavior on Amazon,as surely as you see it on Wall Street.,And when you see this kind of behavior,,what you see is the evidence,of algorithms in conflict,,algorithms locked in loops with each other,,without any human oversight,,without any adult supervision,to say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty." 
 (Laughter) 
 And as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix.,And so Netflix has gone through,several different algorithms over the years.,They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others --,there's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.,They're using Pragmatic Chaos now.,Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms,,trying to do the same thing.,It's trying to get a grasp on you,,on the firmware inside the human skull,,so that it can recommend what movie,you might want to watch next --,which is a very, very difficult problem.,But the difficulty of the problem,and the fact that we don't really quite have it down,,it doesn't take away,from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.,Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms,,determines, in the end,,60 percent,of what movies end up being rented.,So one piece of code,with one idea about you,is responsible for 60 percent of those movies. 
 But what if you could rate those movies,before they get made?,Wouldn't that be handy?,Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,,and they have "story algorithms" --,a company called Epagogix.,And you can run your script through there,,and they can tell you, quantifiably,,that that's a 30 million dollar movie,or a 200 million dollar movie.,And the thing is, is that this isn't Google.,This isn't information.,These aren't financial stats; this is culture.,And what you see here,,or what you don't really see normally,,is that these are the physics of culture.,And if these algorithms,,like the algorithms on Wall Street,,just crashed one day and went awry,,how would we know?,What would it look like? 
 And they're in your house. They're in your house.,These are two algorithms competing for your living room.,These are two different cleaning robots,that have very different ideas about what clean means.,And you can see it,if you slow it down and attach lights to them,,and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.,And the idea that architecture itself,is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization,is not far-fetched.,It's super-real and it's happening around you. 
 You feel it most,when you're in a sealed metal box,,a new-style elevator;,they're called destination-control elevators.,These are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to,before you get in the elevator.,And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.,So none of this mishegas,of letting everybody go into whatever car they want.,Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two,,and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.,And the problem with that,is that people freak out.,People panic.,And you see why. You see why.,It's because the elevator,is missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons.,(Laughter),Like the things that people use.,All it has,is just the number that moves up or down,and that red button that says, "Stop.",And this is what we're designing for.,We're designing,for this machine dialect.,And how far can you take that? How far can you take it?,You can take it really, really far. 
 So let me take it back to Wall Street.,Because the algorithms of Wall Street,are dependent on one quality above all else,,which is speed.,And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.,And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are,,it takes you 500,000 microseconds,just to click a mouse.,But if you're a Wall Street algorithm,and you're five microseconds behind,,you're a loser.,So if you were an algorithm,,you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt,who was hollowing out a skyscraper --,throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use,,and just running steel on the floors,to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in --,all so an algorithm,could get close to the Internet. 
 And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.,And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.,In New York, this is where it's distributed from:,the Carrier Hotel,located on Hudson Street.,And this is really where the wires come right up into the city.,And the reality is that the further away you are from that,,you're a few microseconds behind every time.,These guys down on Wall Street,,Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation,,they're eight microseconds,behind all these guys,going into the empty buildings being hollowed out,up around the Carrier Hotel.,And that's going to keep happening.,We're going to keep hollowing them out,,because you, inch for inch,and pound for pound and dollar for dollar,,none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space,like the Boston Shuffler could. 
 But if you zoom out,,if you zoom out,,you would see an 825-mile trench,between New York City and Chicago,that's been built over the last few years,by a company called Spread Networks.,This is a fiber optic cable,that was laid between those two cities,to just be able to traffic one signal,37 times faster than you can click a mouse --,just for these algorithms,,just for the Carnival and the Knife.,And when you think about this,,that we're running through the United States,with dynamite and rock saws,so that an algorithm can close the deal,three microseconds faster,,all for a communications framework,that no human will ever know,,that's a kind of manifest destiny;,and we'll always look for a new frontier. 
 Unfortunately, we have our work cut out for us.,This is just theoretical.,This is some mathematicians at MIT.,And the truth is I don't really understand,a lot of what they're talking about.,It involves light cones and quantum entanglement,,and I don't really understand any of that.,But I can read this map,,and what this map says,is that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,,that's where people are, where the cities are,,you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are,to do that most effectively.,And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots,is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.,So that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something,,or platforms.,We'll actually part the water,to pull money out of the air,,because it's a bright future,if you're an algorithm. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's not the money that's so interesting actually.,It's what the money motivates,,that we're actually terraforming,the Earth itself,with this kind of algorithmic efficiency.,And in that light,,you go back,and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,,and you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.,They're prophecy,for the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects,of the math that we're making.,And the landscape was always made,by this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration,between nature and man.,But now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms --,the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.,And we will have to understand those as nature,,and in a way, they are. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so,is tell you about an idea,of how we're going to make matter come alive.,Now this may seem a bit ambitious,,but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands,,you realize that you're alive.,So this is a start.,Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.,There's been four billion years,of organic, biological life.,And as an inorganic chemist,,my friends and colleagues make this distinction,between the organic, living world,and the inorganic, dead world.,And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas,about how we can transform inorganic, dead matter,into living matter, into inorganic biology. 
 Before we do that,,I want to kind of put biology in its place.,And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.,I love to do synthetic biology.,I love things that are alive.,I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.,But within that infrastructure,,we have to remember,that the driving force of biology,is really coming from evolution.,And evolution,,although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin,and a vast number of other people,,evolution still is a little bit intangible.,And when I talk about Darwinian evolution,,I mean one thing and one thing only,,and that is survival of the fittest.,And so forget about evolution,in a kind of metaphysical way.,Think about evolution,in terms of offspring competing,,and some winning. 
 So bearing that in mind,,as a chemist, I wanted to ask myself,the question frustrated by biology:,What is the minimal unit of matter,that can undergo Darwinian evolution?,And this seems quite a profound question.,And as a chemist,,we're not used to profound questions every day.,So when I thought about it,,then suddenly I realized,that biology gave us the answer.,And in fact, the smallest unit of matter,that can evolve independently,is, in fact, a single cell --,a bacteria. 
 So this raises three really important questions:,What is life?,Is biology special?,Biologists seem to think so.,Is matter evolvable?,Now if we answer those questions in reverse order,,the third question -- is matter evolvable? --,if we can answer that,,then we're going to know how special biology is,,and maybe, just maybe,,we'll have some idea of what life really is. 
 So here's some inorganic life.,This is a dead crystal,,and I'm going to do something to it,,and it's going to become alive.,And you can see,,it's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing.,This is an inorganic tube.,And all these crystals here under the microscope,were dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.,Of course, they're not alive.,It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.,But when I saw this, I was really fascinated,,because it seemed lifelike.,And as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen.,You can see there's architecture growing, filling the void.,And this is dead.,So I was positive that,,if somehow we can make things mimic life,,let's go one step further.,Let's see if we can actually make life. 
 But there's a problem,,because up until maybe a decade ago,,we were told that life was impossible,and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.,In fact, we were the only people,in the universe.,Now, that's a bit boring.,So as a chemist,,I wanted to say, "Hang on. What is going on here?,Is life that improbable?",And this is really the question.,I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells,was as probable as the emergence of the stars.,And in fact, let's take that one step further.,Let's say,that if the physics of fusion,is encoded into the universe,,maybe the physics of life is as well.,And so the problem with chemists --,and this is a massive advantage as well --,is we like to focus on our elements.,In biology, carbon takes center stage.,And in a universe where carbon exists,and organic biology,,then we have all this wonderful diversity of life.,In fact, we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.,We're awfully careful in the lab,to try and avoid various biohazards. 
 Well what about matter?,If we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard?,So think, this is a serious question.,If your pen could replicate,,that would be a bit of a problem.,So we have to think differently,if we're going to make stuff come alive.,And we also have to be aware of the issues.,But before we can make life,,let's think for a second,what life really is characterized by.,And forgive the complicated diagram.,This is just a collection of pathways in the cell.,And the cell is obviously for us,a fascinating thing.,Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.,Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease.,And you have all these pathways going on at the same time.,You have regulation;,information is transcribed;,catalysts are made; stuff is happening.,But what does a cell do?,Well it divides, it competes,,it survives.,And I think that is where we have to start,in terms of thinking about,building from our ideas in life. 
 But what else is life characterized by?,Well, I like think of it,as a flame in a bottle.,And so what we have here,is a description of single cells,replicating, metabolizing,,burning through chemistries.,And so we have to understand,that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life,,we need to power it somehow.,So before we can really start to make life,,we have to really think about where it came from.,And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague,that he thought that life probably emerged,in some warm little pond somewhere --,maybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa,,maybe somewhere else.,But the real honest answer is, we just don't know,,because there is a problem with the origin.,Imagine way back, four and a half billion years ago,,there is a vast chemical soup of stuff.,And from this stuff we came. 
 So when you think about the improbable nature,of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes,,just remember,,we came from stuff on planet Earth.,And we went through a variety of worlds.,The RNA people would talk about the RNA world.,We somehow got to proteins and DNA.,We then got to the last ancestor.,Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit.,And here we are.,But there's a roadblock that you can't get past.,You can decode the genome, you can look back,,you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA,,but we can't get further than the last ancestor,,the last visible cell,that we could sequence or think back in history.,So we don't know how we got here. 
 So there are two options:,intelligent design, direct and indirect --,so God,,or my friend.,Now talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life,,just pushes the problem further on.,I'm not a politician, I'm a scientist.,The other thing we need to think about,is the emergence of chemical complexity.,This seems most likely.,So we have some kind of primordial soup.,And this one happens to be,a good source of all 20 amino acids.,And somehow,these amino acids are combined,,and life begins.,But life begins, what does that mean?,What is life? What is this stuff of life? 
 So in the 1950s,,Miller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment,,where they did the equivalent in the chemical world.,They took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar,and ignited them,and put a lot of voltage through.,And they had a look at what was in the soup,,and they found amino acids,,but nothing came out, there was no cell.,So the whole area's been stuck for a while,,and it got reignited in the '80s,when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on. 
 In my own laboratory,,the way we're trying to create inorganic life,is by using many different reaction formats.,So what we're trying to do is do reactions --,not in one flask, but in tens of flasks,,and connect them together,,as you can see with this flow system, all these pipes.,We can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically,,we can do it in a 3D printer,,we can do it in droplets for colleagues.,And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry,just bubbling away.,But that's probably going to end in failure,,so we need to be a bit more focused. 
 And the answer, of course, lies with mice.,This is how I remember what I need as a chemist.,I say, "Well I want molecules.",But I need a metabolism, I need some energy.,I need some information, and I need a container.,Because if I want evolution,,I need containers to compete.,So if you have a container,,it's like getting in your car.,"This is my car,,and I'm going to drive around and show off my car.",And I imagine you have a similar thing,in cellular biology,with the emergence of life.,So these things together give us evolution, perhaps.,And the way to test it in the laboratory,is to make it minimal. 
 So what we're going to try and do,is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.,And so forgive the molecules on the screen,,but these are a very simple kit.,There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present.,And we can aggregate them together,and make literally thousands and thousands,of really big nano-molecular molecules,the same size of DNA and proteins,,but there's no carbon in sight.,Carbon is banned.,And so with this Lego kit,,we have the diversity required,for complex information storage,without DNA.,But we need to make some containers.,And just a few months ago in my lab,,we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them.,And you can see on the screen a cell being made.,And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell.,And all I wanted to show you,is we can set up molecules,in membranes, in real cells,,and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism,,a molecular survival of the fittest. 
 And this movie here,shows this competition between molecules.,Molecules are competing for stuff.,They're all made of the same stuff,,but they want their shape to win.,They want their shape to persist.,And that is the key.,If we can somehow encourage these molecules,to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete,,they will start to form cells,that will replicate and compete.,If we manage to do that,,forget the molecular detail. 
 Let's zoom out to what that could mean.,So we have this special theory of evolution,that applies only to organic biology, to us.,If we could get evolution into the material world,,then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.,And that's really worth thinking about.,Does evolution control,the sophistication of matter in the universe?,Is there some driving force through evolution,that allows matter to compete?,So that means we could then start,to develop different platforms,for exploring this evolution.,So you imagine,,if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form,,not only will this tell us about the origin of life --,that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive;,it can use anything --,we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies,,because we can then use software control,for evolution to code in. 
 So imagine we make a little cell.,We want to put it out in the environment,,and we want it to be powered by the Sun.,What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.,And we don't use design anymore. We find what works.,We should take our inspiration from biology.,Biology doesn't care about the design,unless it works.,So this will reorganize,the way we design things.,But not only just that,,we will start to think about,how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.,Wouldn't it be great,if you could take these artificial biological cells,and fuse them with biological ones,to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?,The real issue in cellular biology,is we are never going to understand everything,,because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.,Evolution cannot be cut apart.,You need to somehow find the fitness function.,And the profound realization for me,is that, if this works,,the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level,,and we really start talking about selfish matter. 
 And what does that mean in a universe,where we are right now the highest form of stuff?,You're sitting on chairs.,They're inanimate, they're not alive.,But you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff,,and you enslave stuff.,So using evolution,in biology,,and in inorganic biology,,for me is quite appealing, quite exciting.,And we're really becoming very close,to understanding the key steps,that makes dead stuff come alive.,And again, when you're thinking about how improbable this is,,remember, five billion years ago,,we were not here, and there was no life.,So what will that tell us 
 about the origin of life and the meaning of life?,But perhaps, for me as a chemist,,I want to keep away from general terms;,I want to think about specifics.,So what does it mean about defining life?,We really struggle to do this.,And I think, if we can make inorganic biology,,and we can make matter become evolvable,,that will in fact define life.,I propose to you,that matter that can evolve is alive,,and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline.,You believe you're going to be successful in this project?,When? 
 Lee Cronin: So many people think,that life took millions of years to kick in.,We're proposing to do it in just a few hours,,once we've set up,the right chemistry. 
 CA: And when do you think that will happen? 
 LC: Hopefully within the next two years. 
 CA: That would be a big story.,(Laughter),In your own mind, what do you believe the chances are,that walking around on some other planet,is non-carbon-based life,,walking or oozing or something? 
 LC: I think it's 100 percent.,Because the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology,,if you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.,So the other thing,that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon,,maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.,Don't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff. 
 CA: Lee Cronin, good luck. (LC: Thank you very much.) 
 (Applause)So magic is a very introverted field.,While scientists regularly publish their latest research,,we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.,That's true even amongst peers.,But if you look at creative practice as a form of research,,or art as a form of R&D for humanity,,then how could a cyber illusionist like myself,share his research? 
 Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.,And about three years ago,,I started an exercise,in openness and inclusiveness,by reaching out into the open-source software community,to create new digital tools for magic --,tools that could eventually be shared with other artists,to start them off further on in the process,and to get them to the poetry faster. 
 Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.,It's an augmented reality,projection tracking and mapping system,,or a digital storytelling tool.,Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.,So let's give this a try.,And I'm going to use it,to give you my take,on the stuff of life. 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor. 
 Wake up. 
 Hey. 
 Come on. 
 (Music) 
 Please. 
 (Music) 
 Come on. 
 Ah, sorry about that.,Forgot this. 
 (Music) 
 Give it another try. 
 Okay. 
 He figured out the system. 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 Uh oh. 
 (Music) 
 All right. Let's try this.,Come on. 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Music) 
 Hey. 
 (Music) 
 You heard her, go ahead. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Bye-bye. 
 (Applause)Each of you possesses,the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait,that natural selection has ever devised.,It's a piece of neural audio technology,for rewiring other people's minds.,I'm talking about your language, of course,,because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind,directly into someone else's mind,,and they can attempt to do the same to you,,without either of you having to perform surgery.,Instead, when you speak,,you're actually using a form of telemetry,not so different,from the remote control device for your television.,It's just that, whereas that device,relies on pulses of infrared light,,your language relies on pulses,,discrete pulses, of sound. 
 And just as you use the remote control device,to alter the internal settings of your television,to suit your mood,,you use your language,to alter the settings inside someone else's brain,to suit your interests.,Languages are genes talking,,getting things that they want.,And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby,when it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound,,it can get objects to move across a room,as if by magic,,and maybe even into its mouth. 
 Now language's subversive power,has been recognized throughout the ages,in censorship, in books you can't read,,phrases you can't use,and words you can't say.,In fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible,is a fable and warning,about the power of language.,According to that story, early humans developed the conceit,that, by using their language to work together,,they could build a tower,that would take them all the way to heaven.,Now God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power,,destroyed the tower,,and then to ensure,that it would never be rebuilt,,he scattered the people by giving them different languages --,confused them by giving them different languages.,And this leads to the wonderful irony,that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.,Even today,,we know that there are words we cannot use,,phrases we cannot say,,because if we do so,,we might be accosted, jailed,,or even killed.,And all of this from a puff of air,emanating from our mouths. 
 Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits,tells us there's something worth explaining.,And that is how and why,did this remarkable trait evolve,,and why did it evolve,only in our species?,Now it's a little bit of a surprise,that to get an answer to that question,,we have to go to tool use,in the chimpanzees.,Now these chimpanzees are using tools,,and we take that as a sign of their intelligence.,But if they really were intelligent,,why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground,rather than a shovel?,And if they really were intelligent,,why would they crack open nuts with a rock?,Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts,that somebody else had already cracked open for them?,Why not? I mean, that's what we do. 
 Now the reason the chimpanzees don't do that,is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call,social learning.,They seem to lack the ability,to learn from others,by copying or imitating,or simply watching.,As a result,,they can't improve on others' ideas,or learn from others' mistakes --,benefit from others' wisdom.,And so they just do the same thing,over and over and over again.,In fact, we could go away for a million years and come back,and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing,with the same sticks for the termites,and the same rocks to crack open the nuts. 
 Now this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.,How do we know this?,Because this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did.,These upright apes,evolved on the African savanna,about two million years ago,,and they made these splendid hand axes,that fit wonderfully into your hands.,But if we look at the fossil record,,we see that they made the same hand axe,over and over and over again,for one million years.,You can follow it through the fossil record.,Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived,,what their generation time was,,that's about 40,000 generations,of parents to offspring, and other individuals watching,,in which that hand axe didn't change.,It's not even clear,that our very close genetic relatives, the Neanderthals,,had social learning.,Sure enough, their tools were more complicated,than those of Homo erectus,,but they too showed very little change,over the 300,000 years or so,that those species, the Neanderthals,,lived in Eurasia. 
 Okay, so what this tells us,is that, contrary to the old adage,,"monkey see, monkey do,",the surprise really is,that all of the other animals,really cannot do that -- at least not very much.,And even this picture,has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it --,something from a Barnum & Bailey circus. 
 But by comparison,,we can learn.,We can learn by watching other people,and copying or imitating,what they can do.,We can then choose, from among a range of options,,the best one.,We can benefit from others' ideas.,We can build on their wisdom.,And as a result, our ideas do accumulate,,and our technology progresses.,And this cumulative cultural adaptation,,as anthropologists call,this accumulation of ideas,,is responsible for everything around you,in your bustling and teeming everyday lives.,I mean the world has changed out of all proportion,to what we would recognize,even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.,And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation.,The chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium,,my microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you --,all are a result,of cumulative cultural adaptation. 
 Now to many commentators,,cumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning,,is job done, end of story.,Our species can make stuff,,therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has.,In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" --,as I just said, all the stuff around us.,But in fact, it turns out,that some time around 200,000 years ago,,when our species first arose,and acquired social learning,,that this was really the beginning of our story,,not the end of our story.,Because our acquisition of social learning,would create a social and evolutionary dilemma,,the resolution of which, it's fair to say,,would determine not only the future course of our psychology,,but the future course of the entire world.,And most importantly for this,,it'll tell us why we have language. 
 And the reason that dilemma arose,is, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.,If I can learn by watching you,,I can steal your best ideas,,and I can benefit from your efforts,,without having to put in the time and energy that you did,into developing them.,If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish,,or I can watch how you flake your hand axe,to make it better,,or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch,,I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills,,and maybe even catch that fish,before you do.,Social learning really is visual theft.,And in any species that acquired it,,it would behoove you,to hide your best ideas,,lest somebody steal them from you. 
 And so some time around 200,000 years ago,,our species confronted this crisis.,And we really had only two options,for dealing with the conflicts,that visual theft would bring.,One of those options,was that we could have retreated,into small family groups.,Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge,would flow just to our relatives.,Had we chosen this option,,sometime around 200,000 years ago,,we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were,when we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.,And this is because in small groups,there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.,And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck.,So if we'd chosen that path,,our evolutionary path would have led into the forest --,and been a short one indeed. 
 The other option we could choose,was to develop the systems of communication,that would allow us to share ideas,and to cooperate amongst others.,Choosing this option would mean,that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom,would become available to any one individual,than would ever arise from within an individual family,or an individual person on their own.,Well, we chose the second option,,and language is the result. 
 Language evolved to solve the crisis,of visual theft.,Language is a piece of social technology,for enhancing the benefits of cooperation --,for reaching agreements, for striking deals,and for coordinating our activities.,And you can see that, in a developing society,that was beginning to acquire language,,not having language,would be a like a bird without wings.,Just as wings open up this sphere of air,for birds to exploit,,language opened up the sphere of cooperation,for humans to exploit.,And we take this utterly for granted,,because we're a species that is so at home with language, 
 but you have to realize,that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in,are utterly dependent upon language.,And to see why, consider two scenarios,from early in our evolution.,Let's imagine that you are really good,at making arrowheads,,but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts,with the flight feathers attached.,Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts,,but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.,So what you do is --,one of those people has not really acquired language yet.,And let's pretend the other one is good at language skills. 
 So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads,,and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well,,and you put the arrowheads down in front of him,,hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads,for finished arrows.,But he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift,,picks them up, smiles and walks off.,Now you pursue this guy, gesticulating.,A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed,with one of your own arrowheads.,Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.,You put down your arrowheads and say,,"I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50.",The other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.,We'll do that.",Now the job is done. 
 Once we have language,,we can put our ideas together and cooperate,to have a prosperity,that we couldn't have before we acquired it.,And this is why our species,has prospered around the world,while the rest of the animals,sit behind bars in zoos, languishing.,That's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals,while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground,to extract termites.,All right, if this view of language,and its value,in solving the crisis of visual theft is true,,any species that acquires it,should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity.,And this is exactly what the archeological record shows. 
 If you look at our ancestors,,the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus, our immediate ancestors,,they're confined to small regions of the world.,But when our species arose,about 200,000 years ago,,sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa,and spread around the entire world,,occupying nearly every habitat on Earth.,Now whereas other species are confined,to places that their genes adapt them to,,with social learning and language,,we could transform the environment,to suit our needs.,And so we prospered in a way,that no other animal has.,Language really is,the most potent trait that has ever evolved.,It is the most valuable trait we have,for converting new lands and resources,into more people and their genes,that natural selection has ever devised. 
 Language really is,the voice of our genes.,Now having evolved language, though,,we did something peculiar,,even bizarre.,As we spread out around the world,,we developed thousands of different languages.,Currently, there are about seven or 8,000,different languages spoken on Earth.,Now you might say, well, this is just natural.,As we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge.,But the real puzzle and irony,is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth,is found where people are most tightly packed together. 
 If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea,,we can find about 800 to 1,000,distinct human languages,,different human languages,,spoken on that island alone.,There are places on that island,where you can encounter a new language,every two or three miles.,Now, incredible as this sounds,,I once met a Papuan man, and I asked him if this could possibly be true.,And he said to me, "Oh no.,They're far closer together than that.",And it's true; there are places on that island,where you can encounter a new language in under a mile.,And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands. 
 And so it seems that we use our language,,not just to cooperate,,but to draw rings around our cooperative groups,and to establish identities,,and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills,from eavesdropping from outside.,And we know this,because when we study different language groups,and associate them with their cultures,,we see that different languages,slow the flow of ideas between groups.,They slow the flow of technologies.,And they even slow the flow of genes.,Now I can't speak for you,,but it seems to be the case,that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to.,(Laughter),Now we have to counter that, though,,against the evidence we've heard,that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances,with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay, this tendency we have,,this seemingly natural tendency we have,,towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves,,crashes head first into our modern world.,This remarkable image,is not a map of the world.,In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.,And when you plot those friendship links,by their latitude and longitude,,it literally draws a map of the world.,Our modern world is communicating,with itself and with each other,more than it has,at any time in its past.,And that communication, that connectivity around the world,,that globalization,now raises a burden.,Because these different languages,impose a barrier, as we've just seen,,to the transfer of goods and ideas,and technologies and wisdom.,And they impose a barrier to cooperation. 
 And nowhere do we see that more clearly,than in the European Union,,whose 27 member countries,speak 23 official languages.,The European Union,is now spending over one billion euros annually,translating among their 23 official languages.,That's something on the order,of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars,on translation costs alone.,Now think of the absurdity of this situation.,If 27 individuals,from those 27 member states,sat around table, speaking their 23 languages,,some very simple mathematics will tell you,that you need an army of 253 translators,to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities.,The European Union employs a permanent staff,of about 2,500 translators.,And in 2007 alone --,and I'm sure there are more recent figures --,something on the order of 1.3 million pages,were translated into English alone. 
 And so if language really is,the solution to the crisis of visual theft,,if language really is,the conduit of our cooperation,,the technology that our species derived,to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas,,in our modern world,,we confront a question.,And that question is whether,in this modern, globalized world,we can really afford to have all these different languages. 
 To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance,in which functionally equivalent traits coexist.,One of them always drives the other extinct.,And we see this in the inexorable march,towards standardization.,There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things --,weighing them and measuring their length --,but the metric system is winning.,There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time,,but a really bizarre base 60 system,known as hours and minutes and seconds,is nearly universal around the world.,There are many, many ways,of imprinting CDs or DVDs,,but those are all being standardized as well.,And you can probably think of many, many more,in your own everyday lives. 
 And so our modern world now,is confronting us with a dilemma.,And it's the dilemma,that this Chinese man faces,,who's language is spoken,by more people in the world,than any other single language,,and yet he is sitting at his blackboard,,converting Chinese phrases,into English language phrases.,And what this does is it raises the possibility to us,that in a world in which we want to promote,cooperation and exchange,,and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before,on cooperation,to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity,,his actions suggest to us,it might be inevitable,that we have to confront the idea,that our destiny is to be one world with one language. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Matt Ridley: Mark, one question.,Svante found that the FOXP2 gene,,which seems to be associated with language,,was also shared in the same form,in Neanderthals as us.,Do we have any idea,how we could have defeated Neanderthals,if they also had language? 
 Mark Pagel: This is a very good question.,So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2,that seems to be implicated in some ways,in the fine motor control that's associated with language.,The reason why I don't believe that tells us,that the Neanderthals had language,is -- here's a simple analogy:,Ferraris are cars that have engines.,My car has an engine,,but it's not a Ferrari.,Now the simple answer then,is that genes alone don't, all by themselves,,determine the outcome,of very complicated things like language.,What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals,is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows.,But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language. 
 MR: Thank you very much indeed. 
 (Applause)Now this is a very un-TED-like thing to do,,but let's kick off the afternoon,with a message,from a mystery sponsor. 
 Anonymous: Dear Fox News,,it has come to our unfortunate attention,that both the name and nature of Anonymous,has been ravaged.,We are everyone. We are no one.,We are anonymous. We are legion.,We do not forgive. We do not forget.,We are but the base of chaos. 
 Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen --,a sophisticated group,of politically motivated hackers,who have emerged in 2011.,And they're pretty scary.,You never know when they're going to attack next,,who or what the consequences will be.,But interestingly,,they have a sense of humor.,These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account,to announce President Obama's assassination.,Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated,in the newsroom at Fox.,"What do we do now?,Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?",(Laughter),And of course, who could escape the irony,of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,being a victim of hacking for a change. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Sometimes you turn on the news,and you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?",Sony Playstation Network -- done,,the government of Turkey -- tick,,Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency -- a breeze,,the CIA -- falling off a log.,In fact, a friend of mine from the security industry,told me the other day,that there are two types of companies in the world:,those that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.,I mean three companies,providing cybersecurity services to the FBI,have been hacked.,Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake? 
 Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous --,and they would say this themselves --,they are providing a service,by demonstrating how useless companies are,at protecting our data.,But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous --,they are ideologically driven.,They claim that they are battling,a dastardly conspiracy.,They say that governments are trying,to take over the Internet and control it,,and that they, Anonymous,,are the authentic voice of resistance --,be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships,,against global media corporations,,or against intelligence agencies,,or whoever it is.,And their politics are not entirely unattractive.,Okay, they're a little inchoate.,There's a strong whiff,of half-baked anarchism about them.,But one thing is true:,we are at the beginning,of a mighty struggle,for control of the Internet.,The Web links everything,,and very soon,it will mediate most human activity.,Because the Internet has fashioned,a new and complicated environment,for an old-age dilemma,that pits the demands of security,with the desire for freedom. 
 Now this is a very complicated struggle.,And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me,,we probably can't understand it very well.,Nonetheless,,in an unexpected attack of hubris,a couple of years ago,,I decided I would try and do that.,And I sort of get it.,These were the various things that I was looking at,as I was trying to understand it.,But in order to try and explain the whole thing,,I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it,,so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion,,and let me assure you that all of these issues,are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet,one way or the other,,but in a configuration,that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty,trying to get his head around.,So there you are.,And as you see, in the middle,,there is our old friend, the hacker.,The hacker is absolutely central,to many of the political, social,and economic issues affecting the Net.,And so I thought to myself,,"Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to.",And what do you know,,nobody else does talk to the hackers.,They're completely anonymous, as it were. 
 So despite the fact,that we are beginning to pour billions,,hundreds of billions of dollars,,into cybersecurity --,for the most extraordinary technical solutions --,no one wants to talk,to these guys, the hackers,,who are doing everything.,Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions,,which cost a huge amount of money.,And so nothing is going into the hackers.,Well, I say nothing,,but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit,in Turin, Italy,called the Hackers Profiling Project.,And they are doing some fantastic research,into the characteristics,,into the abilities,and the socialization of hackers.,But because they're a U.N. operation,,maybe that's why governments and corporations,are not that interested in them.,Because it's a U.N. operation,,of course, it lacks funding.,But I think they're doing very important work.,Because where we have a surplus of technology,in the cybersecurity industry,,we have a definite lack of --,call me old-fashioned --,human intelligence. 
 Now, so far I've mentioned,the hackers Anonymous,who are a politically motivated hacking group.,Of course, the criminal justice system,treats them as common old garden criminals.,But interestingly,,Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information,for financial gain.,But what about the real cybercriminals?,Well real organized crime on the Internet,goes back about 10 years,when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers,developed a website,,which led to the industrialization,of cybercrime.,Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.,This is how they were advertising themselves,a decade ago on the Net.,Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.,Cybercriminals would go there,to buy and sell stolen credit card details,,to exchange information,about new malware that was out there.,And remember, this is a time,when we're seeing for the first time,so-called off-the-shelf malware.,This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff,,which you can deploy,even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker. 
 And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket,for cybercriminals.,And its creators,were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial,,because they were faced,with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.,And that challenge is:,How do you do business,,how do you trust,somebody on the Web who you want to do business with,when you know that they're a criminal?,(Laughter),It's axiomatic that they're dodgy,,and they're going to want to try and rip you off.,So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known,,came up with this brilliant idea,called the escrow system.,They appointed an officer,who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.,The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details;,the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.,The purchaser would send the administrative officer,some dollars digitally,,and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.,And the officer would then verify,if the stolen credit card worked.,And if they did,,he then passed on the money to the vendor,and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.,And it was this,which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.,And after that, it just went wild.,We had a champagne decade,for people who we know as Carders. 
 Now I spoke to one of these Carders,who we'll call RedBrigade --,although that wasn't even his proper nickname --,but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.,And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004,he would go on sprees in New York,,taking out $10,000 from an ATM here,,$30,000 from an ATM there,,using cloned credit cards.,He was making, on average a week,,$150,000 --,tax free of course.,And he said,that he had so much money,stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point,that he just didn't know what to do with it,and actually fell into a depression.,But that's a slightly different story,,which I won't go into now.,Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade,is that he wasn't an advanced hacker.,He sort of understood the technology,,and he realized that security was very important,if you were going to be a Carder,,but he didn't spend his days and nights,bent over a computer, eating pizza,,drinking coke and that sort of thing.,He was out there on the town,having a fab time enjoying the high life. 
 And this is because,hackers are only one element,in a cybercriminal enterprise.,And often they're the most vulnerable element of all.,And I want to explain this to you,by introducing you to six characters,who I met,while I was doing this research.,Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT --,born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.,Now he developed his social and moral compass,on the Black Sea port during the 1990s.,This was a sink-or-swim environment,where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities,was entirely necessary,if you wanted to survive.,As an accomplished computer user,,what Dimitry did,was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown,onto the Worldwide Web.,And he did a great job in it.,You have to understand though,that from his ninth birthday,,the only environment he knew,was gangsterism.,He knew no other way of making a living,and making money. 
 Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam,,aka JiLsi --,founder of DarkMarket,,born in Colombo, Sri Lanka.,As an eight year-old,,he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital,because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city,,looking for Tamils like Renu to murder.,At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military,,accused of being a terrorist,,and his parents sent him on his own to Britain,as a refugee seeking political asylum.,At 13,,with only little English and being bullied at school,,he escaped into a world of computers,where he showed great technical ability,,but he was soon being seduced,by people on the Internet.,He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud,,and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London,in 2012. 
 Matrix001,,who was an administrator at DarkMarket.,Born in Southern Germany,to a stable and well-respected middle class family,,his obsession with gaming as a teenager,led him to hacking.,And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world,where he stored his games,that he had cracked and pirated.,His slide into criminality,was incremental.,And when he finally woke up to his situation,and understood the implications,,he was already in too deep. 
 Max Vision, aka ICEMAN --,mastermind of CardersMarket.,Born in Meridian, Idaho.,Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers,working out of Santa Clara, California,in the late 90s for private companies,and voluntarily for the FBI.,Now in the late 1990s,,he discovered a vulnerability,on all U.S. government networks,,and he went in and patched it up --,because this included nuclear research facilities --,sparing the American government,a huge security embarrassment.,But also, because he was an inveterate hacker,,he left a tiny digital wormhole,through which he alone could crawl.,But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator,,and he was convicted.,At his open prison,,he came under the influence of financial fraudsters,,and those financial fraudsters,persuaded him to work for them,on his release.,And this man with a planetary-sized brain,is now serving a 13-year sentence,in California. 
 Adewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB --,master bank account cracker,from Abuja in Nigeria.,He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup,,bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk,before arriving in Britain,in 2005,to take a Masters in chemical engineering,at Manchester University.,He impressed in the private sector,,developing chemical applications for the oil industry,while simultaneously running,a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions,until his arrest in 2008. 
 And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan,,aka Cha0 --,one of the most remarkable hackers ever,,from Ankara in Turkey.,He combined the tremendous skills of a geek,with the suave social engineering skills,of the master criminal.,One of the smartest people I've ever met.,He also had the most effective,virtual private network security arrangement,the police have ever encountered,amongst global cybercriminals. 
 Now the important thing,about all of these people,is they share certain characteristics,despite the fact that they come from very different environments.,They are all people who learned their hacking skills,in their early to mid-teens.,They are all people,who demonstrate advanced ability,in maths and the sciences.,Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills,,their moral compass had not yet developed.,And most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0,,they did not demonstrate,any real social skills in the outside world --,only on the Web. 
 And the other thing is,the high incidence of hackers like these,who have characteristics which are consistent,with Asperger's syndrome.,Now I discussed this,with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen,who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.,And he has done path-breaking work on autism,and confirmed, also for the authorities here,,that Gary McKinnon --,who is wanted by the United States,for hacking into the Pentagon --,suffers from Asperger's,and a secondary condition,of depression.,And Baron-Cohen explained,that certain disabilities,can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world,as tremendous skills,,and that we should not be throwing in jail,people who have such disabilities and skills,because they have lost their way socially,or been duped. 
 Now I think we're missing a trick here,,because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.,And let me be blunt about this.,In China, in Russia and in loads of other countries,that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities,,this is exactly what they are doing.,They are recruiting hackers,both before and after they become involved,in criminal and industrial espionage activities --,are mobilizing them,on behalf of the state.,We need to engage,and find ways of offering guidance,to these young people,,because they are a remarkable breed.,And if we rely, as we do at the moment,,solely on the criminal justice system,and the threat of punitive sentences,,we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame. 
 Thank you very much for listening. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So your idea worth spreading,is hire hackers.,How would someone get over that kind of fear,that the hacker they hire,might preserve that little teensy wormhole? 
 MG: I think to an extent,,you have to understand,that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.,They're just relentless and obsessive,about what they do.,But all of the people who I've spoken to,who have fallen foul of the law,,they have all said, "Please, please give us a chance,to work in the legitimate industry.,We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.,We want to work with you." 
 Chris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha. 
 (Applause)Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.,And take us through those,,and introduce us to another Yemen. 
 Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.,And I would like to share with you all,some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.,This picture shows a revolution,started by women,,and it shows women and men,leading a mixed protest.,The other picture,is the popularity of the real need for change.,So many people are there.,The intensity of the upspring.,This picture shows that the revolution,has allowed opportunities for training,,for education.,These women are learning about first aid,and their rights according to the constitution. 
 I love this picture.,I just wanted to show,that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population,are 15 years and below.,And they were excluded from decision-making,,and now they are in the forefront of the news,,raising the flag.,English --,you will see, this is jeans,and tights,,and an English expression --,the ability to share with the world,what is going on in our own country.,And expression also,,it has brought talents.,Yemenis are using cartoons,and art,,paintings, comics,,to tell the world and each other,about what's going on. 
 Obviously, there's always the dark side of it.,And this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures,of the revolution,and the cost that we have to pay.,The solidarity,of millions of Yemenis across the country,just demanding the one thing.,And finally, lots of people are saying,that Yemen's revolution,is going to break the country.,Is it going to be so many different countries?,Is it going to be another Somalia?,But we want to tell the world that, no,,under the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people. 
 PM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.,And they do, in many ways,,tell a different story,than the story of Yemen,,the one that is often in the news.,And yet, you yourself,defy all those characterizations.,So let's talk about the personal story for a moment.,Your father is murdered.,The Yemen Times already has,a strong reputation in Yemen,as an independent English language newspaper.,How did you then,make the decision and assume the responsibilities,of running a newspaper,,especially in such times of conflict? 
 NA: Well, let me first warn you,that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.,I've guessed you've already noticed this by now.,(Laughter),In Yemen, most women are veiled,and they are sitting behind doors,and not very much part of the public life.,But there's so much potential.,I wish I could show you my Yemen.,I wish you could see,Yemen through my eyes.,Then you would know,that there's so much to it.,And I was privileged because I was born into a family,,my father would always encourage the boys and the girls.,He would say we are equal.,And he was such an extraordinary man.,And even my mother -- I owe it to my family.,A story:,I studied in India.,And in my third year, I started becoming confused,because I was Yemeni,,but I was also mixing up,with a lot of my friends in college.,And I went back home and I said,,"Daddy, I don't know who I am.,I'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian.",And he said, "You are the bridge.",And that is something I will keep in my heart forever.,So since then I've been the bridge,,and a lot of people have walked over me. 
 PM: I don't think so. (Laughter) 
 NA: But it just helps tell,that some people are change agents,in the society.,And when I became editor-in-chief,after my brother actually --,my father passed away in 1999,,and then my brother until 2005 --,and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.,"What's this young girl coming in and showing off,because it's her family business," or something.,It was very hard at first.,I didn't want to clash with people.,But with all due respect,to all the men, and the older men especially,,they did not want me around.,It was very hard, you know,,to impose my authority.,But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do. 
 (Applause) 
 And in the first year,,I had to fire half of the men.,(Laughter),(Applause),Brought in more women.,Brought in younger men.,And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.,The other thing is that it's about professionalism.,It's about proving who you are and what you can do.,And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now,,but in 2006 alone,,we won three international awards.,One of them is the IPI,Free Media Pioneer Award.,So that was the answer,to all the Yemeni people.,And I want to score a point here,,because my husband is in the room over there.,If you could please stand up, [unclear].,He has been very supportive of me. 
 (Applause) 
 PM: And we should point out,that he works with you as well at the paper.,But in assuming this responsibility,and going about it as you have,,you have become a bridge,between an older and traditional society,and the one that you are now creating at the paper.,And so along with changing who worked there,,you must have come up against another positioning,that we always run into, in particular with women,,and it has to do with outside image,,dress, the veiled woman.,So how have you dealt with this,on a personal level,as well as the women who worked for you? 
 NA: As you know,,the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black,and covered, veiled women.,And this is true.,And a lot of it is,because women are not able, are not free,,to show their face to their self.,It's a lot of traditional imposing,coming by authority figures,such as the men, the grandparents and so on.,And it's economic empowerment,and the ability for a woman to say,,"I am as much contributing to this family, or more,,than you are.",And the more empowered the women become,,the more they are able to remove the veil, for example,,or to drive their own car,or to have a job or to be able to travel. 
 So the other face of Yemen,is actually one,that lies behind the veil,,and it's economic empowerment mostly,that allows the woman to just uncover it.,And I have done this throughout my work.,I've tried to encourage young girls.,We started with, you can take it off in the office.,And then after that, you can take it off on assignments.,Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with --,how can you talk to people if you have your face covered? --,and so on; it's just a movement. 
 And I am a role model in Yemen.,A lot of people look up to me.,A lot of young girls look up to me.,And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married,,you can still be a mother,,and you can still be respected within the society,,but at the same time,,that doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.,You can be yourself and have your face. 
 PM: But by putting yourself personally out there --,both projecting a different image,of Yemeni women,,but also what you have made possible,for the women who work at the paper --,has this put you in personal danger? 
 NA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years,,has been through so much.,We've suffered prosecution;,the paper was closed down more than three times.,It's an independent newspaper,,but tell that to the people in charge.,They think that if there's anything against them,,then we are being an opposition newspaper.,And very, very difficult times.,Some of my reporters were arrested.,We had some court cases.,My father was assassinated.,Today, we are in a much better situation.,We've created the credibility.,And in times of revolution or change like today,,it is very important for independent media to have a voice.,It's very important,for you to go to YemenTimes.com,,and it's very important,to listen to our voice. 
 And this is probably something,I'm going to share with you,in Western media probably --,and how there's a lot of stereotypes --,thinking of Yemen in one single frame:,this is what Yemen is all about.,And that's not fair.,It's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.,A lot of reporters come to Yemen,and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism.,And I just wanted to share with you:,there's one reporter that came.,He wanted to do a documentary,on what his editors wanted.,And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me --,hip hop --,that there are young Yemeni men,who express themselves,through dancing and puchu puchu.,(Laughter),That thing. (PM: Rap. Break dancing.),Yeah, break dancing.,I'm not so old.,I'm just not in touch. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 PM: Yes, you are.,Actually, that's a documentary,that's available online; the video's online. 
 NA: ShaketheDust.org. 
 PM: "Shake the Dust." (NA: "Shake the Dust.") 
 PM: ShaketheDust.org.,And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.,You spoke about the responsibility of the press.,And certainly, when we look,at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others,and we've created fear,and danger,,often from lack of knowledge,,lack of real understanding,,how do you see,the way that the Western press in particular,is covering this and all other stories out of the region,,but in particular, in your country? 
 NA: Well there is a saying that says,,"You fear what you don't know,,and you hate what you fear.",So it's about the lack of research, basically.,It's almost, "Do your homework," --,some involvement.,And you cannot do parachute reporting --,just jump into a country for two days,and think that you've done your homework and a story.,So I wish,that the world would know my Yemen,,my country, my people.,I am an example, and there are others like me.,We may not be that many,,but if we are promoted,as a good, positive example,,there will be others -- men and women --,who can eventually bridge the gap --,again, coming to the bridge --,between Yemen and the world,and telling first,about recognition,and then about communication,and compassion. 
 I think Yemen is going to be,in a very bad situation,in the next two or three years.,It's natural.,But after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay,,we are going to stand up again on our feet,,but in the new Yemen,with a younger and more empowered people --,democratic. 
 (Applause) 
 PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us,a very different view of Yemen.,And certainly you yourself and what you do,have given us a view of the future,that we will embrace,and be grateful for.,And the very best of luck to you.,YemenTimes.com. 
 NA: On Twitter also. 
 PM: So you are plugged in. 
 (Applause)The things we make,have one supreme quality --,they live longer than us.,We perish, they survive;,we have one life, they have many lives,,and in each life they can mean different things.,Which means that, while we all have one biography,,they have many. 
 I want this morning to talk,about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies --,of one particular object,,one remarkable thing.,It doesn't, I agree,,look very much.,It's about the size of a rugby ball.,It's made of clay,,and it's been fashioned,into a cylinder shape,,covered with close writing,and then baked dry in the sun.,And as you can see,,it's been knocked about a bit,,which is not surprising,because it was made two and a half thousand years ago,and was dug up,in 1879.,But today,,this thing is, I believe,,a major player,in the politics of the Middle East.,And it's an object,with fascinating stories,and stories that are by no means over yet. 
 The story begins,in the Iran-Iraq war,and that series of events,that culminated,in the invasion of Iraq,by foreign forces,,the removal of a despotic ruler,and instant regime change.,And I want to begin,with one episode from that sequence of events,that most of you would be very familiar with,,Belshazzar's feast --,because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war,of 539 BC.,And the parallels,between the events,of 539 BC and 2003 and in between,are startling.,What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting,,now in the National Gallery in London,,illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel,in the Hebrew scriptures.,And you all know roughly the story. 
 Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,,Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem,and captured the people,and taken the Jews back to Babylon.,Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.,He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.,And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem,had been taken to Babylon.,Belshazzar, his son,,decides to have a feast.,And in order to make it even more exciting,,he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun,,and he brings out the temple vessels.,He's already at war with the Iranians,,with the king of Persia. 
 And that night, Daniel tells us,,at the height of the festivities,a hand appeared and wrote on the wall,,"You are weighed in the balance and found wanting,,and your kingdom is handed over,to the Medes and the Persians.",And that very night,Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon,and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.,It is, of course, a great moment,in the history,of the Jewish people.,It's a great story. It's story we all know.,"The writing on the wall",is part of our everyday language.,What happened next,was remarkable,,and it's where our cylinder,enters the story. 
 Cyrus, king of the Persians,,has entered Babylon without a fight --,the great empire of Babylon,,which ran from central southern Iraq,to the Mediterranean,,falls to Cyrus.,And Cyrus makes a declaration.,And that is what this cylinder is,,the declaration made by the ruler guided by God,who had toppled the Iraqi despot,and was going to bring freedom to the people.,In ringing Babylonian --,it was written in Babylonian --,he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe,,the great king, the powerful king,,king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world.",They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.,This is probably,the first real press release,by a victorious army,that we've got.,And it's written, as we'll see in due course,,by very skilled P.R. consultants.,So the hyperbole is not actually surprising. 
 And what is the great king, the powerful king,,the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?,He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon,,he will at once let all the peoples,that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar --,have captured and enslaved,go free.,He'll let them return to their countries.,And more important,,he will let them all recover,the gods, the statues,,the temple vessels,that had been confiscated.,All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed,will go home,,and they'll take with them their gods.,And they'll be able to restore their altars,and to worship their gods,in their own way, in their own place.,This is the decree,,this object is the evidence,for the fact that the Jews,,after the exile in Babylon,,the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon,,weeping when they remembered Jerusalem,,those Jews were allowed to go home.,They were allowed to return to Jerusalem,and to rebuild the temple. 
 It's a central document,in Jewish history.,And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures,reported in ringing terms.,This is the Jewish version,of the same story.,"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,,'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee,,and he has charged me,to build him a house in Jerusalem.,Who is there among you of his people?,The Lord God be with him,,and let him go up.'","Go up" -- aaleh.,The central element, still,,of the notion of return,,a central part,of the life of Judaism.,As you all know, that return from exile,,the second temple,,reshaped Judaism.,And that change,,that great historic moment,,was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia,,reported for us in Hebrew in scripture,and in Babylonian in clay. 
 Two great texts,,what about the politics?,What was going on,was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.,The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians,,united under Cyrus,,became the first great world empire.,Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.,And by the time of his son Darius,,the whole of the eastern Mediterranean,is under Persian control.,This empire is, in fact,,the Middle East as we now know it,,and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.,It was the largest empire the world had known until then.,Much more important,,it was the first,multicultural, multifaith state,on a huge scale.,And it had to be run in a quite new way.,It had to be run in different languages.,The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.,And it had to recognize their different habits,,different peoples, different religions, different faiths.,All of those are respected by Cyrus. 
 Cyrus sets up a model,of how you run,a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.,And the result of that,was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen,,and which survived for 200 years of stability,until it was shattered by Alexander.,It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit,,and a unit where people of different faiths,could live together.,The Greek invasions ended that.,And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government,and it fragmented.,But what Cyrus represented,remained absolutely central. 
 The Greek historian Xenophon,wrote his book "Cyropaedia",promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.,And throughout European culture afterward,,Cyrus remained the model.,This is a 16th century image,to show you how widespread,his veneration actually was.,And Xenophon's book on Cyrus,on how you ran a diverse society,was one of the great textbooks,that inspired the Founding Fathers,of the American Revolution.,Jefferson was a great admirer --,the ideals of Cyrus,obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals,of how you create religious tolerance,in a new state. 
 Meanwhile, back in Babylon,,things had not been going well.,After Alexander, the other empires,,Babylon declines, falls into ruins,,and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost --,until 1879,when the cylinder is discovered,by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.,And it enters now another story.,It enters that great debate,in the middle of the 19th century:,Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?,We only knew,about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus,from the Hebrew scriptures.,No other evidence.,Suddenly, this appeared.,And great excitement,to a world where those who believed in the scriptures,had had their faith in creation shaken,by evolution, by geology,,here was evidence,that the scriptures were historically true.,It's a great 19th century moment. 
 But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated --,the facts were true,,hurrah for archeology,,but the interpretation was rather more complicated.,Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account,differ in one key respect.,The Babylonian cylinder,is written by the priests,of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.,And, not surprisingly,,they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.,"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name.",Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand,,calls him to shepherd his people,and gives him the rule of Babylon.,Marduk tells Cyrus,that he will do these great, generous things,of setting the people free.,And this is why we should all be grateful to,and worship Marduk. 
 The Hebrew writers,in the Old Testament,,you will not be surprised to learn,,take a rather different view of this.,For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk,that made all this happen.,It can only be Jehovah.,And so in Isaiah,,we have the wonderful texts,giving all the credit of this,,not to Marduk,but to the Lord God of Israel --,the Lord God of Israel,who also called Cyrus by name,,also takes Cyrus by the hand,and talks of him shepherding his people.,It's a remarkable example,of two different priestly appropriations of the same event,,two different religious takeovers,of a political fact. 
 God, we know,,is usually on the side of the big battalions.,The question is, which god was it?,And the debate unsettles,everybody in the 19th century,to realize that the Hebrew scriptures,are part of a much wider world of religion.,And it's quite clear,the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah,,and yet, Jehovah is speaking,in words very similar,to those used by Marduk.,And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this,,because he says,,this is God speaking, of course,,"I have called thee by thy name,though thou hast not known me.",I think it's recognized,that Cyrus doesn't realize,that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.,And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.,Because interestingly, of course,,Cyrus is a good Iranian,with a totally different set of gods,who are not mentioned in any of these texts. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's 1879.,40 years on,and we're in 1917,,and the cylinder enters a different world.,This time, the real politics,of the contemporary world --,the year of the Balfour Declaration,,the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain,,decides that it will declare,a Jewish national home,,it will allow,the Jews to return.,And the response to this,by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.,And across Eastern Europe,,Jews display pictures of Cyrus,and of George V,side by side --,the two great rulers,who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.,And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view,and the text of this,as a demonstration of why what is going to happen,after the war is over in 1918,is part of a divine plan.,You all know what happened.,The state of Israel is setup,,and 50 years later, in the late 60s,,it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.,And another story of the cylinder begins. 
 The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide,,has to be kept safe from communism,,and the superpower that will be created to do this,would be Iran, the Shah.,And so the Shah invents an Iranian history,,or a return to Iranian history,,that puts him in the center of a great tradition,and produces coins,showing himself,with the Cyrus cylinder.,When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis,,he summons the cylinder,and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran,,and is part of those great celebrations,of the Pahlavi dynasty.,Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah. 
 10 years later, another story:,Iranian Revolution, 1979.,Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus;,we're not interested in that history,,we're interested in Islamic Iran --,until Iraq,,the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region,,attacks.,Then another Iran-Iraq war.,And it becomes critical for the Iranians,to remember their great past,,their great past,when they fought Iraq and won.,It becomes critical to find a symbol,that will pull together all Iranians --,Muslims and non-Muslims,,Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran,,people who are devout, not devout.,And the obvious emblem is Cyrus. 
 So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem,cooperate and work together, as we've been doing,,the Iranians ask for one thing only,as a loan.,It's the only object they want.,They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.,And last year,,the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran,for the second time.,It's shown being presented here, put into its case,by the director of the National Museum of Tehran,,one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,,Mrs. Ardakani.,It was a huge event.,This is the other side of that same picture.,It's seen in Tehran,by between one and two million people,in the space of a few months.,This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition,in the West.,And it's the subject of a huge debate,about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means,,but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder --,Cyrus as the defender of the homeland,,the champion, of course, of Iranian identity,and of the Iranian peoples,,tolerant of all faiths.,And in the current Iran,,Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places,in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of. 
 To see this object in Tehran,,thousands of Jews living in Iran,came to Tehran to see it.,It became a great emblem,,a great subject of debate,about what Iran is at home and abroad.,Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?,Will Iran set free the people,that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?,This is heady national rhetoric,,and it was all put together,in a great pageant,launching the return.,Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage,with great figures from Iranian history,gathering to take their place,in the heritage of Iran.,It was a narrative presented,by the president himself. 
 And for me,,to take this object to Iran,,to be allowed to take this object to Iran,was to be allowed to be part,of an extraordinary debate,led at the highest levels,about what Iran is,,what different Irans there are,and how the different histories of Iran,might shape the world today.,It's a debate that's still continuing,,and it will continue to rumble,,because this object,is one of the great declarations,of a human aspiration.,It stands with the American constitution.,It certainly says far more about real freedoms,than Magna Carta.,It is a document that can mean so many things,,for Iran and for the region. 
 A replica of this,is at the United Nations.,In New York this autumn, it will be present,when the great debates,about the future of the Middle East take place.,And I want to finish by asking you,what the next story will be,in which this object figures.,It will appear, certainly,,in many more Middle Eastern stories.,And what story of the Middle East,,what story of the world,,do you want to see,reflecting what is said,,what is expressed in this cylinder?,The right of peoples,to live together in the same state,,worshiping differently, freely --,a Middle East, a world,,in which religion is not the subject of division,or of debate. 
 In the world of the Middle East at the moment,,the debates are, as you know, shrill.,But I think it's possible,that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them,may well be the voice,of this mute thing,,the Cyrus cylinder. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Okay, now I don't wantnto alarm anybody in this room,,but it's just come to my attentionnthat the person to your right is a liar. 
 (Laughter) 
 Also, the person to your left is a liar.,Also the person sittingnin your very seats is a liar.,We're all liars.,What I'm going to do today,is I'm going to show you what the researchnsays about why we're all liars,,how you can become a liespotter,and why you might wantnto go the extra mile,and go from liespotting to truth seeking,,and ultimately to trust building. 
 Now, speaking of trust,,ever since I wrotenthis book, "Liespotting,",no one wants to meet me in personnanymore, no, no, no, no, no.,They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." 
 (Laughter) 
 I can't even getna coffee date at Starbucks.,My husband's like, "Honey, deception?,Maybe you could have focused on cooking.nHow about French cooking?" 
 So before I get started,nwhat I'm going to do,is I'm going to clarify my goal for you,,which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.,Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids,,those kids in the back of the roomnthat are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!,Your eyebrow twitched.nYou flared your nostril.,I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'nI know you're lying.",No, liespotters are armed,with scientific knowledgenof how to spot deception.,They use it to get to the truth,,and they do what maturenleaders do everyday;,they have difficult conversationsnwith difficult people,,sometimes during very difficult times.,And they start up that pathnby accepting a core proposition,,and that proposition is the following:,Lying is a cooperative act.,Think about it, a lie has no powernwhatsoever by its mere utterance.,Its power emerges,when someone else agreesnto believe the lie. 
 So I know it may sound like tough love,,but look, if at some pointnyou got lied to,,it's because you agreed to get lied to.,Truth number one about lying:nLying's a cooperative act.,Now not all lies are harmful.,Sometimes we're willingnparticipants in deception,for the sake of social dignity,,maybe to keep a secret that shouldnbe kept secret, secret.,We say, "Nice song.","Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.",Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,,"You know, I just fishednthat email out of my Spam folder.,So sorry." 
 But there are times when we are unwillingnparticipants in deception.,And that can have dramatic costs for us.,Last year saw 997 billion dollars,in corporate fraud alonenin the United States.,That's an eyelashnunder a trillion dollars.,That's seven percent of revenues.,Deception can cost billions.,Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.,Or in the casenof double agents and traitors,,like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,,lies can betray our country,,they can compromise our security,nthey can undermine democracy,,they can cause the deathsnof those that defend us. 
 Deception is actually serious business.,This con man, Henry Oberlander,nhe was such an effective con man,,British authorities say,he could have undermined the entirenbanking system of the Western world.,And you can't find this guy on Google;nyou can't find him anywhere.,He was interviewed once,nand he said the following.,He said, "Look, I've got one rule.",And this was Henry's rule, he said,,"Look, everyone is willingnto give you something.,They're ready to give you somethingnfor whatever it is they're hungry for.",And that's the crux of it.,If you don't want to bendeceived, you have to know,,what is it that you're hungry for? 
 And we all kind of hate to admit it.,We wish we werenbetter husbands, better wives,,smarter, more powerful, taller, richer --,the list goes on.,Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap,,to connect our wishes and our fantasies,about who we wish we were,nhow we wish we could be,,with what we're really like.,And boy are we willing to fill innthose gaps in our lives with lies. 
 On a given day, studies shownthat you may be lied to,anywhere from 10 to 200 times.,Now granted, many of those are white lies.,But in another study,,it showed that strangers lied three times,within the first 10 minutesnof meeting each other. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now when we first hearnthis data, we recoil.,We can't believe how prevalent lying is.,We're essentially against lying.,But if you look more closely,nthe plot actually thickens.,We lie more to strangersnthan we lie to coworkers.,Extroverts lie more than introverts.,Men lie eight times more about themselvesnthan they do other people.,Women lie more to protect other people.,If you're an average married couple,,you're going to lie to your spousenin one out of every 10 interactions.,Now, you may think that's bad.,If you're unmarried,nthat number drops to three. 
 Lying's complex.,It's woven into the fabricnof our daily and our business lives.,We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.,We parse it out on an as-needed basis,,sometimes for very good reasons,,other times just becausenwe don't understand the gaps in our lives.,That's truth number two about lying.,We're against lying,,but we're covertly for it,in ways that our society has sanctionednfor centuries and centuries and centuries.,It's as old as breathing.,It's part of our culture,nit's part of our history.,Think Dante, Shakespeare,nthe Bible, News of the World. 
 (Laughter) 
 Lying has evolutionary valuento us as a species.,Researchers have long knownnthat the more intelligent the species,,the larger the neocortex,,the more likely it is to be deceptive.,Now you might remember Koko.,Does anybody remember Koko the gorillanwho was taught sign language?,Koko was taught to communicatenvia sign language.,Here's Koko with her kitten.,It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.,Koko once blamed her pet kittennfor ripping a sink out of the wall. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're hardwired to becomenleaders of the pack.,It's starts really, really early.,How early?,Well babies will fake a cry,,pause, wait to see who's coming,and then go right back to crying.,One-year-olds learn concealment. 
 (Laughter) 
 Two-year-olds bluff.,Five-year-olds lie outright.,They manipulate via flattery.,Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.,By the time you enter college,,you're going to lie to your momnin one out of every five interactions.,By the time we enter this work worldnand we're breadwinners,,we enter a world that is just clutterednwith Spam, fake digital friends,,partisan media,,ingenious identity thieves,,world-class Ponzi schemers,,a deception epidemic --,in short, what one author callsna post-truth society.,It's been very confusingnfor a long time now. 
 What do you do?,Well, there are steps we can takento navigate our way through the morass.,Trained liespotters get to the truthn90 percent of the time.,The rest of us,nwe're only 54 percent accurate.,Why is it so easy to learn?,There are good liars and bad liars.,There are no real original liars.,We all make the same mistakes.nWe all use the same techniques.,So what I'm going to do is I'm goingnto show you two patterns of deception.,And then we're goingnto look at the hot spots,and see if we can find them ourselves.,We're going to start with speech. 
 (Video) Bill Clinton:nI want you to listen to me.,I'm going to say this again.,I did not have sexual relationsnwith that woman, Miss Lewinsky.,I never told anybody to lie,nnot a single time, never.,And these allegations are false.,And I need to go back to worknfor the American people.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Pamela Meyer: Okay,nwhat were the telltale signs?,Well first we heard what's knownnas a non-contracted denial.,Studies show that peoplenwho are overdetermined in their denial,will resort to formal rathernthan informal language.,We also heardndistancing language: "that woman.",We know that liars will unconsciouslyndistance themselves,from their subject,,using language as their tool.,Now if Bill Clinton had said,n"Well, to tell you the truth ...",or Richard Nixon's favorite,n"In all candor ...",he would have been a dead giveaway,for any liespotter that knows,that qualifying language, as it's called,nqualifying language like that,,further discredits the subject.,Now if he had repeatednthe question in its entirety,,or if he had peppered his accountnwith a little too much detail --,and we're all really gladnhe didn't do that --,he would have further discredited himself. 
 Freud had it right.,Freud said, look,nthere's much more to it than speech:,"No mortal can keep a secret.,If his lips are silent,nhe chatters with his fingertips.",And we all do it no matternhow powerful you are.,We all chatter with our fingertips.,I'm going to show younDominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama,who's chattering with his fingertips. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now this brings us to our next pattern,nwhich is body language.,With body language,nhere's what you've got to do.,You've really got to just thrownyour assumptions out the door.,Let the science tempernyour knowledge a little bit.,Because we think liarsnfidget all the time.,Well guess what, they're known to freezentheir upper bodies when they're lying.,We think liars won't look you in the eyes.,Well guess what, they looknyou in the eyes a little too much,just to compensate for that myth.,We think warmth and smilesnconvey honesty, sincerity.,But a trained liespotterncan spot a fake smile a mile away.,Can you all spot the fake smile here?,You can consciously contractnthe muscles in your cheeks.,But the real smile's in the eyes,nthe crow's feet of the eyes.,They cannot be consciously contracted,,especially if you overdid the Botox.,Don't overdo the Botox;nnobody will think you're honest. 
 Now we're going to look at the hot spots.,Can you tell what's happeningnin a conversation?,Can you start to find the hot spots,to see the discrepancies,between someone's wordsnand someone's actions?,Now, I know it seems really obvious,,but when you're having a conversationnwith someone you suspect of deception,,attitude is by far the most overlookednbut telling of indicators. 
 An honest personnis going to be cooperative.,They're going to shownthey're on your side.,They're going to be enthusiastic.,They're going to be willing and helpfulnto getting you to the truth.,They're going to be willingnto brainstorm, name suspects,,provide details.,They're going to say,,"Hey, maybe it was those guys in payrollnthat forged those checks.",They're going to be infuriatednif they sense they're wrongly accused,throughout the entire coursenof the interview, not just in flashes;,they'll be infuriated throughoutnthe entire course of the interview.,And if you ask someone honest,what should happennto whomever did forge those checks,,an honest person is much more likely,to recommend strict rathernthan lenient punishment. 
 Now let's say you're havingnthat exact same conversation,with someone deceptive.,That person may be withdrawn,,look down, lower their voice,,pause, be kind of herky-jerky.,Ask a deceptive personnto tell their story,,they're going to pepper itnwith way too much detail,in all kinds of irrelevant places.,And then they're going to tell their storynin strict chronological order.,And what a trained interrogator does,is they come in and in very subtle waysnover the course of several hours,,they will ask that personnto tell that story backwards,,and then they'll watch them squirm,,and track which questions producenthe highest volume of deceptive tells. 
 Why do they do that?nWell, we all do the same thing.,We rehearse our words,,but we rarely rehearse our gestures.,We say "yes," we shake our heads "no.",We tell very convincing stories,nwe slightly shrug our shoulders.,We commit terrible crimes,,and we smile at the delightnin getting away with it.,Now, that smile is knownnin the trade as "duping delight." 
 And we're going to see thatnin several videos moving forward,,but we're going to start --nfor those of you who don't know him,,this is presidentialncandidate John Edwards,who shocked America by fatheringna child out of wedlock.,We're going to see him talknabout getting a paternity test.,See now if you can spot himnsaying, "yes" while shaking his head "no,",slightly shrugging his shoulders. 
 (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happynto participate in one.,I know that it's not possiblenthat this child could be mine,,because of the timing of events.,So I know it's not possible.,Happy to take a paternity test,nand would love to see it happen. 
 Interviewer: Are you going to donthat soon? Is there somebody -- 
 JE: Well, I'm only one side.nI'm only one side of the test.,But I'm happy to participate in one. 
 PM: Okay, those head shakesnare much easier to spot,once you know to look for them.,There are going to be timesnwhen someone makes one expression,while masking another that justnkind of leaks through in a flash.,Murderers are known to leak sadness.,Your new joint venture partnernmight shake your hand,,celebrate, go out to dinner with younand then leak an expression of anger.,And we're not all going to becomenfacial expression experts overnight here,,but there's one I can teach younthat's very dangerous,and it's easy to learn,,and that's the expression of contempt.,Now with anger, you've gotntwo people on an even playing field.,It's still somewhatnof a healthy relationship.,But when anger turns to contempt,nyou've been dismissed.,It's associated with moral superiority.,And for that reason, it's very,nvery hard to recover from.,Here's what it looks like.,It's marked by one lip cornernpulled up and in.,It's the only asymmetrical expression.,And in the presence of contempt,nwhether or not deception follows --,and it doesn't always follow --,look the other way,ngo the other direction,,reconsider the deal,,say, "No thank you. I'm not coming upnfor just one more nightcap. Thank you." 
 Science has surfacednmany, many more indicators.,We know, for example,,we know liars will shift their blink rate,,point their feet towards an exit.,They will take barrier objects,and put them between themselvesnand the person that is interviewing them.,They'll alter their vocal tone,,often making their vocal tone much lower. 
 Now here's the deal.,These behaviors are just behaviors.,They're not proof of deception.,They're red flags.,We're human beings.,We make deceptive flailing gesturesnall over the place all day long.,They don't mean anythingnin and of themselves.,But when you see clustersnof them, that's your signal.,Look, listen, probe,nask some hard questions,,get out of that very comfortablenmode of knowing,,walk into curiosity mode,nask more questions,,have a little dignity, treat the personnyou're talking to with rapport.,Don't try to be like those folksnon "Law & Order" and those other TV shows,that pummel their subjectsninto submission.,Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. 
 Now, we've talked a little bitnabout how to talk to someone who's lying,and how to spot a lie.,And as I promised, we're now goingnto look at what the truth looks like.,But I'm going to show you two videos,,two mothers -- one is lying,none is telling the truth.,And these were surfaced by researchernDavid Matsumoto in California.,And I think they're an excellent examplenof what the truth looks like. 
 This mother, Diane Downs,,shot her kids at close range,,drove them to the hospitalnwhile they bled all over the car,,claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.,And you'll see when you see the video,,she can't even pretendnto be an agonizing mother.,What you want to look for herenis an incredible discrepancy,between horrific events that she describesnand her very, very cool demeanor.,And if you look closely, you'll seenduping delight throughout this video. 
 (Video) Diane Downs:nAt night when I close my eyes,,I can see Christie reachingnher hand out to me while I'm driving,,and the blood just keptncoming out of her mouth.,And that -- maybenit'll fade too with time --,but I don't think so.,That bothers me the most. 
 PM: Now I'm going to show you a video 
 of an actual grieving mother,nErin Runnion,,confronting her daughter's murderernand torturer in court.,Here you're going to see no false emotion,,just the authentic expressionnof a mother's agony. 
 (Video) Erin Runnion:nI wrote this statement,on the third anniversarynof the night you took my baby,,and you hurt her,,and you crushed her,,you terrified her until her heart stopped.,And she fought, and I know she fought you.,But I know she looked at younwith those amazing brown eyes,,and you still wanted to kill her.,And I don't understand it,,and I never will. 
 PM: Okay, there's no doubtingnthe veracity of those emotions. 
 Now the technologynaround what the truth looks like,is progressing on, the science of it.,We know, for example,,that we now have specialized eye trackersnand infrared brain scans,,MRI's that can decode the signalsnthat our bodies send out,when we're trying to be deceptive.,And these technologies are goingnto be marketed to all of us,as panaceas for deceit,,and they will provenincredibly useful some day.,But you've got to ask yourselfnin the meantime:,Who do you want on your sidenof the meeting,,someone who's trainednin getting to the truth,or some guy who's going to dragna 400-pound electroencephalogram,through the door? 
 Liespotters rely on human tools.,They know, as someone once said,,"Character's who you are in the dark.",And what's kind of interestingnis that today, we have so little darkness.,Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.,It's transparentnwith blogs and social networks,broadcasting the buzznof a whole new generation of people,that have made a choice to liventheir lives in public.,It's a much more noisy world.,So one challenge we have is to remember,,oversharing, that's not honesty.,Our manic tweeting and textingncan blind us,to the fact that the subtletiesnof human decency -- character integrity --,that's still what matters,nthat's always what's going to matter.,So in this much noisier world,,it might make sense for us,to be just a little bit more explicitnabout our moral code. 
 When you combine the sciencenof recognizing deception,with the art of looking, listening,,you exempt yourselfnfrom collaborating in a lie.,You start up that pathnof being just a little bit more explicit,,because you signal to everyone around you,,you say, "Hey, my world, our world,nit's going to be an honest one.,My world is going to benone where truth is strengthened,and falsehood is recognizednand marginalized.",And when you do that,,the ground around you startsnto shift just a little bit. 
 And that's the truth. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk today,about the pleasures of everyday life.,But I want to begin with a story,of an unusual and terrible man.,This is Hermann Goering.,Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,,his designated successor.,And like Hitler,,Goering fancied himself a collector of art.,He went through Europe, through World War II,,stealing, extorting and occasionally buying,various paintings for his collection.,And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.,Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.,So he finally found an art dealer,,a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren,,who sold him a wonderful Vermeer,for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.,And it was his favorite artwork ever. 
 World War II came to an end,,and Goering was captured, tried at Nuremberg,and ultimately sentenced to death.,Then the Allied forces went through his collections,and found the paintings,and went after the people who sold it to him.,And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam,and arrested Van Meegeren.,Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason,,which is itself punishable by death.,Six weeks into his prison sentence,,van Meegeren confessed.,But he didn't confess to treason.,He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece,to that Nazi.,I painted it myself; I'm a forger.",Now nobody believed him.,And he said, "I'll prove it.,Bring me a canvas and some paint,,and I will paint a Vermeer much better,than I sold that disgusting Nazi.,I also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work.",(Laughter),So they brought him in.,He painted a beautiful Vermeer.,And then the charges of treason were dropped.,He had a lesser charge of forgery,,got a year sentence,and died a hero to the Dutch people.,There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren,,but I want to turn now to Goering,,who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg. 
 Now Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.,Even for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.,His American interrogators described him,as an amicable psychopath.,But you could feel sympathy,for the reaction he had,when he was told that his favorite painting,was actually a forgery.,According to his biographer,,"He looked as if for the first time,he had discovered there was evil in the world.",(Laughter),And he killed himself soon afterwards.,He had discovered after all,that the painting he thought was this,was actually that.,It looked the same,,but it had a different origin, it was a different artwork. 
 It wasn't just him who was in for a shock.,Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.,And he boasted about all the great masterpieces,that he himself had painted,that were attributed to other artists.,In particular, "The Supper at Emmaus",which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work --,people would come [from] all over the world to see it --,was actually a forgery.,It was not that painting, but that painting.,And when that was discovered,,it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum. 
 Why does this matter?,I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much?,Why do we respond so much,to our knowledge of where something comes from?,Well there's an answer that many people would give.,Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe,would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously,is because we're snobs, because we're focused on status.,Among other things,,if you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are,,it's always better to own an original than a forgery,because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.,I don't doubt that that plays some role,,but what I want to convince you of today,is that there's something else going on.,I want to convince you,that humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists.,What I mean by this,is we don't just respond to things as we see them,,or feel them, or hear them.,Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs,,about what they really are, what they came from,,what they're made of, what their hidden nature is.,I want to suggest that this is true,,not just for how we think about things,,but how we react to things. 
 So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep --,and that this isn't true,just for higher level pleasures like art,,but even the most seemingly simple pleasures,are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences.,So take food.,Would you eat this?,Well, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?",Some of you would eat it if it's pork, but not beef.,Some of you would eat it if it's beef, but not pork.,Few of you would eat it if it's a rat,or a human.,Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu.,That's not so surprising. 
 But what's more interesting,is how it tastes to you,will depend critically on what you think you're eating.,So one demonstration of this was done with young children.,How do you make children,not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk,,but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk --,to think they taste better?,It's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.,They believe McDonald's food is tastier,,and it leads them to experience it as tastier. 
 How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?,It's very simple:,pour it from an expensive bottle.,There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing,that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff,,it tastes better to you.,This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.,They get people into a fMRI scanner,,and while they're lying there, through a tube,,they get to sip wine.,In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.,Everybody, of course,,drinks exactly the same wine.,But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff,,parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward,light up like a Christmas tree.,It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more,,you really experience it in a different way. 
 Or take sex.,These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.,And if you simply show people these pictures,,they'll say these are fairly attractive people.,But how attractive you find them,,how sexually or romantically moved you are by them,,rests critically on who you think you're looking at.,You probably think the picture on the left is male,,the one on the right is female.,If that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.,(Laughter),It will make a difference if they turn out to be,much younger or much older than you think they are.,It will make a difference if you were to discover,that the person you're looking at with lust,is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter,,your mother or father.,Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.,Maybe one of the most heartening findings,from the psychology of pleasure,is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance.,If you like somebody, they look better to you.,This is why spouses in happy marriages,tend to think that their husband or wife,looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do. 
 (Laughter) 
 A particularly dramatic example of this,comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.,So Capgras syndrome is a disorder,where you get a specific delusion.,Sufferers of Capgras syndrome,believe that the people they love most in the world,have been replaced by perfect duplicates.,Now often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.,People have murdered those that they loved,,believing that they were murdering an imposter.,But there's at least one case,where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending.,This was recorded in 1931.,"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome,who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover.",But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.,After she got it, "She was happy to report,that she has discovered that he possessed a double,who was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic.",Of course, it was the same man,,but she was seeing him in different ways. 
 As a third example,,consider consumer products.,So one reason why you might like something is its utility.,You can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs;,and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.,But each of these three objects has value,above and beyond what it can do for you,based on its history.,The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy,and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.,The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears,and sold for several hundreds of dollars.,And in fact, there's a thriving market,in the partially eaten food of beloved people.,(Laughter),The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.,According to an unconfirmed report,,a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars,for this pair of shoes.,They were the ones thrown at George Bush,at an Iraqi press conference several years ago. 
 (Applause) 
 Now this attraction to objects,doesn't just work for celebrity objects.,Each one of us, most people,,have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable,,in that it has value because of its history --,maybe your wedding ring, maybe your child's baby shoes --,so that if it was lost, you couldn't get it back.,You could get something that looked like it or felt like it,,but you couldn't get the same object back.,With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck,,we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters,for the objects that people like.,So in one of our experiments,,we asked people to name a famous person who they adored,,a living person they adored. 
 So one answer was George Clooney.,Then we asked them,,"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?",And the answer is a fair amount --,more than you would pay for a brand new sweater,or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.,Then we asked other groups of subjects --,we gave them different restrictions,and different conditions.,So for instance, we told some people,,"Look, you can buy the sweater,,but you can't tell anybody you own it,,and you can't resell it.",That drops the value of it,,suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.,But what really causes an effect,is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it,,but before it gets to you,,it's thoroughly washed.",That causes a huge drop in the value.,As my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties." 
 (Laughter) 
 So let's go back to art.,I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.,If people want to get me something at the end of the conference,,you could buy me a Chagall.,But I don't want a duplicate,,even if I can't tell the difference.,That's not because, or it's not simply because,,I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original.,Rather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.,In the case of artwork,,the history is special indeed.,The philosopher Denis Dutton,in his wonderful book "The Art Instinct",makes the case that, "The value of an artwork,is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation.",And that could explain the difference,between an original and a forgery.,They may look alike, but they have a different history.,The original is typically the product of a creative act,,the forgery isn't.,I think this approach can explain differences,in people's taste in art. 
 This is a work by Jackson Pollock.,Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?,Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them?,They just don't like it.,I'm not going to make a claim about who's right,,but I will make an empirical claim,about people's intuitions,,which is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock,,you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it,to believe that these works are difficult to create,,that they require a lot of time and energy,and creative energy.,I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example,because there's a young American artist,who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock,,and her work was worth,many tens of thousands of dollars --,in large part because she's a very young artist. 
 This is Marla Olmstead,who did most of her work when she was three years old.,The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead,is her family made the mistake,of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house,to film her painting.,And they then reported that her father was coaching her.,When this came out on television,,the value of her art dropped to nothing.,It was the same art, physically,,but the history had changed. 
 I've been focusing now on the visual arts,,but I want to give two examples from music.,This is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.,And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten,decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment.,The question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell,,the music of Joshua Bell,,if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?,So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin,down to a Washington D.C. subway station,and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make.,And here's a brief clip of this.,(Violin music),After being there for three-quarters of an hour,,he made 32 dollars.,Not bad. It's also not good.,Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell,,you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.,He actually made 20 dollars more than that,,but he didn't count it.,Because this woman comes up --,you see at the end of the video -- she comes up.,She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before,at this extravagant black-tie affair.,So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.,So she's struck with pity.,She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The second example from music,is from John Cage's modernist composition,,"4'33".",As many of you know,,this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench,,opens up the piano,and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds --,that period of silence.,And people have different views on this.,But what I want to point out,is you can buy this from iTunes.,(Laughter),For a dollar 99,,you can listen to that silence,,which is different than other forms of silence. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now I've been talking so far about pleasure,,but what I want to suggest,is that everything I've said applies as well to pain.,And how you think about what you're experiencing,,your beliefs about the essence of it,,affect how it hurts.,One lovely experiment,was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner.,What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates,to an electric shock machine.,And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks.,So it was a series of five painful shocks.,Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks,by somebody in another room,,but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks.,There's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button.,The first shock is recorded as very painful.,The second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it.,The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.,The pain gets less.,In the other condition,,they're told that the person in the next room,is shocking them on purpose -- knows they're shocking them.,The first shock hurts like hell.,The second shock hurts just as much,,and the third and the fourth and the fifth.,It hurts more,if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose. 
 The most extreme example of this,is that in some cases,,pain under the right circumstances,can transform into pleasure.,Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property,that will often seek out low-level doses of pain,in controlled circumstances,and take pleasure from it --,as in the eating of hot chili peppers,and roller coaster rides.,The point was nicely summarized,by the poet John Milton,who wrote, "The mind is its own place,,and in itself can make a heaven of hell,,a hell of heaven." 
 And I'll end with that. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Is there anything unique about human beings?,There is.,We're the only creatures,with fully developed moral sentiments.,We're obsessed with morality as social creatures.,We need to know why people are doing what they're doing.,And I personally am obsessed with morality.,It was all due to this woman,,Sister Mary Marastela,,also known as my mom.,As an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense,,and I learned to say phrases in Latin,,but I also had time to think,about whether my mother's top-down morality,applied to everybody.,I saw that people who were religious and non-religious,were equally obsessed with morality.,I thought, maybe there's some earthly basis,for moral decisions.,But I wanted to go further,than to say our brains make us moral.,I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.,I want to know,if there was a moral molecule. 
 After 10 years of experiments,,I found it.,Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.,This little syringe,contains the moral molecule.,(Laughter),It's called oxytocin.,So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule,found only in mammals.,In rodents, it was known,to make mothers care for their offspring,,and in some creatures,,allowed for toleration of burrowmates.,But in humans, it was only known,to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women,,and is released by both sexes during sex. 
 So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.,I did what most of us do -- I tried it on some colleagues.,One of them told me,,"Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.,It is," he said, "only a female molecule.,It can't be that important.",But I countered, "Well men's brains make this too.,There must be a reason why.",But he was right, it was a stupid idea.,But it was testably stupid.,In other words, I thought I could design an experiment,to see if oxytocin made people moral. 
 Turns out it wasn't so easy.,First of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule.,Baseline levels are near zero,,without some stimulus to cause its release.,And when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life,,and degrades rapidly at room temperature.,So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin,,have to grab it fast and keep it cold.,I think I can do that.,Now luckily, oxytocin is produced,both in the brain and in the blood,,so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.,Then I had to measure morality. 
 So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project.,So I started smaller.,I studied one single virtue:,trustworthiness.,Why? I had shown in the early 2000s,that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people,are more prosperous.,So in these countries, more economic transactions occur,and more wealth is created,,alleviating poverty.,So poor countries are by and large low trust countries.,So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness,,I might help alleviate poverty. 
 But I'm also a skeptic.,I don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?",So instead I use,the Jerry Maguire approach to research.,If you're so virtuous,,show me the money.,So what we do in my lab,is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.,Let me show you how we do that.,So we recruit some people for an experiment.,They all get $10 if they agree to show up.,We give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.,Then we match them in pairs by computer.,And in that pair, one person gets a message saying,,"Do you want to give up some of your $10,you earned for being here,and ship it to someone else in the lab?",The trick is you can't see them,,you can't talk to them.,You only do it one time.,Now whatever you give up,gets tripled in the other person's account.,You're going to make them a lot wealthier.,And they get a message by computer saying,person one sent you this amount of money.,Do you want to keep it all,,or do you want to send some amount back? 
 So think about this experiment for minute.,You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half.,Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle,and take four tubes of blood.,And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger?,So this was the birth of vampire economics.,Make a decision and give me some blood. 
 So in fact, experimental economists,had run this test around the world,,and for much higher stakes,,and the consensus view,was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust,,and the transfer from the second person back to the first,measured trustworthiness.,But in fact, economists were flummoxed,on why the second person would ever return any money.,They assumed money is good,,why not keep it all? 
 That's not what we found.,We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money,,and of those who received money,,95 percent returned some of it.,But why?,Well by measuring oxytocin,we found that the more money the second person received,,the more their brain produced oxytocin,,and the more oxytocin on board,,the more money they returned.,So we have a biology of trustworthiness. 
 But wait. What's wrong with this experiment?,Two things.,One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation.,So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin,,but they didn't have any effect.,But the second is,that I still only had this indirect relationship,between oxytocin and trustworthiness.,I didn't know for sure,oxytocin caused trustworthiness.,So to make the experiment,,I knew I'd have to go into the brain,and manipulate oxytocin directly.,I used everything short of a drill,to get oxytocin into my own brain.,And I found I could do it,with a nasal inhaler.,So along with colleagues in Zurich,,we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo,,had that same trust test with money,,and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust,,we can more than double the number of people,who sent all their money to a stranger --,all without altering mood or cognition. 
 So oxytocin is the trust molecule,,but is it the moral molecule?,Using the oxytocin inhaler,,we ran more studies.,We showed that oxytocin infusion,increases generosity,in unilateral monetary transfers,by 80 percent.,We showed it increases donations to charity,by 50 percent.,We've also investigated,non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin.,These include massage,,dancing and praying.,Yes, my mom was happy about that last one.,And whenever we raise oxytocin,,people willingly open up their wallets,and share money with strangers. 
 But why do they do this?,What does it feel like,when your brain is flooded with oxytocin?,To investigate this question, we ran an experiment,where we had people watch a video,of a father and his four year-old son,,and his son has terminal brain cancer.,After they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings,and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin.,The change in oxytocin,predicted their feelings of empathy.,So it's empathy,that makes us connect to other people.,It's empathy that makes us help other people.,It's empathy that makes us moral. 
 Now this idea is not new.,A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith,wrote a book in 1759,called "The Theory of Moral Sentiments.",In this book, Smith argued,that we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason,,but for a bottom-up reason.,He said we're social creatures,,so we share the emotions of others.,So if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain.,So I tend to avoid that.,If I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy.,So I tend to do those things.,Now this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later,,would write a little book called "The Wealth of Nations" --,the founding document of economics.,But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher,,and he was right on why we're moral.,I just found the molecule behind it.,But knowing that molecule is valuable,,because it tells us how to turn up this behavior,and what turns it off.,In particular, it tells us,why we see immorality. 
 So to investigate immorality,,let me bring you back now to 1980.,I'm working at a gas station,on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.,You sit in a gas station all day,,you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.,So one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth,with this beautiful jewelry box.,Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.,And he said, "Hey, I was in the men's room.,I just found this. What do you think we should do with it?","I don't know, put it in the lost and found.","Well this is very valuable.,We have to find the owner for this." I said, "Yea." 
 So we're trying to decide what to do with this,,and the phone rings.,And a man says very excitedly,,"I was in your gas station a while ago,,and I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it.",I said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah.","Hey, a guy just found it.","Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number.,Tell that guy to wait half an hour.,I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward.",Great, so I tell the guy, "Look, relax.,Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good.",He said, "I can't do it.,I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes,,and I need this job, I've got to go.",Again he asked me, "What do you think we should do?",I'm in high school. I have no idea.,So I said, "I'll hold it for you.",He said, "You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward.",I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars,,and when the guy comes ... " 
 You see it. I was conned.,So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop,,and I was the pigeon.,So the way many cons work,is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him,,it's that he shows he trusts the victim.,Now we know what happens.,The victim's brain releases oxytocin,,and you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money. 
 So who are these people,who manipulate our oxytocin systems?,We found, testing thousands of individuals,,that five percent of the population,don't release oxytocin on stimulus.,So if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin.,If there's money on the table, they keep it all.,So there's a technical word for these people in my lab.,We call them bastards.,(Laughter),These are not people you want to have a beer with.,They have many of the attributes of psychopaths. 
 Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited.,One is through improper nurturing.,So we've studied sexually abused women,,and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus.,You need enough nurturing,for this system to develop properly.,Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin.,So we all know this, when we're really stressed out,,we're not acting our best. 
 There's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting --,through the action of testosterone.,So we, in experiments, have administered testosterone to men.,And instead of sharing money,,they become selfish.,But interestingly,,high testosterone males are also more likely,to use their own money to punish others for being selfish.,(Laughter),Now think about this. It means, within our own biology,,we have the yin and yang of morality.,We have oxytocin that connects us to others,,makes us feel what they feel.,And we have testosterone.,And men have 10 times the testosterone as women,,so men do this more than women --,we have testosterone that makes us want to punish,people who behave immorally.,We don't need God or government telling us what to do.,It's all inside of us. 
 So you may be wondering:,these are beautiful laboratory experiments,,do they really apply to real life?,Yeah, I've been worrying about that too.,So I've gone out of the lab,to see if this really holds in our daily lives.,So last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England.,200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion.,I didn't know a single person.,And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall.,And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice,and needles and tubes.,And I took blood from the bride and the groom,and the wedding party and the family and the friends,before and immediately after the vows. 
 (Laughter) 
 And guess what?,Weddings cause a release of oxytocin,,but they do so in a very particular way.,Who is the center of the wedding solar system?,The bride.,She had the biggest increase in oxytocin.,Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride?,Her mother, that's right.,Her mother was number two.,Then the groom's father, then the groom,,then the family, then the friends --,arrayed around the bride,like planets around the Sun.,So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual,to connect us to this new couple,,connect us emotionally.,Why? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing,to perpetuate the species. 
 I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money,didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.,So even though I have a fear of heights,,I recently strapped myself to another human being,and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft.,I took my blood before and after,,and I had a huge spike of oxytocin.,And there are so many ways we can connect to people.,For example, through social media.,Many people are Tweeting right now.,So we investigated the role of social media,and found the using social media,produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin. 
 So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.,And they had the reporters and their producers participate.,And one of these guys, he must have been 22,,he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin.,I mean, astounding; no one has this.,So he was using social media in private.,When I wrote my report to the Koreans,,I said, "Look, I don't know what this guy was doing,",but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend.,They checked.,He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page.,There you go. That's connection.,So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people,,and it seems to be universal. 
 Two weeks ago,,I just got back from Papua New Guinea,where I went up to the highlands --,very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers,living as they have lived for millenia.,There are 800 different languages in the highlands.,These are the most primitive people in the world.,And they indeed also release oxytocin. 
 So oxytocin connects us to other people.,Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel.,And it's so easy to cause people's brains,to release oxytocin.,I know how to do it,,and my favorite way to do it is, in fact, the easiest.,Let me show it to you.,Come here. Give me a hug.,(Laughter),There you go. 
 (Applause) 
 So my penchant for hugging other people,has earned me the nickname Dr. Love.,I'm happy to share a little more love in the world,,it's great,,but here's your prescription from Dr. Love:,eight hugs a day.,We have found that people who release more oxytocin,are happier.,And they're happier,because they have better relationships of all types.,Dr. Love says eight hugs a day.,Eight hugs a day -- you'll be happier,and the world will be a better place.,Of course, if you don't like to touch people, I can always shove this up your nose. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Let me introduce to you Rezero.,This little fellow was developed,by a group of 10 undergraduate students,at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory,at ETH-Zurich. 
 Our robot belongs to a family of robots,called Ballbots.,Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing,and moving on one single ball.,The main characteristics of such a system is,that there's one sole contact point to the ground.,This means that the robot,is inherently unstable.,It's like when I am trying to stand,on one foot. 
 You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness,of a robot that's unstable?,Now we'll explain that in a second.,Let me first explain how Rezero,actually keeps his balance.,Rezero keeps his balance by constantly,measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.,He then counteracts and avoids toppling over,by turning the motors appropriately.,This happens 160 times per second,,and if anything fails in this process,,Rezero would immediately fall to the ground. 
 Now to move and to balance,,Rezero needs to turn the ball.,The ball is driven by three special wheels,that allow Rezero to move into any direction,and also move around his own axis,at the same time.,Due to his instability, Rezero is always,in motion. Now here's the trick.,It's indeed exactly this instability that allows,a robot to move very [dynamically].,Let's play a little.,You may have wondered what happens,if I give the robot a little push.,In this mode, he's trying to maintain,his position. 
 For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce,to my colleagues Michael, on the computer,,and Thomas who's helping me onstage.,In the next mode, Rezero is passive,,and we can move him around.,With almost no force I can control,his position and his velocity.,I can also make him spin.,In the next mode, we can get Rezero,to follow a person.,He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.,This works with a laser sensor,that's mounted on top of Rezero.,With the same method, we can also,get him to circle a person.,We call this the orbiting mode.,All right, thank you, Thomas.,(Applause) 
 Now, what's the use of this technology?,For now, it's an experiment, but let me,show you some possible future applications.,Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.,With a screen it could inform people or show,them around in a fun and entertaining way.,In a hospital, this device could be used to,carry around medical equipment.,Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small,footprint and it's also easy to move around.,And of course, who wouldn't like,to take a ride on one of these.,And these are more practical applications.,But there's also a certain beauty,within this technology. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.I'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of you,because I have no form,of PowerPoint presentation.,So what I'm going to do,is, every now and again, I will make this gesture,,and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy,,you can imagine what you'd like to see. 
 I do a radio show.,The radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage.",It's about science, it's about rationalism.,So therefore, we get a lot of complaints,every single week --,complaints including one we get very often,,which is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage,",celebrates the idea of vivisection.,We have made it quite clear to these people,that an infinite monkey cage is roomy. 
 (Laughter) 
 We also had someone else who said,,"'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous.,An infinite number of monkeys,could never write the works of Shakespeare.,We know this because they did an experiment.",Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,,and after a week, they only used it as a bathroom. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the main element though, the main complaint we get --,and one that I find most worrying --,is that people say, "Oh, why do you insist,on ruining the magic?,You bring in science, and it ruins the magic.",Now I'm an arts graduate;,I love myth and magic,and existentialism and self-loathing.,That's what I do.,But I also don't understand,how it does ruin the magic.,All of the magic, I think,,that may well be taken away by science,is then replaced by something as wonderful. 
 Astrology, for instance:,like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.,(Laughter),Now astrology --,we remove the banal idea,that your life could be predicted;,that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man,who's wearing a hat.,That is gone.,But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.,We can see predictions of galaxies forming,,of galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.,This is a wonderful thing.,If the Sun could one day -- and indeed the Earth, in fact --,if the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,,one day it would say,,"Not a good day for making plans.,You'll been engulfed by a red giant." 
 And that to me as well,,that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,,well Many Worlds theory --,one of the most beautiful, fascinating,,sometimes terrifying ideas,from the quantum interpretation --,is a wonderful thing.,That every person here, every decision that you've made today,,every decision you've made in your life,,you've not really made that decision,,but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions,is made, each one going off into a new universe.,That is a wonderful idea.,If you ever think that your life is rubbish,,always remember,there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.,(Laughter),If you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,",don't end it all.,Remember that in the majority of universes,,you don't even exist in the first place.,This to me, in its own strange way,,is very, very comforting. 
 Now reincarnation, that's another thing gone -- the afterlife.,But it's not gone.,Science actually says,we will live forever.,Well, there is one proviso.,We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.,Your consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me --,that gets this one go.,But every single thing that makes us,,every atom in us,,has already created a myriad of different things,and will go on to create a myriad of new things.,We have been mountains,and apples and pulsars,and other people's knees.,Who knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.,That is a good thing.,Unlike the occupants of the universe,,the universe itself is not wasteful.,We are all totally recyclable.,And when we die,,we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.,This is a wonderful thing. 
 Understanding, to me,,does not remove the wonder and the joy.,For instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,,"Why do you love me?",And I can with all honesty,look her in the eye and say,,"Because our pheromones,matched our olfactory receptors.",(Laughter),Though I'll probably also say something,about her hair and personality as well.,And that is a wonderful thing there.,Love does not die because of that thing. 
 Pain doesn't go away either.,This is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.,If someone punches me --,and because of my personality,,this is recently a regular occurrence --,I understand where the pain comes from.,It is basically momentum to energy,where the four-vector is constant -- that's what it is.,But at no point can I react and go,,"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?",No, I just spit out a tooth. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.,I have a son. His name is Archie.,I'm very lucky,,because he's better than all the other children.,Now I know you don't think that.,You may well have your own children,and think, "Oh no, my child's best.",That's the wonderful thing about evolution --,the predilection to believe,that our child is best.,Now in many ways, that's just a survival thing.,The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes,,and therefore we love it.,But we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love.,That is a wonderful thing.,Though I should say that my son is best,and is better than your children.,I've done some tests. 
 And all of these things to me,give such joy and excitement and wonder.,Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse,for bad housework, for instance.,Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.,You house is in a terrible state.,Your partner is about to return.,You think, what should I do?,Do nothing.,All you have to do,is, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,,say, "I'm so sorry.,I stopped observing the house for a moment,,and when I started observing again,,everything had happened.",(Laughter),That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming. 
 For me, it's a very, very important thing.,Even on my journey up here --,the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.,If you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.,I'm sitting on a train.,Every time I breathe in,,I'm breathing in a million-billion-billion,atoms of oxygen.,I'm sitting on a chair.,Even though I know the chair is made of atoms,and therefore actually in many ways empty space,,I find it comfortable.,I look out the window, and I realize,that every single time we stop and I look out that window,,framed in that window,,wherever we are,,I am observing more life,than there is in the rest of the known universe,beyond the planet Earth.,If you go to the safari parks,on Saturn or Jupiter,,you will be disappointed.,And I realize I'm observing this,with the brain, the human brain,,the most complex thing in the known universe.,That, to me, is an incredible thing.,And do you know what, that might be enough. 
 Steven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said,,"The more the universe seems comprehensible,,the more it seems pointless.",Now for some people,,that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism.,But for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing.,I'm glad the universe is pointless.,It means if I get to the end of my life,,the universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot?,That's not the point.",I can make my own purpose.,You can make your own purpose.,We have the individual power,to go, "This is what I want to do.",And in a pointless universe, that, to me, is a wonderful thing.,I have chosen to make silly jokes,about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.,You, I imagine, can do much better things with your time. 
 Thank you very much. Goodbye. 
 (Applause)Embracing otherness.,When I first heard this theme,,I thought, well, embracing otherness,is embracing myself.,And the journey to that place,of understanding and acceptance,has been an interesting one for me,,and it's given me an insight,into the whole notion of self,,which I think is worth sharing with you today. 
 We each have a self,,but I don't think that we're born with one.,You know how newborn babies,believe they're part of everything;,they're not separate?,Well that fundamental sense of oneness,is lost on us very quickly.,It's like that initial stage is over --,oneness: infancy,,unformed, primitive.,It's no longer valid or real.,What is real is separateness,,and at some point in early babyhood,,the idea of self,starts to form.,Our little portion of oneness is given a name,,is told all kinds of things about itself,,and these details,,opinions and ideas,become facts,,which go towards building ourselves,,our identity.,And that self becomes the vehicle,for navigating our social world.,But the self is a projection,based on other people's projections.,Is it who we really are?,Or who we really want to be, or should be? 
 So this whole interaction,with self and identity,was a very difficult one for me growing up.,The self that I attempted to take out into the world,was rejected over and over again.,And my panic,at not having a self that fit,,and the confusion that came,from my self being rejected,,created anxiety, shame,and hopelessness,,which kind of defined me for a long time.,But in retrospect,,the destruction of my self was so repetitive,that I started to see a pattern.,The self changed,,got affected, broken, destroyed,,but another one would evolve --,sometimes stronger,,sometimes hateful,,sometimes not wanting to be there at all.,The self was not constant.,And how many times,would my self have to die,before I realized,that it was never alive in the first place? 
 I grew up on the coast of England,in the '70s.,My dad is white from Cornwall,,and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.,Even the idea of us as a family,was challenging to most people.,But nature had its wicked way,,and brown babies were born.,But from about the age of five,,I was aware that I didn't fit.,I was the black atheist kid,in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.,I was an anomaly,,and my self was rooting around for definition,and trying to plug in.,Because the self likes to fit,,to see itself replicated,,to belong.,That confirms its existence,and its importance.,And it is important.,It has an extremely important function.,Without it, we literally can't interface with others.,We can't hatch plans,and climb that stairway of popularity,,of success.,But my skin color wasn't right.,My hair wasn't right.,My history wasn't right.,My self became defined,by otherness,,which meant that, in that social world,,I didn't really exist.,And I was "other" before being anything else --,even before being a girl.,I was a noticeable nobody. 
 Another world was opening up,around this time:,performance and dancing.,That nagging dread of self-hood,didn't exist when I was dancing.,I'd literally lose myself.,And I was a really good dancer.,I would put,all my emotional expression,into my dancing.,I could be in the movement,in a way that I wasn't able to be,in my real life, in myself. 
 And at 16,,I stumbled across another opportunity,,and I earned my first acting role in a film.,I can hardly find the words,to describe the peace I felt,when I was acting.,My dysfunctional self,could actually plug in,to another self, not my own,,and it felt so good.,It was the first time that I existed,inside a fully-functioning self --,one that I controlled,,that I steered,,that I gave life to.,But the shooting day would end,,and I'd return,to my gnarly, awkward self. 
 By 19,,I was a fully-fledged movie actor,,but still searching for definition.,I applied to read anthropology,at university.,Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,,and she asked me, "How would you define race?",Well, I thought I had the answer to that one,,and I said, "Skin color.","So biology, genetics?" she said.,"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.,Because there's actually more genetic difference,between a black Kenyan,and a black Ugandan,than there is between a black Kenyan,and, say, a white Norwegian.,Because we all stem from Africa.,So in Africa,,there's been more time,to create genetic diversity.",In other words,,race has no basis,in biological or scientific fact.,On the one hand, result.,Right?,On the other hand, my definition of self,just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.,But what was credible,,what is biological and scientific fact,,is that we all stem from Africa --,in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve,who lived 160,000 years ago.,And race is an illegitimate concept,which our selves have created,based on fear and ignorance. 
 Strangely, these revelations,didn't cure my low self-esteem,,that feeling of otherness.,My desire to disappear,was still very powerful.,I had a degree from Cambridge;,I had a thriving career,,but my self was a car crash,,and I wound up with bulimia,and on a therapist's couch.,And of course I did.,I still believed,my self was all I was.,I still valued self-worth,above all other worth,,and what was there to suggest otherwise?,We've created entire value systems,and a physical reality,to support the worth of self.,Look at the industry for self-image,and the jobs it creates,,the revenue it turns over.,We'd be right in assuming,that the self is an actual living thing.,But it's not. It's a projection,which our clever brains create,in order to cheat ourselves,from the reality of death. 
 But there is something,that can give the self,ultimate and infinite connection --,and that thing is oneness,,our essence.,The self's struggle,for authenticity and definition,will never end,unless it's connected to its creator --,to you and to me.,And that can happen with awareness --,awareness of the reality of oneness,and the projection of self-hood.,For a start, we can think about,all the times when we do lose ourselves.,It happens when I dance,,when I'm acting.,I'm earthed in my essence,,and my self is suspended.,In those moments,,I'm connected to everything --,the ground, the air,,the sounds, the energy from the audience.,All my senses are alert and alive,in much the same way as an infant might feel --,that feeling of oneness. 
 And when I'm acting a role,,I inhabit another self,,and I give it life for awhile,,because when the self is suspended,so is divisiveness,and judgment.,And I've played everything,from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery,to Secretary of State in 2004.,And no matter how other,these selves might be,,they're all related in me.,And I honestly believe,the key to my success as an actor,and my progress as a person,has been the very lack of self,that used to make me feel,so anxious and insecure.,I always wondered,why I could feel others' pain so deeply,,why I could recognize,the somebody in the nobody.,It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.,I thought I lacked substance,,and the fact that I could feel others',meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.,The thing that was a source of shame,was actually a source of enlightenment. 
 And when I realized,and really understood,that my self is a projection and that it has a function,,a funny thing happened.,I stopped giving it so much authority.,I give it its due.,I take it to therapy.,I've become very familiar,with its dysfunctional behavior.,But I'm not ashamed of my self.,In fact, I respect my self,and its function.,And over time and with practice,,I've tried to live,more and more from my essence.,And if you can do that,,incredible things happen. 
 I was in Congo in February,,dancing and celebrating,with women who've survived,the destruction of their selves,in literally unthinkable ways --,destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves,all over that beautiful land,are fueling our selves' addiction,to iPods, Pads, and bling,,which further disconnect ourselves,from ever feeling their pain,,their suffering,,their death.,Because, hey,,if we're all living in ourselves,and mistaking it for life,,then we're devaluing,and desensitizing life.,And in that disconnected state,,yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,,destroy marine life,and use rape as a weapon of war.,So here's a note to self:,The cracks have started to show,in our constructed world,,and oceans will continue,to surge through the cracks,,and oil and blood,,rivers of it. 
 Crucially, we haven't been figuring out,how to live in oneness,with the Earth and every other living thing.,We've just been insanely trying to figure out,how to live with each other -- billions of each other.,Only we're not living with each other;,our crazy selves are living with each other,and perpetuating an epidemic,of disconnection. 
 Let's live with each other,and take it a breath at a time.,If we can get under that heavy self,,light a torch of awareness,,and find our essence,,our connection to the infinite,and every other living thing.,We knew it from the day we were born.,Let's not be freaked out,by our bountiful nothingness.,It's more a reality,than the ones our selves have created.,Imagine what kind of existence we can have,if we honor inevitable death of self,,appreciate the privilege of life,and marvel at what comes next.,Simple awareness is where it begins. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 (Applause)It's the Second World War.,A German prison camp.,And this man,,Archie Cochrane,,is a prisoner of war and a doctor,,and he has a problem.,The problem is that the men under his care,are suffering,from an excruciating and debilitating condition,that Archie doesn't really understand.,The symptoms,are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.,But he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition.,He doesn't know how to cure it.,And he's operating in a hostile environment.,And people do terrible things in wars.,The German camp guards, they've got bored.,They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random,for fun.,On one particular occasion,,one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory,while it was full of prisoners.,He said he heard suspicious laughter.,And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor,,was one of the first men in,to clear up the mess.,And one more thing:,Archie was suffering from this illness himself. 
 So the situation seemed pretty desperate.,But Archie Cochrane,was a resourceful person.,He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp,,and now he managed,to get hold of supplies of marmite,on the black market.,Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is.,Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.,It looks like crude oil.,It tastes ...,zesty.,And importantly,,it's a rich source,of vitamin B12.,So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can,into two equal groups.,He gives half of them vitamin C.,He gives half of them vitamin B12.,He very carefully and meticulously notes his results,in an exercise book.,And after just a few days,,it becomes clear,that whatever is causing this illness,,marmite is the cure. 
 So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp.,Now you've got to imagine at the moment --,forget this photo, imagine this guy,with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair.,He hasn't been able to shave -- a sort of Billy Connolly figure.,Cochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans,in this Scottish accent --,in fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent --,and explains to them how German culture was the culture,that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.,And he can't understand,how this barbarism can be tolerated,,and he vents his frustrations.,And then he goes back to his quarters,,breaks down and weeps,because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless.,But a young German doctor,picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book,and says to his colleagues,,"This evidence is incontrovertible.,If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners,,it's a war crime.",And the next morning,,supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp,,and the prisoners begin to recover. 
 Now I'm not telling you this story,because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude,,although Archie Cochrane is a dude.,I'm not even telling you the story,because I think we should be running,more carefully controlled randomized trials,in all aspects of public policy,,although I think that would also be completely awesome.,I'm telling you this story,because Archie Cochrane, all his life,,fought against a terrible affliction,,and he realized it was debilitating to individuals,and it was corrosive to societies.,And he had a name for it.,He called it the God complex.,Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.,So the symptoms of the complex,are, no matter how complicated the problem,,you have an absolutely overwhelming belief,that you are infallibly right in your solution. 
 Now Archie was a doctor,,so he hung around with doctors a lot.,And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.,Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,,but I see the God complex around me all the time,in my fellow economists.,I see it in our business leaders.,I see it in the politicians we vote for --,people who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world,,are nevertheless absolutely convinced,that they understand the way that the world works.,And you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about,,the world is simply far too complex,to understand in that way. 
 Well let me give you an example.,Imagine for a moment,that, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,,there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.,You know Hans:,the Mick Jagger of TED.,(Laughter),And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics,,these amazing animations.,And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.,But a typical Hans Rosling graph:,think for a moment, not what it shows,,but think instead about what it leaves out.,So it'll show you GDP per capita,,population, longevity,,that's about it.,So three pieces of data for each country --,three pieces of data.,Three pieces of data is nothing.,I mean, have a look at this graph. 
 This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.,He's at MIT.,Now you won't be able to understand a word of it,,but this is what it looks like.,Cesar has trolled the database,of over 5,000 different products,,and he's used techniques of network analysis,to interrogate this database,and to graph relationships between the different products.,And it's wonderful, wonderful work.,You show all these interconnections, all these interrelations.,And I think it'll be profoundly useful,in understanding how it is that economies grow.,Brilliant work.,Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine,explaining how this works.,And what we learned,is Cesar's work is far too good to explain,in The New York Times Magazine. 
 Five thousand products --,that's still nothing.,Five thousand products --,imagine counting every product category,in Cesar Hidalgo's data.,Imagine you had one second,per product category.,In about the length of this session,,you would have counted all 5,000.,Now imagine doing the same thing,for every different type of product on sale in Walmart.,There are 100,000 there. It would take you all day.,Now imagine trying to count,every different specific product and service,on sale in a major economy,such as Tokyo, London or New York.,It's even more difficult in Edinburgh,because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan.,If you wanted to count every product and service,on offer in New York --,there are 10 billion of them --,it would take you 317 years.,This is how complex the economy we've created is.,And I'm just counting toasters here.,I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.,The complexity here is unbelievable.,And just a piece of context --,the societies in which our brains evolved,had about 300 products and services.,You could count them in five minutes. 
 So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.,This perhaps is why,we find the God complex so tempting.,We tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture,,we can post some graphs,,we get it, we understand how this works.",And we don't.,We never do.,Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.,I'm not trying to say we can't solve,complicated problems in a complicated world.,We clearly can.,But the way we solve them,is with humility --,to abandon the God complex,and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.,And we have a problem-solving technique that works.,Now you show me,a successful complex system,,and I will show you a system,that has evolved through trial and error. 
 Here's an example.,This baby was produced through trial and error.,I realize that's an ambiguous statement.,Maybe I should clarify it.,This baby is a human body: it evolved.,What is evolution?,Over millions of years, variation and selection,,variation and selection --,trial and error,,trial and error.,And it's not just biological systems,that produce miracles through trial and error.,You could use it in an industrial context. 
 So let's say you wanted to make detergent.,Let's say you're Unilever,and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.,How do you do it?,Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.,You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.,You create a spray of detergent.,Then the spray dries. It turns into powder.,It falls to the floor.,You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.,You sell it at a supermarket.,You make lots of money.,How do you design that nozzle?,It turns out to be very important.,Now if you ascribe to the God complex,,what you do is you find yourself a little God.,You find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist --,somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.,And he will, or she will,,calculate the optimal design of the nozzle.,Now Unilever did this and it didn't work --,too complicated.,Even this problem, too complicated. 
 But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones,describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem --,trial and error,,variation and selection.,You take a nozzle,and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.,You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.,You create 10 variations on that one.,You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best.,You try out 10 variations on that one.,You see how this works, right?,And after 45 generations,,you have this incredible nozzle.,It looks a bit like a chess piece --,functions absolutely brilliantly.,We have no idea,why it works,,no idea at all.,And the moment you step back from the God complex --,let's just try to have a bunch of stuff;,let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not --,you can solve your problem. 
 Now this process of trial and error,is actually far more common in successful institutions,than we care to recognize.,And we've heard a lot about how economies function.,The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.,How did it become the world's greatest economy?,I could give you all kinds of facts and figures,about the U.S. economy,,but I think the most salient one is this:,ten percent of American businesses,disappear every year.,That is a huge failure rate.,It's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.,Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year.,Which leads us to conclude,American businesses fail faster than Americans,,and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.,And eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection,that they will make us all their pets --,(Laughter),if, of course, they haven't already done so.,I sometimes wonder.,But it's this process of trial and error,that explains this great divergence,,this incredible performance of Western economies.,It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.,It's come through trial and error. 
 Now I've been sort of banging on about this,for the last couple of months,,and people sometimes say to me,,"Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.,Obviously trial and error is very important.,Obviously experimentation is very important.,Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?" 
 So I say, okay, fine.,You think it's obvious?,I will admit it's obvious,when schools,start teaching children,that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.,Stop giving them lists of questions,every single one of which has an answer.,And there's an authority figure in the corner,behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.,And if you can't find the answers,,you must be lazy or stupid.,When schools stop doing that all the time,,I will admit that, yes,,it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.,When a politician stands up,campaigning for elected office,and says, "I want to fix our health system.,I want to fix our education system.,I have no idea how to do it.,I have half a dozen ideas.,We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail.,Then we'll test some other ideas out.,We'll find some that work. We'll build on those.,We'll get rid of the ones that don't." --,when a politician campaigns on that platform,,and more importantly, when voters like you and me,are willing to vote for that kind of politician,,then I will admit,that it is obvious that trial and error works, and that -- thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Until then, until then,I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error,and why we should abandon the God complex.,Because it's so hard,to admit our own fallibility.,It's so uncomfortable.,And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.,There's this one trial he ran,many years after World War II.,He wanted to test out,the question of, where is it,that patients should recover,from heart attacks?,Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital,,or should they recover at home?,All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.,They had the God complex in spades.,They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients,,and they knew it was very unethical,to run any kind of trial or experiment. 
 Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this.,He ran his trial.,And after the trial had been running for a little while,,he gathered together all his colleagues,around his table,,and he said, "Well, gentlemen,,we have some preliminary results.,They're not statistically significant.,But we have something.,And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.,It is dangerous for patients,to recover from heart attacks at home.,They should be in hospital.",And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table,and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.,You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.,Shut it down at once.",And there's this huge hubbub.,Archie lets it die down.,And then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen,,because when I gave you the table of results,,I swapped the two columns around.,It turns out your hospitals are killing people,,and they should be at home.,Would you like to close down the trial now,,or should we wait until we have robust results?",Tumbleweed,rolls through the meeting room. 
 But Cochrane would do that kind of thing.,And the reason he would do that kind of thing,is because he understood,it feels so much better,to stand there and say,,"Here in my own little world,,I am a god, I understand everything.,I do not want to have my opinions challenged.,I do not want to have my conclusions tested.",It feels so much more comfortable,simply to lay down the law.,Cochrane understood,that uncertainty, that fallibility,,that being challenged, they hurt.,And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.,Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.,It isn't easy.,It's incredibly painful. 
 And since I started talking about this subject,and researching this subject,,I've been really haunted by something,a Japanese mathematician said on the subject.,So shortly after the war,,this young man, Yutaka Taniyama,,developed this amazing conjecture,called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.,It turned out to be absolutely instrumental,many decades later,in proving Fermat's Last Theorem.,In fact, it turns out it's equivalent,to proving Fermat's Last Theorem.,You prove one, you prove the other.,But it was always a conjecture.,Taniyama tried and tried and tried,and he could never prove that it was true.,And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958,,Yutaka Taniyama killed himself.,His friend, Goro Shimura --,who worked on the mathematics with him --,many decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.,He said,,"He was not a very careful person,as a mathematician.,He made a lot of mistakes.,But he made mistakes in a good direction.,I tried to emulate him,,but I realized,it is very difficult,to make good mistakes." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The night before I was heading for Scotland,,I was invited to host the final,of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai,with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.,Guess who was the performing guest?,Susan Boyle.,And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day.",She sang beautifully,,and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:,送你葱,So it's not like "hello" or "thank you,",that ordinary stuff.,It means "green onion for free.",Why did she say that?,Because it was a line,from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle --,a 50-some year-old woman,,a vegetable vendor in Shanghai,,who loves singing Western opera,,but she didn't understand,any English or French or Italian,,so she managed to fill in the lyrics,with vegetable names in Chinese.,(Laughter),And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma,that she was singing in the stadium,was "green onion for free.",So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,,80,000 live audience sang together.,That was hilarious. 
 So I guess both Susan Boyle,and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai,belonged to otherness.,They were the least expected to be successful,in the business called entertainment,,yet their courage and talent brought them through.,And a show and a platform,gave them the stage,to realize their dreams.,Well, being different is not that difficult.,We are all different,from different perspectives.,But I think being different is good,,because you present a different point of view.,You may have the chance to make a difference. 
 My generation has been very fortunate,to witness and participate,in the historic transformation of China,that has made so many changes,in the past 20, 30 years.,I remember that in the year of 1990,,when I was graduating from college,,I was applying for a job in the sales department,of the first five-star hotel in Beijing,,Great Wall Sheraton -- it's still there.,So after being interrogated,by this Japanese manager for a half an hour,,he finally said,,"So, Miss Yang,,do you have any questions to ask me?",I summoned my courage and poise and said,,"Yes, but could you let me know,,what actually do you sell?",I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about,in a five-star hotel.,That was the first day I set my foot,in a five-star hotel. 
 Around the same time,,I was going through an audition --,the first ever open audition,by national television in China --,with another thousand college girls.,The producer told us,they were looking for some sweet, innocent,and beautiful fresh face.,So when it was my turn, I stood up and said,,"Why [do] women's personalities on television,always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent,and, you know, supportive?,Why can't they have their own ideas,and their own voice?",I thought I kind of offended them.,But actually, they were impressed by my words.,And so I was in the second round of competition,,and then the third and the fourth.,After seven rounds of competition,,I was the last one to survive it.,So I was on a national television prime-time show.,And believe it or not,,that was the first show on Chinese television,that allowed its hosts,to speak out of their own minds,without reading an approved script.,(Applause),And my weekly audience at that time,was between 200 to 300 million people. 
 Well after a few years,,I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University,to pursue my postgraduate studies,,and then started my own media company,,which was unthought of,during the years that I started my career.,So we do a lot of things.,I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.,And sometimes I have young people approaching me,say, "Lan, you changed my life,",and I feel proud of that.,But then we are also so fortunate,to witness the transformation of the whole country.,I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.,I was representing the Shanghai Expo.,I saw China embracing the world,and vice versa.,But then sometimes I'm thinking,,what are today's young generation up to?,How are they different,,and what are the differences they are going to make,to shape the future of China,,or at large, the world? 
 So today I want to talk about young people,through the platform of social media.,First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?,Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei --,20 years old, beautiful.,She showed off her expensive bags,,clothes and car,on her microblog,,which is the Chinese version of Twitter.,And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross,at the Chamber of Commerce.,She didn't realize,that she stepped on a sensitive nerve,and aroused national questioning,,almost a turmoil,,against the credibility of Red Cross.,The controversy was so heated,that the Red Cross had to open a press conference,to clarify it,,and the investigation is going on. 
 So far, as of today,,we know that she herself made up that title --,probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.,All those expensive items,were given to her as gifts,by her boyfriend,,who used to be a board member,in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.,It's very complicated to explain.,But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.,It is still boiling.,It shows us a general mistrust,of government or government-backed institutions,,which lacked transparency in the past.,And also it showed us,the power and the impact of social media,as microblog. 
 Microblog boomed in the year of 2010,,with visitors doubled,and time spent on it tripled.,Sina.com, a major news portal,,alone has more than 140 million microbloggers.,On Tencent, 200 million.,The most popular blogger --,it's not me --,it's a movie star,,and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.,About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,,under 30 years old.,And because, as you know,,the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,,social media offers an opening,to let the steam out a little bit.,But because you don't have many other openings,,the heat coming out of this opening,is sometimes very strong, active,and even violent. 
 So through microblogging,,we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.,So how are they different?,First of all, most of them were born,in the 80s and 90s,,under the one-child policy.,And because of selected abortion,by families who favored boys to girls,,now we have ended up,with 30 million more young men than women.,That could pose,a potential danger to the society,,but who knows;,we're in a globalized world,,so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.,Most of them have fairly good education.,The illiteracy rate in China among this generation,is under one percent.,In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.,But they are facing an aging China,with a population above 65 years old,coming up with seven-point-some percent this year,,and about to be 15 percent,by the year of 2030.,And you know we have the tradition,that younger generations support the elders financially,,and taking care of them when they're sick.,So it means young couples,will have to support four parents,who have a life expectancy of 73 years old. 
 So making a living is not that easy,for young people.,College graduates are not in short supply.,In urban areas,,college graduates find the starting salary,is about 400 U.S. dollars a month,,while the average rent,is above $500.,So what do they do? They have to share space --,squeezed in very limited space,to save money --,and they call themselves "tribe of ants.",And for those who are ready to get married,and buy their apartment,,they figured out they have to work,for 30 to 40 years,to afford their first apartment.,That ratio in America,would only cost a couple five years to earn,,but in China it's 30 to 40 years,with the skyrocketing real estate price. 
 Among the 200 million migrant workers,,60 percent of them are young people.,They find themselves sort of sandwiched,between the urban areas and the rural areas.,Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside,,but they don't have the sense of belonging.,They work for longer hours,with less income, less social welfare.,And they're more vulnerable,to job losses,,subject to inflation,,tightening loans from banks,,appreciation of the renminbi,,or decline of demand,from Europe or America,for the products they produce.,Last year, though,,an appalling incident,in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:,13 young workers,in their late teens and early 20s,committed suicide,,just one by one like causing a contagious disease.,But they died because of all different personal reasons.,But this whole incident,aroused a huge outcry from society,about the isolation,,both physical and mental,,of these migrant workers. 
 For those who do return back to the countryside,,they find themselves very welcome locally,,because with the knowledge, skills and networks,they have learned in the cities,,with the assistance of the Internet,,they're able to create more jobs,,upgrade local agriculture and create new business,in the less developed market.,So for the past few years, the coastal areas,,they found themselves in a shortage of labor. 
 These diagrams show,a more general social background.,The first one is the Engels coefficient,,which explains that the cost of daily necessities,has dropped its percentage,all through the past decade,,in terms of family income,,to about 37-some percent.,But then in the last two years,,it goes up again to 39 percent,,indicating a rising living cost.,The Gini coefficient,has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.,Now it's 0.5 --,even worse than that in America --,showing us the income inequality.,And so you see this whole society,getting frustrated,about losing some of its mobility.,And also, the bitterness and even resentment,towards the rich and the powerful,is quite widespread.,So any accusations of corruption,or backdoor dealings between authorities or business,would arouse a social outcry,or even unrest. 
 So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,,we can see what young people care most about.,Social justice and government accountability,runs the first in what they demand.,For the past decade or so,,a massive urbanization and development,have let us witness a lot of reports,on the forced demolition,of private property.,And it has aroused huge anger and frustration,among our young generation.,Sometimes people get killed,,and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.,So when these incidents are reported,more and more frequently on the Internet,,people cry for the government to take actions to stop this. 
 So the good news is that earlier this year,,the state council passed a new regulation,on house requisition and demolition,and passed the right,to order forced demolition from local governments,to the court.,Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety,is a hot topic on the Internet.,We heard about polluted air,,polluted water, poisoned food.,And guess what, we have faked beef.,They have sorts of ingredients,that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,,and it turns it to look like beef.,And then lately,,people are very concerned about cooking oil,,because thousands of people have been found,[refining] cooking oil,from restaurant slop.,So all these things,have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.,And fortunately,,we have seen the government,responding more timely and also more frequently,to the public concerns. 
 While young people seem to be very sure,about their participation,in public policy-making,,but sometimes they're a little bit lost,in terms of what they want for their personal life.,China is soon to pass the U.S.,as the number one market,for luxury brands --,that's not including the Chinese expenditures,in Europe and elsewhere.,But you know what, half of those consumers,are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.,They're not rich at all.,They're taking those bags and clothes,as a sense of identity and social status.,And this is a girl explicitly saying,on a TV dating show,that she would rather cry in a BMW,than smile on a bicycle.,But of course, we do have young people,who would still prefer to smile,,whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle. 
 So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon,called "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage.,It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,,but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married,without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring,and without a wedding banquet,,to show their commitment to true love.,And also, people are doing good through social media.,And the first picture showed us,that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs,for food processing,was spotted and stopped on the highway,with the whole country watching,through microblogging.,People were donating money, dog food,and offering volunteer work to stop that truck.,And after hours of negotiation,,500 dogs were rescued.,And here also people are helping to find missing children.,A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.,After thousands of resends in relay,,the child was found,,and we witnessed the reunion of the family,through microblogging. 
 So happiness is the most popular word,we have heard through the past two years.,Happiness is not only related,to personal experiences and personal values,,but also, it's about the environment.,People are thinking about the following questions:,Are we going to sacrifice our environment further,to produce higher GDP?,How are we going to perform our social and political reform,to keep pace with economic growth,,to keep sustainability and stability?,And also, how capable is the system,of self-correctness,to keep more people content,with all sorts of friction going on at the same time?,I guess these are the questions people are going to answer.,And our younger generation,are going to transform this country,while at the same time being transformed themselves. 
 Thank you very much.

 [Grand Canyon] 
 Narrator: Many of the tests are conducted,while Yves is strapped onto the wing,,because Yves' bodynis an integral part of the aircraft. 
 [Wind tunnel tests] 
 Narrator: The wing has no steeringncontrols, no flaps, no rudder.,Yves uses his body to steer the wing. 
 Stefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns,by just putting his headnon one or the other side.,And sometimes he assists thatnwith his hands,,sometimes even with the leg.,He's acting as a humannfuselage, so to say.,And that's quite unique. 
 Narrator: When he arches his back,nhe gains altitude.,When he pushes his shoulders forward,nhe goes into a dive. 
 [Swiss Alps] 
 [Strait of Gibraltar crossing] 
 [English Channel crossing] 
 Commentator One: There he goes.,There is Yves Rossy.,And I think the wing is open.,So our first critical moment, it's open.,He is down. Is he flying? 
 Commentator Two:nIt looks like he's stabilized.,He's starting to make his climb. 
 Commentator One:nThere's that 90 degree turn.,He's out over the channel.,There is Yves Rossy.,There is no turning back now.,He is over the English Channelnand under way.,Ladies and gentlemen,,a historic flight has begun. 
 [Images: National Geographic] 
 Commentator Two:nAnd as he approaches the ground,,he's going to pull downnon those toggles to flare,,slow himself down just a little bit,,and then come in for a nice landing. 
 Commentator One: There he is.,Yves Rossy has landed in England. 
 Bruno Giussani: And nownhe's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy! 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 And his equipment as well.,Yves, welcome. It is quite amazing.,Those sequences were shotnover the last three years,in various moments of your activities.,And there were many, many others.,So it's possible to flynalmost like a bird.,What is it like to be up there? 
 Yves Rossy: It's fun. It's fun. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't have feathers.,But I feel like a bird sometimes.,It's really an unreal feeling,,because normally you have a big thing,,a plane, around you.,And when I strap just this little harness,,this little wing,,I really have the feeling of being a bird. 
 BG: How did you start to become Jetman? 
 YR: It was about 20 years ago,,when I discovered free falling.,When you go out of an airplane,nyou are almost naked.,You take a position like that.,And especially when you takena tracking position,,you have the feeling that you are flying.,And that's the nearest thing to the dream.,You have no machine around you.,You are just in the element.,It's very short and only in one direction. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the idea was, okay,,keep that feeling of freedom,,but change the vectornand increase the time. 
 BG: So I'm kind of curious,nwhat's your top speed? 
 YR: It's about 300 km per hournbefore looping.,That means about 190 miles per hour. 
 BG: What's the weightnof the equipment you're carrying? 
 YR: When I exit full of kerosene,,I'm about 55 kilos.,I have 55 kilos on my back. 
 BG: And you're not piloting?,There is no handle, no steering, nothing?,It is purely your body,,and the wings become partnof the body and vice versa? 
 YR: That's really the goal,,because if you put in steering,,then you reinvent the airplane.,And I wanted to keep thisnfreedom of movement.,And it's really like the kidnplaying the airplane.,I want to go down like that.,And up I climb, I turn.,It's really pure flying.,It's not steering, it's flight. 
 BG: What kind of training do you do,nyou personally, for that? 
 YR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.,I don't do special physical training.,I just try to keep my mobilitynthrough new activities.,For example, last winternI began with kite surfing.,So, new things.,So you have to adapt.,I'm quite an experiencednmanager of systems as a pilot,,but this is, really --,You need fluidity,,you need to be agile,and also to adapt really fast. 
 BG: Somebody in the audience asked me,,"How does he breathe up there?",Because you're going fastnand you're up at 3,000 meters or so. 
 YR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters,,it's not such a big problem with oxygen.,But for example, bikers,,they have the same speed.,Just with the helmet, integral helmet,,it's really no problem to breathe. 
 BG: Describe for me the equipment,nsince you have it here.,So Breitling's four engines. 
 YR: Yeah, two-meter span.,Ultra-stable profile.,Four little engines,,22 kilos thrust each,,turbines, working with kerosene.,Harness, parachute.,My only instrumentsnare an altimeter and time.,I know I have about eight minutes fuel.,So I just check before it's finished. 
 (Laughter) 
 And yeah, that's all.,Two parachutes.,That means, if I have a problemnwith the first one I pull,,I still have the possibilitynto open the second one.,And this is my life.,That's the real importantnthing about safety.,I did use that during these last 15 years,about 20 times.,Never with that type of wing,nbut at the beginning.,I can release my wing,when I am in a spin or unstable. 
 BG: We saw the 2009 crossingnof the Gibraltar Strait,where you lost control,and then you dived down into the clouds,and in the ocean.,So that was one of those casesnwhere you let the wings go, right? 
 YR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,,but you lose orientation completely.,So I did try to take, again,,a climb altitude.,I thought, okay, I will go out.,But most probably,nI did something like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: Something that is notnvery safe, the image. 
 YR: You feel great, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But you have not the right altitude.,So the next thing I saw was just blue.,It was the sea.,I have also an audible altimeter.,So I was at my minimum altitude,in that vector -- fast --,so I pulled that.,And then I did open my chute. 
 BG: So the wings have their own parachute,nand you have your two parachutes. 
 YR: Exactly. There is a rescuenparachute for the wing,for two reasons:,so I can repair it afterward,and especially so nobody takesnthat, just on his head. 
 BG: I see. Maybe come back here.,This is risky stuff indeed.,People have died tryingnto do this kind of thing.,And you don't look like a crazy guy;nyou're a Swiss airline pilot,,so you're rather a checklist kind of guy.,I assume you have standards. 
 YR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that. 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: Let's not tell your employer. 
 (Laughter) 
 YR: No, that's really two worlds.,Civil aviation is somethingnthat we know very well.,We have a hundred years of experience.,And you can adapt really precisely.,With that, I have to adaptnto something new.,That means improvise.,So it's really a playnbetween these two approaches.,Something that I knownvery well, these principles.,For example, we haventwo engines on an Airbus;,with only one engine, you can fly it.,So plan B, always a plan B.,In a fighter, you have an ejection seat.,That's my ejection seat.,So I have the approachnof a professional pilot,with the respect of a pioneer,in front of Mother Nature. 
 BG: It's well said.,What happens if one of the engines stops? 
 YR: I do a roll.,And then I stabilize,,and according to my altitude,nI continue on two or three engines.,It's sometimes possible.,It's quite complicated to explain,,but according to which regime I was,,I can continue on two,and try to get a nice place to land,nand then I open my parachute. 
 BG: So the beginning of the flight,is actually you jumpnoff a plane or a helicopter,,and you go on a divenand accelerate the engines,,and then you basically take offnmid-air somewhere.,And then the landing, as we have seen,,arriving on this side of the Channel,,is through a parachute.,So just as a curiosity,,where did you land when you flewnover the Grand Canyon?,Did you land on the rim,ndown at the bottom? 
 YR: It was down on the bottom.,And I came back afterwardnon the sled of the helicopter back.,But it was too stonynand full of cactus on top. 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: That's exactlynwhy I asked the question. 
 YR: And also, the currentsnare quite funny there.,There is big thermal activity,,big difference in altitude also.,So it was much safer for mento land at the bottom. 
 BG: I think that right now,nmany people are asking,,"When are you developing a double-seater,so they can fly with you?" 
 YR: I have a standard answer.,Have you ever seen tandem birds? 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: Perfect answer. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 BG: Yves, one last question.,What's next for you?nWhat's next for Jetman? 
 YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.,I want to share it,nto do formation flights.,And I plan to start from a cliff,,like catapulted from a cliff. 
 BG: So instead of jumpingnoff a plane, yes? 
 YR: Yes, with the final goal to take off,nbut with initial speed.,Really, I go step by step.,It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.,It's possible to start already now,nit's just too dangerous. 
 (Laughter),Thanks to the increasing technology,nbetter technology,,it will be safe.,And I hope it will be for everybody. 
 BG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy. 
 (Applause)A few months ago,,a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room,in a hospital close to where I live,,and she was brought in confused.,Her blood pressure was an alarming,230 over 170.,Within a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.,She was resuscitated, stabilized,,whisked over to a CAT scan suite,right next to the emergency room,,because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.,And the CAT scan revealed,no blood clots in the lung,,but it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses,,breast tumors,,that had metastasized widely,all over the body.,And the real tragedy was, if you look through her records,,she had been seen,in four or five other health care institutions,in the preceding two years.,Four or five opportunities,to see the breast masses, touch the breast mass,,intervene at a much earlier stage,than when we saw her. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,that is not an unusual story.,Unfortunately, it happens all the time.,I joke, but I only half joke,,that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb,,no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRI,or orthopedic consult.,I am not a Luddite.,I teach at Stanford.,I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.,But I'd like to make the case to you,in the next 17 minutes,that when we shortcut the physical exam,,when we lean towards ordering tests,instead of talking to and examining the patient,,we not only overlook simple diagnoses,that can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage,,but we're losing much more than that.,We're losing a ritual.,We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent,,and is at the heart,of the patient-physician relationship.,This may actually be heresy to say this at TED,,but I'd like to introduce you,to the most important innovation,,I think, in medicine,to come in the next 10 years,,and that is the power of the human hand --,to touch, to comfort, to diagnose,and to bring about treatment. 
 I'd like to introduce you first to this person,whose image you may or may not recognize.,This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.,Since we're in Edinburgh, I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle.,You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school,here in Edinburgh,,and his character, Sherlock Holmes,,was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.,Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.,And Conan Doyle, writing about Bell,,described the following exchange,between Bell and his students. 
 So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department,,students all around him,,patients signing up in the emergency room,and being registered and being brought in.,And a woman comes in with a child,,and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.,The woman says, "Good Morning.",Bell says, "What sort of crossing did you have,on the ferry from Burntisland?",She says, "It was good.",And he says, "What did you do with the other child?",She says, "I left him with my sister at Leith.",And he says,,"And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row,to get here to the infirmary?",She says, "I did.",And he says, "Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?",And she says, "I am." 
 And Bell then goes on to explain to the students.,He says, "You see, when she said, 'Good morning,',I picked up her Fife accent.,And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.,And so she must have taken the ferry over.,You notice that the coat she's carrying,is too small for the child who is with her,,and therefore, she started out the journey with two children,,but dropped one off along the way.,You notice the clay on the soles of her feet.,Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh,,except in the botanical gardens.,And therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Row,to arrive here.,And finally, she has a dermatitis,on the fingers of her right hand,,a dermatitis that is unique,to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland.",And when Bell actually strips the patient,,begins to examine the patient,,you can only imagine how much more he would discern.,And as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself,,I was so inspired by that story. 
 But you might not realize,that our ability to look into the body,in this simple way, using our senses,,is quite recent.,The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger,who, in the late 1700s,,discovered percussion.,And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger,was the son of an innkeeper.,And his father used to go down into the basement,to tap on the sides of casks of wine,to determine how much wine was left,and whether to reorder.,And so when Auenbrugger became a physician,,he began to do the same thing.,He began to tap on the chests of his patients,,on their abdomens.,And basically everything we know about percussion,,which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day --,organ enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs,,abdominal changes --,all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript,"Inventum Novum," "New Invention,",which would have disappeared into obscurity,,except for the fact that this physician, Corvisart,,a famous French physician --,famous only because he was physician to this gentleman --,Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work. 
 And it was followed a year or two later,by Laennec discovering the stethoscope.,Laennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Paris,and saw two children playing with a stick.,One was scratching at the end of the stick,,another child listened at the other end.,And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way,to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen,using what he called "the cylinder.",Later he renamed it the stethoscope.,And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.,So within a few years,,in the late 1800s, early 1900s,,all of a sudden,,the barber surgeon had given way,to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis. 
 If you'll recall, prior to that time,,no matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeon,who wound up cupping you,,bleeding you, purging you.,And, oh yes, if you wanted,,he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides, long in the back --,and pull your tooth while he was at it.,He made no attempt at diagnosis.,In fact, some of you might well know,that the barber pole, the red and white stripes,,represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon,,and the receptacles on either end,represent the pots in which the blood was collected.,But the arrival of auscultation and percussion,represented a sea change,,a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body. 
 And this particular painting, I think,,represents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era.,This is a very famous painting:,"The Doctor" by Luke Fildes.,Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate,,who then established the Tate Gallery.,And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting,of social importance.,And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic.,Fildes' oldest son, Philip,,died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve,after a brief illness.,And Fildes was so taken by the physician,who held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights,,that he decided that he would try and depict,the physician in our time --,almost a tribute to this physician.,And hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting.,It's been on calendars, postage stamps in many different countries.,I've often wondered, what would Fildes have done,had he been asked to paint this painting,in the modern era,,in the year 2011?,Would he have substituted a computer screen,for where he had the patient? 
 I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley,for saying that the patient in the bed,has almost become an icon,for the real patient who's in the computer.,I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.,I call it the iPatient.,The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.,The real patient often wonders,,where is everyone?,When are they going to come by and explain things to me?,Who's in charge?,There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception,and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care. 
 I want to show you a picture,of what rounds looked like,when I was in training.,The focus was around the patient.,We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge.,Too often these days,,rounds look very much like this,,where the discussion is taking place,in a room far away from the patient.,The discussion is all about images on the computer, data.,And the one critical piece missing,is that of the patient. 
 Now I've been influenced in this thinking,by two anecdotes that I want to share with you.,One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer,,had a small breast cancer detected --,had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.,This is when I was in Texas.,And she then spent a lot of time researching,to find the best cancer center in the world,to get her subsequent care.,And she found the place and decided to go there, went there.,Which is why I was surprised a few months later,to see her back in our own town,,getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist. 
 And I pressed her, and I asked her,,"Why did you come back and get your care here?",And she was reluctant to tell me.,She said, "The cancer center was wonderful.,It had a beautiful facility,,giant atrium, valet parking,,a piano that played itself,,a concierge that took you around from here to there.,But," she said,,"but they did not touch my breasts.",Now you and I could argue,that they probably did not need to touch her breasts.,They had her scanned inside out.,They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level;,they had no need to touch her breasts. 
 But to her, it mattered deeply.,It was enough for her to make the decision,to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist,who, every time she went,,examined both breasts including the axillary tail,,examined her axilla carefully,,examined her cervical region, her inguinal region,,did a thorough exam.,And to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.,I was very influenced by that anecdote. 
 I was also influenced by another experience that I had,,again, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford.,I had a reputation,as being interested in patients,with chronic fatigue.,This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.,I say that because these are difficult patients.,They have often been rejected by their families,,have had bad experiences with medical care,and they come to you fully prepared,for you to join the long list of people,who's about to disappoint them.,And I learned very early on with my first patient,that I could not do justice,to this very complicated patient,with all the records they were bringing,in a new patient visit of 45 minutes.,There was just no way.,And if I tried, I'd disappoint them. 
 And so I hit on this method,where I invited the patient,to tell me the story for their entire first visit,,and I tried not to interrupt them.,We know the average American physician,interrupts their patient in 14 seconds.,And if I ever get to heaven,,it will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes,and did not interrupt my patient.,I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence,,and when the patient came for the physical,,I was able to do a thorough physical,,because I had nothing else to do.,I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam,,but because the whole visit was now about the physical,,I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam. 
 And I remember my very first patient in that series,continued to tell me more history,during what was meant to be the physical exam visit.,And I began my ritual.,I always begin with the pulse,,then I examine the hands, then I look at the nail beds,,then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node,,and I was into my ritual.,And when my ritual began,,this very voluble patient,began to quiet down.,And I remember having a very eerie sense,that the patient and I,had slipped back into a primitive ritual,in which I had a role,and the patient had a role.,And when I was done,,the patient said to me with some awe,,"I have never been examined like this before.",Now if that were true,,it's a true condemnation of our health care system,,because they had been seen in other places. 
 I then proceeded to tell the patient,,once the patient was dressed,,the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions,,which is, "This is not in your head.,This is real.,The good news, it's not cancer, it's not tuberculosis,,it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection.,The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this,,but here's what you should do, here's what we should do.",And I would lay out all the standard treatment options,that the patient had heard elsewhere. 
 And I always felt,that if my patient gave up the quest,for the magic doctor, the magic treatment,and began with me on a course towards wellness,,it was because I had earned the right,to tell them these things,by virtue of the examination.,Something of importance had transpired in the exchange.,I took this to my colleagues,at Stanford in anthropology,and told them the same story.,And they immediately said to me,,"Well you are describing a classic ritual.",And they helped me understand,that rituals are all about transformation. 
 We marry, for example,,with great pomp and ceremony and expense,to signal our departure,from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness,to one of eternal bliss.,I'm not sure why you're laughing.,That was the original intent, was it not?,We signal transitions of power,with rituals.,We signal the passage of a life with rituals.,Rituals are terribly important.,They're all about transformation.,Well I would submit to you,that the ritual,of one individual coming to another,and telling them things,that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi,,and then, incredibly on top of that,,disrobing and allowing touch --,I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance.,And if you shortchange that ritual,by not undressing the patient,,by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown,,by not doing a complete exam,,you have bypassed on the opportunity,to seal the patient-physician relationship. 
 I am a writer,,and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote,that has to do very much with this scene.,I'm an infectious disease physician,,and in the early days of HIV, before we had our medications,,I presided over so many scenes like this.,I remember, every time I went to a patient's deathbed,,whether in the hospital or at home,,I remember my sense of failure --,the feeling of I don't know what I have to say;,I don't know what I can say;,I don't know what I'm supposed to do.,And out of that sense of failure,,I remember, I would always examine the patient.,I would pull down the eyelids.,I would look at the tongue.,I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart.,I would feel the abdomen.,I remember so many patients,,their names still vivid on my tongue,,their faces still so clear.,I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes,staring up at me as I performed this ritual.,And then the next day,,I would come, and I would do it again. 
 And I wanted to read you this one closing passage,about one patient.,"I recall one patient,who was at that point,no more than a skeleton,encased in shrinking skin,,unable to speak,,his mouth crusted with candida,that was resistant to the usual medications.,When he saw me,on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth,,his hands moved as if in slow motion.,And as I wondered what he was up to,,his stick fingers made their way,up to his pajama shirt,,fumbling with his buttons.,I realized that he was wanting,to expose his wicker-basket chest to me.,It was an offering, an invitation.,I did not decline. 
 I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.,I think he surely must have known by then,that it was vital for me,just as it was necessary for him.,Neither of us could skip this ritual,,which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung,,or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.,No, this ritual was about the one message,that physicians have needed to convey to their patients.,Although, God knows, of late, in our hubris,,we seem to have drifted away.,We seem to have forgotten --,as though, with the explosion of knowledge,,the whole human genome mapped out at our feet,,we are lulled into inattention,,forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician,,necessary for the patient --,forgetting that the ritual has meaning,and a singular message to convey to the patient. 
 And the message, which I didn't fully understand then,,even as I delivered it,,and which I understand better now is this:,I will always, always, always be there.,I will see you through this.,I will never abandon you.,I will be with you through the end." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I am a reformed marketer,,and I now work in international development.,In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo,,which is the [second] largest country in Africa.,In fact, it's as large as Western Europe,,but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.,The DRC is a dangerous place.,In the past 10 years, five million people have died,due to a war in the east.,But war isn't the only reason,that life is difficult in the DRC. 
 There are many health issues as well.,In fact, the HIV prevalence rate,is 1.3 percent among adults.,This might not sound like a large number,,but in a country with 76 million people,,it means there are 930,000 that are infected.,And due to the poor infrastructure,,only 25 percent of those,are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.,Which is why, in part,,donor agencies provide condoms,at low or no cost. 
 And so while I was in the DRC,,I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,,including Damien.,Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.,It's a hotel that's only open until midnight,,so it's not a place that you stay.,But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.,Now Damien knows all about condoms,,but he doesn't sell them.,He said there's just not in demand.,It's not surprising,,because only three percent of people in the DRC,use condoms. 
 Joseph and Christine,,who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,,said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,,and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,,their customers don't buy the branded versions.,They like the generics. 
 And as a marketer, I found that curious.,And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.,And it turns out that there are three main messages,used by the donor agencies for these condoms:,fear, financing and fidelity.,They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live",or Trust.,They package it with the red ribbon,that reminds us of HIV,,put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them,,show pictures of your wife or husband,and tell you to protect them,or to act prudently. 
 Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about,just before they go get a condom.,(Laughter),What is it that you think about,just before you get a condom?,Sex!,And the private companies that sell condoms in these places,,they understand this.,Their marketing is slightly different.,The name might not be much different,,but the imagery sure is.,Some brands are aspirational,,and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. 
 And this made me think,that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out,on a key aspect of marketing:,understanding who's the audience.,And for donor agencies, unfortunately,,the audience tends to be,people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].,It's people back home,,people that support their work,,people like these.,But if what we're really trying to do,is stop the spread of HIV,,we need to think about the customer,,the people whose behavior needs to change --,the couples,,the young women, the young men --,whose lives depend on it. 
 And so the lesson is this:,it doesn't really matter what you're selling;,you just have to think about who is your customer,,and what are the messages,that are going to get them to change their behavior.,It might just save their lives. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses,of about eight of my projects,,done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.,We call ourselves Pors and Rao,,and we live and work in India. 
 I'd like to begin with my very first object,,which I call "The Uncle Phone.",And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit,of constantly asking me to do things for him,,almost like I were an extension of his body --,to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,,a pack of cigarettes.,And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,,And I started to think of it as a form of control.,But of course, I could never say anything,,because the uncle is a respected figure,in the Indian family.,And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most,was his use of a landline telephone.,He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.,And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,,I made him "The Uncle Phone.",It's so long that it requires two people to use it.,It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person. 
 But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,,I started missing his commands.,And so I made him a golden typewriter,through which he could dispense his commands,to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.,So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,,type his email or command and pull the paper out.,This device would automatically send the intended person,the letter as an email.,So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics,that understands all of the mechanical actions,and converts it to digital.,So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.,And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,,the way my uncle likes it. 
 The next work is a sound-sensitive installation,that we affectionately call "The Pygmies.",And we wanted to work with a notion of being,surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.,So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,,and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.,And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.,And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.,And at the slightest sound, they hide back again. 
 So we had these panels on three walls of a room.,And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.,So this is how it works.,This is a video prototype.,So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.,And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.,So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.,And they don't react to background sounds.,You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.,(Noise),But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.,(Whistling),So we worked very hard,to make them as lifelike as possible.,So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,,mood swings, personalities and so on.,So this is a very early prototype.,Of course, it got much better after that.,And we made them react to people,,but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them. 
 This is a video installation called "The Missing Person.",And we were quite intrigued,with playing with the notion of invisibility.,How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?,So we worked with a company,that specializes in camera surveillance,,and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,,using a camera,that could look at people in the room, track them,and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible. 
 So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.,On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,,who's actually in the space.,And on the left side, you'll see the processed video,where the camera has made him invisible.,Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.,And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.,It's a very early video,,so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,,but that got refined pretty soon, later.,So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,,and we had one monitor, one on each wall.,And as people walked into the room,,they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:,one person was constantly invisible,wherever they moved in the room. 
 So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow.",And it was almost like a sheet of paper,,like a cutout of a childlike drawing,of an oil spill or a sun.,And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,,and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.,So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,,thinking it was some crap laying around.,But as soon as they passed by,,it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.,And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this work,is a caricature of an upside-down man.,His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,,that it's sort of fallen into his hat,,and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.,Well what he does is he moves around,in a very drunken fashion on his head,in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.,And it's kind of constrained by that circle.,Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,,it would start to wander about in the space.,And there's no wires.,So I'll just show you an instance --,so when people enter the room, it activates this object.,And it very slowly, over a few minutes,,sort of painfully goes up,,and then it gains momentum,and it looks like it's almost about to fall.,And this is an important moment,,because we wanted to instill in the viewer,an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.,But it doesn't really need it,,because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up. 
 So this work was a real technical challenge for us,,and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years,to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.,And it was very important for us,to establish the exact moment that it would fall,,because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,,then it would damage itself,,and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,,or that sense of wanting to go and help it.,So I'm going to show you a very quick video,where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.,That's my colleague. He's let it go.,Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.,But he doesn't need to,,because it manages to lift itself up on its own. 
 So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,,working with the aesthetic of fur,embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes,of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.,And it's at the scale of the night sky.,So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,,which is in the shape of a teddy bear,,which was hanging from the ceiling.,And the idea was to sort of contrast,something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe,into the familiar form of a teddy bear,,which is very comforting and intimate.,And the idea was that at some point,you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear,and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,,and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky. 
 So this is the last work, and a work in progress,,and it's called "Space Filler.",Well imagine a small cube that's about this big,standing in front of you in the middle of the room,,and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you,by growing into a cube,that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.,And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting,to create a dynamic with people moving around it --,almost like it were trying,to conceal a secret within its seams or something. 
 So we work with a lot of technology,,but we don't really love technology,,because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.,But we use it because we're interested,in the way that it can help us,to express the emotions and behavioral patterns,in these creatures that we create.,And once a creature pops into our minds,,it's almost like the process of creation,is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist,and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to start with a short story.,It's about a little boy,whose father was a history buff,and who used to take him by the hand,to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis,on the outskirts of their camp.,They would always stop by to visit,these huge winged bulls that used to guard,the gates of that ancient metropolis,,and the boy used to be scared,of these winged bulls,,but at the same time they excited him.,And the dad used to use those bulls,to tell the boy stories about,that civilization and their work. 
 Let's fast-forward to the,San Francisco Bay Area many decades later,,where I started a technology company,that brought the world its first,3D laser scanning system.,Let me show you how it works.,Female Voice: Long range laser scanning,by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.,The system measures the beam's time of flight,,recording the time it takes for the light,to hit a surface and make its return.,With two mirrors, the scanner calculates,the beam's horizontal and vertical angles,,giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.,The point is then recorded,into a 3D visualization program.,All of this happens in seconds.,Ben Kacyra: You can see here,,these systems are extremely fast.,They collect millions of points at a time,with very high accuracy,and very high resolution.,A surveyor with traditional survey tools,would be hard-pressed to produce,maybe 500 points in a whole day.,These babies would be producing,something like ten thousand points a second.,So, as you can imagine,,this was a paradigm shift,in the survey and construction,as well as in reality capture industry. 
 Approximately ten years ago,,my wife and I started a foundation to do good,,and right about that time,,the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,,hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,,were blown up by the Taliban.,They were gone in an instant.,And unfortunately, there was,no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.,This clearly devastated me,,and I couldn't help but wonder about,the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,,and the fate of the many, many,heritage sites all over the world.,Both my wife and I,were so touched by this,that we decided to,expand the mission of our foundation,to include digital heritage preservation,of world sites.,We called the project CyArk,,which stands for Cyber Archive. 
 To date, with the help of,a global network of partners,,we've completed close to fifty projects.,Let me show you some of them:,Chichen Itza,,Rapa Nui --,and what you're seeing here,are the cloud of points --,Babylon,,Rosslyn Chapel,,Pompeii,,and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,,which happened to be one of,our most challenging projects.,As you see here, we had to develop,a special rig to bring the scanner,up close and personal.,The results of our work in the field,are used to produce,media and deliverables to be used,by conservators and researchers.,We also produce media for,dissemination to the public --,free through the CyArk website.,These would be used for education,,cultural tourism, etc. 
 What you're looking at in here,is a 3D viewer that we developed,that would allow the display,and manipulation of [the] cloud of points,in real time, cutting sections through them,and extracting dimensions.,This happens to be the cloud of points,for Tikal.,In here you see a traditional 2D,architectural engineering drawing,that's used for preservation, and of course,we tell the stories through fly-throughs.,And here, this is a fly-through,the cloud of points of Tikal,,and here you see it rendered,and photo-textured with the photography,that we take of the site.,And so this is not a video.,This is actual 3D points with,two to three millimeter accuracy.,And of course the data can be used,to develop 3D models that are,very accurate and very detailed.,And here you're looking at a model,that's extracted from the cloud of points,for Stirling Castle.,It's used for studies, for visualization,,as well as for education. 
 And finally, we produce mobile apps,that include narrated virtual tools.,The more I got involved,in the heritage field,,the more it became clear to me,that we are losing the sites,and the stories faster than we can,physically preserve them.,Of course, earthquakes,and all the natural phenomena --,floods, tornadoes, etc. --,take their toll.,However, what occurred to me was,human-caused destruction, which was,not only causing a significant portion,of the destruction, but actually,it was accelerating.,This includes arson,,urban sprawl,,acid rain, not to mention,terrorism and wars.,It was getting more and more apparent,that we're fighting a losing battle.,We're losing our sites,and the stories,,and basically we're losing,a piece -- and a significant piece --,of our collective memory.,Imagine us as a human race,not knowing where we came from. 
 Luckily, in the last two or three decades,,digital technologies have been developing,that have helped us to develop tools,that we've brought to bear,in the digital preservation,,in our digital preservation war.,This includes, for example,,the 3D laser scanning systems,,ever more powerful personal computers,,3D graphics,,high-definition digital photography,,not to mention the Internet.,Because of this accelerated,pace of destruction,,it became clear to us that we needed,to challenge ourselves and our partners,to accelerate our work.,And we created a project,we call the CyArk 500 Challenge --,and that is to digitally preserve,500 World Heritage Sites,in five years. 
 We do have the technology,that's scaleable,,and our network of global partners,has been expanding and can be expanded,at a rapid rate,,so we're comfortable,that this task can be accomplished.,However, to me, the 500 is,really just the first 500.,In order to sustain our work into the future,,we use technology centers,where we partner with,local universities and colleges,to take the technology to them,,whereby they then can help us,with digital preservation of their heritage sites,,and at the same time, it gives them,the technology to benefit from in the future. 
 Let me close with another short story.,Two years ago, we were approached,by a partner of ours to digitally preserve,an important heritage site,,a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,,the Royal Kasubi Tombs.,The work was done successfully in the field,,and the data was archived,and publicly disseminated,through the CyArk website.,Last March,,we received very sad news.,The Royal Tombs had been destroyed,by suspected arson.,A few days later, we received a call:,"Is the data available,and can it be used for reconstruction?",Our answer, of course, was yes. 
 Let me leave you with a final thought.,Our heritage is much more than,our collective memory --,it's our collective treasure.,We owe it to our children,,our grandchildren and the generations,we will never meet,to keep it safe,and to pass it along.,Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, I'm staying here because,we wanted to demonstrate to you,the power of this technology,and so, while I've been speaking,,you have been scanned.,(Laughter),The two wizards that I have,that are behind the curtain,will help me bring,the results on the screen.,(Applause) 
 This is all in 3D and of course,you can fly through the cloud of points.,You can look at it from on top,,from the ceiling.,You can look from different vantage points,,but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in,on an individual in the crowd,,just to show the amount of detail,that we can create.,So you have been digitally preserved,in about four minutes.,(Laughter) 
 I'd like to thank the wizards here.,We were very lucky to have,two of our partners participate in this:,the Historic Scotland,,and the Glasgow School of Art.,I'd like to also thank personally,the efforts of David Mitchell,,who is the Director of Conservation,at Historic Scotland.,David.,(Applause),And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of,Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.,Let's give them a hand. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.I'd like to take you to another world.,And I'd like to share,a 45 year-old love story,with the poor,,living on less than one dollar a day.,I went to a very elitist, snobbish,,expensive education in India,,and that almost destroyed me.,I was all set,to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor --,all laid out.,Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion,for three years.,(Laughter),The whole world was laid out for me.,Everything was at my feet.,I could do nothing wrong.,And then I thought out of curiosity,I'd like to go and live and work,and just see what a village is like. 
 So in 1965,,I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,,and I saw starvation, death,,people dying of hunger, for the first time.,It changed my life.,I came back home,,told my mother,,"I'd like to live and work in a village.",Mother went into a coma.,(Laughter),"What is this?,The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,,and you want to go and work in a village?,I mean, is there something wrong with you?",I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.,It made me think.,And I wanted to give something back,in my own way.","What do you want to do in a village?,No job, no money,,no security, no prospect.",I said, "I want to live,and dig wells for five years.","Dig wells for five years?,You went to the most expensive school and college in India,,and you want to dig wells for five years?",She didn't speak to me for a very long time,,because she thought I'd let my family down. 
 But then,,I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills,that very poor people have,,which are never brought into the mainstream --,which is never identified, respected,,applied on a large scale.,And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College --,college only for the poor.,What the poor thought was important,would be reflected in the college.,I went to this village for the first time.,Elders came to me,and said, "Are you running from the police?",I said, "No.",(Laughter),"You failed in your exam?",I said, "No.","You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No.","What are you doing here?,Why are you here?,The education system in India,makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;,what are you doing in this village?,Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?",I said, "No, I want to actually start a college,only for the poor.,What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college." 
 So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.,They said, "Please,,don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification,into your college.",So it's the only college in India,where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,,you are disqualified to come.,You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout,to come to our college.,You have to work with your hands.,You have to have a dignity of labor.,You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community,and provide a service to the community.,So we started the Barefoot College,,and we redefined professionalism. 
 Who is a professional?,A professional is someone,who has a combination of competence,,confidence and belief.,A water diviner is a professional.,A traditional midwife,is a professional.,A traditional bone setter is a professional.,These are professionals all over the world.,You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.,And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream,and show that the knowledge and skills that they have,is universal.,It needs to be used, needs to be applied,,needs to be shown to the world outside --,that these knowledge and skills,are relevant even today. 
 So the college works,following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.,You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.,There are no contracts, no written contracts.,You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.,And no one can get more than $100 a month.,You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.,You come for the work and the challenge,,you'll come to the Barefoot College.,That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.,Whatever idea you have, come and try it.,It doesn't matter if you fail.,Battered, bruised, you start again.,It's the only college where the teacher is the learner,and the learner is the teacher.,And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.,You are certified by the community you serve.,You don't need a paper to hang on the wall,to show that you are an engineer. 
 So when I said that,,they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?,This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground.",So we built the first Barefoot College,in 1986.,It was built by 12 Barefoot architects,who can't read and write,,built on $1.50 a sq. ft.,150 people lived there, worked there.,They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.,But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.,I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,,but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college.",We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,,because they didn't believe us,,and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions,on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia. 
 I asked a forester --,high-powered, paper-qualified expert --,I said, "What can you build in this place?",He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.,Not even worth it.,No water, rocky soil.",I was in a bit of a spot.,And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village,and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'",He looked quietly at me and said,,"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work.",This is what it looks like today. 
 Went to the roof,,and all the women said, "Clear out.,The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.,This is waterproofing the roof.",(Laughter),It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens,and a bit of other things I don't know.,But it actually doesn't leak.,Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.,This technology, the women will not share with the men. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's the only college,which is fully solar-electrified.,All the power comes from the sun.,45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.,And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.,So long as the sun shines,,we'll have no problem with power.,But the beauty is,that is was installed,by a priest, a Hindu priest,,who's only done eight years of primary schooling --,never been to school, never been to college.,He knows more about solar,than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed. 
 Food, if you come to the Barefoot College,,is solar cooked.,But the people who fabricated that solar cooker,are women,,illiterate women,,who actually fabricate,the most sophisticated solar cooker.,It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.,Unfortunately, they're almost half German,,they're so precise.,(Laughter),You'll never find Indian women so precise.,Absolutely to the last inch,,they can make that cooker.,And we have 60 meals twice a day,of solar cooking. 
 We have a dentist --,she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.,She actually looks after the teeth,of 7,000 children.,Barefoot technology:,this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it --,but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.,Very little water is wasted.,All the roofs are connected underground,to a 400,000 liter tank,,and no water is wasted.,If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,,because we collect rainwater. 
 60 percent of children don't go to school,,because they have to look after animals --,sheep, goats --,domestic chores.,So we thought of starting a school,at night for the children.,Because the night schools of Tilonia,,over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.,Because it's for the convenience of the child;,it's not for the convenience of the teacher.,And what do we teach in these schools?,Democracy, citizenship,,how you should measure your land,,what you should do if you're arrested,,what you should do if your animal is sick.,This is what we teach in the night schools.,But all the schools are solar-lit. 
 Every five years,we have an election.,Between six to 14 year-old children,participate in a democratic process,,and they elect a prime minister.,The prime minister is 12 years old.,She looks after 20 goats in the morning,,but she's prime minister in the evening.,She has a cabinet,,a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.,And they actually monitor and supervise,150 schools for 7,000 children.,She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,,and she went to Sweden.,First time ever going out of her village.,Never seen Sweden.,Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.,And the Queen of Sweden, who's there,,turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?,She's only 12 years old,,and she's not dazzled by anything.",And the girl, who's on her left,,turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye,and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high,,we use puppetry.,Puppets is the way we communicate.,You have Jokhim Chacha,who is 300 years old.,He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.,He's my doctor. He's my lawyer.,He's my donor.,He actually raises money,,solves my disputes.,He solves my problems in the village.,If there's tension in the village,,if attendance at the schools goes down,and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,,the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village,and says, "Shake hands.,The attendance must not drop.",These puppets,are made out of recycled World Bank reports. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So this decentralized, demystified approach,of solar-electrifying villages,,we've covered all over India,from Ladakh up to Bhutan --,all solar-electrified villages,by people who have been trained.,And we went to Ladakh,,and we asked this woman --,this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,,because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides --,and we asked this woman,,"What was the benefit you had,from solar electricity?",And she thought for a minute and said,,"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter." 
 (Laughter) 
 Went to Afghanistan.,One lesson we learned in India,was men are untrainable.,(Laughter),Men are restless,,men are ambitious,,men are compulsively mobile,,and they all want a certificate.,(Laughter),All across the globe, you have this tendency,of men wanting a certificate.,Why? Because they want to leave the village,and go to a city, looking for a job.,So we came up with a great solution:,train grandmothers.,What's the best way of communicating,in the world today?,Television? No.,Telegraph? No.,Telephone? No.,Tell a woman. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So we went to Afghanistan for the first time,,and we picked three women,and said, "We want to take them to India.",They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,,and you want to take them to India.",I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well.",So I took the husbands along.,Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.,In six months,,how do we train these women?,Sign language.,You don't choose the written word.,You don't choose the spoken word.,You use sign language.,And in six months,they can become solar engineers.,They go back and solar-electrify their own village. 
 This woman went back,and solar-electrified the first village,,set up a workshop --,the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan,[was] by the three women.,This woman,is an extraordinary grandmother.,55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.,And they haven't collapsed.,She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan,and told the head of the department,the difference between AC and DC.,He didn't know.,Those three women have trained 27 more women,and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan. 
 We went to Africa,,and we did the same thing.,All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,,all chatting to each other, not understanding a word,,because they're all speaking a different language.,But their body language is great.,They're speaking to each other,and actually becoming solar engineers.,I went to Sierra Leone,,and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night --,comes across this village.,Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?",They said, "These two grandmothers ... ","Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.,"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back.",Went straight to the president.,He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?",He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.,"What's the story.",So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?",I said, "I can't, Mr. President.,But they will. The grandmothers will.",So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.,And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone. 
 Gambia:,we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.,Went to this village.,I knew which woman I would like to take.,The community got together and said, "Take these two women.",I said, "No, I want to take this woman.",They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her.",I said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks.","Difficult husband; not possible.",Called the husband, the husband came,,swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible.","Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is.",I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful.","What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?",That was his biggest fear.,I said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile.",She went like a grandmother,and came back like a tiger.,She walked out of the plane,and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.,She handled the national press,,and she was a star.,And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?","Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter.",(Laughter),Success story. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I'll just wind up by saying,that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.,Look for solutions within.,And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.,They're all over the world.,Don't even worry.,Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.,They have all the solutions in the world. 
 I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.,"First they ignore you,,then they laugh at you,,then they fight you,,and then you win." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Everyone's familiar with cancer,,but we don't normally think of cancer,as being a contagious disease.,The Tasmanian devil has shown us,that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease,,but it can also threaten,an entire species with extinction. 
 So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?,Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character,,the one that spins around and around and around.,But not many people know,that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil,,and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.,A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch,like a kangaroo.,The Tasmanian devil got its name,from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes. 
 (Screaming) 
 (Laughter) 
 The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger,,and it uses its powerful jaws,and its sharp teeth,to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.,[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania,,which is that small island,just to the south of the mainland of Australia.,And despite their ferocious appearance,,Tasmanian devils are actually,quite adorable little animals.,In fact, growing up in Tasmania,,it always was incredibly exciting,when we got a chance to see,a Tasmanian devil in the wild. 
 But the Tasmanian devil population,has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.,And in fact, there's concern,that the species could go extinct in the wild,within 20 to 30 years.,And the reason for that,is the emergence of a new disease,,a contagious cancer. 
 The story begins in 1996,when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here,of a Tasmanian devil,with a large tumor on its face.,At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.,Animals, just like humans,,sometimes get strange tumors.,However, we now believe,that this is the first sighting of a new disease,,which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.,The disease was first sighted,in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996,and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.,Now there's only a small part of the population,,which remains unaffected. 
 This disease appears first as tumors,,usually on the face or inside the mouth,of affected Tasmanian devils.,These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors,,such as these ones here.,And the next image I'm going to show,is quite gruesome.,But inevitably, these tumors progress,towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here. 
 This one in particular sticks in my mind,,because this is the first case of this disease,that I saw myself.,And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil,with this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor,inside her mouth,that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.,She hadn't eaten for days.,Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.,Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.,And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils,in her pouch.,Of course, they died along with the mother.,They were too young to survive without their mother.,In fact, in the area where she comes from,,more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population,has already died of this disease. 
 Scientists around the world,were intrigued by this cancer,,this infectious cancer,,that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.,And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women,,which is spread by a virus,,and to the AIDS epidemic,,which is associated with a number of different types of cancer.,All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer,was spread by a virus.,However, we now know -- and I'll tell you right now --,that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.,In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer,is something altogether more sinister,,and something that we hadn't really thought of before.,But in order for me to explain what that is,,I need to spend just a couple of minutes,talking more about cancer itself. 
 Cancer is a disease,that affects millions of people around the world every year.,One in three people in this room,will develop cancer at some stage in their lives.,I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine,when I was only 14.,Cancer occurs,when a single cell in your body,acquires a set of random mutations in important genes,that cause that cell to start to produce,more and more and more copies of itself.,Paradoxically, once established,,natural selection actually favors,the continued growth of cancer.,Natural selection is survival of the fittest.,And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells,,if one of them acquires new mutations,,which allow them to grow more quickly,,acquire nutrients more successfully,,invade the body,,they'll be selected for by evolution. 
 That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.,It evolves.,Throw a drug at it,,and resistant cells will grow back.,An amazing fact is that,,given the right environment and the right nutrients,,a cancer cell has the potential,to go on growing forever.,However cancer is constrained,by living inside our bodies,,and its continued growth,,its spreading through our bodies,and eating away at our tissues,,leads to the death of the cancer patient,and also to the death of the cancer itself. 
 So cancer could be thought of,as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form --,an evolutionary dead end.,But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer,has acquired an absolutely amazing,evolutionary adaptation.,And the answer came from studying,the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.,This was work from many people,,but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment,that I did a few years ago. 
 The next slide is going to be gruesome.,This is Jonas.,He's a Tasmanian devil that we found,with a large tumor on his face.,And being a geneticist,,I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.,So I took this opportunity,to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor,and also some samples from other parts of his body.,I took these back to the lab.,I extracted DNA from them.,And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA,,and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor,to that of the rest of his body,,I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.,In fact, Jonas and his tumor,were as different from each other,as you and the person sitting next to you.,What this told us was that Jonas' tumor,did not arise from cells of his own body.,In fact, more genetic profiling,told us that this tumor in Jonas,actually probably first arose,from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil --,and Jonas was clearly a male. 
 So how come,a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual,is growing on Jonas' face?,Well the next breakthrough,came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers,from all around Tasmania.,We found that all of these cancers,shared the same DNA.,Think about that for a minute.,That means that all of these cancers,actually are the same cancer,that arose once from one individual devil,,that have broken free of that first devil's body,and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population. 
 But how can a cancer spread in a population?,Well the final piece of the puzzle came,when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.,They tend to bite each other,,often quite ferociously and usually on the face.,We think that cancer cells,actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.,When the devil bites another devil,,it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil,,so the tumor continues to grow.,So this Tasmanian devil cancer,is perhaps the ultimate cancer.,It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.,It spreads through the population,,has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system,,and it's the only cancer that we know of,that's threatening an entire species with extinction. 
 But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils,,why hasn't it happened in other animals,or even humans?,Well the answer is, it has.,This is Kimbo.,He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.,Last year, his owner noticed some blood,trickling from his genital region.,She took him to the vet,and the vet discovered something quite disgusting.,And if you're squeamish, please look away now.,He discovered this,,a huge bleeding tumor,at the base of Kimbo's penis.,The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor,,a sexually transmitted cancer,that affects dogs.,And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious,through the spread of living cancer cells,,so is this dog cancer. 
 But this dog cancer is quite remarkable,,because it spread all around the world.,And in fact, these same cells,that are affecting Kimbo here,are also found affecting dogs,in New York City,,in mountain villages in the Himalayas,and in Outback Australia.,We also believe this cancer might be very old.,In fact, genetic profiling tells,that it may be tens of thousands of years old,,which means that this cancer,may have first arisen,from the cells of a wolf,that lived alongside the Neanderthals.,This cancer is remarkable.,It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.,It's a living relic,of the distant past. 
 So we've seen that this can happen in animals.,Could cancers be contagious between people?,Well this is a question,which fascinated Chester Southam,,a cancer doctor in the 1950s.,Ad he decided to put this to the test,by actually deliberately inoculating people,with cancer from somebody else.,And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957,injecting cancer into a volunteer,,who in this case was an inmate,in Ohio State Penitentiary.,Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected,did not go on to develop cancer,from the injected cells.,But a small number of them did,,and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill --,whose immune systems were probably compromised. 
 What this tells us,,ethical issues aside,,is that ...,(Laughter),it's probably extremely rare,for cancers to be transferred between people.,However, under some circumstances,,it can happen.,And I think that this is something,that oncologists and epidemiologists,should be aware of in the future. 
 So just finally,,cancer is an inevitable outcome,of the ability of our cells,to divide,and to adapt to their environments.,But that does not mean that we should give up hope,in the fight against cancer.,In fact, I believe, given more knowledge,of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth,,we can defeat cancer.,My personal aim,is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.,Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil,from being the first animal,to go extinct from cancer. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.,And usually when I tell people I'm an artist,,they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?",or "What kind of medium do you work in?",Well most of my work that I work with,is really a little bit about methodologies of working,rather than actually a specific discipline,or a specific technique.,So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.,And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.,So let me show you a little of that. 
 So it started over here.,And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.,I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.,And as I was coming back,,well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,,and went into a little room,and he asked me all sorts of questions --,"Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?,Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" --,all these little details.,And then literally just out of nowhere,,the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?",And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?",or any date for that fact,,it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you." 
 So I pulled out my little PDA,,and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th.",I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.,From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.,From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class,,3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.,"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?","Where were you the 29th? the 30th?","Where were you October 5th?",We read about six months of my calendar.,And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records,of what I did.,But good thing I did,,because I don't look good in orange. 
 (Laughter) 
 So he asked me --,(Applause),"So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,,what did you have in it?",This was in Tampa, Florida,,so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.,Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.,Just assorted garage sale junk,,because I'm a pack rat.",And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?",(Laughter),I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.,And if there were, I would have remembered that one.",And he's still a little confused,,but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes,realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.,And so we're sitting there,,and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,,he says, "Okay, I have enough information here.,I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.,They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it.",I was like, "Great." 
 So I got home and the phone rings,,and a man introduced himself.,Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa,where I spent six months of my life --,back and forth, not six months continuously.,By the way, you folks know that in the United States,,you can't take photographs of federal buildings,,but Google can do it for you.,So to the folks from Google, thank you.,(Applause),So I spent a lot of time in this building.,Questions like:,"Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act,that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?",And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in,when you're doing this.,You're basically face-to-face with someone,that essentially decides life or death.,Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph,,which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- 
 one of the polygraph questions was ...,well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes.","Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes.",Because you have to base it on a yes or no.,Then, of course, the next question is:,"Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?",I work at a university.,(Laughter),So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly.",But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed,,do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?",I was like, "No." 
 So at the end of six months of this,and nine consecutive polygraphs,,they said, "Hey, everything's fine.",I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.,I know everything's fine.",So they're looking at me really odd.,And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot.",This is with the FBI.,And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,,and here we go all over again.",And there was a sincere concern there.,And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble,,give us a call -- we'll take care of it." 
 So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.,I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.,Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle,on March 12th" or whatever.,A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.,It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.,Just wanted to say, "Hey guys.,Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves.",(Laughter),"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.,Just letting you know. Heads up.",And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.,And then the phone calls turned into emails,,and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...,with pictures,,with travel tips.,Then I'd make websites.,And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here. 
 So I actually designed this back in 2003.,So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.,I wrote some code for my mobile phone.,Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.,But I'll watch myself. It's okay.,You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.,And I'll help you out.,So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?,Well they probably have all my flight records,,so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.,So you can see, Delta 1252,going from Kansas City to Atlanta.,And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.,This was on Delta 719,going from JFK to San Francisco.,See that? They won't let me on a plane with that,,but they'll give it to me on the plane.,(Laughter),These are the airports that I hang out in,,because I like airports.,That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.,This is in Warsaw.,Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty. 
 These images are shot really anonymously,to the point where it could be anyone.,But if you can cross-reference this with the other data,,then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent,and putting it all together.,And when you're in a situation,where you have to justify every moment of your existence,,you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.,At the time that this was going on,,the last thing on my mind was "art project.",I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.,But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?,And after piecing together this, this and this,,this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself,eventually evolved into this,,and it actually became this project. 
 So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them --,because they need to know.,This is me buying some duck flavored paste,at the Ranch 99 in Daly City,on Sunday, November 15th.,At Coreana Supermarket,buying my kimchi because I like kimchi.,And I bought some crabs too right around there,,and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.,And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland --,East Oakland, sorry.,And then my pickled jellyfish,at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.,Now if you go to my bank records,,it'll actually show something from there,,so you know that, on May 9th,,that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo. 
 So not only that I'm giving this information here and there,,but now there's a third party,,an independent third party, my bank,,that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.,So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.,And there's a verification taking place.,Sometimes they're really small purchases.,So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.,All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,,and everything pops up right away. 
 Sometimes there's a lot of information.,This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.,And then sometimes you get this.,Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,,January 22nd.,And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,,because this is what I had to do with the FBI.,I had to tell them every little detail of everything.,I spend a lot of time on the road.,This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada,off of Route 80,at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.,I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.,So there's multiple databases.,And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.,There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site,,and the FBI has seen all of them --,at least I trust they've seen all of them.,And then sometimes you don't get much information at all,,you just get this empty bed.,And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.,So you get something like this.,This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California --,Vietnamese sandwich. 
 So there's different categorizations,of meals eaten outside,empty train stations, empty gas stations.,These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.,So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?,Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.,So again, you have to do some detective work here.,So sometimes the databases get so specific.,These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City,near a train station,on July fifth to July sixth.,At 11:39 a.m. was this one.,At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.,So I time-stamp my life every few moments.,Every few moments I shoot the image. 
 Now it's all done on my iPhone,,and it all goes straight up to my server,,and my server does all the backend work,and categorizes things and puts everything together.,They need to know where I'm doing my business,,because they want to know about my business.,So on December 4th, I went here.,And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 --,this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon,in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.,So what you're basically seeing here,is all bits and pieces and all this information. 
 If you go to my site, there's tons of things.,And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.,It's actually quite user-unfriendly.,And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,,is that everything is there,,but you have to really work through it.,So by me putting all this information out there,,what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.,But in this barrage of noise,that I'm putting out,,I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.,And you know very little about me actually.,And really so I've come to the conclusion,that the way you protect your privacy,,particularly in an era where everything is cataloged,and everything is archived and everything is recorded,,there's no need to delete information anymore. 
 So what do you do when everything is out there?,Well you have to take control over it.,And if I give you this information directly,,it's a very different type of identity,than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.,The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here,is the fact that intelligence agencies --,and it doesn't matter who they are --,they all operate in an industry,where their commodity is information,,or restricted access to information.,And the reason their information has any value,is, well, because no one else has access to it.,And by me cutting out the middle man,and giving it straight to you,,the information that the FBI has has no value,,so thus devaluing their currency.,And I understand that, on an individual level,,it's purely symbolic.,But if 300 million people in the U.S.,started doing this,,we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system,from the ground up.,Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.,And we're getting to that. 
 When I first started this project,,people were looking at me and saying,,"Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?,Why are you posting these photos?",This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere,and 750 million people,were posting status messages,or poking people.,So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.,I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete,,because you're all doing it.,This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,,whether we're aware of it or not.,So we're creating our own archives and so on. 
 And you know, some of my friends have always said,,"Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?,Because no one's really watching.,No one's really going to bother you.",So one of the things that I do,is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.,Because it's about surveillance.,I'm watching who's watching me.,And I came up with these.,So these are some of my sample logs.,And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.,And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.,So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by --,Department of Homeland Security.,You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.,I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.,Central Intelligence Agency.,Executive Office of the President.,Not really sure why they show up, but they do.,I think they kind of like to look at art.,And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. 
 So thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious.,You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,",but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.,So how many hours of the day does that take? 
 HE: Almost none.,It's no different,than sending a text.,It's no different than checking an email.,It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.,So it's just become another day.,I mean, when we update a status message,,we don't really think about how long that's going to take.,So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,,send, and then it's done.,And everything's automated at the other end. 
 BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy? 
 HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.,So it holds onto the very last point.,So if I'm on a 12-hour flight,,you'll see the last airport that I departed from. 
 BG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.) 
 (Applause)So I'm here to explain,why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.,And to do that, I'd like to talk first,about environmental toxins in our bodies.,So some of you may know,about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.,It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen,that's found in the lining of canned foods,and some plastics.,So BPA mimics the body's own hormones,and causes neurological and reproductive problems.,And it's everywhere.,A recent study found BPA,in 93 percent of people six and older.,But it's just one chemical.,The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.,says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies,,and this includes preservatives, pesticides,and heavy metals like lead and mercury. 
 To me, this says three things.,First, don't become a cannibal.,Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of,our own pollution.,And third,,our bodies are filters and storehouses,for environmental toxins.,So what happens to all these toxins when we die?,The short answer is:,They return to the environment in one way or another,,continuing the cycle of toxicity.,But our current funeral practices,make the situation much worse.,If you're cremated,,all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.,And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury,from our dental fillings alone every year. 
 And in a traditional American funeral,,a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics,to make it look alive.,It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde,to slow decomposition --,a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer,in funeral personnel.,So by trying to preserve our dead bodies,,we deny death, poison the living,and further harm the environment.,Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming,,are a step in the right direction,,but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.,I think there's a better solution. 
 I'm an artist,,so I'd like to offer a modest proposal,at the intersection,of art, science and culture.,The Infinity Burial Project,,an alternative burial system,that uses mushrooms,to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.,The Infinity Burial Project,began a few years ago with a fantasy,to create the Infinity Mushroom --,a new hybrid mushroom,that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins,and deliver nutrients to plant roots,,leaving clean compost.,But I learned it's nearly impossible,to create a new hybrid mushroom.,I also learned,that some of our tastiest mushrooms,can clean environmental toxins in soil.,So I thought maybe I could train an army,of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms,to eat my body. 
 So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off --,my hair, skin and nails --,and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.,As the mushrooms grow,,I pick the best feeders,to become Infinity Mushrooms.,It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process,for the afterlife.,So when I die,,the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body,and be able to eat it.,All right, so for some of you,,this may be really, really out there.,(Laughter),Just a little. 
 I realize this is not the kind of relationship,that we usually aspire to have with our food.,We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.,But as I watch the mushrooms grow,and digest my body,,I imagine the Infinity Mushroom,as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death,and the relationship between my body and the environment.,See for me,,cultivating the Infinity Mushroom,is more than just scientific experimentation,or gardening or raising a pet,,it's a step towards accepting the fact,that someday I will die and decay.,It's also a step,towards taking responsibility,for my own burden on the planet. 
 Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice,of cultivating decomposing organisms,called decompiculture,,a concept that was developed by an entomologist,,Timothy Myles.,The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture,I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation --,the cultivation of organisms that decompose,and clean toxins in bodies. 
 And now about these ninja pajamas.,Once it's completed,,I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.,First, a burial suit,infused with mushroom spores,,the Mushroom Death Suit.,(Laughter),I'm wearing the second prototype,of this burial suit.,It's covered with a crocheted netting,that is embedded with mushroom spores.,The dendritic pattern you see,mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia,,which are the equivalent of plant roots. 
 I'm also making a decompiculture kit,,a cocktail of capsules,that contain Infinity Mushroom spores,and other elements,that speed decomposition and toxin remediation.,These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly,,a kind of second skin,,which dissolves quickly,and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.,So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit,in the next year or two,,and then I'd like to begin testing them,,first with expired meat from the market,and then with human subjects.,And believe it or not,,a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project,to be eaten by mushrooms. 
 (Laughter) 
 What I've learned from talking to these folks,is that we share a common desire,to understand and accept death,and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.,I wanted to cultivate this perspective,just like the mushrooms,,so I formed the Decompiculture Society,,a group of people called decompinauts,who actively explore their postmortem options,,seek death acceptance,and cultivate decomposing organisms,like the Infinity Mushroom.,The Decompiculture Society shares a vision,of a cultural shift,,from our current culture of death denial and body preservation,to one of decompiculture,,a radical acceptance of death and decomposition. 
 Accepting death means accepting,that we are physical beings,who are intimately connected to the environment,,as the research on environmental toxins confirms.,And the saying goes,,we came from dust and will return to dust.,And once we understand that we're connected to the environment,,we see that the survival of our species,depends on the survival of the planet.,I believe this is the beginning,of true environmental responsibility. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was born in Switzerland,and raised in Ghana, West Africa.,Ghana felt safe to me as a child.,I was free, I was happy.,The early 70s,marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.,But then by the end of the decade,,the country had fallen back into political instability,and mismanagement. 
 In 1979,,I witnessed my first military coup.,We the children had gathered at a friend's house.,It was a dimly lit shack.,There was a beaten up black and white television,flickering in the background,,and a former head of state and general,was being blindfolded,and tied to the pole.,The firing squad aimed, fired --,the general was dead.,Now this was being broadcast live.,And shortly after, we left the country,,and we returned to Switzerland. 
 Now Europe came as a shock to me,,and I think I started feeling the need,to shed my skin in order to fit in.,I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.,I think it was a tactic of survival.,And it worked, or so I believed. 
 So here I was in 2008,wondering where I was in my life.,And I felt I was being typecast as an actor.,I was always playing the exotic African.,I was playing the violent African,,the African terrorist.,And I was thinking,,how many terrorists could I possibly play,before turning into one myself?,And I had become ashamed of the other,,the African in me.,And fortunately I decided in 2008,to return to Ghana,,after 28 years of absence.,I wanted to document on film,the 2008 presidential elections.,And there, I started by searching,for the footprints in my childhood.,And before I even knew it,,I was suddenly on a stage,surrounded by thousands of cheering people,during a political rally. 
 And I realized that, when I'd left the country,,free and fair elections in a democratic environment,were a dream.,And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality,,though a fragile reality.,And I was thinking,,was Ghana searching for its identity,like I was looking for my identity?,Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor,for what was happening in me?,And it was as if through the standards of my Western life,,I hadn't lived up to my full potential.,I mean, nor had Ghana,,even though we had been trying very hard. 
 Now in 1957,,Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country,to gain its independence.,In the late 50s,,Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.,I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country,and Ghana is not.,But maybe it was time to prove to myself,,yes, it's important to understand the past,,it is important to look at it in a different light,,but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture,and build on those foundations in the present. 
 So here I was, December 7th, 2008.,The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,,but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,,were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.,And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,,because they wanted to make their voices heard.,And I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?",And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you.",He said that his vote was in his heart.,And I understood, this was their election,,and they weren't going to let anyone,take it away from them. 
 Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner --,so nobody had achieved the absolute majority --,so voting went into a second round three weeks later.,The candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.,The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.,The heat was on.,And then the cliche came to haunt us.,There were claims of intimidation,at the polling stations,,of ballot boxes being stolen.,Inflated results started coming in,and the mob was starting to get out of control.,We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.,People were being beaten brutally.,The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.,It was complete chaos.,And my heart sank,,because I thought, here we are again.,Here is another proof,that the African is not capable of governing himself.,And not only that, I am documenting it --,documenting my own cultural shortcomings. 
 So when the echo of the gunshots,had lingered,,it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,,and I didn't believe what I was hearing.,They were chanting, "We want peace.,We want peace.",And I realized it had to come from the people.,After all, they decide,,and they did.,So the sounds that were before distorted and loud,,were suddenly a melody.,The sounds of the voices were harmonious.,So it could happen.,A democracy could be upheld peacefully.,It could be, by the will of the masses,who were now urgently pressing,with all their heart and all their will,for peace. 
 Now here's an interesting comparison.,We in the West,,we preach the values,,the golden light of democracy,,that we are the shining example of how it's done.,But when it comes down to it,,Ghana found itself in the same place,in which the U.S. election stalled,in the 2000 presidential elections --,Bush versus Gore.,But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates,to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,,Ghana honored democracy,and its people.,It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;,the people did. 
 Now the second round of voting,did not bring forth a clear winner either.,I mean, it was so incredibly close.,The electoral commissioner declared,,with the consent of the parties,,to run an unprecedented,second re-run.,So the people went back to the polls,to determine their own president,,not the legal system.,And guess what, it worked.,The defeated candidate,gave up power,and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.,I mean, at the absolute time,for the absolute need of democracy,,they did not abuse their power.,The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,,proving that the African is capable of governing himself. 
 Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa,is not over,,but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,,and that we must not take it for granted.,Now I have learned,that my place is not just in the West or in Africa,,and I'm still searching,for my identity,,but I saw Ghana,create democracy better.,Ghana taught me,to look at people differently,and to look at myself differently.,And yes,,we Africans can. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Humans in the developed world,spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,,where they breathe in and come into contact,with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:,microorganisms.,Buildings are complex ecosystems,that are an important source,of microbes that are good for us,,and some that are bad for us.,What determines the types and distributions,of microbes indoors?,Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes,that enter through windows,and through mechanical ventilation systems.,And they are brought inside,by humans and other creatures.,The fate of microbes indoors,depends on complex interactions,with humans,,and with the human-built environment.,And today, architects and biologists,are working together,to explore smart building design,that will create,healthy buildings for us. 
 We spend an extraordinary amount of time,in buildings,that are extremely controlled environments,,like this building here --,environments that have mechanical ventilation systems,that include filtering,,heating and air conditioning.,Given the amount of time that we spend indoors,,it's important to understand,how this affects our health.,At the Biology and the Built Environment Center,,we carried out a study in a hospital,where we sampled air,and pulled the DNA,out of microbes in the air.,And we looked at three different types of rooms.,We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,,which are the data points in the blue.,We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,,where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation,in a wing of the building,and pry open the windows,that were no longer operable,,but they made them operable for our study.,And we also sampled the outdoor air. 
 If you look at the x-axis of this graph,,you'll see that what we commonly want to do --,which is keeping the outdoors out --,we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.,So if you look at the green data points,,which is air that's outside,,you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,,or variety of microbial types.,But if you look at the blue data points,,which is mechanically ventilated air,,it's not as diverse.,But being less diverse,is not necessarily good for our health.,If you look at the y-axis of this graph,,you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,,you have a higher probability,of encountering a potential pathogen,,or germ,,than if you're outdoors. 
 So to understand why this was the case,,we took our data,and put it into an ordination diagram,,which is a statistical map,that tells you something,about how related the microbial communities are,in the different samples.,The data points that are closer together,have microbial communities that are more similar,than data points that are far apart.,And the first things that you can see from this graph,is, if you look at the blue data points,,which are the mechanically ventilated air,,they're not simply a subset of the green data points,,which are the outdoor air. 
 What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air,looks like humans.,It has microbes on it,that are commonly associated with our skin,and with our mouth, our spit.,And this is because,we're all constantly shedding microbes.,So all of you right now,are sharing your microbes with one another.,And when you're outdoors,,that type of air has microbes,that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt. 
 Why does this matter?,It matters because the health care industry,is the second most energy intensive industry,in the United States.,Hospitals use two and a half times,the amount of energy as office buildings.,And the model that we're working with,in hospitals,,and also with many, many different buildings,,is to keep the outdoors out.,And this model,may not necessarily be the best for our health.,And given the extraordinary amount,of nosocomial infections,,or hospital-acquired infections,,this is a clue that it's a good time,to reconsider our current practices. 
 So just as we manage national parks,,where we promote the growth of some species,and we inhibit the growth of others,,we're working towards thinking about buildings,using an ecosystem framework,where we can promote the kinds of microbes,that we want to have indoors.,I've heard somebody say,that you're as healthy as your gut.,And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt,so they can promote a healthy gut flora.,And what we ultimately want to do,is to be able to use this concept,to promote a healthy group,of microorganisms inside. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Well after many years working in trade and economics,,four years ago,,I found myself working on the front lines,of human vulnerability.,And I found myself in the places,where people are fighting every day to survive,and can't even obtain a meal.,This red cup comes from Rwanda,from a child named Fabian.,And I carry this around,as a symbol, really, of the challenge,and also the hope.,Because one cup of food a day,changes Fabian's life completely.,But what I'd like to talk about today,is the fact that this morning,,about a billion people on Earth --,or one out of every seven --,woke up and didn't even know,how to fill this cup.,One out of every seven people. 
 First, I'll ask you: Why should you care?,Why should we care?,For most people,,if they think about hunger,,they don't have to go far back on their own family history --,maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives,,or their grandparents' lives --,to remember an experience of hunger.,I rarely find an audience,where people can go back very far without that experience.,Some are driven by compassion,,feel it's perhaps,one of the fundamental acts of humanity.,As Gandhi said,,"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God.",Others worry about peace and security,,stability in the world.,We saw the food riots in 2008,,after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger,swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.,The destabilizing effects of hunger,are known throughout human history.,One of the most fundamental acts of civilization,is to ensure people can get enough food. 
 Others think about Malthusian nightmares.,Will we be able to feed a population,that will be nine billion in just a few decades?,This is not a negotiable thing, hunger.,People have to eat.,There's going to be a lot of people.,This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.,But I actually came to this issue,in a different way.,This is a picture of me and my three children.,In 1987, I was a new mother,with my first child,and was holding her and feeding her,when an image very similar to this,came on the television.,And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.,One two years earlier,had killed more than a million people.,But it never struck me as it did that moment,,because on that image,was a woman trying to nurse her baby,,and she had no milk to nurse.,And the baby's cry really penetrated me,,as a mother.,And I thought, there's nothing more haunting,than the cry of a child,that cannot be returned with food --,the most fundamental expectation of every human being.,And it was at that moment,that I just was filled,with the challenge and the outrage,that actually we know how to fix this problem. 
 This isn't one of those rare diseases,that we don't have the solution for.,We know how to fix hunger.,A hundred years ago, we didn't.,We actually have the technology and systems.,And I was just struck,that this is out of place.,At our time in history, these images are out of place.,Well guess what?,This is last week in northern Kenya.,Yet again,,the face of starvation,at large scale,with more than nine million people,wondering if they can make it to the next day.,In fact,,what we know now,is that every 10 seconds,we lose a child to hunger.,This is more,than HIV/AIDS,,malaria and tuberculosis combined.,And we know that the issue,is not just production of food. 
 One of my mentors in life,was Norman Borlaug, my hero.,But today I'm going to talk about access to food,,because actually this year and last year,and during the 2008 food crisis,,there was enough food on Earth,for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.,So why is it,that we have a billion people,who can't find food?,And I also want to talk about,what I call our new burden of knowledge.,In 2008,,Lancet compiled all the research,and put forward the compelling evidence,that if a child in its first thousand days --,from conception to two years old --,does not have adequate nutrition,,the damage is irreversible.,Their brains and bodies will be stunted.,And here you see a brain scan of two children --,one who had adequate nutrition,,another, neglected,and who was deeply malnourished.,And we can see brain volumes,up to 40 percent less,in these children.,And in this slide,you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain,don't form.,And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies,,which I'll talk about later.,But also the earning potential of these children,is cut in half in their lifetime,due to the stunting,that happens in early years. 
 So this burden of knowledge drives me.,Because actually we know how to fix it,very simply.,And yet, in many places,,a third of the children,,by the time they're three,already are facing a life of hardship,due to this.,I'd like to talk about,some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger,,some of the things I've learned,in bringing my economic and trade knowledge,and my experience in the private sector.,I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is. 
 Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth,,breastfeeding.,You may be surprised to know,that a child could be saved every 22 seconds,if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.,But in Niger, for example,,less than seven percent of the children,are breastfed,for the first six months of life, exclusively.,In Mauritania, less than three percent.,This is something that can be transformed with knowledge.,This message, this word, can come out,that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business;,it's a brilliant way,of saving your child's life.,And so today we focus on not just passing out food,,but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment,,and teaching them about breastfeeding. 
 The second thing I'd like to talk about:,If you were living in a remote village somewhere,,your child was limp,,and you were in a drought, or you were in floods,,or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet,,what would you do?,Do you think you could go to the store,and get a choice of power bars, like we can,,and pick the right one to match?,Well I find parents out on the front lines,very aware their children are going down for the count.,And I go to those shops, if there are any,,or out to the fields to see what they can get,,and they cannot obtain the nutrition.,Even if they know what they need to do, it's not available. 
 And I'm very excited about this,,because one thing we're working on,is transforming the technologies,that are very available,in the food industry,to be available for traditional crops.,And this is made with chickpeas, dried milk,and a host of vitamins,,matched to exactly what the brain needs.,It costs 17 cents for us to produce this,as, what I call, food for humanity.,We did this with food technologists,in India and Pakistan --,really about three of them.,But this is transforming,99 percent of the kids who get this.,One package, 17 cents a day --,their malnutrition is overcome.,So I am convinced,that if we can unlock the technologies,that are commonplace in the richer world,to be able to transform foods.,And this is climate-proof.,It doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water,,which is often lacking.,And these types of technologies,,I see, have the potential,to transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition,out on the front lines. 
 The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.,Eighty percent of the people in the world,have no food safety net.,When disaster strikes --,the economy gets blown, people lose a job,,floods, war, conflict,,bad governance, all of those things --,there is nothing to fall back on.,And usually the institutions --,churches, temples, other things --,do not have the resources,to provide a safety net.,What we have found working with the World Bank,is that the poor man's safety net,,the best investment, is school feeding.,And if you fill the cup,with local agriculture from small farmers,,you have a transformative effect.,Many kids in the world can't go to school,because they have to go beg and find a meal.,But when that food is there,,it's transformative.,It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life. 
 But what is most amazing is the effect on girls.,In countries where girls don't go to school,and you offer a meal to girls in school,,we see enrollment rates,about 50 percent girls and boys.,We see a transformation in attendance by girls.,And there was no argument,,because it's incentive.,Families need the help.,And we find that if we keep girls in school later,,they'll stay in school until they're 16,,and won't get married if there's food in school.,Or if they get an extra ration of food,at the end of the week --,it costs about 50 cents --,will keep a girl in school,,and they'll give birth to a healthier child,,because the malnutrition is sent,generation to generation. 
 We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.,We know this.,Right now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.,So is this a hopeless cause?,Absolutely not.,I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.,Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger,every year for decades.,Food aid coming in every year,when people are starving during the lean seasons.,Well two years ago,,we decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger,,and instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.,And we said, listen,,during the lean season, take the food out.,You manage, the village manages these warehouses.,And during harvest, put it back with interest,,food interest.,So add in five percent, 10 percent more food.,For the past two years,,500 of these villages where these are,have not needed any food aid -- they're self-sufficient.,And the food banks are growing.,And they're starting school feeding programs for their children,by the people in the village.,But they've never had the ability,to build even the basic infrastructure,or the resources.,I love this idea that came from the village level:,three keys to unlock that warehouse.,Food is gold there.,And simple ideas can transform the face,,not of small areas,,of big areas of the world. 
 I'd like to talk about what I call digital food.,Technology is transforming,the face of food vulnerability,in places where you see classic famine.,Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize,for saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food,because people have no ability to buy it.",We certainly saw that in 2008.,We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa,where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas,over last year.,Food can be there and people can't buy it. 
 Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop,,where instead of bringing in food,,we provide digital food, a card.,It says "bon appetit" in Arabic.,And the women can go in and swipe,and get nine food items.,They have to be nutritious,,and they have to be locally produced.,And what's happened in the past year alone,is the dairy industry --,where this card's used for milk and yogurt,and eggs and hummus --,the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.,The shopkeepers are hiring more people.,It is a win-win-win situation,that starts the food economy moving.,We now deliver food in over 30 countries,over cell phones,,transforming even the presence of refugees in countries,,and other ways. 
 Perhaps most exciting to me,is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others,have supported boldly,,which is to ask the question:,What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims --,and most of them are small farmers,who cannot raise enough food or sell food,to even support their own families --,what if we view them as the solution,,as the value chain to fight hunger?,What if from the women in Africa,who cannot sell any food --,there's no roads, there's no warehouses,,there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with --,what if we give the enabling environment,for them to provide the food,to feed the hungry children elsewhere?,And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.,And guess what?,In virtually every case,,when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market --,if you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.,We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." --,their yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold,and they figure it out,,because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.,And we're seeing people transform their lives.,Today, food aid, our food aid --,huge engine --,80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.,Total transformation,that can actually transform the very lives that need the food. 
 Now you'd ask, can this be done at scale?,These are great ideas, village-level ideas.,Well I'd like to talk about Brazil,,because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years,,when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger,faster than any nation on Earth right now.,And what I've found is,,rather than investing their money in food subsidies,and other things,,they invested in a school feeding program.,And they require that a third of that food,come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.,And they're doing this at huge scale,after President Lula declared his goal,of ensuring everyone had three meals a day.,And this zero hunger program,costs .5 percent of GDP,and has lifted many millions of people,out of hunger and poverty.,It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil,,and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.,I've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers,who have built their livelihoods,on the opportunity and platform,provided by this. 
 Now if we look at the economic imperative here,,this isn't just about compassion.,The fact is studies show,that the cost of malnutrition and hunger --,the cost to society,,the burden it has to bear --,is on average six percent,,and in some countries up to 11 percent,,of GDP a year.,And if you look at the 36 countries,with the highest burden of malnutrition,,that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy,every year.,Well, the World Bank estimates,it would take about 10 billion dollars --,10.3 --,to address malnutrition in those countries.,You look at the cost-benefit analysis,,and my dream is to take this issue,,not just from the compassion argument,,but to the finance ministers of the world,,and say we cannot afford,to not invest,in the access to adequate, affordable nutrition,for all of humanity. 
 The amazing thing I've found,is nothing can change on a big scale,without the determination of a leader.,When a leader says, "Not under my watch,",everything begins to change.,And the world can come in,with enabling environments and opportunities to do this.,And the fact that France,has put food at the center of the G20,is really important.,Because food is one issue,that cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.,We have to stand together.,And we're seeing nations in Africa.,WFP's been able to leave 30 nations,because they have transformed,the face of hunger in their nations. 
 What I would like to offer here is a challenge.,I believe we're living at a time in human history,where it's just simply unacceptable,that children wake up,and don't know where to find a cup of food.,Not only that,,transforming hunger,is an opportunity,,but I think we have to change our mindsets.,I am so honored to be here,with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.,And I would like you to join with all of humanity,to draw a line in the sand,and say, "No more.,No more are we going to accept this.",And we want to tell our grandchildren,that there was a terrible time in history,where up to a third of the children,had brains and bodies that were stunted,,but that exists no more. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Thank you.,It's a real pleasure to be here.,I last did a TED Talk,I think about seven years ago or so.,I talked about spaghetti sauce.,And so many people,nI guess, watch those videos.,People have beenncoming up to me ever since,to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,,which is a wonderful thingnin the short term --,(Laughter),but it's proven to be less than ideal,over seven years.,And so I though I would come,and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me. 
 (Laughter) 
 The theme of this morning'snsession is Things We Make.,And so I thought I would tell a story,about someone,who made one of the most precious objects,of his era.,And the man's name is Carl Norden.,Carl Norden was born in 1880.,And he was Swiss.,And of course, the Swiss can be divided,into two general categories:,those who make small, exquisite,,expensive objects,and those who handle the money,of those who buy small, exquisite,,expensive objects.,And Carl Norden is verynfirmly in the former camp.,He's an engineer.,He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.,In fact, one of his classmatesnis a young man named Lenin,who would go on,to break small, expensive,nexquisite objects. 
 And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.,And I mean that in itsnfullest sense of the word.,He wears three-piece suits;,and he has a very, very small,nimportant mustache;,and he is domineering,and narcissistic,and driven,and has an extraordinary ego;,and he works 16-hour days;,and he has very strong feelingsnabout alternating current;,and he feels like a suntannis a sign of moral weakness;,and he drinks lots of coffee;,and he does his best work,sitting in his mother's kitchennin Zurich for hours,in complete silence,with nothing but a slide rule. 
 In any case,,Carl Norden emigratesnto the United States,just before the First World War,and sets up shop on Lafayette Street,in downtown Manhattan.,And he becomes obsessed with the question,of how to drop bombs from an airplane.,Now if you think about it,,in the age before GPS and radar,,that was obviouslyna really difficult problem.,It's a complicated physics problem.,You've got a plane that'snthousands of feet up in the air,,going at hundreds of miles an hour,,and you're trying to dropnan object, a bomb,,towards some stationary target,in the face of all kindsnof winds and cloud cover,and all kinds of other impediments.,And all sorts of people,,moving up to the First World Warnand between the wars,,tried to solve this problem,,and nearly everybody came up short.,The bombsights that were available,were incredibly crude. 
 But Carl Norden is reallynthe one who cracks the code.,And he comes up with thisnincredibly complicated device.,It weighs about 50 lbs.,It's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.,And it has all kinds of leversnand ball-bearings,and gadgets and gauges.,And he makes this complicated thing.,And what he allows people to do,is he makes the bombardierntake this particular object,,visually sight the target,,because they're in the Plexiglasncone of the bomber,,and then they plug innthe altitude of the plane,,the speed of the plane,nthe speed of the wind,and the coordinates,of the target.,And the bombsight will tell himnwhen to drop the bomb.,And as Norden famously says,,"Before that bombsight came along,,bombs would routinely miss their target,by a mile or more.",But he said, with thenMark 15 Norden bombsight,,he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel,at 20,000 ft. 
 Now I cannot tell you,how incredibly excited,the U.S. military was,by the news of the Norden bombsight.,It was like manna from heaven.,Here was an army,that had just had experiencenin the First World War,,where millions of men,fought each other in the trenches,,getting nowhere, making no progress,,and here someone had come up with a device,that allowed them to fly up in the skies,high above enemy territory,and destroy whatever they wanted,with pinpoint accuracy. 
 And the U.S. military,spends 1.5 billion dollars --,billion dollars in 1940 dollars --,developing the Norden bombsight.,And to put that in perspective,,the total cost of the Manhattan project,was three billion dollars.,Half as much money was spentnon this Norden bombsight,as was spent on the most famousnmilitary-industrial project,of the modern era.,And there were people, strategists,nwithin the U.S. military,who genuinely thoughtnthat this single device,was going to spell the difference,between defeat and victory,when it came to thenbattle against the Nazis,and against the Japanese. 
 And for Norden as well,,this device had incrediblenmoral importance,,because Norden was a committed Christian.,In fact, he would always get upset,when people referred to thenbombsight as his invention,,because in his eyes,,only God could invent things.,He was simplynthe instrument of God's will.,And what was God's will?,Well God's will was thatnthe amount of suffering in any kind of war,be reduced to as smallnan amount as possible. 
 And what did the Norden bombsight do?,Well it allowed you to do that.,It allowed you to bomb only those things,that you absolutely needednand wanted to bomb.,So in the years leading up tonthe Second World War,,the U.S. military buys 90,000,of these Norden bombsights,at a cost of $14,000 each --,again, in 1940 dollars,nthat's a lot of money.,And they trained 50,000 bombardiersnon how to use them --,long extensive, months-longntraining sessions --,because these things arenessentially analog computers;,they're not easy to use.,And they make every onenof those bombardiers take an oath,,to swear that if they're ever captured,,they will not divulge a single detail,of this particular device to the enemy,,because it's imperativenthe enemy not get their hands,on this absolutely essentialnpiece of technology. 
 And whenever the Norden bombsightnis taken onto a plane,,it's escorted there byna series of armed guards.,And it's carried in a boxnwith a canvas shroud over it.,And the box is handcuffednto one of the guards.,It's never allowed to be photographed.,And there's a littlenincendiary device inside of it,,so that, if the plane ever crashes,nit will be destroyed,and there's no way the enemyncan ever get their hands on it.,The Norden bombsight,is the Holy Grail. 
 So what happens duringnthe Second World War?,Well, it turns outnit's not the Holy Grail.,In practice, the Norden bombsight,can drop a bomb intona pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,,but that's under perfect conditions.,And of course, in wartime,,conditions aren't perfect.,First of all, it's really hard to use --nreally hard to use.,And not all of the people,who are of those 50,000 mennwho are bombardiers,have the ability to properlynprogram an analog computer.,Secondly, it breaks down a lot.,It's full of all kindsnof gyroscopes and pulleys,and gadgets and ball-bearings,,and they don't work as wellnas they ought to,in the heat of battle. 
 Thirdly, when Nordennwas making his calculations,,he assumed that a plane would be flying,at a relatively slow speednat low altitudes.,Well in a real war, you can't do that;,you'll get shot down.,So they started flying themnat high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.,And the Norden bombsightndoesn't work as well,under those conditions. 
 But most of all,,the Norden bombsightnrequired the bombardier,to make visual contact with the target.,But of course, what happens in real life?,There are clouds, right.,It needs cloudless skynto be really accurate.,Well how many cloudless skies,do you think therenwere above Central Europe,between 1940 and 1945?,Not a lot. 
 And then to give you a sense,of just how inaccuratenthe Norden bombsight was,,there was a famous case in 1944,where the Allies bombedna chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.,And the chemical plant comprised,757 acres.,And over the coursenof 22 bombing missions,,the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs,on this 757 acre chemical plant,,using the Norden bombsight.,Well what percentage of those bombs,do you think actually landed,inside the 700-acrenperimeter of the plant?,10 percent. 10 percent.,And of those 10 percent that landed,,16 percent didn't even go off;nthey were duds.,The Leuna chemical plant,,after one of the most extensivenbombings in the history of the war,,was up and running within weeks. 
 And by the way, all those precautions,to keep the Norden bombsightnout of the hands of the Nazis?,Well it turns out,that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,,was very enamored of German engineers.,So in the 1930s,nhe hired a whole bunch of them,,including a man named Hermann Long,who, in 1938,,gave a complete set of the plansnfor the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.,So they had their own Norden bombsightnthroughout the entire war --,which also, by the way,ndidn't work very well. 
 (Laughter) 
 So why do we talk aboutnthe Norden bombsight?,Well because we live in an age,where there are lots and lots,of Norden bombsights.,We live in a timenwhere there are all kinds,of really, really smart people,running around, sayingnthat they've invented gadgets,that will forever change our world.,They've invented websitesnthat will allow people to be free.,They've invented some kind of this thing,nor this thing, or this thing,that will make our world forever better. 
 If you go into the military,,you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.,If you go to the Pentagon, they will say,,"You know what, now we really can,put a bomb inside a pickle barrel,at 20,000 ft.",And you know what, it's true;nthey actually can do that now.,But we need to be very clear,about how little that means. 
 In the Iraq War, at the beginningnof the first Iraq War,,the U.S. military, the air force,,sent two squadronsnof F-15E Fighter Eagles,to the Iraqi desert,equipped with thesenfive million dollar cameras,that allowed them to seenthe entire desert floor.,And their mission wasnto find and to destroy --,remember the Scud missile launchers,,those surface-to-air missiles,that the Iraqis were launchingnat the Israelis?,The mission of the two squadrons,was to get rid of all thenScud missile launchers.,And so they flew missions day and night,,and they dropped thousands of bombs,,and they fired thousands of missiles,in an attempt to get ridnof this particular scourge. 
 And after the war was over,nthere was an audit done --,as the army always does,nthe air force always does --,and they asked the question:,how many Scuds did we actually destroy?,You know what the answer was?,Zero, not a single one.,Now why is that?,Is it because their weaponsnweren't accurate?,Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.,They could have destroyednthis little thing right here,from 25,000 ft.,The issue was they didn't knownwhere the Scud launchers were.,The problem with bombs and pickle barrels,is not getting the bombninside the pickle barrel,,it's knowing how tonfind the pickle barrel.,That's always been the harder problem,when it comes to fighting wars. 
 Or take the battle in Afghanistan.,What is the signature weapon,of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?,It's the drone. What is the drone?,Well it is the grandsonnof the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.,It is this weapon of devastatingnaccuracy and precision.,And over the course of the last six years,in Northwest Pakistan,,the CIA has flown hundredsnof drone missiles,,and it's used those drones,to kill 2,000 suspected,Pakistani and Taliban militants.,Now what is the accuracy of those drones?,Well it's extraordinary.,We think we're now at 95 percent accuracy,when it comes to drone strikes.,95 percent of the peoplenwe kill need to be killed, right?,That is one of the mostnextraordinary records,in the history of modern warfare. 
 But do you know what the crucial thing is?,In that exact same period,that we've been using these drones,with devastating accuracy,,the number of attacks, of suicide attacksnand terrorist attacks,,against American forces in Afghanistan,has increased tenfold.,As we have gotten more and more efficient,in killing them,,they have become angrier and angrier,and more and more motivated to kill us.,I have not describednto you a success story.,I've described to you,the opposite of a success story. 
 And this is the problem,with our infatuationnwith the things we make.,We think the thingsnwe make can solve our problems,,but our problems are muchnmore complex than that.,The issue isn't the accuracynof the bombs you have,,it's how you use the bombs you have,,and more importantly,,whether you ought to use bombs at all. 
 There's a postscript,to the Norden story,of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.,And that is, on August 6, 1945,,a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay,flew over Japan,and, using a Norden bombsight,,dropped a very large thermonuclear device,on the city of Hiroshima.,And as was typicalnwith the Norden bombsight,,the bomb actuallynmissed its target by 800 ft.,But of course, it didn't matter.,And that's the greatest irony of all,when it comes to the Norden bombsight.,the air force's 1.5 billionndollar bombsight,was used to dropnits three billion dollar bomb,,which didn't need a bombsight at all. 
 Meanwhile, back in New York,,no one told Carl Norden,that his bombsight was usednover Hiroshima.,He was a committed Christian.,He thought he had designed something,that would reduce the tollnof suffering in war.,It would have broken his heart. 
 (Applause)So the type of magic I like,nand I'm a magician,,is magic that uses technologynto create illusions.,So I would like to show younsomething I've been working on.,It's an application,that I think will be useful for artists --nmultimedia artists in particular.,It synchronizes videosnacross multiple screens of mobile devices.,I borrowed these three iPodsnfrom people here in the audience,to show you what I mean.,And I'm going to use them to tell youna little bit about my favorite subject:,deception. 
 (Music) 
 One of my favorite magiciansnis Karl Germain.,He had this wonderful tricknwhere a rosebush would bloom,right in front of your eyes.,But it was his production of a butterflynthat was the most beautiful. 
 (Recording) Announcer:nLadies and gentlemen,,the creation of life. 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 Marco Tempest: When asked about deception,,he said this: 
 Announcer: Magicnis the only honest profession.,A magician promises to deceive you --,and he does. 
 MT: I like to think of myselfnas an honest magician.,I use a lot of tricks,,which means that sometimesnI have to lie to you.,Now I feel bad about that.,But people lie every day. 
 (Ringing) 
 Hold on. 
 Phone: Hey, where are you? 
 MT: Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon.,You've all done it. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Music) 
 Right: I'll be readynin just a minute, darling. 
 Center: It's just what I've always wanted. 
 Left: You were great. 
 MT: Deception,,it's a fundamental part of life.,Now polls show,that men tell twicenas many lies as women --,assuming the womennthey asked told the truth. 
 (Laughing) 
 We deceive to gain advantage,and to hide our weaknesses.,The Chinese general Sun Tzu saidnthat all war was based on deception.,Oscar Wilde saidnthe same thing of romance. 
 Some people deceive,for money.,Let's play a game.,Three cards, three chances. 
 Announcer: One five will get you 10,n10 will get you 20.,Now, where's the lady?,Where is the queen? 
 MT: This one?,Sorry. You lose.,Well, I didn't deceive you.,You deceived yourself.,Self-deception.,That's when we convince ourselvesnthat a lie is the truth.,Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.,Compulsive gamblersnare experts at self-deception. 
 (Slot machine) 
 They believe they can win.,They forget the times they lose. 
 The brain is very good at forgetting.,Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.,Bad experiences quickly disappear.,Which is why in this vastnand lonely cosmos,,we are so wonderfully optimistic.,Our self-deceptionnbecomes a positive illusion --,why movies are able to take usnonto extraordinary adventures;,why we believe Romeonwhen he says he loves Juliet;,and why single notes of music,,when played together,,become a sonata and conjure up meaning. 
 That's "Clair De lune.",Its composer, called Debussy,,said that art wasnthe greatest deception of all.,Art is a deceptionnthat creates real emotions --,a lie that creates a truth.,And when you give yourselfnover to that deception,,it becomes magic. 
 [MAGIC] 
 (Music fades slowly) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a garbage man.,And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,,because I absolutely hate waste.,I hope, within the next 10 minutes,,to change the way you think,about a lot of the stuff in your life.,And I'd like to start at the very beginning.,Think back when you were just a kid.,How did look at the stuff in your life?,Perhaps it was like these toddler rules:,It's my stuff if I saw it first.,The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.,The more stuff that's mine, the better.,And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry,,it's become pretty clear to me,that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind,as we develop into adults.,And let me tell you why I have that perspective.,Because each and every day,at our recycling plants around the world,we handle about one million pounds,of people's discarded stuff.,Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff,,but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods,that are disposed each and every year around the world --,well less than one percent.,In fact, the United Nations estimates,that there's about 85 billion pounds a year,of electronics waste,that gets discarded around the world each and every year --,and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.,And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth,,that number well more than doubles.,And of course, the more developed the country,,the bigger these mountains. 
 Now when you see these mountains,,most people think of garbage.,We see above-ground mines.,And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials,that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.,And it's becoming increasingly important,that we figure out how to extract these raw materials,from these extremely complicated waste streams.,Because as we've heard all week at TED,,the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it,who want more and more stuff.,And of course, they want the toys and the tools,that many of us take for granted. 
 And what goes into making those toys and tools,that we use every single day?,It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.,And the metals, we typically get,from ore that we mine,in ever widening mines,and ever deepening mines around the world.,And the plastics, we get from oil,,which we go to more remote locations,and drill ever deeper wells to extract.,And these practices have,significant economic and environmental implications,that we're already starting to see today. 
 The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff,and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff,,particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe,that have recycling policies in place,that require that this stuff be recycled,in a responsible manner.,Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff,,if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.,To put that in perspective --,and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals,,because it's the most common metal --,if your stuff makes it to a recycler,,probably over 90 percent of the metals,are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.,Plastics are a whole other story:,well less than 10 percent are recovered.,In fact, it's more like five percent.,Most of it's incinerated or landfilled. 
 Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material,,have very little value.,But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.,And there's more plastics produced and consumed,around the world on a volume basis,every year than steel.,So why is such a plentiful and valuable material,not recovered at anywhere near the rate,of the less valuable material?,Well it's predominantly because,metals are very easy to recycle,from other materials and from one another.,They have very different densities.,They have different electrical and magnetic properties.,And they even have different colors.,So it's very easy for either humans or machines,to separate these metals,from one another and from other materials.,Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.,They have either identical or very similar,electrical and magnetic properties.,And any plastic can be any color,,as you probably well know.,So the traditional ways of separating materials,just simply don't work for plastics. 
 Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans,is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world --,and sadly to say, particularly from the United States,,where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe --,finds its way to developing countries,for low-cost recycling.,People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.,They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals --,circuit boards and so forth --,and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover,,which is, again, mostly the plastics.,Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals,in burn houses like you see here.,And they extract the metals by hand.,Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution,,this is certainly not the low-environmental,or human health-and-safety solution.,I call this environmental arbitrage.,And it's not fair, it's not safe,and it's not sustainable. 
 Now because the plastics are so plentiful --,and by the way,,those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously --,but people do try to recover the plastics.,This is just one example.,This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops,of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.,They store the plastics on the roofs.,They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these,,and people try very hard to separate the plastics,,by color, by shape, by feel,,by any technique they can.,And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique,where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes,to try to determine the type of plastic.,None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling,in any significant way.,And by the way,,please don't try this technique at home. 
 So what are we to do about this space-age material,,at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?,Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant,to keep putting back in the ground,or certainly send up in smoke.,So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,,trying to figure out how to separate,these very similar materials from each other,,and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,,in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,,and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.,Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.,And we eventually broke the code.,This is the last frontier of recycling.,It's the last major material,to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.,And we finally figured out how to do it.,And in the process, we started recreating,how the plastics industry makes plastics. 
 The traditional way to make plastics,is with oil or petrochemicals.,You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,,to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.,We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.,And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,,sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.,Well a good place to start is with waste.,It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,,and it's plentiful,,as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.,And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules,and recombining them,,we're using a mining approach to extract the materials. 
 We have significantly lower capital costs,in our plant equipment.,We have enormous energy savings.,I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now,can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy,compared to making something the traditional way.,And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars,to build a chemical plant,that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,,our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.,And we make a drop-in replacement,for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.,Our customers get to enjoy,huge CO2 savings.,They get to close the loop with their products.,And they get to make more sustainable products. 
 In the short time period I have,,I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.,It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.,They recover the metals,and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste --,a very complex mixture of materials,,but predominantly plastics.,We take out the things that aren't plastics,,such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,,wood, glass, paper, you name it.,Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.,And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.,We're sieving the material, we're using magnets,,we're using air classification.,It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point. 
 At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:,many different types of plastics,and many different grades of plastics.,This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,,and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.,We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.,We use a very highly automated process,to sort those plastics,,not only by type, but by grade.,And out the end of that part of the process,come little flakes of plastic:,one type, one grade.,We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.,We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.,We push that material to extruders where we melt it,,push it through small die holes,,make spaghetti-like plastic strands.,And we chop those strands,into what are called pellets.,And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.,This is the same material,that you would get from oil.,And today,,we're producing it from your old stuff,,and it's going right back into your new stuff. 
 (Applause) 
 So now, instead of your stuff ending up,on a hillside in a developing country,or literally going up in smoke,,you can find your old stuff,back on top of your desk in new products,,in your office,,or back at work in your home.,And these are just a few examples,of companies that are buying our plastic,,replacing virgin plastic,,to make their new products. 
 So I hope I've changed the way you look at,at least some of the stuff in your life.,We took our clues from mother nature.,Mother nature wastes very little,,reuses practically everything.,And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer --,that's a label I've always hated my entire life --,and think of yourself as just using resources in one form,,until they can be transformed to another form,for another use later in time.,And finally, I hope you agree with me,to change that last toddler rule just a little bit,to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff." 
 Thank you for your time. 
 (Applause)I love the Internet.,It's true.,Think about everything it has brought us.,Think about all the services we use,,all the connectivity,,all the entertainment,,all the business, all the commerce.,And it's happening during our lifetimes.,I'm pretty sure that one day,we'll be writing history books,hundreds of years from now. This time,our generation will be remembered,as the generation that got online,,the generation,that built something really and truly global.,But yes, it's also true,that the Internet has problems, very serious problems,,problems with security,and problems with privacy.,I've spent my career,fighting these problems. 
 So let me show you something.,This here,is Brain.,This is a floppy disk,-- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk,infected by Brain.A.,It's the first virus we ever found,for PC computers.,And we actually know,where Brain came from.,We know because it says so,inside the code.,Let's take a look.,All right.,That's the boot sector of an infected floppy,,and if we take a closer look inside,,we'll see that right there,,it says, "Welcome to the dungeon.",And then it continues,,saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.,And Basit and Amjad are first names,,Pakistani first names.,In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, 1986.,Now it's 2011.,That's 25 years ago.,The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.,So half a year ago,,I decided to go to Pakistan myself.,So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.,This is from the city of Lahore,,which is around 300 kilometers south,from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.,Here's a typical street view.,And here's the street or road leading to this building,,which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.,And I knocked on the door.,(Laughter),You want to guess who opened the door?,Basit and Amjad; they are still there.,(Laughter),(Applause),So here standing up is Basit.,Sitting down is his brother Amjad.,These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.,Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.,I asked them why.,I asked them how they feel about what they started.,And I got some sort of satisfaction,from learning that both Basit and Amjad,had had their computers infected dozens of times,by completely unrelated other viruses,over these years.,So there is some sort of justice,in the world after all. 
 Now, the viruses that we used to see,in the 1980s and 1990s,obviously are not a problem any more.,So let me just show you a couple of examples,of what they used to look like.,What I'm running here,is a system that enables me,to run age-old programs on a modern computer.,So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.,What we have here is a list of old viruses.,So let me just run some viruses on my computer. 
 For example,,let's go with the Centipede virus first.,And you can see at the top of the screen,,there's a centipede scrolling across your computer,when you get infected by this one.,You know that you're infected,because it actually shows up.,Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash,,invented in Russia in 1992.,Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.,(Siren noise),And the last example,,guess what the Walker virus does?,Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen,once you get infected.,So it used to be fairly easy to know,that you're infected by a virus,,when the viruses were written by hobbyists,and teenagers. 
 Today, they are no longer being written,by hobbyists and teenagers.,Today, viruses are a global problem.,What we have here in the background,is an example of our systems that we run in our labs,,where we track virus infections worldwide.,So we can actually see in real time,that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan,and Russia and elsewhere.,In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems,through the Web,,we can see in real time,just some kind of idea of how many viruses,,how many new examples of malware we find every single day.,Here's the latest virus we've found,,in a file called Server.exe.,And we found it right over here three seconds ago --,the previous one, six seconds ago.,And if we just scroll around,,it's just massive.,We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.,And that's the last 20 minutes of malware,every single day. 
 So where are all these coming from then?,Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs,writing these viruses,because they make money with their viruses.,It's gangs like --,let's go to GangstaBucks.com.,This is a website operating in Moscow,where these guys are buying infected computers.,So if you are a virus writer,and you're capable of infecting Windows computers,,but you don't know what to do with them,,you can sell those infected computers --,somebody else's computers -- to these guys.,And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.,So how do these guys then monetize,those infected computers?,Well there's multiple different ways,,such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts,when you do online banking,,or keyloggers.,Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view,,and they record everything you type.,So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.,Every single Google search you type,is saved and sent to the criminals.,Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.,Same thing with every single password and so on. 
 But the thing that they're actually looking for most,are sessions where you go online,and do online purchases in any online store.,Because when you do purchases in online stores,,you will be typing in your name, the delivery address,,your credit card number and the credit card security codes.,And here's an example of a file,we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.,That's the credit card number,,that's the expiration date, that's the security code,,and that's the name of the owner of the card.,Once you gain access to other people's credit card information,,you can just go online and buy whatever you want,with this information.,And that, obviously, is a problem.,We now have a whole underground marketplace,and business ecosystem,built around online crime. 
 One example of how these guys,actually are capable of monetizing their operations:,we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL,and search for wanted persons.,We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,,and his partner in crime,,also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,,Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain,,a U.S. citizen.,These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,,a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.,They are both right now on the run.,Nobody knows where they are.,U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,,froze a Swiss bank account,belonging to Mr. Jain,,and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it. 
 So the amount of money online crime generates,is significant.,And that means that the online criminals,can actually afford to invest into their attacks.,We know that online criminals,are hiring programmers, hiring testing people,,testing their code,,having back-end systems with SQL databases.,And they can afford to watch how we work --,like how security people work --,and try to work their way around,any security precautions we can build.,They also use the global nature of Internet,to their advantage.,I mean, the Internet is international.,That's why we call it the Internet. 
 And if you just go and take a look,at what's happening in the online world,,here's a video built by Clarified Networks,,which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.,This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,,moves around from one country to another,as soon as the website is tried to shut down.,So you just can't shut these guys down.,They will switch from one country to another,,from one jurisdiction to another --,moving around the world,,using the fact that we don't have the capability,to globally police operations like this.,So the Internet is as if,someone would have given free plane tickets,to all the online criminals of the world.,Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before,can reach us. 
 So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?,How do you actually track them down?,Let me give you an example.,What we have here is one exploit file.,Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file,,which contains an exploit.,And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer,,it actually takes over your computer and runs code. 
 Now, if you'll take a look at this image file --,well there's the image header,,and there the actual code of the attack starts.,And that code has been encrypted,,so let's decrypt it.,It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.,You just have to believe me,,it is, it is.,And we can go here,and actually start decrypting it.,Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.,And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.,But just keep staring at it.,You'll actually see that down here,you can see a Web address:,unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe,And when you view this image on your computer,it actually is going to download and run that program.,And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer. 
 But even more interestingly,,if we continue decrypting,,we'll find this mysterious string,,which says O600KO78RUS.,That code is there underneath the encryption,as some sort of a signature.,It's not used for anything.,And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.,So obviously I Googled for it.,I got zero hits; wasn't there.,So I spoke with the guys at the lab.,And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs,,and one of them mentioned,,well, it ends in RUS like Russia.,And 78 is the city code,for the city of St. Petersburg.,For example, you can find it from some phone numbers,and car license plates and stuff like that.,So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg,,and through a long road,,we eventually found this one particular website. 
 Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years,who runs his own website,,and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.,And on this blog, he blogs about his life,,about his life in St. Petersburg --,he's in his early 20s --,about his cat,,about his girlfriend.,And he drives a very nice car.,In fact, this guy drives,a Mercedes-Benz S600,V12,with a six-liter engine,with more than 400 horsepower.,Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg. 
 How do I know about this car?,Because he blogged about the car.,He actually had a car accident.,In downtown St. Petersburg,,he actually crashed his car into another car.,And he put blogged images about the car accident --,that's his Mercedes --,right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.,And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara,ends in 78RUS.,And if you actually take a look at the scene picture,,you can see that the plate of the Mercedes,is O600KO78RUS.,Now I'm not a lawyer,,but if I would be,,this is where I would say, "I rest my case." 
 (Laughter) 
 So what happens when online criminals are caught?,Well in most cases it never gets this far.,The vast majority of the online crime cases,,we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.,And even if we are able to find online criminals,,quite often there is no outcome.,The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,,or for some reason we can't take them down.,I wish it would be easier;,unfortunately it isn't. 
 But things are also changing,at a very rapid pace.,You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.,So if you look at what Stuxnet did,is that it infected these.,That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC,,programmable logic [controller].,And this is what runs our infrastructure.,This is what runs everything around us.,PLC's, these small boxes which have no display,,no keyboard,,which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.,For example, the elevators in this building,most likely are controlled by one of these.,And when Stuxnet infects one of these,,that's a massive revolution,on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.,Because everything around us is being run by these.,I mean, we have critical infrastructure.,You go to any factory, any power plant,,any chemical plant, any food processing plant,,you look around --,everything is being run by computers. 
 Everything is being run by computers.,Everything is reliant on these computers working.,We have become very reliant,on Internet,,on basic things like electricity, obviously,,on computers working.,And this really is something,which creates completely new problems for us.,We must have some way,of continuing to work,even if computers fail. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So preparedness means that we can do stuff,even when the things we take for granted,aren't there.,It's actually very basic stuff --,thinking about continuity, thinking about backups,,thinking about the things that actually matter. 
 Now I told you --,(Laughter),I love the Internet. I do.,Think about all the services we have online.,Think about if they are taken away from you,,if one day you don't actually have them,for some reason or another.,I see beauty in the future of the Internet,,but I'm worried,that we might not see that.,I'm worried that we are running into problems,because of online crime.,Online crime is the one thing,that might take these things away from us. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've spent my life,defending the Net,,and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,,we are running a risk of losing it all.,We have to do this globally,,and we have to do it right now.,What we need,is more global, international law enforcement work,to find online criminal gangs --,these organized gangs,that are making millions out of their attacks.,That's much more important,than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.,What actually matters,is actually finding the people behind these attacks,,and even more importantly,,we have to find the people,who are about to become,part of this online world of crime,,but haven't yet done it.,We have to find the people with the skills,,but without the opportunities,and give them the opportunities,to use their skills for good. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Let's talk about billions.,Let's talk about,past and future billions.,We know,that about 106 billion people,have ever lived.,And we know that most of them are dead.,And we also know,that most of them live or lived in Asia.,And we also know,that most of them were or are very poor --,did not live for very long.,Let's talk about billions.,Let's talk about,the 195,000 billion dollars of wealth,in the world today.,We know that most of that wealth,was made after the year 1800.,And we know that most of it,is currently owned,by people we might call Westerners:,Europeans, North Americans, Australasians.,19 percent of the world's population today,,Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth. 
 Economic historians,call this "The Great Divergence.",And this slide here,is the best simplification,of the Great Divergence story,I can offer you.,It's basically two ratios,of per capita GDP,,per capita gross domestic product,,so average income.,One, the red line,,is the ratio of British to Indian,per capita income.,And the blue line,is the ratio of American to Chinese.,And this chart goes back to 1500.,And you can see here,that there's an exponential Great Divergence.,They start off pretty close together.,In fact, in 1500,,the average Chinese was richer than the average North American.,When you get to the 1970s,,which is where this chart ends,,the average Briton is more than 10 times richer,than the average Indian.,And that's allowing,for differences in the cost of living.,It's based on purchasing power parity.,The average American,is nearly 20 times richer,than the average Chinese,by the 1970s. 
 So why?,This wasn't just an economic story.,If you take the 10 countries,that went on to become,the Western empires,,in 1500 they were really quite tiny --,five percent of the world's land surface,,16 percent of its population,,maybe 20 percent of its income.,By 1913,,these 10 countries, plus the United States,,controlled vast global empires --,58 percent of the world's territory,,about the same percentage of its population,,and a really huge, nearly three-quarters share,of global economic output.,And notice, most of that went to the motherland,,to the imperial metropoles,,not to their colonial possessions. 
 Now you can't just blame this on imperialism --,though many people have tried to do so --,for two reasons.,One, empire was the least original thing,that the West did after 1500.,Everybody did empire.,They beat preexisting Oriental empires,like the Mughals and the Ottomans.,So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation,for the Great Divergence.,In any case, as you may remember,,the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,,some considerable time after decolonization.,This is not a new question. 
 Samuel Johnson,,the great lexicographer,,[posed] it through his character Rasselas,in his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia,",published in 1759.,"By what means are the Europeans thus powerful;,or why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa,for trade or conquest,,cannot the Asiaticks and Africans,invade their coasts,,plant colonies in their ports,,and give laws to their natural princes?,The same wind that carries them back,would bring us thither?" 
 That's a great question.,And you know what,,it was also being asked at roughly the same time,by the Resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world --,like Ibrahim Muteferrika,,an Ottoman official,,the man who introduced printing, very belatedly,,to the Ottoman Empire --,who said in a book published in 1731,,"Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past,compared with Muslim nations,begin to dominate so many lands in modern times,and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?",Unlike Rasselas,,Muteferrika had an answer to that question,,which was correct.,He said it was "because they have laws and rules,invented by reason.",It's not geography. 
 You may think we can explain the Great Divergence,in terms of geography.,We know that's wrong,,because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century,to see if geography mattered more than institutions.,We took all the Germans,,we divided them roughly in two,,and we gave the ones in the East communism,,and you see the result.,Within an incredibly short period of time,,people living in the German Democratic Republic,produced Trabants, the Trabbi,,one of the world's worst ever cars,,while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.,If you still don't believe me,,we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.,And we decided we'd take Koreans,in roughly the same geographical place,with, notice, the same basic traditional culture,,and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.,And the result is an even bigger divergence,in a very short space of time,than happened in Germany.,Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,,but in almost every other respect,,it's a huge divergence.,Which leads me to think,that neither geography nor national character,,popular explanations for this kind of thing,,are really significant. 
 It's the ideas.,It's the institutions.,This must be true,because a Scotsman said it.,And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.,So let me just explain to you,that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.,He was Adam Smith --,not Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery --,though he is very smart indeed.,(Laughter),Smith -- and I want you to go,and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;,it's a wonderful statue --,Smith, in the "Wealth of Nations",published in 1776 --,that's the most important thing that happened that year ...,(Laughter),You bet.,There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ... 
 (Laughter) 
 "China seems to have been long stationary,,and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches,which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.,But this complement may be much inferior,to what, with other laws and institutions,,the nature of its soil, climate, and situation,might admit of.",That is so right and so cool.,And he said it such a long time ago. 
 But you know, this is a TED audience,,and if I keep talking about institutions,,you're going to turn off.,So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.,Let's call them the killer apps.,I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps,that set the West apart from the rest.,And they're kind of like the apps on your phone,,in the sense that they look quite simple.,They're just icons; you click on them.,But behind the icon, there's complex code.,It's the same with institutions.,There are six,which I think explain the Great Divergence.,One, competition.,Two, the scientific revolution.,Three, property rights.,Four, modern medicine.,Five, the consumer society.,And six, the work ethic.,You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,,or try and boil it down to just four,,but you'll lose. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,,synthesizing the work of many economic historians,in the process.,Competition means,,not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,,but within each of these units,,there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.,The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,,existed in the 12th century.,Nothing like this existed in China,,where there was one monolithic state,covering a fifth of humanity,,and anyone with any ambition,had to pass one standardized examination,,which took three days and was very difficult,and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters,and very complex Confucian essay writing. 
 The scientific revolution was different,from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world,in a number of crucial ways,,the most important being,that, through the experimental method,,it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.,Example: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application,of Newtonian physics to ballistics.,Once you do that,,your artillery becomes accurate.,Think of what that means.,That really was a killer application.,(Laughter),Meanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.,The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,,but there's no scientific revolution there.,In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,,because it's considered blasphemous,to inquire into the mind of God. 
 Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks;,it's having the rule of law based on private property rights.,That's what makes the difference,between North America and South America.,You could turn up in North America,having signed a deed of indenture,saying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.,You just have to feed me.",But at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.,That's the land grant,on the bottom half of the slide.,That's not possible in Latin America,where land is held onto,by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.,And you can see here the huge divergence,that happens in property ownership between North and South.,Most people in rural North America,owned some land by 1900.,Hardly anyone in South America did.,That's another killer app. 
 Modern medicine in the late 19th century,began to make major breakthroughs,against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.,And this was another killer app --,the very opposite of a killer,,because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.,It even did that,in the European empires.,Even in places like Senegal,,beginning in the early 20th century,,there were major breakthroughs in public health,,and life expectancy began to rise.,It doesn't rise any faster,after these countries become independent.,The empires weren't all bad. 
 The consumer society is what you need,for the Industrial Revolution to have a point.,You need people to want to wear tons of clothes.,You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;,I guarantee it.,That's the consumer society,,and it propels economic growth,more than even technological change itself.,Japan was the first non-Western society,to embrace it.,The alternative,,which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,,was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.,Very few Indians today,wish that India had gone down,Mahatma Gandhi's road. 
 Finally, the work ethic.,Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.,He was wrong.,Any culture can get the work ethic,if the institutions are there,to create the incentive to work.,We know this,because today the work ethic,is no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.,In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.,Today, the average Korean,works a thousand hours more a year,than the average German --,a thousand.,And this is part,of a really extraordinary phenomenon,,and that is the end of the Great Divergence. 
 Who's got the work ethic now?,Take a look at mathematical attainment,by 15 year-olds.,At the top of the international league table,according to the latest PISA study,,is the Shanghai district of China.,The gap between Shanghai,and the United Kingdom and the United States,is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.,and Albania and Tunisia.,You probably assume,that because the iPhone was designed in California,but assembled in China,that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.,You're wrong.,In terms of patents,,there's no question that the East is ahead.,Not only has Japan been ahead for some time,,South Korea has gone into third place,,and China is just about to overtake Germany.,Why?,Because the killer apps can be downloaded.,It's open source.,Any society can adopt these institutions,,and when they do,,they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 --,only faster. 
 This is the Great Reconvergence,,and it's the biggest story of your lifetime.,Because it's on your watch that this is happening.,It's our generation,that is witnessing the end of Western predominance.,The average American used to be more than 20 times richer,than the average Chinese.,Now it's just five times,,and soon it will be 2.5 times. 
 So I want to end with three questions,for the future billions,,just ahead of 2016,,when the United States will lose its place,as number one economy to China.,The first is, can you delete these apps,,and are we in the process of doing so,in the Western world?,The second question is,,does the sequencing of the download matter?,And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?,One obvious implication of modern economic history,is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy,before you've established,secure private property rights.,Warning: that may not work.,And third, can China do without,killer app number three?,That's the one that John Locke systematized,when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights,and the protection of law.,That's the basis,for the Western model,of representative government.,Now this picture shows the demolition,of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio,in Shanghai earlier this year.,He's now free again,,having been detained, as you know, for some time.,But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt. 
 Winston Churchill once defined civilization,in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.,And I think these words really nail it:,"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.,It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,,the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,,give place to parliaments where laws are made,,and independent courts of justice,in which over long periods those laws are maintained.,That is civilization --,and in its soil grow continually,freedom, comfort and culture,",what all TEDsters care about most.,"When civilization reigns in any country,,a wider and less harassed life,is afforded to the masses of the people.",That's so true. 
 I don't think the decline of Western civilization,is inevitable,,because I don't think history operates,in this kind of life-cycle model,,beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's,"Course of Empire" paintings.,That's not the way history works.,That's not the way the West rose,,and I don't think it's the way the West will fall.,The West may collapse very suddenly.,Complex civilizations do that,,because they operate, most of the time,,on the edge of chaos.,That's one of the most profound insights,to come out of the historical study of complex institutions,like civilizations.,No, we may hang on,,despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,,despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic,and other parts of our historical mojo.,But one thing is for sure,,the Great Divergence,is over, folks. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Niall,,I am just curious,about your take on the other region of the world that's booming,,which is Latin America.,What's your view on that? 
 Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking,about the rise of the East;,I'm talking about the rise of the Rest,,and that includes South America.,I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,,"Hey, is South America part of the West?",He was an expert in Latin American history.,He said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that.",That tells you something really important.,I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,,but also Chile,,which was in many ways the one that led the way,in transforming the institutions of economic life,,there's a very bright future indeed.,So my story really is,as much about that convergence in the Americas,as it's a convergence story in Eurasia. 
 BG: And there is this impression,that North America and Europe,are not really paying attention,to these trends.,Mostly they're worried about each other.,The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.,The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.,And that's all we seem to be caring about recently. 
 NF: I think the fiscal crisis,that we see in the developed World right now -- both sides of the Atlantic --,is essentially the same thing,taking different forms,in terms of political culture.,And it's a crisis that has its structural facet --,it's partly to do with demographics.,But it's also, of course, to do with the massive crisis,that followed excessive leverage,,excessive borrowing in the private sector.,That crisis,,which has been the focus of so much attention, including by me,,I think is an epiphenomenon.,The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon,,which has just accelerated,this huge shift,,which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy.,I think that's its real importance. 
 BG: Niall, thank you. (NF: Thank you very much, Bruno.) 
 (Applause)The oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet.,And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right,when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet,Planet Ocean.,And the oceans are hugely productive,,as you can see by the satellite image,of photosynthesis, the production of new life.,In fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth,as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe.,In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth,,and much of it we don't know about.,But I'll tell you some of that today.,That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction,that we do from the ocean.,That's about 10 percent of our global needs,and 100 percent of some island nations. 
 If you were to descend,into the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable,,it would quickly become pitch black,,interrupted only by pinpoints of light,from bioluminescent organisms.,And if you turn the lights on,,you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by,,because those are the denizens of the deep,,the things that live in the deep ocean.,And eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view.,This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface,than all other habitats combined.,And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars,than we do about this habitat,,despite the fact that we have yet to extract,a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water,from those bodies. 
 And so 10 years ago,,an international program began called the Census of Marine Life,,which set out to try and improve our understanding,of life in the global oceans.,It involved 17 different projects around the world.,As you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.,And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage,that it managed to achieve.,It all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel,,met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts,where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute.,And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity,and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.,Well, from that discussion grew this program,that involved 2,700 scientists,from more than 80 countries around the world,who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions,at a combined cost of 650 million dollars,to study the distribution, diversity and abundance,of life in the global ocean. 
 And so what did we find?,We found spectacular new species,,the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked --,from the shoreline to the abyss,,form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between.,And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life,,but rather the taxonomic specialists,who can identify and catalog these species,that became the limiting step.,They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.,There are actually four to five new species,described everyday for the oceans.,And as I say, it could be a much larger number. 
 Now, I come from Newfoundland in Canada --,It's an island off the east coast of that continent --,where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters,in human history.,And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish.,It's around 1900.,Now, when I was a boy of about his age,,I would go out fishing with my grandfather,and we would catch fish about half that size.,And I thought that was the norm,,because I had never seen fish like this.,If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,,if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge,,it would be half that size still.,So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines.,Our expectations of what the oceans can produce,is something that we don't really appreciate,because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes. 
 Now most of us, and I would say me included,,think that human exploitation of the oceans,really only became very serious,in the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so.,The census actually tried to look back in time,,using every source of information they could get their hands on.,And so anything from restaurant menus,to monastery records to ships' logs,to see what the oceans looked like.,Because science data really goes back,to, at best, World War II, for the most part.,And so what they found, in fact,,is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.,And so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration.,So fishermen could only catch,what they could either eat or sell that day.,But the Romans developed salting.,And with salting,,it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances.,And so began industrial fishing. 
 And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have,of what sort of loss we've had,relative to pre-human impacts on the ocean.,They range from 65 to 98 percent,for these major groups of organisms,,as shown in the dark blue bars.,Now for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect --,for example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds --,there is some recovery.,So it's not all hopeless.,But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting. 
 Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.,It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.,And so this is a photograph from the 1950s.,I want you to notice the scale on the slide,,because when you see the same picture from the 1980s,,we see the fish are much smaller,and we're also seeing a change,in terms of the composition of those fish.,By 2007, the catch was actually laughable,in terms of the size for a trophy fish.,But this is no laughing matter.,The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity,and we're responsible for it. 
 So what's left? Actually quite a lot.,There's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them.,And I want to start with a bit on technology,,because, of course, this is a TED Conference,and you want to hear something on technology.,So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean,are remotely operated vehicles.,So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor,where they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom.,So a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise,and I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict.,But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home,with my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand,,and I could tell the pilot, "I want a sample right there.",And that's exactly what the pilot did for me.,That's the sort of technology that's available today,that really wasn't available even a decade ago.,So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats,that are very far from the surface,and very far from light. 
 And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans,is acoustics, or sound waves.,And the advantage of sound waves,is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.,And so we can send out sound waves,,they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.,And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.,One would send out sound waves that would bounce back.,They would be received by a second ship,,and that would give us very precise estimates, in this case,,of 250 billion herring,in a period of about a minute.,And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island.,And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool,,because knowing how many fish are there is really critical. 
 We can also use satellite tags,to track animals as they move through the oceans.,And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe,,such as this elephant seal,,it's an opportunity to send data back to shore,and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean.,And so from that we can produce these tracks.,For example, the dark blue,shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific.,Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful,,but stick with me nonetheless. 
 For animals that don't surface,,we have something called pop-up tags,,which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets.,And then at some period of time,it pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore.,Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools.,And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways,,these hot spots in the ocean,,that should be real priority areas,for ocean conservation. 
 Now one of the other things that you may think about,is that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they're scanned.,And so there's a barcode on that product,that tells the computer exactly what the product is.,Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.,And what barcoding does,is use a specific gene called CO1,that's consistent within a species, but varies among species.,And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify,which species are which,even if they look similar to each other,,but may be biologically quite different. 
 Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this,is the story of two young women, high school students in New York City,,who worked with the census.,They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City,and they barcoded it.,Well what they found was mislabeled fish.,So for example,,they found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable,,was in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish.,They also found an endangered species,sold as a common one.,So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with,and also what we're eating. 
 The Ocean Biogeographic Information System,is the database for all the census data.,It's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish.,And it contains all the data from the census,plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.,And so what you can do with that,is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans.,What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.,This is where our sampling effort has concentrated.,Now what you can see,is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic,,in the North Sea in particular,,and also the east coast of North America fairly well.,That's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region.,The cold colors, the blue and the black,,show areas where we have almost no data.,So even after a 10-year census,,there are large areas that still remain unexplored. 
 Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico,who decided really as a labor of love,to pull together all the knowledge they could,about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico.,And so they put this together, a list of all the species,,where they're known to occur,,and it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise.,But then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill.,So all of a sudden, this labor of love,for no obvious economic reason,has become a critical piece of information,in terms of how that system is going to recover, how long it will take,and how the lawsuits,and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years,are likely to be resolved. 
 So what did we find?,Well, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that.,But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries,from the census.,So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity?,Where do we find the most species of ocean life?,And what we find if we plot up the well-known species,is this sort of a distribution.,And what we see is that for coastal tags,,for those organisms that live near the shoreline,,they're most diverse in the tropics.,This is something we've actually known for a while,,so it's not a real breakthrough. 
 What is really exciting though,is that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast,,are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.,This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use,if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve.,You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.,And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable. 
 Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census,are things that are small and hard to see,,that certainly wasn't always the case.,For example, while it's hard to believe,that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists,,it did until a few years ago,when South African fishermen requested an export permit,and scientists realized that this was something new to science.,Similarly this Golden V kelp,collected in Alaska just below the low water mark,is probably a new species.,Even though it's three meters long,,it actually, again, eluded science.,Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.,But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,,so it was a lot harder to find.,But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.,This particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp,,it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago --,at least it was, until the census discovered,it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.,And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness,,can hide secrets for a very long time.,So, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out. 
 If we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically.,And so one of the records that we had,was this sooty shearwater, which undergoes these spectacular migrations,all the way from New Zealand,all the way up to Alaska and back again,in search of endless summer,as they complete their life cycles.,We also talked about the White Shark Cafe.,This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge.,We don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know.,That's a question for the future. 
 One of the things that we're taught in high school,is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.,Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size,,not terribly charismatic.,But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.,But the really interesting thing about it,is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered,that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments,in the deep Mediterranean Sea.,So now they know that, in fact,,animals can live without oxygen, at least some of them,,and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions. 
 If you were to suck all the water out of the ocean,,this is what you'd be left behind with,,and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor.,Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles,and not much biomass in between.,We found life in the extremes.,And so there were new species that were found,that live inside ice,and help to support an ice-based food web. 
 And we also found this spectacular yeti crab,that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island.,And this particular species,really captured the public's attention.,We also found the deepest vents known yet -- 5,000 meters --,the hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius --,vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic,where none had been found before.,So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable. 
 Now in terms of the unknowns, there are many.,And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them,very quickly for you.,First of all, we might ask, how many fishes in the sea?,We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean,other than marine mammals.,And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery,how many more species we're likely to discover.,And from that, we actually calculate,that we know about 16,500 marine species,and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go.,So we've done pretty well.,We've got about 75 percent of the fish,,maybe as much as 90 percent.,But the fishes, as I say, are the best known. 
 So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.,Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper,that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology.,And what is does is predict how many more species there are,on land and in the ocean.,And what they found,is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean.,That means 91 percent, even after the census,,still remain to be discovered.,And so that turns out to be about two million species,once all is said and done.,So we still have quite a lot of work to do,in terms of unknowns. 
 Now this bacterium,is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile.,And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.,And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye.,But you can imagine the biomass that represents.,But the really intriguing thing about the microbes,is just how diverse they are.,A single drop of seawater,could contain 160 different types of microbes.,And the oceans themselves,are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types.,So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there?,We actually don't know. 
 The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census,is the role of global science.,And so as we see in this image of light during the night,,there are lots of areas of the Earth,where human development is much greater,and other areas where it's much less,,but between them we see large dark areas,of relatively unexplored ocean.,The other point I'd like to make about this,is that this ocean's interconnected.,Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries;,they move where they will.,And so the importance then of global collaboration,becomes all the more important. 
 We've lost a lot of paradise.,For example, these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea,are now effectively gone.,There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean,,which collected more garbage than they did animals.,And that's the deep sea, that's the environment that we consider to be,among the most pristine left on Earth.,And there are a lot of other pressures.,Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with,,as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs.,On the scale of decades, in our lifetimes,,we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs. 
 And I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited,,going through this litany of concerns about the ocean,,but I want to end on a more positive note.,And so the grand challenge then,is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left,,because there is still spectacular beauty.,And the oceans are so productive,,there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans,that we really need to, even from a selfish perspective,,try to do better than we have in the past.,So we need to recognize those hot spots,and do our best to protect them. 
 When we look at pictures like this, they take our breath away,,in addition to helping to give us breath,by the oxygen that the oceans provide.,Census scientists worked in the rain, they worked in the cold,,they worked under water and they worked above water,trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery,,the still vast unknown,,the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life.,So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile,,whether you're a stockbroker in New York City,or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh,,the oceans matter.,And as the oceans go so shall we. 
 Thanks for listening. 
 (Applause)I'm here to talk to you,about the economic invisibility of nature.,The bad news,is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,,so those invoices don't get issued.,But we need to do something about this problem.,I began my life as a markets professional,and continued to take an interest,,but most of my recent effort,has been looking at the value,of what comes to human beings from nature,,and which doesn't get priced by the markets. 
 A project called TEEB was started in 2007,,and it was launched by a group of environment ministers,of the G8+5.,And their basic inspiration,was a stern review of Lord Stern.,They asked themselves a question:,If economics could make such a convincing case,for early action on climate change,,well why can't the same be done for conservation?,Why can't an equivalent case be made,for nature?,And the answer is: Yeah, it can.,But it's not that straightforward.,Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.,It exists in many layers,,ecosystems, species and genes across many scales --,international, national, local, community --,and doing for nature,what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy. 
 And yet, we began.,We began the project with an interim report,,which quickly pulled together,a lot of information that had been collected on the subject,by many, many researchers.,And amongst our compiled results,was the startling revelation,that, in fact, we were losing natural capital --,the benefits that flow from nature to us.,We were losing it at an extraordinary rate --,in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth,of natural capital.,This came out in 2008,,which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown,that we had lost financial capital,of the order of two and a half trillion dollars.,So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.,We then have gone on since,to present for [the] international community,,for governments,,for local governments and for business,and for people, for you and me,,a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,,which address the economic invisibility of nature,and describe what can be done to solve it. 
 What is this about?,A picture that you're familiar with --,the Amazon rainforests.,It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,,but what people don't really know,is this also is a rain factory.,Because the northeastern trade winds,,as they go over the Amazonas,,effectively gather the water vapor.,Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor,is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,,and eventually precipitates in the form of rain,across the La Plata Basin.,This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,,effectively feeds an agricultural economy,of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth,in Latin America.,But the question arises: Okay, so how much,do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina,and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil,pay for that vital input to that economy,to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?,And the answer is zilch,,exactly zero.,That's the economic invisibility of nature.,That can't keep going on,,because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.,Economics has become the currency of policy.,And unless we address,this invisibility,,we are going to get the results that we are seeing,,which is a gradual degradation and loss,of this valuable natural asset. 
 It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.,No matter what level you look at,,whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,,we see the same problem again and again.,So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests,at an ecosystem level.,At the species level,,it's been estimated that insect-based pollination,,bees pollinating fruit and so on,,is something like 190 billion dollars-worth.,That's something like eight percent,of the total agricultural output globally.,It completely passes below the radar screen.,But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?,Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,,60 percent of medicines were prospected,,were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.,Once again, most of that doesn't get paid. 
 And that brings me to another aspect of this,,which is, to whom should this get paid?,That genetic material,probably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,,to a local community of poor people,who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,,which then became the medicine.,They were the ones that didn't get paid.,And if you look at the species level,,you saw about fish.,Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant,that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,,the artisanal fisher folk,and those who fish for their own livelihoods,,to feed their families.,Something like a billion people depend on fish,,the quantity of fish in the oceans.,A billion people depend on fish,for their main source for animal protein.,And at this rate at which we are losing fish,,it is a human problem of enormous dimensions,,a health problem,of a kind we haven't seen before.,And finally, at the ecosystem level,,whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,,or whether it is the ability of poor farmers,to go out and gather leaf litter,for their cattle and goats,,or whether it's the ability of their wives,to go and collect fuel wood from the forest,,it is actually the poor,who depend most on these ecosystem services. 
 We did estimates in our study,that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,,even though ecosystem services --,these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free --,they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP --,two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent --,but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,,the answers are more like,45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent.,That's the difference.,Because these are important benefits for the poor.,And you can't really have a proper model for development,if at the same time you're destroying or allowing,the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,,which is your development asset,,that is ecological infrastructure. 
 How bad can things get?,Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.,It's basically a measure,of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average,of biomass of various species are around.,The green represents the percentage.,If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.,If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.,And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,,the pre-industrial era, 1750. 
 Now I'm going to show you,how business as usual will affect this.,And just watch the change in colors,in India, China, Europe,,sub-Saharan Africa,as we move on and consume global biomass,at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.,See that again.,The only places that remain green -- and that's not good news --,is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,,like the tundra and like the Sahara.,But that doesn't help because there were very few species,and volume of biomass there in the first place.,This is the challenge.,The reason this is happening,boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,,which is our inability to perceive the difference,between public benefits,and private profits.,We tend to constantly ignore public wealth,simply because it is in the common wealth,,it's common goods. 
 And here's an example from Thailand,where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much --,it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured --,compared to its value as a shrimp farm,,which is more like $9,600,,there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves,and convert them to shrimp farms.,But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,,almost 8,000 of those dollars,are, in fact, subsidies.,So you compare the two sides of the coin,and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.,That's not that hard. 
 But on the other hand, if you start measuring,,how much would it actually cost,to restore the land of the shrimp farm,back to productive use?,Once salt deposition and chemical deposition,has had its effects,,that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.,And if you see the benefits of the mangrove,in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get,and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,,that provide fish for the poor,,that answer is more like $11,000.,So now look at the different lens.,If you look at the lens of public wealth,as against the lens of private profits,,you get a completely different answer,,which is clearly conservation makes more sense,,and not destruction. 
 So is this just a story from South Thailand?,Sorry, this is a global story.,And here's what the same calculation looks like,,which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years --,by a group called TRUCOST.,And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,,what are the externalities?,In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?,This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,,which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.,It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,,health cost and so on.,Use of freshwater.,If you drill water to make coke near a village farm,,that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community. 
 Can we stop this, and how?,I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.,Basically the stuff of life is natural capital,,and we need to recognize and build that into our systems.,When we measure GDP,as a measure of economic performance at the national level,,we don't include our biggest asset at the country level.,When we measure corporate performances,,we don't include our impacts on nature,and what our business costs society.,That has to stop.,In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.,I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.,That was in the early 2000s,when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth,as the means forward --,looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent,and wondering, why can we do the same?,And a few friends of mine and I,decided this doesn't make sense.,This is going to create more cost to society and more losses.,So we decided to do a massive set of calculations,and started producing green accounts for India and its states.,That's how my interests began,and went to the TEEB project.,Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.,And the World Bank has acknowledged this,and they've started a project called WAVES --,Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services. 
 But calculating this at the next level,,that means at the business sector level, is important.,And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.,We've done this for a very difficult case,,which was for deforestation in China.,This is important, because in China in 1997,,the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months,causing severe loss of agriculture output,and pain and loss to society.,Just a year later the Yangtze flooded,,causing something like 5,500 deaths.,So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.,It was associated largely with the construction industry. 
 And the Chinese government responded sensibly,and placed a ban on felling.,A retrospective on 40 years,shows that if we had accounted for these costs --,the cost of loss of topsoil,,the cost of loss of waterways,,the lost productivity, the loss to local communities,as a result of all these factors,,desertification and so on --,those costs are almost twice as much,as the market price of timber.,So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace,ought to have been three-times what it was,had it reflected the true pain and the costs,to the society within China.,Of course, after the event one can be wise. 
 The way to do this is to do it on a company basis,,to take leadership forward,,and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,,and to disclose these answers.,Someone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,,is it Unilever or is it P&G,when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?",And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,,good though they are and professional though they are,,do not calculate or disclose their externalities. 
 But if we look at companies like PUMA --,Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,,once challenged me at a function,,saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.,Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.,He's basically worked the cost to PUMA.,PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,,300 million dollars of profits,,200 million dollars after tax,,94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.,Now that's not a happy situation for them,,but they have the confidence and the courage,to come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.,We are measuring it because we know,that you cannot manage what you do not measure." 
 That's an example, I think, for us to look at,and for us to draw comfort from.,If more companies did this,,and if more sectors engaged this as sectors,,you could have analysts, business analysts,,and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs,actually look and compare the social performance of companies.,Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.,This can be done.,And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.,has already set up a coalition to do this,,an international coalition. 
 The other favorite, if you like, solution for me,is the creation of green carbon markets.,And by the way, these are my favorites --,externalities calculation and green carbon markets.,TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions,including protected area evaluation,and payments for ecosystem services,and eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.,What's green carbon?,Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.,It's about energy emissions.,The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.,It's not doing too well. We've over-issued.,A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,,you get what you see, declining prices.,But that's all about energy and industry. 
 But what we're missing is also some other emissions,like black carbon, that is soot.,What we're also missing is blue carbon,,which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon --,more than 55 percent.,Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions,from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,,is more or less balanced.,In fact, what's being absorbed,is something like 25 percent of our emissions,,which then leads to acidification,or lower alkalinity in oceans.,More of that in a minute. 
 And finally, there's deforestation,,and there's emission of methane,from agriculture.,Green carbon,,which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,,and blue carbon,together comprise 25 percent of our emissions.,We have the means already in our hands,,through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus --,a scheme for the reduced emissions,from deforestation and forest degradation.,And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each,towards Indonesia and Brazil,to implement this Red Plus scheme.,So we actually have some movement forward.,But the thing is to do a lot more of that. 
 Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?,Well I'm afraid not.,There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.,As you can see,,they cut across the entire globe,all the way from Micronesia,across Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar,and to the West of the Caribbean.,These red dots, these red areas,,basically provide the food and livelihood,for more than half a billion people.,So that's almost an eighth of society.,And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost --,and scientists tell us,that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million,is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs --,we are not only risking the extinction,of the entire coral species, the warm water corals,,we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,,but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods,of more than 500 million people,who live in the developing world in poor countries. 
 So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million,and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,,what we have done is we've made an ethical choice.,We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society,to not have coral reefs.,Well what I will say to you in parting,is that we may have done that.,Let's think about it and what it means,,but please, let's not do more of that.,Because mother nature only has that much,in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital.,I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Cholera was reported in Haiti,for the first time in over 50 years,last October.,There was no way to predict,how far it would spread through water supplies,and how bad the situation would get.,And not knowing where help was needed,always ensured that help was in short supply,in the areas that needed it most. 
 We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms,before they take innocent lives,and cause irreversible damage,,but we still can't do that with water,,and here's why.,Right now, if you want to test water in the field,,you need a trained technician,,expensive equipment like this,,and you have to wait about a day,for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.,It's too slow,to get a picture of conditions on the ground,before they change,,too expensive to implement,in all the places that require testing.,And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile,,people still need to drink water.,Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak,didn't come from testing water;,it came from forms like this,,which documented all the people,we failed to help. 
 Countless lives have been saved,by canaries in coalmines --,a simple and invaluable way,for miners to know whether they're safe.,I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem,with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.,We think there's a simpler solution to this problem --,one that can be used,by people who face conditions like this everyday. 
 It's in its early stages,,but this is what it looks like right now.,We call it the Water Canary.,It's a fast, cheap device,that answers an important question:,Is this water contaminated?,It doesn't require any special training.,And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place,,it uses light.,That means there's no waiting,for chemical reactions to take place,,no need to use reagents that can run out,and no need to be an expert,to get actionable information. 
 To test water, you simply insert a sample,and, within seconds,,it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water,,or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.,This will make it possible,for anyone to collect life-saving information,and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold. 
 We're also, on top of that,,integrating wireless networking,into an affordable device,with GPS and GSM.,What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers,to be mapped in real time.,With enough users,,maps like this will make it possible,to take preventive action,,containing hazards before they turn into emergencies,that take years to recover from.,And then, instead of taking days,to disseminate this information to the people who need it most,,it can happen automatically.,We've seen how distributed networks,,big data and information,can transform society.,I think it's time for us to apply them to water. 
 Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field,and to open-source the hardware,so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation,,so we can tackle this problem together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What I want to talk to you about,is what we can learn from studying the genomes,of living people,and extinct humans.,But before doing that,,I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know:,that our genomes, our genetic material,,are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes,in the form of DNA,,which is this famous double-helical molecule.,And the genetic information,is contained in the form of a sequence,of four bases,abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G.,And the information is there twice --,one on each strand --,which is important,,because when new cells are formed, these strands come apart,,new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates,in an almost perfect process. 
 But nothing, of course, in nature,is totally perfect,,so sometimes an error is made,and a wrong letter is built in.,And we can then see the result,of such mutations,when we compare DNA sequences,among us here in the room, for example.,If we compare my genome to the genome of you,,approximately every 1,200, 1,300 letters,will differ between us.,And these mutations accumulate,approximately as a function of time.,So if we add in a chimpanzee here, we will see more differences.,Approximately one letter in a hundred,will differ from a chimpanzee. 
 And if you're then interested in the history,of a piece of DNA, or the whole genome,,you can reconstruct the history of the DNA,with those differences you observe.,And generally we depict our ideas about this history,in the form of trees like this.,In this case, it's very simple.,The two human DNA sequences,go back to a common ancestor quite recently.,Farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees.,And because these mutations,happen approximately as a function of time,,you can transform these differences,to estimates of time,,where the two humans, typically,,will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago,,and with the chimpanzees,,it will be in the order of five million years ago. 
 So what has now happened in the last few years,is that there are account technologies around,that allow you to see many, many pieces of DNA very quickly.,So we can now, in a matter of hours,,determine a whole human genome.,Each of us, of course, contains two human genomes --,one from our mothers and one from our fathers.,And they are around three billion such letters long.,And we will find that the two genomes in me,,or one genome of mine we want to use,,will have about three million differences,in the order of that.,And what you can then also begin to do,is to say, "How are these genetic differences,distributed across the world?",And if you do that,,you find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa.,And if you look outside Africa,,you actually find less genetic variation.,This is surprising, of course,,because in the order of six to eight times fewer people,live in Africa than outside Africa.,Yet the people inside Africa,have more genetic variation. 
 Moreover, almost all these genetic variants,we see outside Africa,have closely related DNA sequences,that you find inside Africa.,But if you look in Africa,,there is a component of the genetic variation,that has no close relatives outside.,So a model to explain this,is that a part of the African variation, but not all of it,,[has] gone out and colonized the rest of the world.,And together with the methods to date these genetic differences,,this has led to the insight,that modern humans --,humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me --,evolved in Africa, quite recently,,between 100 and 200,000 years ago.,And later, between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so,,went out of Africa,to colonize the rest of the world. 
 So what I often like to say,is that, from a genomic perspective,,we are all Africans.,We either live inside Africa today,,or in quite recent exile.,Another consequence,of this recent origin of modern humans,is that genetic variants,are generally distributed widely in the world,,in many places,,and they tend to vary as gradients,,from a bird's-eye perspective at least.,And since there are many genetic variants,,and they have different such gradients,,this means that if we determine a DNA sequence --,a genome from one individual --,we can quite accurately estimate,where that person comes from,,provided that its parents or grandparents,haven't moved around too much. 
 But does this then mean,,as many people tend to think,,that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people --,on different continents, for example?,Well we can begin to ask those questions also.,There is, for example, a project that's underway,to sequence a thousand individuals --,their genomes -- from different parts of the world.,They've sequenced 185 Africans,from two populations in Africa.,[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people,in Europe and in China.,And we can begin to say how much variance do we find,,how many letters that vary,in at least one of those individual sequences.,And it's a lot: 38 million variable positions. 
 But we can then ask: Are there any absolute differences,between Africans and non-Africans?,Perhaps the biggest difference,most of us would imagine existed.,And with absolute difference --,and I mean a difference,where people inside Africa at a certain position,,where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter,,and everybody outside Africa has another letter.,And the answer to that, among those millions of differences,,is that there is not a single such position.,This may be surprising.,Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so.,So we can relax the criterion a bit,and say: How many positions do we find,where 95 percent of people in Africa have,one variant,,95 percent another variant,,and the number of that is 12. 
 So this is very surprising.,It means that when we look at people,and see a person from Africa,and a person from Europe or Asia,,we cannot, for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy,,predict what the person would carry.,And only for 12 positions,can we hope to be 95 percent right.,This may be surprising,,because we can, of course, look at these people,and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from.,So what this means now,is that those traits we then look at,and so readily see --,facial features, skin color, hair structure --,are not determined by single genes with big effects,,but are determined by many different genetic variants,that seem to vary in frequency,between different parts of the world. 
 There is another thing with those traits,that we so easily observe in each other,that I think is worthwhile to consider,,and that is that, in a very literal sense,,they're really on the surface of our bodies.,They are what we just said --,facial features, hair structure, skin color.,There are also a number of features,that vary between continents like that,that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest,,or that have to do,with how our immune systems deal with microbes,that try to invade our bodies.,But so those are all parts of our bodies,where we very directly interact with our environment,,in a direct confrontation, if you like.,It's easy to imagine,how particularly those parts of our bodies,were quickly influenced by selection from the environment,and shifted frequencies of genes,that are involved in them.,But if we look on other parts of our bodies,where we don't directly interact with the environment --,our kidneys, our livers, our hearts --,there is no way to say,,by just looking at these organs,,where in the world they would come from. 
 So there's another interesting thing,that comes from this realization,that humans have a recent common origin in Africa,,and that is that when those humans emerged,around 100,000 years ago or so,,they were not alone on the planet.,There were other forms of humans around,,most famously perhaps, Neanderthals --,these robust forms of humans,,compared to the left here,with a modern human skeleton on the right --,that existed in Western Asia and Europe,since several hundreds of thousands of years.,So an interesting question is,,what happened when we met?,What happened to the Neanderthals? 
 And to begin to answer such questions,,my research group -- since over 25 years now --,works on methods to extract DNA,from remains of Neanderthals,and extinct animals,that are tens of thousands of years old.,So this involves a lot of technical issues,in how you extract the DNA,,how you convert it to a form you can sequence.,You have to work very carefully,to avoid contamination of experiments,with DNA from yourself.,And this then, in conjunction with these methods,that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly,,allowed us last year,to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome,,so that any one of you,can now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome,,or at least on the 55 percent of it,that we've been able to reconstruct so far.,And you can begin to compare it to the genomes,of people who live today. 
 And one question,that you may then want to ask,is, what happened when we met?,Did we mix or not?,And the way to ask that question,is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe,and compare it to genomes,of people who live today.,So we then look,to do this with pairs of individuals,,starting with two Africans,,looking at the two African genomes,,finding places where they differ from each other,,and in each case ask: What is a Neanderthal like?,Does it match one African or the other African?,We would expect there to be no difference,,because Neanderthals were never in Africa.,They should be equal, have no reason to be closer,to one African than another African.,And that's indeed the case.,Statistically speaking, there is no difference,in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other.,But this is different,if we now look at the European individual and an African.,Then, significantly more often,,does a Neanderthal match the European,rather than the African.,The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual,versus an African,,the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often.,This may also be surprising,because the Neanderthals were never in China. 
 So the model we've proposed to explain this,is that when modern humans came out of Africa,sometime after 100,000 years ago,,they met Neanderthals.,Presumably, they did so first in the Middle East,,where there were Neanderthals living.,If they then mixed with each other there,,then those modern humans,that became the ancestors,of everyone outside Africa,carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome,to the rest of the world.,So that today, the people living outside Africa,have about two and a half percent of their DNA,from Neanderthals. 
 So having now a Neanderthal genome,on hand as a reference point,and having the technologies,to look at ancient remains,and extract the DNA,,we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world.,And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia,in the Altai Mountains,at a place called Denisova,,a cave site in this mountain here,,where archeologists in 2008,found a tiny little piece of bone --,this is a copy of it --,that they realized came from the last phalanx,of a little finger of a pinky of a human.,And it was well enough preserved,so we could determine the DNA from this individual,,even to a greater extent,than for the Neanderthals actually,,and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome,and to people today.,And we found that this individual,shared a common origin for his DNA sequences,with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago.,And further back, 800,000 years ago,is there a common origin,with present day humans. 
 So this individual comes from a population,that shares an origin with Neanderthals,,but far back and then have a long independent history.,We call this group of humans,,that we then described for the first time,from this tiny, tiny little piece of bone,,the Denisovans,,after this place where they were first described.,So we can then ask for Denisovans,the same things as for the Neanderthals:,Did they mix with ancestors of present day people?,If we ask that question,,and compare the Denisovan genome,to people around the world,,we surprisingly find,no evidence of Denisovan DNA,in any people living even close to Siberia today.,But we do find it in Papua New Guinea,and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific.,So this presumably means,that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past,,since we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians,were ever in Siberia. 
 So from studying,these genomes of extinct humans,,we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like,when modern humans started coming out of Africa.,In the West, there were Neanderthals;,in the East, there were Denisovans --,maybe other forms of humans too,that we've not yet described.,We don't know quite where the borders between these people were,,but we know that in Southern Siberia,,there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans,at least at some time in the past.,Then modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa,,came out of Africa, presumably in the Middle East.,They meet Neanderthals, mix with them,,continue to spread over the world,,and somewhere in Southeast Asia,,they meet Denisovans and mix with them,and continue on out into the Pacific.,And then these earlier forms of humans disappear,,but they live on a little bit today,in some of us --,in that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA,from Neanderthals,,and people in Melanesia,actually have an additional five percent approximately,from the Denisovans. 
 Does this then mean that there is after all,some absolute difference,between people outside Africa and inside Africa,in that people outside Africa,have this old component in their genome,from these extinct forms of humans,,whereas Africans do not?,Well I don't think that is the case.,Presumably, modern humans,emerged somewhere in Africa.,They spread across Africa also, of course,,and there were older, earlier forms of humans there.,And since we mixed elsewhere,,I'm pretty sure that one day,,when we will perhaps have a genome,of also these earlier forms in Africa,,we will find that they have also mixed,with early modern humans in Africa. 
 So to sum up,,what have we learned from studying genomes,of present day humans,and extinct humans?,We learn perhaps many things,,but one thing that I find sort of important to mention,is that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed.,We mixed with these earlier forms of humans,,wherever we met them,,and we mixed with each other ever since. 
 Thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)So today, I would like to talk with you,about bionics,,which is the popular term,for the science of replacing part of a living organism,with a mechatronic device, or a robot.,It is essentially,the stuff of life meets machine.,And specifically, I'd like to talk with you,about how bionics is evolving,for people with arm amputations. 
 This is our motivation.,Arm amputation causes a huge disability.,I mean, the functional impairment is clear.,Our hands are amazing instruments.,And when you lose one, far less both,,it's a lot harder to do the things,we physically need to do.,There's also a huge emotional impact.,And actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic,dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients,as with the physical disability.,And finally, there's a profound social impact.,We talk with our hands.,We greet with our hands.,And we interact with the physical world with our hands.,And when they're missing,,it's a barrier.,Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma,,with things like industrial accidents,,motor vehicle collisions,or, very poignantly, war.,There are also some children who are born without arms,,called congenital limb deficiency. 
 Unfortunately, we don't do great,with upper-limb prosthetics.,There are two general types.,They're called body-powered prostheses,,which were invented just after the Civil War,,refined in World War I and World War II.,Here you see a patent,for an arm in 1912.,It's not a lot different,than the one you see on my patient.,They work by harnessing shoulder power.,So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.,And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook,or bend an elbow.,And we still use them commonly,,because they're very robust,and relatively simple devices. 
 The state of the art,is what we call myoelectric prostheses.,These are motorized devices,that are controlled,by little electrical signals from your muscle.,Every time you contract a muscle,,it emits a little electricity,that you can record with antennae or electrodes,and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.,They work pretty well,for people who have just lost their hand,,because your hand muscles are still there.,You squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.,You open it, these muscles contract.,So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well. 
 Well how about with higher levels of amputation?,Now you've lost your arm above the elbow.,You're missing not only these muscles,,but your hand and your elbow too.,What do you do?,Well our patients have to use,very code-y systems,of using just their arm muscles,to operate robotic limbs.,We have robotic limbs.,There are several available on the market, and here you see a few.,They contain just a hand that will open and close,,a wrist rotator and an elbow.,There's no other functions.,If they did, how would we tell them what to do? 
 We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago,where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints,to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.,And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms,that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,,that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom,including movable hands.,But at the end of the day,,how do we tell these robotic arms what to do?,How do we control them?,Well we need a neural interface,,a way to connect to our nervous system,or our thought processes,so that it's intuitive, it's natural,,like for you and I. 
 Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,,going down your spinal cord,,out the nerves and to your periphery.,And your sensation's the exact opposite.,You touch yourself, there's a stimulus,that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.,When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.,Those nerves can put out command signals.,And if I tap the nerve ending,on a World War II vet,,he'll still feel his missing hand.,So you might say,,let's go to the brain,and put something in the brain to record signals,,or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.,And these are very exciting research areas,,but it's really, really hard.,You have to put in,hundreds of microscopic wires,to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers,that put out tiny signals,that are microvolts.,And it's just too hard,to use now and for my patients today. 
 So we developed a different approach.,We're using a biological amplifier,to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles.,Muscles will amplify the nerve signals,about a thousand-fold,,so that we can record them from on top of the skin,,like you saw earlier.,So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.,Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,,we still have four major nerves,that go down your arm.,And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle,and let these nerves grow into it.,Now you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.,You think, "Bend elbow,",a different section contracts.,And we can use electrodes or antennae,to pick that up and tell the arm to move.,That's the idea. 
 So this is the first man that we tried it on.,His name is Jesse Sullivan.,He's just a saint of a man --,54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire,and had both of his arms burnt so badly,they had to be amputated at the shoulder.,Jesse came to us at the RIC,to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.,I'm still using that old technology,with a bicycle cable on his right side.,And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.,On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis,with those three joints,,and he operates little pads in his shoulder,that he touches to make the arm go.,And Jesse's a good crane operator,,and he did okay by our standards. 
 He also required a revision surgery on his chest.,And that gave us the opportunity,to do targeted reinnervation.,So my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.,First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,,then we took the arm nerves,and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest,and closed him up.,And after about three months,,the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.,And after six months, the nerves grew in well,,and you could see strong contractions.,And this is what it looks like.,This is what happens when Jesse thinks,open and close his hand,,or bend or straighten your elbow.,You can see the movements on his chest,,and those little hash marks,are where we put our antennae, or electrodes.,And I challenge anybody in the room,to make their chest go like this.,His brain is thinking about his arm.,He has not learned how to do this with the chest.,There is not a learning process.,That's why it's intuitive. 
 So here's Jesse in our first little test with him.,On the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,,and he's using those switches,to move little blocks from one box to the other.,He's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it.,On the right side,,two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis --,which, by the way, is the same physical arm,,just programmed a little different --,you can see that he's much faster,and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.,And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time. 
 Then we had one of those little surprises in science.,So we're all motivated to get motor commands,to drive robotic arms.,And after a few months,,you touch Jesse on his chest,,and he felt his missing hand.,His hand sensation grew into his chest again,probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,,so the skin was right down to the muscle,and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.,So you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;,you touch it here, he feels his pinky.,He feels light touch,down to one gram of force.,He feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,,all in his missing hand,,or both his hand and his chest,,but he can attend to either.,So this is really exciting for us,,because now we have a portal,,a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,,so that he might feel what he touches,with his prosthetic hand.,Imagine sensors in the hand,coming up and pressing on this new hand skin.,So it was very exciting. 
 We've also gone on,with what was initially our primary population,of people with above-the-elbow amputations.,And here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,,just from little segments of muscle,and leave others alone,that give us our up-down signals,and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.,This was one of our first patients, Chris.,You see him with his original device,on the left there after eight months of use,,and on the right, it is two months.,He's about four or five times as fast,with this simple little performance metric. 
 All right.,So one of the best parts of my job,is working with really great patients,who are also our research collaborators.,And we're fortunate today,to have Amanda Kitts come and join us.,Please welcome Amanda Kitts. 
 (Applause) 
 So Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm? 
 Amanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.,And I was driving home from work,,and a truck was coming the opposite direction,,came over into my lane,,ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off. 
 Todd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.,And you've got one of these conventional arms.,Can you tell us how it worked? 
 AK: Well, it was a little difficult,,because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.,So for the simple little things like picking something up,,I would have to bend my elbow,,and then I would have to cocontract,to get it to change modes.,When I did that,,I had to use my bicep,to get the hand to close,,use my tricep to get it to open,,cocontract again,to get the elbow to work again. 
 TK: So it was a little slow? 
 AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.,You had to concentrate a whole lot. 
 TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later,that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,,took six more months to have all the reinnervation.,Then we fit her with a prosthesis.,And how did that work for you? 
 AK: It works good.,I was able to use my elbow,and my hand simultaneously.,I could work them just by my thoughts.,So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that. 
 TK: A little faster? 
 AK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural. 
 TK: Okay, this was my goal.,For 20 years, my goal was to let somebody,[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way,and at the same time.,And we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,,including over a dozen of our wounded warriors,in the U.S. armed services.,The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.,It's like 96 percent.,Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.,And it provides intuitive control.,Our functional testing, those little tests,,all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.,And the most important thing,is our patients have appreciated it. 
 So that was all very exciting.,But we want to do better.,There's a lot of information in those nerve signals,,and we wanted to get more.,You can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.,Can we get more out of it?,So we did some experiments,where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes,and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks --,from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm,to reaching for something --,and recorded this data.,And then we used some algorithms,that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,,called pattern recognition.,See. 
 (Laughter) 
 And here you can see, on Jesse's chest,,when he just tried to do three different things,,you can see three different patterns.,But I can't put in an electrode,and say, "Go there.",So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,,came up with this algorithm control,,which Amanda can now demonstrate. 
 AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.,I have the wrist rotation,that goes -- and it can go all the way around.,And I have the wrist flexion and extension.,And I also have the hand closed and open. 
 TK: Thank you, Amanda.,Now this is a research arm,,but it's made out of commercial components from here down,and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.,It's about seven pounds,,which is probably about what my arm would weigh,if I lost it right here.,Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda.,And in fact, it feels even heavier,,because it's not glued on the same.,She's carrying all the weight through harnesses. 
 So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,,but the control.,So we've developed a small microcomputer,that is blinking somewhere behind her back,and is operating this,all by the way she trains it,to use her individual muscle signals.,So Amanda, when you first started using this arm,,how long did it take to use it? 
 AK: It took just about probably three to four hours,to get it to train.,I had to hook it up to a computer,,so I couldn't just train it anywhere.,So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.,So now it's able to train,with just this little piece on the back.,I can wear it around.,If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.,Takes about a minute. 
 TK: So we're really excited,,because now we're getting to a clinically practical device.,And that's where our goal is --,to have something clinically pragmatic to wear.,We've also had Amanda able to use,some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.,Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.,And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.,So Amanda, you can see,,has really good control.,It's all the pattern recognition.,And it now has a hand that can do different grasps.,What we do is have the patient go all the way open,and think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?",It goes into that mode,,and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand.,Amanda, how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm? 
 AK: I was able to get four.,I had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,,I had a power grasp,and I had a fine pinch.,But my favorite one was just when the hand was open,,because I work with kids,,and so all the time you're clapping and singing,,so I was able to do that again, which was really good. 
 TK: That hand's not so good for clapping. 
 AK: Can't clap with this one. 
 TK: All right. So that's exciting,on where we may go with the better mechatronics,,if we make them good enough,to put out on the market and use in a field trial.,I want you to watch closely. 
 (Video) Claudia: Oooooh! 
 TK: That's Claudia,,and that was the first time,she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.,She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis,that then she rubbed over different surfaces,,and she could feel different textures,of sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,,as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.,She said that when she just ran it across the table,,it felt like her finger was rocking.,So that's an exciting laboratory experiment,on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation. 
 But here's another video that shows some of our challenges.,This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.,And the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle,that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.,But look at all the electrodes around it.,I've got a real estate problem.,You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,,but our little motor's making all kinds of noise,right next to my electrodes.,So we're really challenged on what we're doing there. 
 The future is bright.,We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.,So for example,,one is to get rid of my real estate problem,and get better signals.,We want to develop these little tiny capsules,about the size of a piece of risotto,that we can put into the muscles,and telemeter out the EMG signals,,so that it's not worrying about electrode contact.,And we can have the real estate open,to try more sensation feedback.,We want to build a better arm.,This arm -- they're always made for the 50th percentile male --,which means they're too big for five-eighths of the world.,So rather than a super strong or super fast arm,,we're making an arm that is --,we're starting with,,the 25th percentile female --,that will have a hand that wraps around,,opens all the way,,two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow.,So it'll be the smallest and lightest,and the smartest arm ever made.,Once we can do it that small,,it's a lot easier making them bigger. 
 So those are just some of our goals.,And we really appreciate you all being here today.,I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side,,with yesterday's theme.,So Amanda came jet-lagged,,she's using the arm,,and everything goes wrong.,There was a computer spook,,a broken wire,,a converter that sparked.,We took out a whole circuit in the hotel,and just about put on the fire alarm.,And none of those problems could I have dealt with,,but I have a really bright research team.,And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us,and worked really hard yesterday to fix it.,That's science.,And fortunately, it worked today. 
 So thank you very much. 
 (Applause)It is a dream of mankindnto fly like a bird.,Birds are very agile.,They fly, not with rotating components,,so they fly only by flapping their wings.,So we looked at the birds,,and we tried to make a modelnthat is powerful, ultralight,,and it must have excellentnaerodynamic qualities,that would fly by its ownnand only by flapping its wings. 
 So what would be better than to usenthe herring gull, in its freedom,,circling and swooping over the sea,,and to use this as a role model?,So we bring a team together.,There are generalists and also specialistsnin the field of aerodynamics,,in the field of building gliders.,And the task was to buildnan ultralight indoor-flying model,that is able to fly over your heads.,So be careful later on. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this was one issue:,to build it that lightweight,that no one would be hurt if it fell down. 
 So why do we do all this?,We are a companynin the field of automation,,and we'd like to donvery lightweight structures,because that's energy efficient,,and we'd like to learn morenabout pneumatics and air flow phenomena. 
 So I now would like younto put your seat belts on,and put your hats on.,So maybe we'll try it once --,to fly a SmartBird. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 (Cheers) 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 (Applause) 
 So we can now look at the SmartBird.,So here is one without a skin.,We have a wingspan of about two meters.,The length is one meter and six,,and the weight is only 450 grams.,And it is all out of carbon fiber.,In the middle we have a motor,,and we also have a gear in it,,and we use the gearnto transfer the circulation of the motor.,So within the motor,nwe have three Hall sensors,,so we know exactly where the wing is.,And if we now beat up and down -- 
 (Mechanical sounds) 
 We have the possibilitynto fly like a bird.,So if you go down, you haventhe large area of propulsion,,and if you go up,,the wings are not that large,,and it is easier to get up. 
 So, the next thing we did,,or the challenges we did,,was to coordinate this movement.,We have to turn it, go up and go down.,We have a split wing.,With the split wing,,we get the lift at the upper wing,,and we get the propulsionnat the lower wing.,Also, we see how we measurenthe aerodynamic efficiency.,We had knowledgenabout the electromechanical efficiency,and then we can calculatenthe aerodynamic efficiency.,So therefore, it rises upnfrom passive torsion to active torsion,,from 30 percent up to 80 percent. 
 Next thing we have to do,,we have to control and regulatenthe whole structure.,Only if you control and regulate it,,you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.,So the overall consumption of energy,is about 25 watts at takeoff,and 16 to 18 watts in flight. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Markus,nwe should fly it once more. 
 Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure. 
 (Audience) Yeah! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Gasps) 
 (Cheers) 
 (Applause)What is it about flying cars?,We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.,And there are historic attempts,that have had some level of technical success.,But we haven't yet gotten to the point,where on your way here this morning,you see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates,the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in,with the three-dimensional sky above us --,that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in. 
 We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there,and realized that, despite the fact,that we have a lot of modern innovations,to draw on today,that weren't available previously --,we have modern composite materials,,we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy,and have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available,,we have glass cockpit avionics,that bring the information you need to fly,directly to you in the cockpit --,but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective,,we realized that we were going to be getting,the same result that people had been getting,for the last hundred years,,which isn't where we want to be right now.,So instead of trying to make a car that can fly,,we decided to try to make a plane that could drive. 
 And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.,It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane,that works just like any other small airplane.,You take off and land at a local airport.,Then once you're on the ground,,you fold up the wings, drive it home,,park it in your garage.,And it works.,After two years of an innovative design and construction process,,the proof of concept made its public debut,in 2008. 
 Now like with anything,that's really different from the status quo,,it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft.,And we discovered that it's a very good thing,that, when you go home with something that's been broken,,you've actually learned a lot more,than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives,the first time through.,Still, we very much wanted to see,the aircraft that we'd all helped build,in the air, off the ground,,like it was supposed to be.,And on our third high-speed testing deployment,on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York,,we got to do that for the first time.,The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft,just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.,And we were all very flattered to see that image,become a symbol of accomplishing something,that people had thought was impossible,really the world over. 
 The flight testing that followed that,was as basic and low-risk as we could make it,,but it still accomplished what we needed to,to take the program to the next step,and to gain the credibility that we needed,within our eventual market, the general aviation community,,and with the regulators,that govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.,The FAA, about a year ago,,gave us an exemption for the Transition,to allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.,within the light sport aircraft category.,Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important,,because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft,makes it simpler for us to certify it,,but it also makes it much easier,for you to learn how to fly it.,A sport pilot can be certificated,in as little as 20 hours of flight time.,And at 110 lbs.,,that's very important for solving the other side of the equation --,driving. 
 It turns out that driving,,with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles,,is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.,For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground,,this may be counter-intuitive,,but driving has potholes, cobblestones,,pedestrians, other drivers,and a rather long and detailed list,of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.,Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention,,and a lot of the design work,that we're the most proud of with the aircraft,came out of solving the unique problems,of operating it on the ground --,everything from a continuously-variable transmission,and liquid-based cooling system,that allows us to use an aircraft engine,in stop-and-go traffic,,to a custom-designed gearbox,that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground,,to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment,,to crash safety features.,We have a carbon fiber safety cage,that protects the occupants,for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car. 
 Now this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough.,The regulations for vehicles on the road,weren't written with an airplane in mind.,So we did need a little bit of support,from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.,Now you may have seen in the news recently,,they came through with us at the end of last month,with a few special exemptions,that will allow the Transition to be sold,in the same category as SUVs and light trucks.,As a multi-purpose passenger vehicle,,it is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now let's see it in action.,You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.,You're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels.,And it is under seven feet tall,,so it will fit in a standard construction garage.,And that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.,That's real time.,You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.,Once they're fully deployed,,there's a mechanical lock that goes into place,,again, from inside the cockpit.,And they're now fully capable of handling,any of the loads you would see in flight --,just like putting down your convertible top.,And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that. 
 (Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies,,75 percent of your risk is that first flight. 
 Radio: It actually flew. Yes. 
 Radio 2: That was gorgeous. 
 Radio: What did you think of that?,That was beautiful from up here, I tell you. 
 AMD: See, we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.,And our test pilot gave us,the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight,,which was that it was "remarkably unremarkable.",He would go onto tell us,that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land,that he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.,So despite making something,that is seemingly revolutionary,,we really focused on doing,as little new as possible.,We leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation,and from automotive racing.,When we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box,,we use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle,that lets us reduce risk in baby steps. 
 Now since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago,,we've had a lot of those baby steps.,We've gone from being three of us,working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school,to about two-dozen of us,working in an initial production facility outside of Boston.,We've had to overcome challenges,like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about,,figuring out how to politely respond,when a regulator tells you,,"But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended --,(Laughter),to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues,that we talked about on the ground.,Still, if everything goes to our satisfaction,with the testing and construction,of the two production prototypes,that we're working on right now,,those first deliveries,to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point,should begin at the end of next year. 
 The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.,And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy,,but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.,Here's why.,While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world,goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports,,there is a huge underutilized resource out there.,There are thousands of local airstrips,that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.,On average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles,of wherever you are in the United States.,The Transition gives you,a safer, more convenient and more fun way,of using this resource. 
 For those of you who aren't yet pilots,,there's four main reasons why those of us who are,don't fly as much as we'd like to:,the weather, primarily,,cost, long door-to-door travel time,and mobility at your destination.,Now, bad weather comes in,,just land, fold up the wings, drive home.,Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.,Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger,,park it in your garage.,And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use,is both cheaper and better for the environment,than traditional avgas.,Door-to-door travel time is reduced,,because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space,,taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger,,you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.,And mobility to your destination is clearly solved.,Just fold up the wings and keep going. 
 The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons,while making the world a smaller, more accessible place.,It also continues to be a fabulous adventure.,I hope you'll each take a moment,to think about how you could use something like this,to give yourself more access to your own world,,and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun. 
 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you. 
 (Applause)I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.,I couldn't understand,the starvation, the destruction,,the killing of innocent people.,Making sense of those things,is a very difficult thing to do.,And when I was 12, I became an actor.,I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.,I was told I was dyslexic.,In fact, I have got qualifications.,I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get --,which was useful, obviously.,And so concern,is where all of this comes from.,And then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things,,and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in,really wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more. 
 And at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby,,this wonderful nuclear physicist,,and he said that media had a responsibility,,that all sectors of society had a responsibility,to try and progress things and move things forward.,And that fascinated me,,because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.,And then I thought, well maybe I could do something.,Maybe I could become a filmmaker.,Maybe I can use the form of film constructively,to in some way make a difference.,Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in.,So I started thinking about peace,,and I was obviously, as I said to you,,very much moved by these images,,trying to make sense of that.,Could I go and speak to older and wiser people,who would tell me how they made sense,of the things that are going on?,Because it's obviously incredibly frightening. 
 But I realized that,,having been messing around with structure as an actor,,that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough,,that there needed to be a mountain to climb,,there needed to be a journey that I had to take.,And if I took that journey,,no matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.,The point was that I would have something,to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil?,Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children?,Is that a responsible thing to do? Etc., etc. 
 So I was thinking about peace,,and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?,And that was when I had the idea.,There was no starting point for peace.,There was no day of global unity.,There was no day of intercultural cooperation.,There was no day when humanity came together,,separate in all of those things,and just shared it together --,that we're in this together,,and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated,,then that might be the key to humanity's survival.,That might shift the level of consciousness,around the fundamental issues that humanity faces --,if we did it just for a day. 
 So obviously we didn't have any money.,I was living at my mom's place.,And we started writing letters to everybody.,You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do,to fathom that out.,How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world,to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,,the 21st of September?,And I wanted it to be the 21st of September,because it was my granddad's favorite number.,He was a prisoner of war.,He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.,It poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.,So he was like my hero.,And the reason why 21 was the number is,700 men left, 23 came back,,two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.,And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace. 
 So we began this journey,,and we launched it in 1999.,And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors,,Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths,,various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody.,And very quickly, some letters started coming back.,And we started to build this case.,And I remember the first letter.,One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.,And of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars,and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].,A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying,,"This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.,I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace.",And we didn't have money for the flight.,And I rang Sir Bob Ayling, who was CEO of BA at the time,,and said, "Mate, we've got this invitation.,Could you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him.",And of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.,And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward. 
 And actually, let me go back to that slide,,because when we launched it in 1999 --,this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence --,we invited thousands of people.,Well not thousands -- hundreds of people, lots of people --,all the press, because we were going to try and create,the first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.,And we invited everybody,,and no press showed up.,There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family.,And that was kind of like the launch of this thing.,But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.,For me, it was really about the process.,It wasn't about the end result.,And that's the beautiful thing about the camera.,They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is.,And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing,and really empowering actually. 
 So anyway, we began the journey.,And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.,I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long,,because every time I saw Kofi Annan,,I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it,,and that was kind of what was going on.,(Laughter),Yeah, I'm not worried about it now.,So Mary Robinson,,she said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created.",Kofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground.",The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim,,said, "I must get the African countries involved.",Dr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate,,president now of Costa Rica,,said, "I'll do everything that I can.",So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.,I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks,,and so on and so on and so on --,while I was building the case,to prove whether this idea,would make sense. 
 And then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.,76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.,And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone.,I've recorded 44,000 young people.,I've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.,I'm really clear about how young people feel,when you talk to them about this idea,of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world,through their poetry, their art, their literature,,their music, their sport, whatever it might be.,And we were listening to everybody. 
 And it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.,and working with NGOs and building this case.,I felt that I was presenting a case,on behalf of the global community,to try and create this day.,And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was,,the better chance we had of creating this day.,And it was this stuff, this,,where I actually was in the beginning,kind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.,It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.,The fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work,,then I could make a statement,about how unwilling the global community is to unite --,until, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.,And this young child,who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic,,and that young boy who was a child soldier,,who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 --,these things made me realize,that this was not a film that I could just stop.,And that actually, at that moment something happened to me,,which obviously made me go, "I'm going to document.,If this is the only film that I ever make,,I'm going to document until this becomes a reality.",Because we've got to stop, we've got to do something,where we unite --,separate from all the politics and religion,that, as a young person, is confusing me.,I don't know how to get involved in that process. 
 And then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York.,The Costa Rican government and the British government,had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly,,with 54 co-sponsors,,the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,,the 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date,,and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.,(Applause),Yeah, but there were hundreds of individuals, obviously, who made that a reality.,And thank you to all of them.,That was an incredible moment.,I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen.,And as I mentioned, when it started,,we were at the Globe, and there was no press.,And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story.",And suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day. 
 Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th,to do a press conference.,And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.,And I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way.,And obviously he never came down. The statement was never made.,The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence.,And it was obviously a tragic moment,for the thousands of people who lost their lives,,there and then subsequently all over the world.,It never happened.,And I remember thinking,,"This is exactly why, actually,,we have to work even harder.,And we have to make this day work.,It's been created; nobody knows.,But we have to continue this journey,,and we have to tell people,,and we have to prove it can work." 
 And I left New York freaked,,but actually empowered.,And I felt inspired,by the possibilities,that if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.,I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.,I was showing the film,,and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered,by some guys having watched the film --,that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.,It's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan;,the Taliban won't listen, etc., etc.,It's just symbolism.,And that was even worse,than actually what had just happened in many ways,,because it couldn't not work.,I'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank,,India, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was,,and they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity,,we can move aid, we can vaccinate children.,Children can lead their projects.,They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved.",That's what I'd heard.,And I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about. 
 And so I went back to the United Nations.,I decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie.,And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years.,We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system,,governments and NGOs,,trying desperately to find somebody,to come forward and have a go at it,,see if we could make it possible.,And after lots and lots of meetings obviously,,I'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi,,one of my heroes and mentors really,,he managed to get UNICEF involved.,And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go.",And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.,It was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan,with UNAMA and WHO,and civil society, etc., etc., etc.?,And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it,,and I was thinking, "This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working.,But even if it doesn't, at least the door is open,and there's a chance." 
 And so I went back to London,,and I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.,And I saw him because he was an actor, I was an actor,,I had a connection to him,,because we needed to get to the press, we needed this attraction,,we needed the media to be involved.,Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen,and there'd be more --,when we got into certain areas,,maybe there would be more people interested.,And maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more,,which had been desperately difficult.,I won't go into that.,So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you." 
 While I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?",I said, "I'm going to go to Afghanistan." He said, "Really?",And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.,So I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?,It'd be really interesting if you came.,It would help and bring attention.,And that attention,would help leverage the situation,,as well as all of the other sides of it.",I think there's a number of pillars to success.,One is you've got to have a great idea.,The other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance,,and you've got to be able to raise awareness.,And actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved.,So these guys were absolutely crucial.,So he said yes,,and we found ourselves in Afghanistan. 
 It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there,,I was talking to various people, and they were saying to me,,"You've got to get everybody involved here.,You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work.",And we did, and we traveled around,,and we spoke to elders, we spoke to doctors, we spoke to nurses,,we held press conferences, we went out with soldiers,,we sat down with ISAF, we sat down with NATO,,we sat down with the U.K. government.,I mean, we basically sat down with everybody --,in and out of schools with ministers of education,,holding these press conferences,,which of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there.,There was an interest in what was going on.,This amazing woman, Fatima Gailani, was absolutely instrumental in what went on,as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.,And her Afghan network,was just absolutely everywhere.,And she was really crucial in getting the message in. 
 And then we went home. We'd sort of done it.,We had to wait now and see what happened.,And I got home,,and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me,from the Taliban.,And that letter basically said, "We'll observe this day.,We will observe this day.,We see it as a window of opportunity.,And we will not engage. We're not going to engage.",And that meant that humanitarian workers,wouldn't be kidnapped or killed.,And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.,And days later,,1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio,as a consequence of everybody stopping.,(Applause),And like the General Assembly,,obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment. 
 And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together,because we had to go back.,We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.,We went back to Afghanistan,,because the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.,But more importantly, we wanted to go back,,because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.,They were the people who believed in peace,and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real.,And we wanted to go back and show them the film,and say, "Look, you guys made this possible. And thank you very much.",And we gave the film over.,Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing. 
 And then that year, that year, 2008,,this ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th:,"General Stanley McChrystal,,commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan,,announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations,on the 21st of September.",They were saying they would stop.,And then there was this other statement,that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety,saying that, in Afghanistan,,because of this work,,the violence was down by 70 percent.,70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least.,And that completely blew my mind,almost more than anything. 
 And I remember being stuck in New York, this time because of the volcano,,which was obviously much less harmful.,And I was there thinking about what was going on.,And I kept thinking about this 70 percent.,70 percent reduction in violence --,in what everyone said was completely impossible,and you couldn't do.,And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan,,then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.,We have to go for a global truce.,We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence,and go for a global truce,,go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities,,both domestically and internationally, ever recorded. 
 That's exactly what we must do.,And on the 21st of September this year,,we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena,to go for that process,,to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.,And we will utilize all kinds of things --,have a dance and social media,and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.,And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.,And we'll globally link with government, inter-government,,non-government, education, unions, sports.,And you can see the education box there.,We've got resources at the moment in 174 countries,trying to get young people to be the driving force,behind the vision of that global truce.,And obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help. 
 Linking up with the Olympics --,I went and saw Seb Coe. I said, "London 2012 is about truce.,Ultimately, that's what it's about.",Why don't we all team up? Why don't we bring truce to life?,Why don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce?,We'll make a new film about this process.,We'll utilize sport and football.,On the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played,,from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.,So, utilizing all of these ways,to inspire individual action.,And ultimately, we have to try that.,We have to work together. 
 And when I stand here in front of all of you,,and the people who will watch these things,,I'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met,,that there is a possibility that our world could unite,,that we could come together as one,,that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues,,brought about by individuals.,I was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.,I think he's one of the most incredible men,in relation to international politics -- in Afghanistan, in Iraq.,He's an amazing man.,And I sat with him a few weeks ago.,And I said to him, "Mr. Brahimi, is this nuts, going for a global truce?,Is this possible? Is it really possible that we could do this?",He said, "It's absolutely possible.",I said, "What would you do?,Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system?",He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals.",It's all about the individuals.,It's all about you and me.,It's all about partnerships.,It's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.,Because together, by working together,,I seriously think we can start to change things. 
 And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is,,who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal --,and he said, "I've been thinking about this day,and imagining it as a square,with 365 squares,,and one of them is white.",And it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear.,If you put one drop,,one drop of something, in that water,,it'll change it forever. 
 By working together, we can create peace one day.,Thank you TED. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks a lot. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. Thank you.The question today is not:,Why did we invade Afghanistan?,The question is:,why are we still in Afghanistan,one decade later?,Why are we spending,$135 billion?,Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?,Why were more people killed,last month,than in any preceding month,of this conflict?,How has this happened?,The last 20 years,has been the age of intervention,,and Afghanistan is simply one act,in a five-act tragedy.,We came out of the end of the Cold War,in despair.,We faced Rwanda;,we faced Bosnia,,and then we rediscovered our confidence.,In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo,and we seemed to succeed.,In the fourth act, with our hubris,,our overconfidence developing,,we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,,and in the fifth act,,we plunged into a humiliating mess. 
 So the question is: What are we doing?,Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan?,And the answer, of course,,that we keep being given,is as follows:,we're told that we went into Afghanistan,because of 9/11,,and that we remain there,because the Taliban poses an existential threat,to global security.,In the words of President Obama,,"If the Taliban take over again,,they will invite back Al-Qaeda,,who will try to kill as many of our people,as they possibly can.",The story that we're told,is that there was a "light footprint" initially --,in other words, that we ended up in a situation,where we didn't have enough troops,,we didn't have enough resources,,that Afghans were frustrated --,they felt there wasn't enough progress,and economic development and security,,and therefore the Taliban came back --,that we responded in 2005 and 2006,with troop deployments,,but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground.,And that it wasn't until 2009,,when President Obama signed off on a surge,,that we finally had,,in the words of Secretary Clinton,,"the strategy, the leadership and the resources.",So, as the president now reassures us,,we are on track to achieve our goals. 
 All of this is wrong.,Every one of those statements is wrong.,Afghanistan does not,pose an existential threat,to global security.,It is extremely unlikely,the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country --,extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul.,They simply don't have a conventional military option.,And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong,,it's extremely unlikely,the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.,From the Taliban's point of view,,that was their number one mistake last time.,If they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda,,they would still be in power today. 
 And even if I'm wrong about those two things,,even if they were able to take back the country,,even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda,,it's extremely unlikely,that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance,its ability to harm the United States,or harm Europe.,Because this isn't the 1990s anymore.,If the Al-Qaeda base,was to be established near Ghazni,,we would hit them very hard,,and it would be very, very difficult,for the Taliban to protect them. 
 Furthermore, it's simply not true,that what went wrong in Afghanistan,is the light footprint.,In my experience, in fact,,the light footprint was extremely helpful.,And these troops that we brought in --,it's a great picture of David Beckham,there on the sub-machine gun --,made the situation worse, not better.,When I walked across Afghanistan,in the winter of 2001-2002,,what I saw was scenes like this.,A girl, if you're lucky,,in the corner of a dark room --,lucky to be able to look at the Koran.,But in those early days,when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources,,we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.,Within a few months,,there were two and a half million more girls in school.,In Sangin where I was sick in 2002,,the nearest health clinic,was within three days walk.,Today, there are 14 health clinics,in that area alone.,There was amazing improvements.,We went from almost no Afghans,having mobile telephones during the Taliban,to a situation where, almost overnight,,three million Afghans had mobile telephones.,And we had progress in the free media.,We had progress in elections --,all of this with the so-called light footprint. 
 But when we began to bring more money,,when we began to invest more resources,,things got worse, not better. How?,Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year,into a country like Afghanistan,where the entire revenue of the Afghan state,is one billion dollars a year,,you drown everything.,It's not simply corruption and waste,that you create;,you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,,the elected Afghan government,,with the micromanaging tendencies,of foreigners on short tours,with their own priorities.,And the same is true for the troops. 
 When I walked across Afghanistan,,I stayed with people like this.,This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.,Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.,He was very generous,,like many of the Afghans I stayed with.,But he was also considerably more conservative,,considerably more anti-foreign,,considerably more Islamist,than we'd like to acknowledge.,This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,,tried to shoot me.,And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph,is I was somewhat frightened,,and I was too afraid on this occasion,to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert,and taken refuge in this house,,why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.,But 18 months later, I asked him,why he had tried to shoot me.,And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper --,explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,,Nadir Shah,had bet him that he couldn't hit me.,Now this is not to say,Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.,It's not; it's a wonderful place,full of incredible energy and intelligence.,But it is a place,where the putting-in of the troops,has increased the violence rather than decreased it. 
 2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,,an agricultural engineer,,could travel through Helmand,,could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,,which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.,Today, he could never do that.,So the idea that we deployed the troops,to respond to the Taliban insurgency,is mistaken.,Rather than preceding the insurgency,,the Taliban followed the troop deployment,,and as far as I'm concerned,,the troop deployment caused their return. 
 Now is this a new idea?,No, there have been any number of people,saying this over the last seven years.,I ran a center at Harvard,from 2008 to 2010,,and there were people like Michael Semple there,who speak Afghan languages fluently,,who've traveled to almost every district in the country.,Andrew Wilder, for example,,born on the Pakistan-Iranian border,,served his whole life,in Pakistan and Afghanistan.,Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 --,worked for Save the Children,,ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit.,These are people,who were able to say consistently,that the increase in development aid,was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure --,that the counter-insurgency strategy,was not working and would not work.,And yet, nobody listened to them.,Instead,,there was a litany of astonishing optimism. 
 Beginning in 2004,,every general came in saying,,"I've inherited a dismal situation,,but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy,,which will deliver,",in General Barno's word in 2004,,the "decisive year.",Well guess what? It didn't.,But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying,that he had the strategy and the resources,to deliver, in 2005,,the "decisive year.",Or General David Richards to come in 2006,and say he had the strategy and the resources,to deliver the "crunch year.",Or in 2007,,the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide,,to say that that would deliver the "decisive year.",Or in 2008, Major General Champoux,to come in and say he would deliver the "decisive year.",Or in 2009, my great friend,,General Stanley McChrystal,,who said that he was "knee-deep in the decisive year.",Or in 2010,,the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband,,who said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year.",And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today,,that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister,,assures us that we are in the "decisive year." 
 (Applause) 
 How do we allow,any of this to happen?,Well the answer, of course, is,,if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion,dollars a year in a country,,you co-opt almost everybody.,Even the aid agencies,,who begin to receive an enormous amount of money,from the U.S. and the European governments,to build schools and clinics,,are somewhat disinclined,to challenge the idea,that Afghanistan is an existential threat,to global security.,They're worried, in other words,,that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat --,Oxfam, Save the Children,wouldn't get the money,to build their hospitals and schools.,It's also very difficult to confront a general,with medals on his chest.,It's very difficult for a politician,,because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.,You feel deep, deep guilt.,You exaggerate your fears,,and you're terrified about the humiliation,of defeat. 
 What is the solution to this?,Well the solution to this,is we need to find a way,that people like Michael Semple, or those other people,,who are telling the truth, who know the country,,who've spent 30 years on the ground --,and most importantly of all,,the missing component of this --,Afghans themselves,,who understand what is going on.,We need to somehow get their message,to the policymakers.,And this is very difficult to do,because of our structures. 
 The first thing we need to change,is the structures of our government.,Very, very sadly,,our foreign services, the United Nations,,the military in these countries,have very little idea of what's going on.,The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;,Italian soldiers, on tours of four months;,the American military, on tours of 12 months.,Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds.,When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles,with these somewhat threatening security teams,who ready 24 hours in advance,who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour. 
 In the British embassy in Afghanistan,in 2008,,an embassy of 350 people,,there were only three people who could speak Dari,,the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.,And there was not a single Pashto speaker.,In the Afghan section in London,responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground,,I was told last year,that there was not a single staff member,of the foreign office in that section,who had ever served,on a posting in Afghanistan.,So we need to change that institutional culture.,And I could make the same points about the United States,and the United Nations. 
 Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.,We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious,,that we understand that optimism,is in the DNA of the military,,that we don't respond to it,with quite as much alacrity.,And thirdly, we need to have some humility.,We need to begin from the position,that our knowledge, our power,,our legitimacy,is limited.,This doesn't mean,that intervention around the world is a disaster.,It isn't. 
 Bosnia and Kosovo,were signal successes,,great successes.,Today when you go to Bosnia,it is almost impossible to believe,that what we saw in the early 1990s happened.,It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made,since 1994.,Refugee return,,which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees,thought would be extremely unlikely,,has largely happened.,A million properties have been returned.,Borders between the Bosniak territory,and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down.,The national army has shrunk.,The crime rates in Bosnia today,are lower than they are in Sweden. 
 This has been done,by an incredible, principled effort,by the international community,,and, of course, above all,,by Bosnians themselves.,But you need to look at context.,And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq.,You need to understand that in those places,what really mattered,was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic,in coming to the agreement,,and then the fact those men went,,that the regional situation improved,,that the European Union could offer Bosnia,something extraordinary:,the chance to be part,of a new thing, a new club,,a chance to join something bigger. 
 And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,,a lot of the secret of what we did,,a lot of the secret of our success,,was our humility --,was the tentative nature of our engagement.,We criticized people a lot in Bosnia,for being quite slow to take on war criminals.,We criticized them,for being quite slow to return refugees.,But that slowness, that caution,,the fact that President Clinton initially said,that American troops would only be deployed for a year,,turned out to be a strength,,and it helped us to put our priorities right. 
 One of the saddest things,about our involvement in Afghanistan,is that we've got our priorities out of sync.,We're not matching our resources to our priorities.,Because if what we're interested in is terrorism,,Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.,If what we're interested in is regional stability,,Egypt is far more important.,If what we're worried about is poverty and development,,sub-Saharan Africa is far more important.,This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter,,but that it's one of 40 countries in the world,with which we need to engage. 
 So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,,what we need to think of,is something like mountain rescue.,Why mountain rescue?,Because when people talk about intervention,,they imagine that some scientific theory --,the Rand Corporation goes around,counting 43 previous insurgencies,producing mathematical formula,saying you need one trained counter-insurgent,for every 20 members of the population.,This is the wrong way of looking at it.,You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue. 
 When you're doing mountain rescue,,you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue,,you look for somebody who knows the terrain.,It's about context.,You understand that you can prepare,,but the amount of preparation you can do,is limited --,you can take some water, you can have a map,,you can have a pack.,But what really matters,is two kinds of problems --,problems that occur on the mountain,which you couldn't anticipate,,such as, for example, ice on a slope,,but which you can get around,,and problems which you couldn't anticipate,and which you can't get around,,like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche,or a change in the weather. 
 And the key to this,is a guide who has been on that mountain,,in every temperature,,at every period --,a guide who, above all,,knows when to turn back,,who doesn't press on relentlessly,when conditions turn against them.,What we look for,in firemen, in climbers, in policemen,,and what we should look for in intervention,,is intelligent risk takers --,not people who plunge blind off a cliff,,not people who jump into a burning room,,but who weigh their risks,,weigh their responsibilities.,Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan,is this idea,that failure is not an option.,It makes failure invisible,,inconceivable and inevitable.,And if we can resist,this crazy slogan,,we shall discover --,in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,,and anywhere else we go in the world --,that if we can often do much less than we pretend,,we can do much more than we fear. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you very much.,Thank you. Thank you very much.,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,Thank you. Thank you.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Rory, you mentioned Libya at the end.,Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there,and the intervention? 
 Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem.,The problem in Libya,is that we are always pushing for the black or white.,We imagine there are only two choices:,either full engagement and troop deployment,or total isolation.,And we are always being tempted up to our neck.,We put our toes in and we go up to our neck.,What we should have done in Libya,is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution.,We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly,to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi.,We could have done that.,We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours,because Gaddafi had no planes,within 48 hours.,Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted,towards regime change.,In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council,,which means it's very difficult,to get a resolution on Syria,,and we're setting ourselves up again for failure.,Once more, humility,,limits, honesty,,realistic expectations,and we could have achieved something to be proud of. 
 BG: Rory, thank you very much. 
 RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.)Erez Lieberman Aiden: Everyone knows,that a picture is worth a thousand words.,But we at Harvard,were wondering if this was really true.,(Laughter),So we assembled a team of experts,,spanning Harvard, MIT,,The American Heritage Dictionary, The Encyclopedia Britannica,and even our proud sponsors,,the Google.,And we cogitated about this,for about four years.,And we came to a startling conclusion.,Ladies and gentlemen, a picture is not worth a thousand words.,In fact, we found some pictures,that are worth 500 billion words. 
 Jean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion?,So Erez and I were thinking about ways,to get a big picture of human culture,and human history: change over time.,So many books actually have been written over the years.,So we were thinking, well the best way to learn from them,is to read all of these millions of books.,Now of course, if there's a scale for how awesome that is,,that has to rank extremely, extremely high.,Now the problem is there's an X-axis for that,,which is the practical axis.,This is very, very low. 
 (Applause) 
 Now people tend to use an alternative approach,,which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully.,This is extremely practical, but not so awesome.,What you really want to do,is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space.,So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google,who had started a digitization project a few years back,that might just enable this approach.,They have digitized millions of books.,So what that means is, one could use computational methods,to read all of the books in a click of a button.,That's very practical and extremely awesome. 
 ELA: Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from.,Since time immemorial, there have been authors.,These authors have been striving to write books.,And this became considerably easier,with the development of the printing press some centuries ago.,Since then, the authors have won,on 129 million distinct occasions,,publishing books.,Now if those books are not lost to history,,then they are somewhere in a library,,and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries,and digitized by Google,,which has scanned 15 million books to date. 
 Now when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.,Now we've got the data, plus we have metadata.,We have information about things like where was it published,,who was the author, when was it published.,And what we do is go through all of those records,and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data.,What we're left with,is a collection of five million books,,500 billion words,,a string of characters a thousand times longer,than the human genome --,a text which, when written out,,would stretch from here to the Moon and back,10 times over --,a veritable shard of our cultural genome.,Of course what we did,when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ...,(Laughter),was what any self-respecting researchers,would have done.,We took a page out of XKCD,,and we said, "Stand back.,We're going to try science." 
 (Laughter) 
 JM: Now of course, we were thinking,,well let's just first put the data out there,for people to do science to it.,Now we're thinking, what data can we release?,Well of course, you want to take the books,and release the full text of these five million books.,Now Google, and Jon Orwant in particular,,told us a little equation that we should learn.,So you have five million, that is, five million authors,and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit.,So, although that would be really, really awesome,,again, that's extremely, extremely impractical.,(Laughter) 
 Now again, we kind of caved in,,and we did the very practical approach, which was a bit less awesome.,We said, well instead of releasing the full text,,we're going to release statistics about the books.,So take for instance "A gleam of happiness.",It's four words; we call that a four-gram.,We're going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram,appeared in books in 1801, 1802, 1803,,all the way up to 2008.,That gives us a time series,of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time.,We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books,,and that gives us a big table of two billion lines,that tell us about the way culture has been changing. 
 ELA: So those two billion lines,,we call them two billion n-grams.,What do they tell us?,Well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends.,Let me give you an example.,Let's suppose that I am thriving,,then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did.,And so I might say, "Yesterday, I throve.",Alternatively, I could say, "Yesterday, I thrived.",Well which one should I use?,How to know? 
 As of about six months ago,,the state of the art in this field,is that you would, for instance,,go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair,,and you'd say,,"Steve, you're an expert on the irregular verbs.,What should I do?",And he'd tell you, "Well most people say thrived,,but some people say throve.",And you also knew, more or less,,that if you were to go back in time 200 years,and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair,,(Laughter),"Tom, what should I say?",He'd say, "Well, in my day, most people throve,,but some thrived.",So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data.,Two rows from this table of two billion entries.,What you're seeing is year by year frequency,of "thrived" and "throve" over time.,Now this is just two,out of two billion rows.,So the entire data set,is a billion times more awesome than this slide. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 JM: Now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words.,For instance, this one.,If you just take influenza,,you will see peaks at the time where you knew,big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe. 
 ELA: If you were not yet convinced,,sea levels are rising,,so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature. 
 JM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram,,and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead,,although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. 
 (Laughter) 
 ELA: You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing.,For instance, let me tell you the history,of the year 1950.,Pretty much for the vast majority of history,,no one gave a damn about 1950.,In 1700, in 1800, in 1900,,no one cared.,Through the 30s and 40s,,no one cared.,Suddenly, in the mid-40s,,there started to be a buzz.,People realized that 1950 was going to happen,,and it could be big.,(Laughter),But nothing got people interested in 1950,like the year 1950.,(Laughter),People were walking around obsessed.,They couldn't stop talking,about all the things they did in 1950,,all the things they were planning to do in 1950,,all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950.,In fact, 1950 was so fascinating,that for years thereafter,,people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened,,in '51, '52, '53.,Finally in 1954,,someone woke up and realized,that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé.,(Laughter),And just like that, the bubble burst. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the story of 1950,is the story of every year that we have on record,,with a little twist, because now we've got these nice charts.,And because we have these nice charts, we can measure things.,We can say, "Well how fast does the bubble burst?",And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely.,Equations were derived, graphs were produced,,and the net result,is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster,with each passing year.,We are losing interest in the past more rapidly. 
 JM: Now a little piece of career advice.,So for those of you who seek to be famous,,we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures,,authors, actors and so on.,So if you want to become famous early on, you should be an actor,,because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s --,you're still young, it's really great.,Now if you can wait a little bit, you should be an author,,because then you rise to very great heights,,like Mark Twain, for instance: extremely famous.,But if you want to reach the very top,,you should delay gratification,and, of course, become a politician.,So here you will become famous by the end of your 50s,,and become very, very famous afterward.,So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older.,Like for instance, biologists and physics,tend to be almost as famous as actors.,One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician.,(Laughter),If you do that,,you might think, "Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s.",But guess what, nobody will really care. 
 (Laughter) 
 ELA: There are more sobering notes,among the n-grams.,For instance, here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall,,an artist born in 1887.,And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person.,He gets more and more and more famous,,except if you look in German.,If you look in German, you see something completely bizarre,,something you pretty much never see,,which is he becomes extremely famous,and then all of a sudden plummets,,going through a nadir between 1933 and 1945,,before rebounding afterward.,And of course, what we're seeing,is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist,in Nazi Germany. 
 Now these signals,are actually so strong,that we don't need to know that someone was censored.,We can actually figure it out,using really basic signal processing.,Here's a simple way to do it.,Well, a reasonable expectation,is that somebody's fame in a given period of time,should be roughly the average of their fame before,and their fame after.,So that's sort of what we expect.,And we compare that to the fame that we observe.,And we just divide one by the other,to produce something we call a suppression index.,If the suppression index is very, very, very small,,then you very well might be being suppressed.,If it's very large, maybe you're benefiting from propaganda. 
 JM: Now you can actually look at,the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations.,So for instance, here --,this suppression index is for 5,000 people,picked in English books where there's no known suppression --,it would be like this, basically tightly centered on one.,What you expect is basically what you observe.,This is distribution as seen in Germany --,very different, it's shifted to the left.,People talked about it twice less as it should have been.,But much more importantly, the distribution is much wider.,There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution,who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been.,But then also many people on the far right,who seem to benefit from propaganda.,This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record. 
 ELA: So culturomics,is what we call this method.,It's kind of like genomics.,Except genomics is a lens on biology,through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome.,Culturomics is similar.,It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis,to the study of human culture.,Here, instead of through the lens of a genome,,through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record.,The great thing about culturomics,is that everyone can do it.,Why can everyone do it?,Everyone can do it because three guys,,Jon Orwant, Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google,,saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer,,and they said, "This is so fun.,We have to make this available for people.",So in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out --,they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public.,And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in,and see its n-gram immediately --,also browse examples of all the various books,in which your n-gram appears. 
 JM: Now this was used over a million times on the first day,,and this is really the best of all the queries.,So people want to be their best, put their best foot forward.,But it turns out in the 18th century, people didn't really care about that at all.,They didn't want to be their best, they wanted to be their beft.,So what happened is, of course, this is just a mistake.,It's not that strove for mediocrity,,it's just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F.,Now of course, Google didn't pick this up at the time,,so we reported this in the science article that we wrote.,But it turns out this is just a reminder,that, although this is a lot of fun,,when you interpret these graphs, you have to be very careful,,and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. 
 ELA: People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes.,(Laughter),Actually, we're not going to have to talk,,we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent.,This person was interested in the history of frustration.,There's various types of frustration.,If you stub your toe, that's a one A "argh.",If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons,to make room for an interstellar bypass,,that's an eight A "aaaaaaaargh.",This person studies all the "arghs,",from one through eight A's.,And it turns out,that the less-frequent "arghs",are, of course, the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating --,except, oddly, in the early 80s.,We think that might have something to do with Reagan. 
 (Laughter) 
 JM: There are many usages of this data,,but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized.,Google has started to digitize 15 million books.,That's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published.,It's a sizable chunk of human culture.,There's much more in culture: there's manuscripts, there newspapers,,there's things that are not text, like art and paintings.,These all happen to be on our computers,,on computers across the world.,And when that happens, that will transform the way we have,to understand our past, our present and human culture. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)What I'm going to do is,nI'm going to explain to you,an extreme green concept,that was developednat NASA's Glenn Research Center,in Cleveland, Ohio.,But before I do that, we have to go over,the definition of what green is,,'cause a lot of us have andifferent definition of it.,Green. The product is created through,environmentally and sociallynconscious means.,There's plenty of things thatnare being called green now.,What does it actually mean?,We use three metrics to determine green.,The first metric is: Is it sustainable?,Which means, are you preservingnwhat you are doing for future use,or for future generations?,Is it alternative? Is it differentnthan what is being used today,,or does it have a lower carbon footprint,than what's used conventionally?,And three: Is it renewable?,Does it come from Earth'snnatural replenishing resources,,such as sun, wind and water? 
 Now, my task at NASA is to develop,the next generation of aviation fuels.,Extreme green. Why aviation?,The field of aviation usesnmore fuel than just about,every other combined. Wenneed to find an alternative.,Also it's a nationalnaeronautics directive.,One of the national aeronauticsngoals is to develop,the next generation of fuels, biofuels,,using domestic and safe,nfriendly resources.,Now, combating that challenge,we have to also meetnthe big three metric —,Actually, extreme greennfor us is all three together;,that's why you see the plusnthere. I was told to say that.,So it has to be the big three atnGRC. That's another metric.,Ninety-seven percent of thenworld's water is saltwater.,How about we use that?nCombine that with number three.,Do not use arable land.,Because crops are alreadyngrowing on that land,that's very scarce around the world.,Number two: Don't compete with food crops.,That's already a well establishednentity, they don't need another entry.,And lastly the most preciousnresource we have on this Earth,is fresh water. Don't use fresh water.,If 97.5 percentnof the world's water is saltwater,,2.5 percent is fresh water.nLess than a half percent,of that is accessible for human use.,But 60 percent of the populationnlives within that one percent. 
 So, combating my problem was,nnow I have to be extreme green,and meet the big three.nLadies and gentlemen,,welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.,This is a facility dedicatednto the next generation,of aviation fuels using halophytes.,A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.,Most plants don't like salt,nbut halophytes tolerate salt.,We also are using weeds,and we are also using algae.,The good thing about our lab is, we've had,3,600 visitors in the last two years.,Why do you think that's so?,Because we are on to something special. 
 So, in the lower you seenthe GreenLab obviously,,and on the right handnside you'll see algae.,If you are into the businessnof the next generation,of aviation fuels, algaenis a viable option,,there's a lot of funding right now,,and we have an algae to fuels program.,There's two types of algae growing.,One is a closed photobioreactornthat you see here,,and what you see on the othernside is our species —,we are currently using a speciesncalled Scenedesmus dimorphus.,Our job at NASA is to take thenexperimental and computational,and make a better mixing fornthe closed photobioreactors.,Now the problems with closednphotobioreactors are:,They are quite expensive,nthey are automated,,and it's very difficultnto get them in large scale.,So on large scale what do they use?,We use open pond systems.nNow, around the world,they are growing algae,nwith this racetrack design,that you see here. Looks like an oval with,a paddle wheel and mixes really well,,but when it gets around the last turn,nwhich I call turn four — it's stagnant.,We actually have a solution for that.,In the GreenLab in our open pond system,we use something that happensnin nature: waves.,We actually use wave technologynon our open pond systems.,We have 95 percent mixingnand our lipid content is higher,than a closed photobioreactor system,,which we think is significant. 
 There is a drawback to algae,nhowever: It's very expensive.,Is there a way to producenalgae inexpensively?,And the answer is: yes.,We do the same thingnwe do with halophytes,,and that is: climatic adaptation.,In our GreenLab we havensix primary ecosystems,that range from freshwaternall the way to saltwater.,What we do: We take a potentialnspecies, we start at freshwater,,we add a little bit more salt,nwhen the second tank here,will be the same ecosystem as Brazil —,right next to the sugar canenfields you can have our plants —,the next tank represents Africa,nthe next tank represents Arizona,,the next tank represents Florida,,and the next tank representsnCalifornia or the open ocean.,What we are trying to do is toncome up with a single species,that can survive anywhere in thenworld, where there's barren desert.,We are being very successful so far. 
 Now, here's one of the problems.,If you are a farmer, you need five thingsnto be successful: You need seeds,,you need soil, you neednwater and you need sun,,and the last thing that younneed is fertilizer.,Most people use chemical fertilizers.nBut guess what?,We do not use chemical fertilizer.,Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenerynin your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.,Believe it or not, in our analysisnof our saltwater ecosystems,80 percent of what we neednare in these tanks themselves.,The 20 percent that's missingnis nitrogen and phosphorous.,We have a natural solution: fish.,No we don't cut up the fishnand put them in there.,Fish waste is what we use.nAs a matter of fact,we use freshwater mollies, that we'venused our climatic adaptation technique,from freshwater all the way to seawater.,Freshwater mollies: cheap,nthey love to make babies,,and they love to go to the bathroom.,And the more they go to thenbathroom, the more fertilizer we get,,the better off we are, believe it or not.,It should be noted that we usensand as our soil,,regular beach sand. Fossilized coral. 
 So a lot of people ask me,n"How did you get started?",Well, we got started in what wencall the indoor biofuels lab.,It's a seedling lab. We have 26ndifferent species of halophytes,,and five are winners. What we do here is —,actually it should be calledna death lab, 'cause we try to,kill the seedlings, make them rough —,and then we come to the GreenLab.,What you see in the lower corner,is a wastewater treatment plant experiment,that we are growing, a macro-algaenthat I'll talk about in a minute.,And lastly, it's me actually workingnin the lab to prove to you I do work,,I don't just talk about what I do.,Here's the plant species.nSalicornia virginica.,It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.,Everywhere we go we see it. It'snall over the place, from Maine,all the way to California.nWe love that plant.,Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Veryndifficult to get around the world.,It is the highest lipidncontent that we have,,but it has a shortcoming: It's short.,Now you take europaea, which is thenlargest or the tallest plant that we have.,And what we are trying to do,with natural selection or adaptivenbiology — combine all three,to make a high-growth, high-lipid plant.,Next, when a hurricane decimated thenDelaware Bay — soybean fields gone —,we came up with an idea:nCan you have a plant,that has a land reclamation positivenin Delaware? And the answer is yes.,It's called seashore mallow.nKosteletzkya virginica —,say that five times fast if you can.,This is a 100 percent usable plant. Thenseeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed.,It's there for 10 years;nit's working very well.,Now we get to Chaetomorpha.,This is a macro-algae that loves,excess nutrients. If younare in the aquarium industry,you know we use itnto clean up dirty tanks.,This species is so significant to us.,The properties are very close to plastic.,We are trying right now to convertnthis macro-algae into a bioplastic.,If we are successful, we willnrevolutionize the plastics industry. 
 So, we have a seed to fuel program.,We have to do something withnthis biomass that we have.,And so we do G.C. extraction, lipidnoptimization, so on and so forth,,because our goal really is to come up with,the next generation of aviation fuels,naviation specifics, so on and so forth.,So far we talked about water and fuel,,but along the way we found outnsomething interesting about Salicornia:,It's a food product.,So we talk about ideasnworth spreading, right?,How about this: In sub-SaharannAfrica, next to the sea, saltwater,,barren desert,nhow about we take that plant,,plant it, half use for food,nhalf use for fuel.,We can make that happen, inexpensively.,You can seenthere's a greenhouse in Germany,that sells it as a health food product.,This is harvested, and in the middle herenis a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled.,So I have to tell you a joke.nSalicornia is known as sea beans,,saltwater asparagus and pickle weed.,So we are pickling picklenweed in the middle.,Oh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter),And at the bottom is seaman's mustard.nIt does make sense,,this is a logical snack. You have mustard,,you are a seaman, you see thenhalophyte, you mix it together,,it's a great snack with some crackers.,And last, garlic with Salicornia,nwhich is what I like.,So, water, fuel and food. 
 None of this is possiblenwithout the GreenLab team.,Just like the Miami Heat has the bignthree, we have the big three at NASA GRC.,That's myself, professor Bob Hendricks,nour fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait.,The backbone of the GreenLab is students.,Over the last two yearsnwe've had 35 different students,from around the world working at GreenLab.,As a matter fact my division chief saysna lot, "You have a green university.",I say, "I'm okay with that,n'cause we are nurturing,the next generation of extremengreen thinkers, which is significant." 
 So, in first summary I presentednto you what we think,is a global solutionnfor food, fuel and water.,There's something missing to be complete.,Clearly we use electricity.nWe have a solution for you —,We're using clean energy sources here.,So, we have two wind turbinesnconnected to the GreenLab,,we have four or five morenhopefully coming soon.,We are also using somethingnthat is quite interesting —,there is a solar array field atnNASA's Glenn Research Center,,hasn't been used for 15 years.,Along with some of my electricalnengineering colleagues,,we realized that they are still viable,,so we are refurbishing them right now.,In about 30 days or so they'll benconnected to the GreenLab. 
 And the reason why you seenred, red and yellow, is,a lot of people think NASA employeesndon't work on Saturday —,This is a picture taken on Saturday.,There are no cars around, but you see my trucknin yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter),This is a proof to you that I'm working.,'Cause we do what it takes to get thenjob done, most people know that.,Here's a concept with this:,We are using the GreenLabnfor a micro-grid test bed,for the smart grid concept in Ohio.,We have the ability to do that,nand I think it's going to work.,So, GreenLab Research Facility.,A self-sustainable renewable energynecosystem was presented today.,We really, really hope thisnconcept catches on worldwide.,We think we have a solution for food,nwater, fuel and now energy. Complete.,It's extreme green, it's sustainable,nalternative and renewable,and it meets the big three at GRC:,Don't use arable land, don'tncompete with food crops,,and most of all, don't use fresh water. 
 So I get a lot of questions about,n"What are you doing in that lab?",And I usually say, "None of your business,nthat's what I'm doing in the lab." (Laughter),And believe it or not, my number one goal,for working on this project is,I want to help save the world.I want to talk to you about something,kind of big.,We'll start here.,Sixty-five million years ago -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the dinosaurs had a bad day. 
 (Laughter) 
 A chunk of rock six miles across,,moving something like 50 timesnthe speed of a rifle bullet,,slammed into the Earth.,It released its energy all at once,,and it was an explosionnthat was mind-numbing.,If you took everynnuclear weapon ever built,at the height of the Cold War,,lumped them together,,and blew them up at the same time,,that would be one one-millionthnof the energy released at that moment.,The dinosaurs had a really bad day.,OK? 
 Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.,We all live here in Boulder.,If you look out your windownand see Longs Peak --,you're probably familiar with it --,now, scoop up Longs Peaknand put it out in space.,Take ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.,Lump that in there,nand put that in space as well.,And Mt. Everest. And K2.,And the Indian peaks.,Then you're starting to get an ideanof how much rock we're talking about, OK?,We know it was that big,because of the impact it hadnand the crater it left.,It hit in what we now knownas Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.,You can see here,nthere's the Yucatan Peninsula,,if you recognize Cozumelnoff the east coast there.,Here is how big of a crater was left.,It was huge. 
 To give you a sensenof the scale ... there you go.,The scale here is 50 miles on top,na hundred kilometers on the bottom.,This thing was 300 kilometersnacross -- 200 miles --,an enormous crater that excavatednout vast amounts of earth,that splashed around the globenand set fires all over the planet,,threw up enough dust to block out the sun.,It wiped out 75 percentnof all species on Earth.,Now, not all asteroids are that big. 
 Some of them are smaller.,Here is one that came in,over the United States in October of 1992.,It came in on a Friday night.,Why is that important?,Because back then, video camerasnwere just starting to become popular,,and parents would bring themnto their kids' football games,to film their kids playing football.,And since this came in on a Friday,,they were able to get this great footagenof this thing breaking up,as it came in over West Virginia,nMaryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey,until it did that,to a car in New York. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,,but then again, you can see the rock,nwhich is sitting right here,,about the size of a football,,that hit that car and did that damage.,Now, this thing was probablynabout the size of a school bus,when it first came in.,It broke up through atmospheric pressure,,it crumbled, and thennthe pieces fell apart,and did some damage.,Now, you wouldn't want that fallingnon your foot or your head,,because it would do that to it.,That would be bad.,But it won't wipe out, you know,nall life on Earth, so that's fine. 
 But it turns out, you don't neednsomething six miles across,to do a lot of damage.,There is a median pointnbetween tiny rock and gigantic rock,,and in fact, if any of younhave ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,,there is a crater in the desertnthere that is so iconic,that it is actuallyncalled "Meteor Crater.",To give you a sense of scale,nthis is about a mile wide.,If you look up at the top,nthat's a parking lot,,and those are recreationalnvehicles right there.,So it's about a mile across,n600 feet deep.,The object that formed thisnwas probably about 30 to 50 yards across,,so roughly the sizenof Macky Auditorium here.,It came in at speeds that were tremendous,,slammed into the ground, blew up,,and exploded with the energy of roughlyna 20-megaton nuclear bomb --,a very hefty bomb.,This was 50,000 years ago,,so it may have wiped outna few buffalo or antelope,,or something like that out in the desert,,but it probably would not have causednglobal devastation. 
 It turns out that these thingsndon't have to hit the ground,to do a lot of damage.,Now, in 1908, over Siberia,nnear the Tunguska region --,for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fansnand saw "Ghostbusters,",when he talked about the greatestncross-dimensional rift,since the Siberia blast of 1909,,where he got the datenwrong, but that's OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was 1908. That's fine.nI can live with that. 
 (Laughter) 
 Another rock cameninto the Earth's atmosphere,and this one blew up above the ground,,several miles upnabove the surface of the Earth.,The heat from the explosionnset fire to the forest below it,,and then the shock wave came downnand knocked down trees,for hundreds of square miles.,This did a huge amount of damage.,And again, this was a rocknprobably roughly the size,of this auditorium that we're sitting in.,In Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,,and metal is much tougher,nso it made it to the ground.,The one over Tunguskanwas probably made of rock,,and that's much more crumbly,nso it blew up in the air. 
 Either way, these are tremendousnexplosions -- 20 megatons.,Now, when these things blow up,,they're not going to donglobal ecological damage.,They're not going to donsomething like the dinosaur killer did.,They're just not big enough.,But they will do global economic damage,,because they don't havento hit, necessarily,,to do this kind of damage.,They don't have to do global devastation.,If one of these things were to hitnpretty much anywhere,,it would cause a panic.,But if it came over a city,nan important city --,not that any citynis more important than others,,but some of them we depend on morenon the global economic basis --,that could do a huge amount of damagento us as a civilization.,So, now that I've scarednthe crap out of you -- 
 (Laughter) 
 what can we do about this?,This is a potential threat.,Let me note that we have not hadna giant impact like the dinosaur killer,for 65 million years.,They're very rare.,The smaller ones happen more often,,but probably on the order of a millennium,,every few centuriesnor every few thousand years.,But it's still something to be aware of.,Well, what do we do about them?,The first thingnwe have to do is find them.,This is an image of an asteroidnthat passed us in 2009.,It's right here.,But you can see that it's extremely faint.,I don't know if you can see thatnin the back row.,These are just stars. 
 This is a rocknthat was about 30 yards across,,so roughly the size of the onesnthat blew up over Tunguska,and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.,These things are faint.,They're hard to see,nand the sky is really big.,We have to find these things first.,Well, the good news is,nwe're looking for them.,NASA has devoted money to this;,the National Science Foundationnand other countries,are interested in doing this.,We're building telescopesnthat are looking for the threat. 
 That's a great first step.nBut what's the second step?,The second step is if we see one headingntoward us, we have to stop it.,What do we do?,You've probably heardnabout the asteroid Apophis.,If you haven't yet, you will.,If you've heard about the Mayann2012 apocalypse,,you're going to hear about Apophis,,because you're keyed innto all the doomsday networks, anyway. 
 (Laughter) 
 Apophis is an asteroidnthat was discovered in 2004.,It's roughly 250 [meters] across,nso it's pretty big --,bigger than a football stadium.,And it's going to passnby the Earth in April of 2029.,And it's going to pass us so close,that it's actually going to comenunderneath our weather satellites.,The Earth's gravity is going to bendnthe orbit of this thing so much,that if it's just right,,if it passes through this region of space,,this kidney-bean-shaped regionncalled the keyhole,,the Earth's gravity will bend itnjust enough that seven years later,,on April 13 -- which is a Friday,nI'll note -- in the year 2036 -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you can't plan that kind of stuff -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Apophis is going to hit us.,And it's 250 meters across,nso it would do unbelievable damage.,The good news is that the odds of itnactually passing through this keyhole,and hitting us next go-aroundnare one in a million, roughly --,very, very low odds.,So I personally am not lying awakenat night worrying about this at all.,I don't think Apophis is a problem.,In fact, Apophisnis a blessing in disguise,,because it woke us upnto the dangers of these things.,This thing was discoverednjust a few years ago,and could hit us a few years from now.,It won't, but it gives us a chancento study these kinds of asteroids. 
 We didn't really necessarily understandnthese keyholes, and now we do,,and it turns out that's really important,,because how do you stopnan asteroid like this?,Well, let me ask you:,What happens if you're standingnin the road and a car's headed for you?,What do you do?,You do this. Right?nMove, and the car goes past you.,But we can't move the Earth,nat least not easily,,but we can move a small asteroid. 
 And it turns out, we've even done it.,In the year 2005, NASA launchedna probe called Deep Impact,,which slammed a piece of itselfninto the nucleus of a comet.,Comets are very much like asteroids.,The purpose wasn't to push itnout of the way;,the purpose was to make a craternto excavate the material,and see what was underneathnthe surface of this comet,,which we learned quite a bit about.,We did move the comet a little tiny bit --,not very much, but that wasn't the point.,However, think about this:,This thing is orbiting the Sunnat 10, 20 miles per second.,We shot a space probenat it and hit it, OK?,Imagine how hard that must be,nand we did it.,That means we can do it again.,If we see an asteroid that's comingntoward us, headed right for us,,and we have two years to go?,Boom! We hit it.,You know, if you watch the movies -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you might think:,Why don't we use a nuclear weapon?,Well, you can try that,nbut the problem is timing.,Shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,,you have to blow it upnwithin a few milliseconds of tolerance,,or else you'll miss it.,And there are a lot of other problemsnwith that; it's very hard to do.,But just hitting something?nThat's pretty easy.,I think even NASA can do that,nand proved that they can. 
 (Laughter) 
 The problem is, if you hit this asteroid,nyou've changed the orbit,,you measure the orbit,,then you find out, oh yeah,nwe just pushed it into a keyhole,,and now it's going to hit usnin three years.,Well, my opinion is: fine!,It's not hitting us in six months --,that's good. 
 Now we have three yearsnto do something else.,And you can hit it again.,That's kind of ham-fisted;,you might just push itninto a third keyhole or whatever,,so you don't do that.,And this is the part --,it's the part I just love. 
 (Laughter) 
 After the big macho "Grr ... bam!nWe're gonna hit this thing in the face,",then we bring in the velvet gloves. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's a group of scientistsnand engineers and astronauts,,and they call themselvesnThe B612 Foundation.,For those of you who've readn"The Little Prince,",you understand that reference, I hope --,the little prince livednon an asteroid called B612.,These are smart guys -- men and women --nastronauts, like I said, engineers.,Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9nastronaut, is on this.,Dan Durda, my friend who made this image,,works here at Southwest Research Institutenin Boulder, on Walnut Street.,He created this image for this.,He's actually one of the astronomersnwho works for them.,If we see an asteroidnthat's going to hit the Earth,and we have enough time,,we can hit it to move itninto a better orbit. 
 But then what we do is launch a probenthat has to weigh a ton or two.,It doesn't have to be huge --na couple of tons, not that big --,and you park it near the asteroid.,You don't land on it, because these thingsnare tumbling end over end.,It's very hard to land on them.,Instead you get near it.,The gravity of the asteroidnpulls on the probe,,and the probenhas a couple of tons of mass.,It has a little tiny bit of gravity,,but it's enoughnthat it can pull the asteroid,,and you have your rocket set up --,you can barely see it here,nbut there's rocket plumes --,and these guys are connectednby their own gravity,,and if you move the probenvery slowly -- very, very gently,,you can very easily finesse that rockninto a safe orbit.,You can even put in orbitnaround the Earth where we could mine it,,although that's a whole other thing;nI won't go into that. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we'd be rich! 
 (Laughter) 
 So think about this, right?,There are these giant rocks flyingnout there, and they're hitting us,,and they're doing damage to us.,But we've figured out how to do this,,and all the piecesnare in place to do this.,We have astronomersnwith telescopes, looking for them.,We have very, very smart people,,who are concerned about thisnand figuring out how to fix the problem,,and we have the technology to do this.,This probe actually can't usenchemical rockets.,Chemical rockets providentoo much thrust, too much push.,The probe would just shoot away. 
 We invented something called an ion drive,,which is a very, very,nvery low-thrust engine.,It generates the force a piece of papernwould have on your hand --,incredibly light, but it can runnfor months and years,,providing that very gentle push.,If anybody here is a fannof the original "Star Trek,",they ran across an alien shipnthat had an ion drive,,and Spock said, "They're veryntechnically sophisticated.,They're a hundred yearsnahead of us with this drive.",Yeah, we have an ion drive now.,We don't have the Enterprise,nbut we've got an ion drive now. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Spock. 
 (Laughter),So ...,That's the difference --,that's the differencenbetween us and the dinosaurs.,This happened to them.,It doesn't have to happen to us.,The differencenbetween the dinosaurs and us,is that we have a space program,and we can vote,,and so we can change our future. 
 (Laughter) 
 We have the ability to change our future.,Sixty-five million years from now,,we don't have to have our bonesncollecting dust in a museum.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I always wanted to becomena walking laboratory of social engagement:,to resonate other people's feelings,nthoughts, intentions, motivations,,in the act of being with them.,As a scientist, I always wantednto measure that resonance,,that sense of the othernthat happens so quickly,,in the blink of an eye.,We intuit other people's feelings;,we know the meaning of their actionsneven before they happen.,We're always in this stance,of being the objectnof somebody else's subjectivity.,We do that all the time.nWe just can't shake it off.,It's so important that the very toolsnwe use to understand ourselves,,to understand the world around us,,are shaped by that stance.,We are social to the core. 
 So my journey in autism really started,when I lived in a residential unitnfor adults with autism.,Most of those individualsnhad spent most of their lives,in long-stay hospitals.,This is a long time ago.,And for them, autism was devastating.,They had profoundnintellectual disabilities.,They didn't talk.,But most of all,,they were extraordinarily isolatednfrom the world around them,,from their environment,and from the people.,In fact, at the time,nif you walked into a school,for individuals with autism,,you'd hear a lot of noise,,plenty of commotion, actions,npeople doing things.,But they're always doingnthings by themselves.,So they may be lookingnat a light in the ceiling,,or they may be isolated in the corner,,or they might be engagednin these repetitive movements,,in self-stimulatory movementsnthat led them nowhere.,Extremely, extremely isolated. 
 Well, now we know that autismnis this disruption,,the disruption of this resonancenthat I am telling you about.,These are survival skills.,These are survival skillsnthat we inherited,over many, many hundredsnof thousands of years of evolution. 
 You see, babies are bornnin a state of utter fragility.,Without the caregiver,nthey wouldn't survive,,so it stands to reasonnthat nature would endow them,with these mechanisms of survival.,They orient to the caregiver.,From the first days and weeks of life,,babies prefer to hear human sounds,,rather than just soundsnin the environment.,They prefer to look at peoplenrather than at things,,and even as they're looking at people,nthey look at people's eyes,,because the eye is the windownto the other person's experiences,,so much so that they even prefernto look at people,who are looking at themnrather than people who are looking away.,Well, they orient to the caregiver.,The caregiver seeks the baby.,And it's out of this mutuallynreinforcing choreography,that a lot that is of importancento the emergence of mind --,the social mind, the socialnbrain -- depends on. 
 We always think about autism,as something that happensnlater on in life.,It doesn't; it beginsnwith the beginning of life.,As babies engage with caregivers,nthey soon realize that, well,,there is something between the earsnthat is very important --,it's invisible, you can't see it,nbut it's really critical.,And that thing is called attention.,And they learn soon enough,,even before they can utter one word,,that they can take that attentionnand move somewhere,in order to get things they want.,They also learn to follownother people's gazes,,because whatever people are looking atnis what they are thinking about.,And soon enough, they start to learnnabout the meaning of things,,because when somebodynis looking at something,or somebody is pointing at something,,they're not just gettingna directional cue.,They are getting the othernperson's meaning of that thing,,the attitude.,And soon enough, they startnbuilding this body of meanings,,but meanings that were acquirednwithin the realm of social interaction.,Those are meanings that are acquired,as part of their sharednexperiences with others. 
 Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl,,and she has autism.,And I am coming so close to hernthat I am maybe two inches from her face,,and she's quite oblivious to me.,Imagine if I did that to you,ncame two inches from your face.,You'd do probablyntwo things, wouldn't you?,You would recoil.nYou would call the police. 
 (Laughter) 
 You would do something,,because it's literally impossiblento penetrate somebody's physical space,and not get that reaction.,We do so, remember,nintuitively, effortlessly.,This is our body wisdom;,it's not something mediatednby our language.,Our body just knows that.,And we've known that for a long time. 
 And this is not somethingnthat happens to humans only.,It happens to somenof our phyletic cousins,,because if you're a monkey,nand you look at another monkey,,and that monkey has a highernhierarchy position than you,,and that is considerednto be a signal or threat,,well, you are not goingnto be alive for long.,So something that in other speciesnare survival mechanisms,,without which theynwouldn't basically live,,we bring into the context of human beings,,and this is what we neednto simply act, socially. 
 Now, she is oblivious to menand I'm so close to her,,and you think, maybe she can see you,,maybe she can hear you.,Well, a few minutes later,,she goes to the corner of the room,,and she finds a tiny little piecenof candy, an M&M.,So I could not attract her attention,,but something -- a thing -- did.,Now, most of us make a big dichotomy,between the world of thingsnand the world of people.,Now, for this girl,nthat division line is not so clear,,and the world of peoplenis not attracting her,as much as we would like.,Now, remember that we learn a great dealnby sharing experiences.,What she is doing right nownis that her path of learning is diverging,,moment by moment,,as she is isolating herselfnfurther and further.,So we feel sometimesnthat the brain is deterministic,,the brain determinesnwho we're going to be.,But, in fact, the brainnalso becomes who we are,,and at the same timenthat her behaviors are taking away,from the realm of social interaction,,this is what's happening with her mind,,and this is what's happeningnwith her brain. 
 Well, autism is the most stronglyngenetic condition,of all developmental disorders.,And it's a brain disorder.,It's a disorder that beginsnmuch prior to the time,that the child is born.,We now know that there is a verynbroad spectrum of autism.,There are those individualsnwho are profoundly intellectually disabled,but there are those that are gifted.,There are those individualsnwho don't talk at all;,there are those individualsnwho talk too much.,There are those individualsnthat if you observe them in their school,,you see them running the periphery fencenall the school day if you let them,,to those individualsnwho cannot stop coming to you,and trying to engage younrepeatedly, relentlessly,,but often in an awkward fashion,,without that immediate resonance. 
 Well, this is much more prevalentnthan we thought at the time.,When I started in this field,,we thought there were four individualsnwith autism per 10,000 --,a very rare condition.,Well, now we know it's morenlike one in 100.,There are millions of individualsnwith autism all around us. 
 The societal costnof this condition is huge,,in the US alone,nmaybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.,And you know what?,Most of those funds are associatednwith adolescents and particularly adults,who are severely disabled,,individuals who neednwraparound services --,services that are very, very intensive.,And those services can cost in excessnof 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.,Those are individuals who did notnbenefit from early treatment,,because now we knownthat autism creates itself,as individuals diverge in that pathwaynof learning that I mentioned to you.,Were we to be ablento identify this condition,at an earlier point,nand intervene and treat --,I can tell you, this has been probablynsomething that has changed my life,in the past 10 years,,this notion that we can absolutelynattenuate this condition.,Also, we have a window of opportunity,,because the brainnis malleable for just so long,,and that window of opportunitynhappens in the first three years of life.,It's not that that windowncloses; it doesn't.,But it diminishes considerably.,And yet, the median agenof diagnosis in this country,is still about five years,,and in disadvantaged populations,,the populations that don't havenaccess to clinical services,,rural populations, minorities,,the age of diagnosis is later still,,which is almost as if I were to tell you,that we are condemning those communitiesnto have individuals with autism,whose condition is goingnto be more severe.,So I feel that we havena bioethical imperative.,The science is there.,But no science is of relevance,if it doesn't have an impactnon the community.,And we just can't affordnthat missed opportunity,,because children with autismnbecome adults with autism.,And we feel that those things we can do,for these children,nfor those families, early on,,will have lifetime consequences --,for the child, for the family,nand for the community at large.,So this is our view of autism. 
 There are over a hundred genesnthat are associated with autism.,In fact, we believe there are going to be,something between 300 and 600ngenes associated with autism,,and genetic anomalies,nmuch more than just genes.,And we actually havena bit of a question here,,because if there are so manyndifferent causes of autism,,how do you go from those liabilitiesnto the actual syndrome?,Because people like myself,,when we walk into a playroom,,we recognize a child as having autism.,So how do you go from multiple causes,to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?,And the answer is what lies in between,,which is development.,And in fact, we are very interestednin those first two years of life,,because those liabilitiesndon't necessarily convert into autism.,Autism creates itself.,Were we to be able to intervenenduring those years of life,,we might attenuate for some, and Godnknows, maybe even prevent for others. 
 So how do we do that?,How do we enter that feeling of resonance,,how do we enter another person's being?,I remember when I interactednwith that 15-month-old,,the thing that came to my mind was,,"How do you come into her world?,Is she thinking about me?nIs she thinking about others?",Well, it's hard to do that,,so we had to create the technologies.,We had to basically step inside a body.,We had to see the world through her eyes. 
 And so in the past many years,,we've been building these new technologies,that are based on eye tracking.,We can see, moment by moment,nwhat children are engaging with.,This is my colleague, Warren Jones,,with whom we've been buildingnthese methods, these studies,,for the past 12 years.,And you see there a happy five-month-old,,a five-month little boynwho is going to watch things,that are brought from his world:,his mom, the caregiver,,but also experiences that he would havenwere he to be in his daycare.,What we want is to embrace that worldnand bring it into our laboratory,,but in order for us to do that,,we had to createnthese very sophisticated measures,,measures of how people, how little babies,,how newborns, engagenwith the world, moment by moment.,What is important and what is not. 
 Well, we created those measures,,and here, what you seenis what we call a funnel of attention.,You're watching a video --,those frames are separatednby about a second --,through the eyes of 35 typicallyndeveloping two-year-olds.,And we freeze one frame,,and this is what the typicalnchildren are doing.,In this scan pass, in green here,nare two-year-olds with autism.,So on that frame, the childrennwho are typical are watching this,,the emotion of expressionnof that little boy,as he's fighting a little bitnwith the little girl.,What are the children with autism doing?,They are focusing on the revolving door,,opening and shutting.,Well, I can tell you that this divergencenthat you're seeing here,doesn't happen onlynin our five-minute experiment.,It happens moment by momentnin their real lives,,and their minds are being formednand their brains are being specialized,in something other than what is happeningnwith their typical peers. 
 Well, we took a constructnfrom our pediatrician friends,,the concept of growth charts --,you know, when you takena child to the pediatrician,,and you have physical height and weight.,Well, we decided we were goingnto create growth charts,of social engagement.,We sought childrennfrom the time they're born.,What you see here on the x-axis,is two, three, four, five,nsix months and nine,,until about the age of 24 months.,This is the percent of their viewing time,that they're focusing on people's eyes,,and this is their growth chart.,They start over here --nthey love people's eyes --,and it remains quite stable.,It sort of goes up a little bitnin those initial months.,Now, let's see what's happeningnwith babies who became autistic.,It's something very different.,It starts way up here,nbut then it's a free fall.,It's very much like they broughtninto this world the reflex,that orients them to people,nbut it has no traction.,It's almost as if that stimulus -- you --,you're not exertingninfluence on what happens,as they navigate their daily lives. 
 Now, we thought those datanwere so powerful, in a way,,that we wanted to see what happenednin the first six months of life,,because if you interactnwith a two- and a three-month-old,,you'd be surprisednby how social those babies are.,And what we seenin the first six months of life,is that those two groupsncan be segregated very easily.,And using these kindsnof measures and many others,,what we found outnis that our science could, in fact,,identify this condition early on.,We didn't have to waitnfor the behaviors of autism,to emerge in the second year of life.,If we measured things that are,nevolutionarily, highly conserved,,and developmentally very early-emerging --,things that are onlinenfrom the first weeks of life --,we could push the detection of autism,all the way to those first months,,and that's what we are doing now. 
 Now, we can createnthe very best technologies,and the very best methodsnto identify the children,,but this would be for naughtnif we didn't have an impact,on what happens in their realitynin the community.,Now we want those devices, of course,,to be deployed by thosenwho are in the trenches --,our colleagues, the primary carenphysicians, who see every child --,and we need to transformnthose technologies,into something that is goingnto add value to their practice,,because they have to see so many children.,And we want to do that universallynso that we don't miss any child.,But this would be immoral,if we also did not have an infrastructurenfor intervention, for treatment.,We need to be able to worknwith the families, support the families,,to manage those first years with them.,We need to be able to really go,from universal screeningnto universal access to treatment,,because those treatmentsnare going to change,these children'snand those families' lives. 
 Now, when we think about what we [can]ndo in those first years,,I can tell you, having beennin this field for so long,,one feels really rejuvenated.,There is a sense that the sciencenthat one worked on,can actually have an impact on realities,,preventing, in fact, those experiences,that I really startednin my journey in this field.,I thought at the timenthat this was an intractable condition.,No longer. We can dona great deal of things. 
 And the idea is not to cure autism.,That's not the idea.,What we want is to make sure,that those individualsnwith autism can be free,from the devastating consequencesnthat come with it at times,,the profound intellectual disabilities,nthe lack of language,,the profound, profound isolation.,We feel that individualsnwith autism, in fact,,have a very specialnperspective on the world,,and we need diversity.,And they can work extremely wellnin some areas of strength:,predictable situations,nsituations that can be defined.,Because after all,nthey learn about the world,almost, like, about it,,rather than learningnhow to function in it.,But this is a strength if you're working,nfor example, in technology.,And there are those individualsnwho have incredible artistic abilities.,We want them to be free to do that.,We want that the next generationsnof individuals with autism,will be able not onlynto express their strengths,,but to fulfill their promise. 
 Well, thank you for listening to me. 
 (Applause)Like most journalists, I'm an idealist.,I love unearthing good stories,nespecially untold stories.,I just didn't think that in 2011,,women would still be in that category. 
 I'm the President of the Journalismnand Women Symposium -- JAWS.,That's Sharky. 
 (Laughter) 
 I joined 10 years agonbecause I wanted female role models,,and I was frustrated by the lagging statusnof women in our profession,and what that meantnfor our image in the media.,We make up halfnthe population of the world,,but we're just 24 percentnof the news subjects,quoted in news stories.,And we're just 20 percentnof the experts quoted in stories.,And now, with today's technology,,it's possible to remove womennfrom the picture completely. 
 This is a picture of PresidentnBarack Obama and his advisors,,tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.,You can see Hillary Clinton on the right.,Let's see how the photo ran,in an Orthodox Jewishnnewspaper based in Brooklyn.,Hillary's completely gone. 
 (Laughter) 
 The paper apologized,nbut said it never runs photos of women;,they might be sexually provocative. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is an extreme case, yes.,But the fact is,,women are only 19 percentnof the sources in stories on politics,,and only 20 percentnin stories on the economy.,The news continues to give us a picture,where men outnumber women,in nearly all occupationalncategories, except two:,students and homemakers. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we all get a veryndistorted picture of reality.,The problem is, of course,nthere aren't enough women in newsrooms.,They report at just 37 percent of storiesnin print, TV and radio.,Even in stories on gender-based violence,,men get an overwhelming majoritynof print space and airtime. 
 Case in point:,This March, the New York Timesnran a story by James McKinley,about a gang rape of a young girl,,11 years old, in a small Texas town.,McKinley writes thatnthe community is wondering,,"How could their boysnhave been drawn into this?","Drawn into this" --,like they were seducedninto committing an act of violence.,And the first person he quotes says,,"These boys will have to livenwith this the rest of their lives.",(Groans, laughter),You don't hear muchnabout the 11-year-old victim,,except that she wore clothesnthat were a little old for her,and she wore makeup. 
 The Times was deluged with criticism.,Initially, it defended itself,,and said, "These aren't our views.,This is what we found in our reporting.",Now, here's a secretnyou probably know already:,Your stories are constructed.,As reporters, we research, we interview.,We try to give a good picture of reality.,We also have our own unconscious biases.,But The Times makes it sound like anyonenwould have reported this story,the same way.,I disagree with that. 
 So three weeks later,,The Times revisits the story.,This time, it adds another bylinento it with McKinley's:,Erica Goode.,What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale,of a young girl and her familyntrapped in poverty.,She was raped numerous times by many men.,She had been a bright, easygoing girl.,She was maturing quickly, physically,,but her bed was still coverednwith stuffed animals.,It's a very different picture.,Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goodenis what made this story more complete. 
 The Global Media Monitoring Projectnhas found that stories by female reporters,are more likely to challenge stereotypesnthan those by male reporters.,At KUNM here in Albuquerque,,Elaine Baumgartelndid some graduate research,on the coverage of violence against women.,What she found was many of thesenstories tend to blame victims,and devalue their lives.,They tend to sensationalize,nand they lack context.,So for her graduate work,,she did a three-part seriesnon the murder of 11 women,,found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.,She tried to challenge those patternsnand stereotypes in her work,and she tried to shownthe challenges that journalists face,from external sources,ntheir own internal biases,and cultural norms.,And she worked with an editornat National Public Radio,to try to get a story aired nationally.,She's not sure that would have happenednif the editor had not been a female. 
 Stories in the news,are more than twice as likelynto present women as victims than men,,and women are more likely to be definednby their body parts.,Wired magazine, November 2010.,Yes, the issue was aboutnbreast-tissue engineering.,Now I know you're all distracted,nso I'll take that off. 
 (Laughter) 
 Eyes up here. 
 (Laughter) 
 So -- 
 (Applause) 
 Here's the thing:,Wired almost never putsnwomen on its cover.,Oh, there have been some gimmicky ones --,Pam from "The Office,",manga girls,,a voluptuous modelncovered in synthetic diamonds.,Texas State University professornCindy Royal wondered in her blog,how are young women like her studentsnsupposed to feel about their roles,in technology, reading Wired.,Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired,ndefended his choice,and said there aren't enough women,nprominent women,in technology to sell a cover,nto sell an issue.,Part of that is true,,there aren't as manynprominent women in technology. 
 Here's my problem with that argument:,Media tells us every day what's important,,by the stories they choosenand where they place them;,it's called agenda setting.,How many people knewnthe founders of Facebook and Google,before their facesnwere on a magazine cover?,Putting them therenmade them more recognizable. 
 Now, Fast Company Magazinenembraces that idea.,This is its cover from November 15, 2010.,The issue is about the most prominentnand influential women in technology.,Editor Robert Safianntold the Poynter Institute,,"Silicon Valley is very whitenand very male.,But that's not what Fast Company thinks,the business worldnwill look like in the future,,so it tries to give a picturenof where the globalized world is moving." 
 By the way, apparently,nWired took all this to heart.,This was its issue in April. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's Limor Fried, the foundernof Adafruit Industries,,in the Rosie the Riveter pose. 
 It would help to have more womennin positions of leadership in media.,A recent global survey,found that 73 percentnof the top media-management jobs,are still held by men.,But this is also about somethingnfar more complex:,our own unconsciousnbiases and blind spots. 
 Shankar Vedantam is the author,of "The Hidden Brain: How Our UnconsciousnMinds Elect Presidents,,Control Markets, Wage Wars,nand Save Our Lives.",He told the former ombudsmannat National Public Radio,,who was doing a reportnon how women fare in NPR coverage,,unconscious bias flowsnthroughout most of our lives.,It's really difficultnto disentangle those strands.,But he did have one suggestion.,He used to work for two editors,who said every story had to havenat least one female source.,He balked at first,,but said he eventually followednthe directive happily,,because his stories got better,and his job got easier. 
 Now, I don't know if onenof the editors was a woman,,but that can make the biggest difference.,The Dallas Morning Newsnwon a Pulitzer Prize in 1994,for a series it did on womennaround the world,,but one of the reporters told me,she's convincednit never would have happened,if they had not hadna female assistant foreign editor,,and they would not have gottennsome of those stories,without female reportersnand editors on the ground,,particularly onenon female genital mutilation --,men would just not be allowedninto those situations. 
 This is an important point to consider,,because much of our foreign policynnow revolves around countries,where the treatment of women is an issue,,such as Afghanistan.,What we're told in terms of argumentsnagainst leaving this country,is that the fate of the women is primary.,Now, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabulncan find women to interview.,Not so sure about rural,ntraditional areas,,where I'm guessingnwomen can't talk to strange men. 
 It's important to keep talking about this,nin light of Lara Logan.,She was the CBS News correspondent,who was brutally sexually assaultednin Egypt's Tahrir Square,,right after this photo was taken.,Almost immediately, pundits weighed in,,blaming her and saying things like,,"You know, maybe women shouldn'tnbe sent to cover those stories.",I never heard anyone say thisnabout Anderson Cooper and his crew,,who were attacked covering the same story. 
 One way to get more women into leadership,is to have other women mentor them.,One of my board members is an editornat a major global media company,,but she never thoughtnabout this as a career path,,until she met female role models at JAWS. 
 But this is not just a jobnfor super-journalists,or my organization.,You all have a stakenin a strong, vibrant media.,Analyze your news.,And speak up when there are gapsnmissing in coverage,,like people at The New York Times did.,Suggest female sourcesnto reporters and editors.,Remember -- a complete picture of realitynmay depend upon it. 
 And I'll leave you with a video clip,that I first saw in [1987]nwhen I was a student in London.,It's for The Guardian newspaper.,It's actually long before I ever thoughtnabout becoming a journalist,,but I was very interestednin how we learn to perceive our world.,Narrator: An event seen from onenpoint of view gives one impression.,Seen from another point of view,,it gives quite a different impression.,But it's only when you getnthe whole picture,,you can fully understand what's going on. 
 [The Guardian] 
 Megan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree,that we'd be better offnif we all had the whole picture.So, my name is Roger Doiron,,and I have a subversive plot. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 It is so subversive, in fact,,that it has the potentialnto radically alter the balance of power,,not only in our own country,,but in the entire world.,Now I realize, I'm sounding -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a little bit like Dr. Evil now.,I understand that.,But trust me -- we have very,nvery little in common.,His plots are all aboutndestruction and secrecy,,whereas my plots are aboutncreation and openness.,In fact, my plot can only work,if I share it with as manynpeople as possible.,So I'm going to share it with you now,,but you have to promise menyou're going to share it in turn. 
 So here it is.,Huh. That's not so good, is it?,There's nothing particularly radicalnor revolutionary about a patch of grass.,What starts to get interestingnis when we turn it into this. 
 Now, I would like to suggest to you all,that gardening is a subversive activity. 
 (Laughter) 
 Think about this:nfood is a form of energy.,It's what our body runs on,,but it's also a form of power.,And when we encourage peoplento grow some of their own food,,we're encouraging themnto take power into their hands,,power over their diet,,power over their health,and some power over their pocketbooks.,So I think that's quite subversive,nbecause we're also necessarily,talking about taking that power away,from someone else,,from other actors in societynthat currently have power,over food and health.,You can think aboutnwho those actors might be. 
 I also look at gardeningnas a sort of healthy gateway drug,,you might say, to other formsnof food freedom.,It's not long after you plant a garden,that you start to say, "Hey,nI need to start to learn how to cook." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You know, I might wantnto look into food preservation,or I might want to look upnwhere my local farmer's market,is located in my town." 
 Now the other thing, of course,nwith planting a garden,,especially a gardennin front of a white house,and on a sunny south lawn,,is you never know who you might influence. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I'm not exactly surenwhat my white house garden's influence,was on the First Lady's,,but I can tell you this:,she's had an enormous influence on me,since planting hers.,Now it hasn't been -- 
 (Laughter) 
 it hasn't been in the area of fashion.,I understand that she's justnin a completely different league there,,and I'm not even trying to compete.,But she's really inspired mento think much more boldly,about the role that I want to havenin the garden movement. 
 And so this is sort ofnwhat I'm aspiring to here. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, pretty modest, right?,I like this picture.,I think it sort of captures me well,,not that I have anyndivine connections whatsoever,,but I like my facial expression there,,because, if I've gotna worried look on my face,,it's not simply because I've gotn20 pounds of squash over my head,,but it's because I've got somenpretty heavy topics on my mind.,And I want to share some of thosenwith you right now,,starting off in the form of a verynshort video I've produced for you,,which is my best effortnto sum up the history of gastronomy,in about 15 seconds. 
 ("Also sprach Zarathustra" plays) 
 (Laughter) 
 So, here we are. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, that's a funny little clip,,but it'd be even funniernif it weren't so tragic,and if it weren't so true. 
 The reality is that we are in the midstnof an obesity epidemic,,and it's not simplynlimited to our country.,It's spreading around the world right now.,And in a sort of parallel universe,,we're also seeingnthat hunger is on the rise.,Over 900 million peoplenright now are affected by it.,That's three times the populationnof the United States.,But at the same time,,world food prices are rising,and world population is risingnand is set to reach 10 billion people,by the end of the century. 
 Now, another thing about the populationnis we know that it's increasing,,but a lot of us don't realizenthat it's also changing.,There's a fundamental shift taking place.,As of 2007, we went from beingna primarily rural planet,to being a primarily urban one,,and that has implicationsnfor how we're going to feed these people,,how we're going to get the foodnto the people in the cities.,Now, I imagine that there arensome Stephen King fans,in the audience here,,and I'm one of them.,But I can tell you, I haven't readnanything scarier than this here,,and that's this statistic:,in order to keep upnwith the growing population,,we're going to need to grow more foodnover the course of the next 50 years,than we have grown over the coursenof the past 10,000 years combined. 
 What makes this even more challenging,is that we're going to neednto grow all this food with less,,and when I say less,,I mean a number of things.,Less oil, for example.,Most reputable geologists believenthat we've already reached,peak oil production in the world.,Now, you might not think in termsnof oil and food as being linked,,but there's a very strong link, in fact.,It takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy,in our highly industrialized food system,in order to producenone calorie of food energy.,We'll also need to grownmore food with less water.,These three images come from threenvery different parts of the planet,,but they all tell the same storynof catastrophic drought. 
 We'll also need to grownmore food with less farmland.,Here, the pressures differnfrom one place to the next.,In the Global South,nwe're seeing desertification,,whereas in the north,nwe're seeing suburban sprawl. 
 We'll also have to grow more foodnwith less climate stability,and less genetic diversity.,Now, this is really important.,We need our genetic varieties,because they're a sort of insurance policynagainst climate change.,We heard earlier today,"not putting all of our eggsnin one basket.",Well, we shouldn't be doingnthe same with our tomatoes, either. 
 We're also going to neednto grow more food with less time.,Now here, I'm not simply talkingnabout the ticking time bomb,that is the global population.,I'm talking aboutnthe amount of time we all have,in order to putna decent meal on the table.,And that "31" figure therenis not something arbitrary.,That's the average amount of timenthe American family spends,preparing, eating and cleaning upnafter meals per day.,31 minutes.,So somewhere in there, we're goingnto need to also fit in growing food.,Alright?,And I think we do need to do that,,but that's also going to meannthat somewhere along the way,,something's going to have to give.,So it sort of leaves us feeling like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know?,It's time to leave townnor even perhaps leave planets.,But where do we go?,Where do we gonwhen we only have one planet?,And where do we gonwhere the going gets tough? 
 Well, if we were to listen to a lotnof our political leaders over the years,,we would simply go shopping.,Right?,Because we have this unwavering belief,,especially in American political culture,,that we can shop our waynout of just about any problem.,But the reality is something different.,We're not going to solvenour food problems and our health problems,simply by switching from regular Coke,to some future green iteration thereof.,And although the large food companiesnwould like us to believe,that we can give our childrennall of the vitamins, minerals,and immunity-buildingnsubstances that they need,without even leavingnthe chocolatey cereal aisle -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the truth is something quite different. 
 Now, what's becomeneven more troublesome of late,is that even the foodsnthat ought to be healthy aren't always so,,and we're starting to lose confidencenin our food system, I think.,The bigger it becomesnand the more complex it becomes.,And we've seen this time and time again.,This is an imagenfrom the latest E. coli outbreak.,In this case, it was in Europe,,and we think it was startednwith bean sprouts, of all things. 
 So we have this sort ofnshopper's dilemma right now.,We have all of these different foods --,30,000 foods in the averagenbig-box grocery store --,but we have less confidencenin those foods,,and we have less confidence in the actors,that are putting those foodsnon the shelves.,I think we need to redefinenwhat good food is.,This is an interesting imagenfrom Berlin, Germany,,where somebody started plantingnshopping carts and leaving them around.,Those are potatoes, by the way. 
 But in addition to redefiningnwhat good food is,,I think we need to redefinenour living spaces.,Instead of seeing this as a yard,,we need to think of it morenas like a full-service greengrocer.,That's, in fact, my yard,nand that's how I look at it.,That's what we transformed our yard into,,and I think a really keynmessage is this one:,gardens grow good food.,And when I say good food,,I mean a number of different things.,I mean food that is safe,,food that is healthy,,food that is absolutely gorgeous,and delicious. 
 Another important message is this one:,gardens grow healthy kids and families.,Those happen to be my two youngest sons,,and they look healthynand they are healthy,,and I think it has to do with the factnthat they grew up in gardens,and they know where good food comes from.,And in fact, they know hownto grow some of it themselves.,But in the current economy,nI think it's key to get this message out,,that gardens also grownimportant economic savings for families.,And you can pretty muchntake my word on this one,,because in addition to crunchingnthe vegetables a couple of years ago,,my wife and I also crunched the numbers,,and we found out that at the end,,we had saved well over 2,000 dollarsnby growing our own food. 
 So you could be asking this question now:,If gardens grow all of these great things,nhow do we grow more gardens?,That's, in fact, the questionnthat my organization,,Kitchen Gardens International,,is both asking and answering.,And our answer is essentially this one:,we're going to need to leveragenthe resources and power that we have,,the gardens and gardeners that we have,,in order to grow and inspire even more.,And as I said before, you never knownwho you might inspire. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now if this campaign was successful,,I think it wasn't simply because we hadna visionary First Lady,taking up residence at the White House --,that certainly was a major part of it --,and it wasn't simply because we hadnsome celebrity chefs and authors,saying this would be a good idea to do.,I think it was ultimately made possible,by the fact that there werena lot of people who wanted it to happen.,There was a movement that made it happen.,And my organization triednto sort of channel some of that energy,of the movement,and direct it towards the White House.,And we had a lot of luck,in terms of getting our messagenout there to the media.,We had a petition on Facebook,n110,000 signatures.,We had viral images and videos,,and we did crazy things likensymbolically putting the White House lawn,up for sale on eBay. 
 But we need to do even more,,and what we're trying to donin my organization,is to connect people online,,but also to connect people in person.,This is an image from a littlenholiday we invented,called "World Kitchen Garden Day.",It's at the end of August each year,,and it's just about bringingnpeople together in gardens,to learn from one another,,to experience a gardennas a community experience.,We also need to grownthe next generation of gardeners,,and we're doing thatnin the United States and abroad. 
 But there's still so much morenthat needs to be done,,and I think this slide sort of capturesnwhere we need to go.,We need a road map,,and I picked this slide for a reason.,We've got a bike garden on the left,and a map of the Netherlands on the right.,I was in the Netherlands early this year,and was absolutely amazednby the amount of bikes on the road;,26 percent of all trips takennin the Netherlands are by bicycle,,and it's gotten me thinking:,How do we get that happeningnin terms of food and gardens?,How would we get 26 percent of all producencoming from backyard gardens?,That might sound like a lot,,because we're probably at aboutntwo percent at the most right now.,But if you take into consideration,that at the peak of the victory gardennmovement last century,,40 percent of all producenwas coming from gardens.,We can get there again.,And I think this is a really good start.,The White House gardennis certainly very inspirational.,That's actually sort of a snapshotnof what the garden looked like,when it was planted earlier this spring --,lots of diversity, lots of healthy crops.,However, this is not a good representation,of our federal agriculture policy. 
 (Laughter) 
 If we were to take the model here,nthe diagram of that particular garden,,and sort of transpose itnonto our federal agriculture policy,,we'd get this:,billions of billions of dollarsngoing to support,just a handful of commodity crops,with just that tiny little bit at the topnfor fruits and vegetables.,This is scandalous. This is scandalous.,We need to do something about this.,I think one place we could startnis we could look at the tax code.,We're already using the tax codento encourage green transport,and green shelter.,Why not green food?,We're in the midst now of talkingnabout another stimulus package.,Why not a garden stimulus package?,Why not? 
 (Applause) 
 In terms of other thingsnthat we need to be doing,,we need to move down to the local level,and we need to make surenthat gardens are legal.,This is an illegal garden.nAt least it was.,It's from Michigan earlier this year.,It was planted by a woman,na mother of four,,and she nearly facedna 93-day jail sentence,because she planted it in her front yard.,We still have laws from the 20th century.,We need to bring our codes upnto the realities that we are facing now.,We need to figure out alsonnew ways of getting people into gardens,,people who don't have yards.,I think we also need to setngarden entrepreneurism free,,and I'm happy to say, as a Mainer,,that we are leading the way in this area.,Earlier this year, a number of Maine towns,passed local food sovereignty laws,that allow town residentsnto not only grow food,where they want to grow it,but to also sell itnthe way they want to sell it,and to the people they want to sell it to.,I think that's an incentive.,There are a lot of gardeners out there,that would be interested in scaling upntheir production if they could,,if they had a financial incentive. 
 I also think that we need to examine,the composition of the movement right now. 
 (Laughter) 
 If the movement were a 1960s beach flick,,it would be "Where The Boys Aren't." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'm going to take you to task, guys.,It's not right and it's not fairnthat the burden of this responsibility --,feeding our country and the world --,should be with the women.,OK? 
 (Applause) 
 And I'm going to challenge the women,to come up with really clever,ncreative ways of getting guys,into the gardens, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 Perhaps wearing a bathing suit? 
 (Laughter) 
 But beyond that, I think we neednto reexamine the infrastructure,that we have in place for gardens.,I think we need to creatennew infrastructure.,And this is one of the thingsnmy organization is working on right now,,sort of a local communicationsninfrastructure, very place-based,,that allows people in the same areanto connect with one another,and to help each other out.,I think we're lacking thisnat the moment -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but we can do it.,The technology is certainly there. 
 In addition to that, I think we neednanother type of infrastructure.,It would be good if we couldnall get together.,I think if we've learned anythingnthrough the TED experience,,it's that there is powernwhen we bring people together,,and I think we need to bring peoplentogether at the local level as well.,And I think we can take some inspirationnfrom a previous movement,,which was the grange movement,,a rural movement which brought farmersntogether in a single building,to meet and to recreatenand learn how to become better farmers.,I think we need a network,of suburban granges now. 
 I think one of the lastnthings that we need,is to not lose the fun of food.,Food is at its best when it's deliciousnbut shared as part of a community,,and I think that gardens can getnsome of that community vibe back as well.,So I'm going to leave with one last video,,and I'm going to revisit the short videonthat I showed you before,,but I'm going to suggestnan alternative ending.,And I think this endingnis well within our reach,,but it's really going to requirenthat we all pull together.,So here's the new history of gastronomy. 
 ("Also sprach Zarathustra" plays) 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause and cheers) 
 Thank you very much.nThank you all. Thank you.The maxim, "Know thyself"nhas been around since the ancient Greeks.,Some attribute this golden worldnknowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.,But the truth is it doesn't really matternwhich sage said it first,,because it's stillnsage advice, even today.,"Know thyself.",It's pithy almost to the pointnof being meaningless,,but it rings familiarnand true, doesn't it?,"Know thyself.",I understand this timeless dictumnas a statement about the problems,,or more exactly, the confusions,nof consciousness.,I've always been fascinatednwith knowing the self.,This fascination led mento submerge myself in art,,study neuroscience,nand later, to become a psychotherapist. 
 Today I combine all my passionsnas the CEO of InteraXon,,a thought-controlled computing company.,My goal, quite simply, is to help peoplenbecome more in tune with themselves.,I take it from thisnlittle dictum, "Know thyself.",If you think about it,,this imperative is kind of the definingncharacteristic of our species, isn't it?,I mean, it's self-awareness,that separates Homo sapiensnfrom earlier instances of our mankind. 
 Today we're often too busy,tending to our iPhones and iPodsnto really stop and get to know ourselves.,Under the deluge of minute-to-minutentext conversations,,e-mails, relentless exchangenof media channels,and passwords and appsnand reminders and Tweets and tags,,we lose sight of what all this fuss isnsupposed to be about in the first place:,Ourselves.,Much of the time we're transfixed,by all of the ways we can reflectnourselves out into the world.,And we can barely find the time to reflectndeeply back in on our own selves.,We've cluttered ourselves upnwith all this.,And we feel like we have to getnfar, far away to a secluded retreat,,leaving it all behind. 
 So we go far awaynto the top of a mountain,,assuming that perchingnourselves on a piece,is bound to give us the respite we neednto sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,,and find ourselves again.,But on that mountain where we gainnthat beautiful peace of mind,,what are we really achieving?,It's really only a successful escape.,Think of the term we use, "Retreat.",This is the term that armies usenwhen they've lost a battle.,It means we've got to get out of here.,Is this how we feelnabout the pressures of our world,,that in order to get inside ourselves,,you have to run for the hills?,And the problem with escapingnyour day-to-day life,is that you have to come home, eventually.,So when you think about it,,we're almost like a touristnvisiting ourselves over there.,And eventually, that vacation's gotnto come to an end. 
 So my question to you is,,can we find ways to know ourselvesnwithout the escape?,Can we redefine our relationshipnwith the technologized world,in order to have the heightenednsense of self-awareness that we seek?,Can we live here and now in our wired web,and still follow those ancientninstructions, "Know thyself?",I say the answer is yes.,And I'm here today to share a new way,that we're workingnwith technology to this end,,to get familiar with our inner selfnlike never before --,humanizing technologynand furthering that age-old quest of ours,to more fully know the self.,It's called thought-controlled computing. 
 You may or may not have noticed,that I'm wearing a tinynelectrode on my forehead.,This is actually a brainwave sensor,that's reading the electricalnactivity of my brain,as I give this talk.,These brainwaves are being analyzednand we can see them as a graph.,Let me show you what it looks like.,That blue line there is my brainwave.,It's the direct signal being recordednfrom my head, rendered in real time.,The green and red bars shownthat same signal displayed by frequency,,with lower frequencies here,and higher frequencies up here.,You're actually lookingninside my head as I speak.,These graphs are compelling,nthey're undulating,,but from a human's perspective,nthey're actually not very useful.,That's why we've spent a lot of time,thinking about how to make this datanmeaningful to the people who use it. 
 For instance,,what if I could use this data to find outnhow relaxed I am at any moment?,Or what if I can take that information,and put it into an organicnshape up on the screen?,The shape on the right over here,has become an indicatornof what's going on in my head.,The more relaxed I am,,the more the energy's goingnto fall through it.,I may also be interested in knowingnhow focused I am,,so I can put my level of attentionninto the circuit board on the other side.,And the more focused my brain is,,the more the circuit boardnis going to surge with energy. 
 Ordinarily, I would have no waynof knowing how focused or relaxed I was,in any tangible way.,As we know, our feelingsnabout how we're feeling,are notoriously unreliable.,We've all had stress creep upnon us without even noticing it,until we lost it on someonenwho didn't deserve it,,and then we realize that we probablynshould have checked in with ourselves,a little earlier.,This new awarenessnopens up vast possibilities,for applications that helpnimprove our lives and ourselves.,We're trying to create technologynthat uses the insights,to make our work more efficient,nour breaks more relaxing,and our connections deepernand more fulfilling than ever.,I'm going to share some of thesenvisions with you in a bit,,but first I want to takena look at how we got here.,By the way, feel free to checknin on my head at any time. 
 (Laughter) 
 My team at InteraXon and I,have been developing thought-controllednapplication for almost a decade now.,In the first phase of development,,we were really enthused by all the thingsnwe could control with our mind.,We were making things activate,nlight up and work just by thinking.,We were transcending the spacenbetween the mind and the device.,We brought to life a vast arraynof prototypes and products,that you could control with your mind,,like thought-controlled home appliances,or slot-car games or video gamesnor a levitating chair.,We created technology and applicationsnthat engaged people's imaginations,,and it was really exciting. 
 And then we were asked to do somethingnreally big for the Olympics.,We were invited to createna massive installation,at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,,were used in Vancouver,,got to control the lightingnon the CN Tower,,the Canadian Parliamentnbuildings and Niagara Falls,from all the way across the countrynusing their minds.,Over 17 days at the Olympics,n7,000 visitors from all over the world,actually got to individuallyncontrol the light,from the CN Tower, parliamentnand Niagara in real time,with their minds from acrossnthe country, 3,000 km away.,So controlling stuffnwith your mind is pretty cool. 
 But we're always interested in multitierednlevels of human interaction.,And so we began looking into inventingnthought-controlled applications,in a more complex frame than just control.,And that was responsiveness.,We realized that we had a system,that allowed technologynto know something about you.,And it could joinninto the relationship with you.,We created the responsive room,where the lights, music and blindsnadjusted to your state.,They followed these little shiftsnin your mental activity.,So as you settled into relaxationnat the end of a hard day,,on the couch in our office,,the music would mellow with you.,When you read, the desk lampnwould get brighter.,If you nod off, the system would know,ndimming to darkness as you do. 
 We then realized that if technologyncould know something about you,and use it to help you,,there's an even more valuablenapplication than that.,That you could knownsomething about yourself.,We could know sides of ourselvesnthat were all but invisible,and come to see thingsnthat were previously hidden.,Let me show you an examplenof what I'm talking about here. 
 Here's an applicationnthat I created for the iPad.,So the goal of the original game Zen Boundnis to wrap a rope around a wooden form.,So you use it with your headset.,The headset connects wirelesslynto an iPad or a smartphone.,In that headset, you have fabric sensorsnon your forehead and above the ear.,In the original Zen Bound game,,you play it by scrollingnyour fingers over the pad.,In the game that we created, of course,,you control the wooden formnthat's on the screen there with your mind.,As you focus on the wooden form,,it rotates.,The more you focus,nthe faster the rotation.,This is for real.,This is not a fake.,What's really interesting to me though,is at the end of the game, you get statsnand feedback about how you did.,You have graphs and chartsnthat tell you how your brain was doing --,not just how much rope you usednor what your high score is,,but what was going on inside of your mind.,And this is valuable feedback,that we can use to understandnwhat's going on inside of ourselves. 
 I like to call this "intra-active.",Normally, we thinknabout technology as interactive.,This technology is intra-active.,It understands what's inside of you,and builds a sortnof responsive relationship,between you and your technology,so that you can use this informationnto move you forward.,So you can use this informationnto understand you in a responsive loop.,At InteraXon --,intra-active technologynis one of our really defining mandates.,It's how we understand the world insidenand reflect it outside,into this tight loop. 
 For example, thought-controlled computing,can teach children with ADDnhow to improve their focus.,With ADD, children have a low proportionnof beta waves for focus states,and a high proportion of theta states.,So you can create applicationsnthat reward focused brain states.,So you can imagine kids playingnvideo games with their brain waves,and improving their ADDnsymptoms as they do it.,This can be as effective as Ritalin.,Perhaps even more importantly,,thought-controlled computingncan give children with ADD,insights into their own fluctuatingnmental states,,so they can better understand themselvesnand their learning needs.,The way these children will be able to usentheir new awareness to improve themselves,will upend many of the damagingnand widespread social stigmas,that people who are diagnosednas different are challenged with. 
 We can peer inside our heads,and interact with what was oncenlocked away from us,,what once mystified and separated us.,Brainwave technology can understand us,nanticipate our emotions,and find the best solutions for our needs.,Imagine this collectednawareness of the individual,computed and reflectednacross an entire lifespan.,Imagine the insights that you can gainnfrom this kind of second sight.,It would be like pluggingninto your own personal Google. 
 On the subject of Google,,today you can search and tag images,based on the thoughts and feelingsnyou had while you watched them.,You can tag picturesnof baby animals as happy,,or whatever baby animals are to you,,and then you can search that database,nnavigating with your feelings,,rather than the keywordsnthat just hint at them.,Or you could tag Facebook photos,with the emotions that you hadnassociated with those memories,and then instantly prioritizenthe streams that catch your attention,,just like this.,Humanizing technologynis about taking what's already natural,about the human-tech experience,and building technologynseamlessly in tandem with it.,As it aligns with our human behaviors,,it can allow us to makenbetter sense of what we do,and, more importantly, why.,Creating a big picturenout of all the important little details,that make up who we are. 
 With humanized technology we can monitornthe quality of your sleep cycles.,When our productivity starts to slacken,nwe can go back to that data,and see how we can make more effectivenbalance between work and play.,Do you know what causes fatigue in younor what brings out your energetic self,,what triggers cause you to be depressed,or what fun things are goingnto bring you out of that funk?,Imagine if you had access to data,that allowed you to ranknon a scale of overall happiness,which people in your lifenmade you the happiest,,or what activities brought you joy.,Would you make more time for those people?nWould you prioritize?,Would you get a divorce? 
 (Laughter) 
 What thought-controlled computingncan allow you to do,is build colorful layerednpictures of our lives.,And with this, we can get the skinnynon our psychological happenings,and build a storynof our behaviors over time.,We can begin to see the underlyingnnarratives that propel us forward,and tell us about what's going on.,And from this, we can learnnhow to change the plot, the outcome,and the character of our personal stories. 
 Two millennia ago, those Greeksnhad some powerful insights.,They knew that a fundamentalnpiece falls into place,when you start to livenout their little phrase,,when you come into contact with yourself.,They understood the powernof human narrative,and the value that we place on humansnas changing, evolving and growing.,But they understood somethingnmore fundamental --,the sheer joy in discovery,,the delight and fascinationnthat we get from the world,and being ourselves in it;,the richness that we get from seeing,nfeeling and knowing the lives that we are. 
 My mom's an artist,,and as a child, I'd often see her bringnthings to life with the stroke of a brush.,One moment, it wasnall white space, pure possibility.,The next, it was alivenwith her colorful ideas and expressions.,As I sat easel-side, watching herntransform canvas after canvas,,I learned that you couldncreate your own world.,I learned that our own inner worlds --,our ideas, emotions and imaginations --,were, in fact, not boundnby our brains and bodies.,If you could think it,nif you could discover it,,you could bring it to life. 
 To me, thought-controlled computing,is as simple and powerfulnas a paintbrush --,one more tool to unlock and enlivennthe hidden worlds within us.,I look forward to the daynthat I can sit beside you, easel-side,,watching the world that we can createnwith our new toolboxes,and the discoveriesnthat we can make about ourselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What I want to talk to you about today,is some of the problems that the militarynof the Western world --,Australia, United States,nthe UK and so on --,face in some of the deploymentsnthat they're dealing with,in the modern world at this time.,If you think about the sorts of things,we've sent Australian militarynpersonnel to in recent years,,we've got obvious thingsnlike Iraq and Afghanistan,,but you've also got things likenEast Timor and the Solomon Islands,,and so on. 
 And a lot of these deployments,that we're sendingnmilitary personnel to these days,aren't traditional wars.,In fact, a lot of the jobsnwe're asking military personnel to do,in those situations,are ones that, in their own countries --nAustralia, the US and so on --,would actually be done by police officers.,So there's a bunchnof problems that come up,for military personnelnin these situations,,because they're doing thingsnthey haven't really been trained for.,And they're doing things that thosenwho do them in their own countries,are trained very differently fornand equipped very differently for. 
 Now, there's a bunch of reasonsnwhy we send military personnel,,rather than police, to do these jobs.,If Australia had to sendn1,000 people tomorrow,to West Papua, for example,,we don't have 1,000 police officersnhanging around that could go tomorrow,,and we do haven1,000 soldiers that could go.,So when we have to send someone,nwe send the military --,they're there, they're available,,and heck, they're used to going offnand doing these things,and living by themselves,and not having all this extra support.,So they are able to do it in that sense.,But they aren't trainednthe same way police officers are,,and they're certainly not equippednthe way police officers are,,so this has raisedna bunch of problems for them,when dealing with these issues. 
 One particular thing that's come upnthat I am especially interested in,,is the question of whether,,when we're sending military personnelnto do these sorts of jobs,,we ought to be equipping them differently;,and in particular, whether we oughtnto be giving them access,to some of the nonlethal weaponsnthat police have.,Since they're doing some of the same jobs,,maybe they should havensome of those things. 
 And there's a range of places you'd thinknthose things would be really useful.,For example, when you've gotnmilitary checkpoints.,If people are approachingnthese checkpoints,and the military personnel are unsurenif this person's hostile or not,,say this person approachingnhere, and they say,,"Is this a suicide bomber or not?,Is something hidden under their clothes?,What's going to happen?",They don't know if the personnis hostile or not.,If the person doesn't follow directions,nthey may end up shooting them,,and then find out afterwardsneither, yes, we shot the right person,,or, no, this was just an innocent person,who didn't understand what was going on.,So if they had nonlethal weapons,nthen they would say,,"We can use themnin that sort of situation.,If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile,,at least we haven't killed them." 
 Another situation: this photonis from one of the missions,in the Balkans in the late 1990s.,This situation is a little bit different,,where maybe they know someone is hostile;,they've got someone shooting at them,or doing something elsenthat's clearly hostile,,throwing rocks, whatever.,But if they respond,,there's a range of other people aroundnwho are innocent people,,who might also get hurt.,It'd be collateral damage,that the militarynoften doesn't want to talk about.,So again, they'd say, "With accessnto nonlethal weapons,,if we've got someone we know is hostile,,we can do something to deal with them,,and know that if we hit anyone else,,at least we're not going to kill them." 
 Another suggestion has been,,since we're putting so manynrobots in the field,,we can see the time coming,where they're actually goingnto send robots out in the field,that are autonomous.,They'll make their own decisionsnabout who to shoot and who not to shoot,,without a human in the loop.,So the suggestion is,,if we're going to send robots outnand allow them to do this,,maybe it would be a good ideanif they were armed with nonlethal weapons,,so if the robot makes a bad decisionnand shoots the wrong person,,again, they haven't actually killed them. 
 Now, there's a whole rangenof different sorts of nonlethal weapons,,some of which are available now,,some of which they're developing.,You've got traditional thingsnlike pepper spray,,OC spray up at the top there,,or Tasers over here.,The one on the top right herenis actually a dazzling laser,,intended to just blindnthe person momentarily,and disorient them.,You've got nonlethal shotgun rounds,that contain rubber pelletsninstead of the traditional metal ones.,And this one in the middlenhere, the large truck,,is called the Active Denial System,,something the US militarynis working on at the moment. 
 It's essentially a bignmicrowave transmitter.,It's sort of your classicnidea of a heat ray.,It goes out to a really long distance,,compared to any of thesenother sorts of things.,Anybody who is hit with thisnfeels a sudden burst of heat,,and just wants to get out of the way.,It is a lot more sophisticatednthan a microwave oven,,but it basically is boilingnthe water molecules,in the very surface level of your skin.,So you feel this massive heat,,and you go, "I wantnto get out of the way.",And they think this will be really useful,in places where we need to clearna crowd out of a particular area,,if the crowd is being hostile.,If we need to keep peoplenaway from a particular place,,we can do that with these sorts of things. 
 So there's a whole rangenof different nonlethal weapons,we could give military personnel,,and there's a whole range of situations,where they're looking at them and saying,,"These things would be really useful.",But as I said,,the military and the policenare very different. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, you don't have to looknvery hard at this to recognize,that they might be very different.,In particular,,the attitude to the use of force,and the way they're trained to use force,is especially different. 
 The police --,and knowing because I've actuallynhelped to train police --,police, particularlynin Western jurisdictions at least,,are trained to De-escalate force,,to try and avoid using forcenwherever possible,,and to use lethal forcenonly as an absolute last resort.,Military personnelnare being trained for war.,So they're trained that,nas soon as things go bad,,their first response is lethal force.,The moment the fecal matternhits the rotating turbine -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you can start shooting at people.,So their attitudes,to the use of lethal forcenare very different,,and I think it's fairly obvious,that their attitude to the usenof nonlethal weapons,would also be very differentnfrom what it is with the police. 
 And since we've already hadnso many problems,with police use of nonlethalnweapons in various ways,,I thought it would be a good ideanto look at some of those things,and relate it to the military context.,I was very surprised when I startednto do this to see that, in fact,,even the people who advocated the usenof nonlethal weapons by the military,hadn't actually done that.,They generally seemed to think,,"Why would we carenwhat's happened with the police?,We're looking at something different,",and didn't seem to recognize,they were looking at prettynmuch the same stuff. 
 So I started to investigatensome of those issues,,and have a look at the waynpolice use nonlethal weapons,when they're introduced,,and some of the problems that mightnarise out of those sorts of things,when they actually do introduce them.,And of course, being Australian,,I started looking at stuff in Australia,nknowing from my own experience,of various times when nonlethal weaponsnhave been introduced in Australia. 
 One of the things I particularlynlooked at was the use of OC spray --,oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray --,by Australian police,,and seeing what had happenednwhen that had been introduced,,and those sorts of issues.,And one study that I found,na particularly interesting one,,was in Queensland,,because they had a trial periodnfor the use of pepper spray,before they actuallynintroduced it more broadly.,And I went and had a looknat some of the figures here.,Now, when they introducednOC spray in Queensland,,they were really explicit.,The police minister's and a heapnof public statements were made about it.,They were saying, "This is explicitlynintended to give police an option,between shouting and shooting.,This is something they can useninstead of a firearm,in situations where they would havenpreviously had to shoot someone." 
 So I looked at allnof the police shooting figures.,And you can't actuallynfind them very easily,for individual Australian states;,I could only find these.,This is from an Australian Institutenof Criminology report.,You can see, in the fine print at the top:,"Police shooting deaths"nmeans not just people shot by police,,but people who have shot themselvesnin the presence of police.,But these are the figuresnacross the entire country,,and the red arrow representsnthe point where Queensland said,,"Yes, this is where we're going to give,all police officersnacross the entire state,access to OC spray.",So you can see there were six deathsnsort of leading up to it,,every year for a number of years.,There was a spike a few years before,,but that wasn't actually Queensland.,Anyone know where that was?,Wasn't Port Arthur, no.,Victoria? Yes, correct.,That spike was all Victoria. 
 (Laughter) 
 So it wasn't that Queenslandnhad a particular problem,with deaths from policenshootings and so on.,So, six shootingsnacross the whole country,,fairly consistently over the years before. 
 The next two years were the yearsnthey studied -- 2001, 2002.,Anyone want to take a stabnat the number of times,,given how they've introduced this,,the number of times police in Queenslandnused OC spray in that period?,Hundreds? One? Three?,A thousand is getting better.,Explicitly introduced as an alternativento the use of lethal force --,an alternative betweennshouting and shooting.,I'm going to go out on a limb here,and say that if Queensland policendidn't have OC spray,,they wouldn't have shot 2,226 people,in those two years. 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, if you have a looknat the studies they were looking at,,the material they werencollecting and examining,,you can see the suspects were only armednin about 15 percent of cases,where OC spray was used. 
 It was routinely beingnused in this period,,and, of course, still is routinely used --,because there were no complaints about it,,not within the contextnof this study, anyway --,it was routinely being usednto deal with people who were violent,,who were potentially violent,,and also quite frequently used,to deal with people who werensimply passively noncompliant.,This person is not doing anything violent,,but they just won't donwhat we want them to.,They're not obeyingnthe directions we're giving them,,so we'll give them a shotnof the OC spray -- that'll speed them up.,Everything will work out better that way.,This was something explicitly introduced,to be an alternative to firearms,,but it's being routinely used,to deal with a whole rangenof other sorts of problems. 
 Now one of the particularnissues that comes up,with military use of nonlethal weapons --,and people actually say,n"There might be some problems" --,there's a couple of particularnproblems that get focused on.,One of those problems is: nonlethalnweapons may be used indiscriminately.,One of the fundamental principlesnof military use of force,is that you have to be discriminate;,you have to be carefulnabout who you're shooting at.,So one of the problems suggestednwith nonlethal weapons,is that they might be usednindiscriminately --,that you would use themnagainst a whole range of people,,because you don't havento worry so much anymore. 
 And in fact, one particular instancenwhere I think that actually happens,was the Dubrovka Theaternsiege in Moscow in 2002,,which probably a lot of you,nunlike most of my students at ADFA,,are old enough to remember.,So, Chechens had come innand taken control of the theater.,They were holding somethingnlike 700 people hostage.,They'd released a bunch of people,,but they still hadnabout 700 people hostage.,And the Russian military policenspecial forces, "Spetsnaz,",came in and stormed the theater.,The way they did it was to pumpnthe whole thing full of anesthetic gas.,And it turned outnthat lots of the hostages died,as a result of inhaling the gas.,It was used indiscriminately.,They pumped the whole theaternfull of the gas. 
 And it's no surprise that people died,,because you don't know how much gasneach person is going to inhale,,what position they'll fall in whennthey become unconscious, and so on.,There were, in fact,nonly a couple of people who got shot,in this episode.,So when they had a look at it afterward,,there were only a couple of peoplenwho'd apparently been shot,,by the hostage takersnor by the police forces,trying to deal with the situation.,Virtually everybody that got killed,got killed from inhaling the gas.,The final toll of hostagesnis a little unclear,,but it's certainly a few more than that,,because other people diednover the next few days.,So this was one problem they talked about,,that it might be used indiscriminately. 
 A second problemnpeople sometimes talk about,with military use of nonlethal weapons --,and it's actually why,nin the chemical weapons convention,,it's very clear that you can't usenriot-control agents,as weapons of warfare --,is that it's seen that sometimesnnonlethal weapons might be used,not as an alternative to lethal force,,but as a lethal force multiplier:,that you use nonlethal weapons first,,so your lethal weaponsnwill actually be more effective.,The people you'll be shooting atnwon't be able to get out of the way.,They won't be aware of what's happening,nand you can kill them better.,And that's exactly what happened here.,The hostage takers who hadnbeen rendered unconscious by the gas,were not taken into custody;,they were simply shot in the head.,So this nonlethal weaponnwas being used in this case,as a lethal force multiplier,,to make killing more effectivenin this particular situation. 
 Another problem I want to quickly mention,is that there's a whole heap of problems,with the way people are actuallyntaught to use nonlethal weapons,,and get trained about themnand then tested and so on.,Because they're testednin nice, safe environments,,and are taught to use themnin nice, safe environments --,like this, where you can seenexactly what's going on.,The person spraying the OC spraynis wearing a rubber glove,to make sure they don't getncontaminated, and so on.,But they're never used like that. 
 They're used out in the real world,,like in Texas, like this: 
 ["Police Taser Great-GrandmothernDuring Traffic Stop"] 
 I confess, this particular casenwas one that piqued my interest in this.,It happened while I was workingnas a research fellow,at the US Naval Academy.,News reports startedncoming up about this situation,,where this woman was arguingnwith a police officer.,She wasn't violent.,In fact, he was probablynsix inches taller than me,,and she was about this tall.,And eventually she said to him,,"Well, I'm going to get back in my car.",And he says, "If you get backnin your car, I'm going to tase you.",And she says, "Oh, go ahead.nTase me." And so he does.,And it's all captured by the video camera,running in the front of the police car.,So, she's 72.,And it's seen that this is the mostnappropriate way of dealing with her. 
 And there are other examplesnof the same sorts of things,,where you think,,"Is this really an appropriate waynto use nonlethal weapons?","Police Chief Fires Taserninto 14 year old Girl's Head.","She was running away.nWhat else was I suppose to do?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Or Florida:,"Police Taser 6-year-oldnBoy at Elementary School.",And they clearly learned a lot from it,nbecause in the same district:,"Police Review PolicynAfter Children Shocked:,2nd Child Shocked by TasernStun Gun Within Weeks.",Same police district.,Another child within weeksnof Tasering the six-year-old boy. 
 Just in case you think it's only goingnto happen in the United States,,it happened in Canada as well: 
 ["Mounties Zap 11-year-old Boy"] 
 And a colleague sent menthis one from London: 
 ["Arrested Man, 82, Shot with Taser"] 
 But my personal favorite,nI have to confess, does come from the US:,"Officers Taser 86-year-oldnDisabled Woman in her Bed." 
 (Laughter) 
 I checked the reports on this one.,I looked at it. I was really surprised.,Apparently, she took up a morenthreatening position in her bed. 
 (Laughter) 
 I kid you not,nthat's exactly what it said:,"She took up a more threateningnposition in her bed.",OK. 
 But I'd remind you --,I'm talking about militarynuses of nonlethal weapons,,so why is this relevant?,Because police are actuallynmore restrained in the use of force,than the military are.,They're trained to be morenrestrained in the use of force,than the military are.,They're trained to think more,nto try and De-escalate.,So if you have these problemsnwith police officers,with nonlethal weapons,,what on earth would make you think,it's going to be betternwith military personnel? 
 The last thing that I would like to say:,When I'm talking to the police,about what a perfect nonlethalnweapon would look like,,they almost inevitably say the same thing.,They say, "It's got to be somethingnthat's nasty enough,that people don't wantnto be hit with this weapon.,So if you threaten to use it,,people are going to comply with it.,But it's also going to be something,that doesn't leave any lasting effects.",In other words,,your perfect nonlethal weaponnis something that's perfect for abuse.,What would these guys have donenif they'd had access to Tasers,,or to a manned, portable versionnof the Active Denial System --,a small heat ray that youncan use on people,and not worry about. 
 So I think yes,,there may be ways that nonlethal weaponsnwill be great in these situations,,but there's also a whole heap of problems,that need to be considered as well. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a process engineer, I know all aboutnboilers and incinerators,and fabric filters, and cyclones,nand things like that.,But I also have Marfan syndrome.,This is an inherited disorder.,And in 1992, I participatednin a genetic study,,and found to my horror,nas you can see from the slide,,that my ascending aortanwas not in the normal range,,the green line at the bottom.,Everyone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,,and I was already up at 4.4.,And as you can see,nmy aorta dilated progressively,,and I got closer and closer to the pointnwhere surgery was going to be necessary. 
 The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.,Anesthetize you, open your chest,,put you on an artificialnheart and lung machine,,drop your body temperaturento about 18 centigrade,,stop your heart, cut the aorta out,,replace it with a plastic valvenand a plastic aorta.,And most importantly, commit younto a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.,Normally, warfarin.,The thought of the surgerynwas not attractive.,The thought of the warfarinnwas really quite frightening. 
 So I said to myself,,"I'm an engineer, I'm in R&D,nthis is just a plumbing problem.","I can do this, I can change this.",So I set out to change the entirentreatment for aortic dilation.,The project aim is really quite simple.,The only real problemnwith the ascending aorta,in people with Marfan syndrome,is that it lacks some tensile strength.,So, the possibility existsnto simply externally wrap the pipe,,and it would remain stablenand operate quite happily.,If your high-pressure hose pipenor hydraulic line bulges a little,,you just wrap some tape around it,nit really is that simple.,In concept, though not in execution.,The great advantagenof an external support, for me,,was that I could retainnall of my own bits,,all of my own endothelium and valves,,and not need any anticoagulation therapy. 
 So, where do we start?,This is a sagittal slice through me.,In the middle, you can seenthat little structure squeezing out,,that's the left ventricle,,pushing blood outnthrough the aortic valve.,You can see two of the leafletsnof the aortic valve working there.,Up into the ascending aorta.,And it's that part, the ascending aorta,,which dilates and ultimately bursts,nwhich of course is fatal.,We started by organizing image acquisition,from magnetic resonancenand CT imaging machines,,from which to make a modelnof the patient's aorta. 
 This is a model of my aorta.,I've got a real one in my pocket,,if anyone would like to look at it,nand play with it. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can see it's quitena complex structure.,It has a funny tri-lobal shapenat the bottom,,which contains the aortic valve.,It then comes back into a round form,,and then tapers and curves off.,It's quite a difficult structurento produce.,This is a sort of CAD model of me,,and this is one of the later CAD models.,We went through an iterative processnof producing better and better models.,When we produced that model,,we turned it into a solid,nplastic model, as you can see,,using a rapid prototyping technique,nanother engineering technique.,We then used that former,to manufacture a perfectly bespokenporous textile mesh,,which takes the shape of the formernand perfectly fits the aorta.,So this is absolutely personalizednmedicine at its best, really.,Every patient we donhas an absolutely bespoke implant. 
 Once you've made it,nthe installation is quite easy.,John Pepper, bless his heart,nprofessor of cardiothoracic surgery.,Never done it before in his life,nhe put the first one in, didn't like it,,he put the second one in.,Happy, away I went.,Four and a half hours on the table,nand everything was done.,So the surgical implantationnwas actually the easiest part. 
 If you compare our new treatmentnto the existing alternative,,the composite aortic root graft,,there are one or two startling comparisons,which I'm sure will benclear to all of you.,Two hours to install one of our devices,,compared to 6 hoursnfor the existing treatment.,As I said, the existing treatmentnrequires the heart-lung bypass machine,,and it requires a total body cooling.,We don't need any of that.nWe work on a beating heart.,He opens you up,,he accesses the aortanwhile your heart is beating,,all at the right temperature.,No breaking into your circulatory system.,So it really is great. 
 But for me, absolutely the best point is,,there is no anticoagulationntherapy required.,I don't take any drugs at all,,other than recreational onesnthat I would choose to take. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in fact, if you speak to peoplenwho are on long-term warfarin,,it is a serious compromisento your quality of life,,and even worse, it inevitablynforeshortens your life.,Likewise, if you haventhe artificial valve option,,you're committed to antibiotic therapy,whenever you havenany intrusive medical treatment,,even trips to the dentistnrequire that you take antibiotics,,in case you get an internalninfection on the valve.,Again, I don't have any of that,nso I'm entirely free,,my artery is fixed.,I haven't got to worry about it,nwhich is a rebirth for me. 
 Back to the theme of the presentation,nmultidisciplinary research,,how on earth does a process engineernused to working with boilers,end up producing a medical devicenwhich transforms his own life?,Well, the answer to that is,na multidisciplinary team.,This is a list of the core team,,and you can see there aren't only twonprincipal technical disciplines there,,medicine and engineering,,but also, there are various specialistsnfrom within those two disciplines.,John Pepper was the cardiac surgeonnwho did all the actual work on me.,But everyone else had to contributenone way or another.,Raad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.,We had to get good-quality imagesnfrom which to make the CAD model.,Warren Thornton, who still doesnall our CAD models for us,,had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code,to produce this model from thisnreally rather difficult input data set. 
 There are some barriers to this, though,nthere are some problems.,Jargon is a big one.,I would think no one in this roomnunderstands the first four jargon points.,The engineers amongst you will recognizen"rapid prototyping" and "CAD.",The medics amongst you, if there are any,nwill recognize the first two,,but there will be nobody else herenthat understands all those four words.,Taking the jargon out was very important,to ensure that everyone in the teamnunderstood exactly what was meant,when a particular phrase was used. 
 Our disciplinary conventionsnwere funny as well.,We took a lot of horizontal slicenimages through me,,produced those slices and used themnto build a CAD model.,And the very first CAD model we made,,the surgeons were playing with itnand couldn't quite figure it out.,And then we realized that it was actuallyna mirror image of the real aorta.,And it was a mirror imagenbecause in the real world,,we always look down on plans,,plans of houses, or streets, or maps.,In the medical world,nthey look up at plans.,So the horizontal imagesnwere all in inversion.,So, one needs to be carefulnwith disciplinary conventions.,Everyone needs to understandnwhat is assumed and what is not. 
 Institutional barriers werenanother serious headache in the project.,The Brompton Hospital was taken over,by the Imperial CollegenSchool of Medicine.,And there are some seriously badnrelationship problems,between the two organizations.,I was working with the Imperialnand the Brompton,,and this generated some seriousnproblems for the project.,Really, problems that shouldn't exist. 
 Research & Ethics Committee.,If you want to do anything new in surgery,,you have to get a licensenfrom your local Research & Ethics.,I'm sure it's the same in Poland.,There will be some form of equivalentnwhich licenses new types of surgery.,We didn't only have the bureaucraticnproblems associated with that,,we also had professional jealousies.,There were peoplenon the Research & Ethics committee,who really didn't want to seenJohn Pepper succeed again.,Because he is so successful.,And they made extra problems for us. 
 Bureaucratic problems.,Ultimately, when you have a new treatment,,you have to have a guidance notenfor all the hospitals in the country.,In the UK, we have the National Institutenand Clinical Excellence.,You have an equivalentnin Poland, no doubt.,And we had to get past the NICE problem.,We now have a great clinicalnguidance, out on the net.,So any other hospitals interestedncan come along, read the NICE report,,get in touch with us,nand then get doing it themselves. 
 Funding barriers, another big areanto be concerned with.,A big problem with understandingnone of those perspectives.,When we first approached one of the big,ncharitable UK organizations,that fund this kind of stuff,,we essentially gave themnan engineering proposal.,They didn't understand it,nthey were doctors, next to God,,it must be rubbish, they binned it.,So in the end, I went afternprivate investors, just gave up on it.,Most R&D is going to beninstitutionally funded,,by the Polish Academy of Sciences,or the Engineering and Physical SciencesnResearch Council, or whatever.,And you need to get past those people. 
 Jargon is a huge problemnwhen you try to work across disciplines,,because in an engineering world,nwe all understand CAD and RP.,Not in the medical world.,I suppose the funding bureaucratsnultimately have to get their act together.,They've really got to startntalking to each other,,and exercise a bit of imagination,nif that's not too much to ask. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which it probably is. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've coined the phrasen"obstructive conservatism.",So many people in the medical worldndon't want to change.,Particularly when some jumped-up engineernhas come along with the answer.,They don't want to change.,They simply want to donwhatever they've done before.,And in fact, many surgeonsnin the UK are still waiting,for one of our patientsnto have some sort of an episode,,so that they could say,n"Told you that was no good.",We've actually got 30 patients.,At seven and a half years,,we've got 90 post-opnpatient years between us,,and we haven't had a single problem.,And still, there are peoplenin the UK saying,,"That external aortic root,nit will never work, you know." 
 It really is a problem.,I'm sure everyone in this roomnhas come across arrogance,amongst medics, doctors,nsurgeons, at some point.,The middle point is simply the waynthat the doctors protect themselves.,"Well, of course,nI'm looking after my patient.",I think it's not good, but that's my view. 
 Egos, of course, again a huge problem.,If you work in a multidisciplinary team,,you've got to give your guysnthe benefit of the doubt,,you've got to express support for them.,Tom Treasure, professornof cardiothoracic surgery.,Incredible guy.,Dead easy to give him respect.,Him giving me respect? Slightly different. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's all the bad news.,The good news is,nthe benefits are stonkingly huge.,Translate that one! I bet they can't. 
 (Laughter) 
 When you have a group of peoplenwith different professional training,,a different professional experience,,they not only have a differentnknowledge base,,but also a different perspectivenon everything.,And if you can bring them together,,and get them talkingnand understanding each other,,the results can be spectacular.,You can find really novel solutionsnthat have never been looked at before,,very quickly and easily.,You can short-cut huge amounts of work,simply by using the extendednknowledge base you have.,And as a result,nit's an entirely different use,of the technologynand the knowledge around you. 
 The result of all this is that you can getnincredibly quick progress,on incredibly small budgets.,I'm so embarrassed at how cheapnit was to get from my idea,to me being implanted,that I'm not preparednto tell you what it cost,,because I suspect there arenabsolutely standard surgical treatments,,probably in the USA,,which cost more for a one-off patient,than the cost of us getting fromnmy dream to my reality. 
 That's all I want to say,nand I've got three minutes left.,So, Ewa's going to like me.,If you have any questions,nplease come up and talk to me later on,,it would be a pleasure to speak with you. 
 Many thanks. 
 (Applause)I study how the brain processes,information. That is, how it takes,information in from the outside world, and,converts it into patterns of electrical activity,,and then how it uses those patterns,to allow you to do things --,to see, hear, to reach for an object.,So I'm really a basic scientist, not,a clinician, but in the last year and a half,I've started to switch over, to use what,we've been learning about these patterns,of activity to develop prosthetic devices,,and what I wanted to do today is show you,an example of this.,It's really our first foray into this.,It's the development of a prosthetic device,for treating blindness. 
 So let me start in on that problem.,There are 10 million people in the U.S.,and many more worldwide who are blind,or are facing blindness due to diseases,of the retina, diseases like,macular degeneration, and there's little,that can be done for them.,There are some drug treatments, but,they're only effective on a small fraction,of the population. And so, for the vast,majority of patients, their best hope for,regaining sight is through prosthetic devices.,The problem is that current prosthetics,don't work very well. They're still very,limited in the vision that they can provide.,And so, you know, for example, with these,devices, patients can see simple things,like bright lights and high contrast edges,,not very much more, so nothing close,to normal vision has been possible. 
 So what I'm going to tell you about today,is a device that we've been working on,that I think has the potential to make,a difference, to be much more effective,,and what I wanted to do is show you,how it works. Okay, so let me back up a,little bit and show you how a normal retina,works first so you can see the problem,that we were trying to solve.,Here you have a retina.,So you have an image, a retina, and a brain.,So when you look at something, like this image,of this baby's face, it goes into your eye,and it lands on your retina, on the front-end,cells here, the photoreceptors.,Then what happens is the retinal circuitry,,the middle part, goes to work on it,,and what it does is it performs operations,on it, it extracts information from it, and it,converts that information into a code.,And the code is in the form of these patterns,of electrical pulses that get sent,up to the brain, and so the key thing is,that the image ultimately gets converted,into a code. And when I say code,,I do literally mean code.,Like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face,",and so when the brain gets this pattern,of pulses, it knows that what was out there,was a baby's face, and if it,got a different pattern it would know,that what was out there was, say, a dog,,or another pattern would be a house.,Anyway, you get the idea. 
 And, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic,,meaning that it's changing all the time,,so the patterns of pulses are changing,all the time because the world you're,looking at is changing all the time too.,So, you know, it's sort of a complicated,thing. You have these patterns of pulses,coming out of your eye every millisecond,telling your brain what it is that you're seeing.,So what happens when a person,gets a retinal degenerative disease like,macular degeneration? What happens is,is that, the front-end cells die,,the photoreceptors die, and over time,,all the cells and the circuits that are,connected to them, they die too.,Until the only things that you have left,are these cells here, the output cells,,the ones that send the signals to the brain,,but because of all that degeneration,they aren't sending any signals anymore.,They aren't getting any input, so,the person's brain no longer gets,any visual information --,that is, he or she is blind. 
 So, a solution to the problem, then,,would be to build a device that could mimic,the actions of that front-end circuitry,and send signals to the retina's output cells,,and they can go back to doing their,normal job of sending signals to the brain.,So this is what we've been working on,,and this is what our prosthetic does.,So it consists of two parts, what we call,an encoder and a transducer.,And so the encoder does just,what I was saying: it mimics the actions,of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images,in and converts them into the retina's code.,And then the transducer then makes the,output cells send the code on up,to the brain, and the result is,a retinal prosthetic that can produce,normal retinal output.,So a completely blind retina,,even one with no front-end circuitry at all,,no photoreceptors,,can now send out normal signals,,signals that the brain can understand.,So no other device has been able,to do this. 
 Okay, so I just want to take,a sentence or two to say something about,the encoder and what it's doing, because,it's really the key part and it's,sort of interesting and kind of cool.,I'm not sure "cool" is really the right word, but,you know what I mean.,So what it's doing is, it's replacing,the retinal circuitry, really the guts of,the retinal circuitry, with a set of equations,,a set of equations that we can implement,on a chip. So it's just math.,In other words, we're not literally replacing,the components of the retina.,It's not like we're making a little mini-device,for each of the different cell types.,We've just abstracted what the,retina's doing with a set of equations.,And so, in a way, the equations are serving,as sort of a codebook. An image comes in,,goes through the set of equations,,and out comes streams of electrical pulses,,just like a normal retina would produce. 
 Now let me put my money,where my mouth is and show you that,we can actually produce normal output,,and what the implications of this are.,Here are three sets of,firing patterns. The top one is from,a normal animal, the middle one is from,a blind animal that's been treated with,this encoder-transducer device, and the,bottom one is from a blind animal treated,with a standard prosthetic.,So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art,device that's out there right now, which is,basically made up of light detectors,,but no encoder. So what we did was we,presented movies of everyday things --,people, babies, park benches,,you know, regular things happening -- and,we recorded the responses from the retinas,of these three groups of animals.,Now just to orient you, each box is showing,the firing patterns of several cells,,and just as in the previous slides,,each row is a different cell,,and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller,and thinner so I could show you,a long stretch of data. 
 So as you can see, the firing patterns,from the blind animal treated with,the encoder-transducer really do very,closely match the normal firing patterns --,and it's not perfect, but it's pretty good --,and the blind animal treated with,the standard prosthetic,,the responses really don't.,And so with the standard method,,the cells do fire, they just don't fire,in the normal firing patterns because,they don't have the right code.,How important is this?,What's the potential impact,on a patient's ability to see?,So I'm just going to show you one,bottom-line experiment that answers this,,and of course I've got a lot of other data,,so if you're interested I'm happy,to show more. So the experiment,is called a reconstruction experiment.,So what we did is we took a moment,in time from these recordings and asked,,what was the retina seeing at that moment?,Can we reconstruct what the retina,was seeing from the responses,from the firing patterns? 
 So, when we did this for responses,from the standard method and from,our encoder and transducer.,So let me show you, and I'm going to,start with the standard method first.,So you can see that it's pretty limited,,and because the firing patterns aren't,in the right code, they're very limited in,what they can tell you about,what's out there. So you can see that,there's something there, but it's not so clear,what that something is, and this just sort of,circles back to what I was saying in the,beginning, that with the standard method,,patients can see high-contrast edges, they,can see light, but it doesn't easily go,further than that. So what was,the image? It was a baby's face.,So what about with our approach,,adding the code? And you can see,that it's much better. Not only can you,tell that it's a baby's face, but you can,tell that it's this baby's face, which is a,really challenging task.,So on the left is the encoder,alone, and on the right is from an actual,blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.,But the key one really is the encoder alone,,because we can team up the encoder with,the different transducer. 
 This is just actually the first one that we tried.,I just wanted to say something about the standard method.,When this first came out, it was just a really,exciting thing, the idea that you,even make a blind retina respond at all.,But there was this limiting factor,,the issue of the code, and how to make,the cells respond better,,produce normal responses,,and so this was our contribution.,Now I just want to wrap up,,and as I was mentioning earlier,of course I have a lot of other data,if you're interested, but I just wanted to give,this sort of basic idea,of being able to communicate,with the brain in its language, and,the potential power of being able to do that.,So it's different from the motor prosthetics,where you're communicating from the brain,to a device. Here we have to communicate,from the outside world,into the brain and be understood,,and be understood by the brain. 
 And then the last thing I wanted,to say, really, is to emphasize,that the idea generalizes.,So the same strategy that we used,to find the code for the retina we can also,use to find the code for other areas,,for example, the auditory system and,the motor system, so for treating deafness,and for motor disorders.,So just the same way that we were able to,jump over the damaged,circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's,output cells, we can jump over the,damaged circuitry in the cochlea,to get the auditory nerve,,or jump over damaged areas in the cortex,,in the motor cortex, to bridge the gap,produced by a stroke. 
 I just want to end with a simple,message that understanding the code,is really, really important, and if we,can understand the code,,the language of the brain, things become,possible that didn't seem obviously,possible before. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've always had a fascinationnfor computers and technology,,and I made a few apps for the iPhone,niPod touch, and iPad.,I'd like to share a couple with you today.,My first app was a uniquenfortune teller called "Earth Fortune",that would displayndifferent colors of Earth,depending on what your fortune was.,My favorite and most successful app,is "Bustin Jieber," which is -- 
 (Laughter) 
 which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole. 
 (Laughter) 
 I created it becausena lot of people at school,disliked Justin Bieber a little bit,,so I decided to make the app.,So I went to work programming it,,and I released itnjust before the holidays in 2010.,A lot of people ask me,nhow did I make these?,A lot of times it's becausenthe person who asked the question,wants to make an app also.,A lot of kids these daysnlike to play games,,but now they want to make them,nand it's difficult,,because not many kids know where to gonto find out how to make a program.,I mean, for soccer,nyou could go to a soccer team.,For violin, you could getnlessons for a violin.,But what if you want to make an app?,And the kid's parents might have donensome of these things when they were young,,but not many parents have written apps. 
 (Laughter) 
 Where do you go to find outnhow to make an app?,Well, this is how I approached it,nthis is what I did.,First of all, I've been programmingnin multiple other programming languages,to get the basics down,,such as Python, C, Java, etc.,And then Apple released the iPhone,,and with it, the iPhonensoftware development kit,,and the software development kitnis a suite of tools,for creating and programmingnan iPhone app.,This opened up a whole new worldnof possibilities for me,,and after playing with the softwarendevelopment kit a little bit,,I made a couple of apps,nI made some test apps.,One of them happened to ben"Earth Fortune,",and I was ready to putn"Earth Fortune" on the App Store,,and so I persuaded my parentsnto pay the 99 dollar fee,to be able to put my appsnon the App Store.,They agreed, and now I havenapps on the App Store.,I've gotten a lot of interestnand encouragement,from my family, friends, teachersnand even people at the Apple Store,,and that's been a huge help to me. 
 I've gotten a lotnof inspiration from Steve Jobs,,and I've started an app club at school,,and a teacher at my schoolnis kindly sponsoring my app club.,Any student at my school can comenand learn how to design an app.,This is so I can sharenmy experiences with others.,There's these programsncalled the iPad Pilot Program,,and some districts have them.,I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.,A big challenge is,nhow should the iPads be used,,and what apps should we put on the iPads?,So we're getting feedbacknfrom teachers at the school,to see what kind of apps they'd like.,When we design the app and we sell it,,it will be free to local districts;nand other districts that we sell to --,all the money from that will goninto the local ed foundations. 
 These days, students usually knowna little bit more than teachers,with the technology. 
 (Laughter) 
 So -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is a resource to teachers,,and educators should recognizenthis resource and make good use of it. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd like to finish up by sayingnwhat I'd like to do in the future.,First of all, I'd like to createnmore apps, more games.,I'm working with a third partyncompany to make an app.,I'd like to get into Androidnprogramming and development,,and I'd like to continue my app club,,and find other ways for studentsnto share knowledge with others. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Over the last 13 years --,one, three, 13 years --,I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel,and partners around the world,for taking this idea, this concept,,noninvasive surgery,,from the research lab to routine clinical use.,And this is what I'll tell you about.,13 years --,for some of you, you can empathize with that number.,For me, today, on this date,,it's like a second bar mitzvah experience. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this dream,is really enabled,by the convergence,of two known technologies.,One is the focused ultrasound,,and the other one is the,vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.,So let's first talk about focused ultrasound.,And I hold in my hand,a tissue-mimicking phantom.,It is made out of silicon.,It is transparent, made just for you.,So you see, it's all intact,,completely transparent.,I'll take you now to the acoustic lab.,You see the phantom within the aquarium.,This is a setup I put in a physics lab.,On the right-hand side,,you see an ultrasonic transducer.,So the ultrasonic transducer,emits basically an ultrasonic beam,that focuses inside the phantom.,Okay, when you hear the click,,this is when the energy starts to emit,and you see a little lesion form,inside the phantom.,Okay, so everything around it,is whole and intact.,It's just a lesion formed inside.,So think about, this is in your brain.,We need to reach a target inside the brain.,We can do it without harming any tissue.,So this is, I think,,the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound,,the force of ultrasound.,You know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.,And you know also about lithotripsy --,breaking kidney stones.,But ultrasound can be shaped,to be anything in between,,because it's a mechanical force.,Basically, it's a force acting on a tissue,that it transverses.,So you can change the intensity, the frequency,,the duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasound,to create anything,from an airbrush to a hammer.,And I am going to show you,multiple applications in the medical field,that can be enabled,just by focusing,,physically focusing. 
 So this idea,of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain,is not new at all.,When I was born, this idea was already conceived,by pioneers such as the Fry brothers,and Lars Leksell,,who is know actually,as the inventor of the gammaknife.,But you may not know,that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,,noninvasively,,with focused ultrasound in the '50s.,He failed,,so he then invented the gammaknife.,And it makes you ponder,why those pioneers failed.,And there was something fundamental,that they were missing.,They were missing the vision.,It wasn't until the invention of the MR,and really the integration of MR,with focused ultrasound,that we could get the feedback --,both the anatomical and the physiological,in order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loop,surgical procedure. 
 So this is how it looks, you know,,the operating room of the future today.,This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.,And I will give you several examples.,So the first one is in the brain.,One of the neurological conditions,that can be treated with focused ultrasound,are movement disorders,,like Parkinson's or essential tremor.,What is typical to those conditions,,to essential tremor for example,,is inability,to drink or eat cereal or soup,without spilling everything all over you,,or write legibly so people can understand it,,and be really independent in your life,without the help of others. 
 So I'd like you to meet John.,John is a retired professor of history,from Virginia.,So he suffered from essential tremor for many years.,And medication didn't help him anymore.,And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery,to have people cut into their brain.,And about four or five months ago,,he underwent an experimental procedure.,It is approved under an FDAIDE,at the University of Virginia,in Charlottesville,using focused ultrasound,to ablate a point in his thalamus.,And this is his handwriting.,"On June 20th," if you can read it,,"2011.",This is his handwriting,on the morning of the treatment,before going into the MR,So now I'll take you through,[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,,[what] noninvasive surgery looks like. 
 So we put the patient on the MR table.,We attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,,but if it will be a different organ,,it will be a different transducer attached to the patient.,And the physician,will then take a regular MR scan.,And the objective of that?,I don't have a pointer here,,but you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?,This is the sort of general area of the treatment.,It's a safety boundary,around the target.,It's a target in the thalamus.,So once those pictures are acquired,and the physician has drawn,all the necessary safety limits and so on,,he selects basically a point --,you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is --,and he presses this blue button called "sonicate.",We call this instance of injecting the energy,,we call it sonication.,The only handwork the physician does here,is moving a mouse.,This is the only device he needs in this treatment. 
 So he presses "sonicate," and this is what happens.,You see the transducer, the light blue.,There's water in between the skull and the transducer.,And it does this burst of energy.,It elevates the temperature.,We first need to verify,that we are on target.,So the first sonication,is at lower energy.,It doesn't do any damage,,but it elevates the temperature,by a few degrees.,And one of the unique capabilities,that we leverage with the MR,is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.,This is really a unique capability of the MR.,It is not being used,in regular diagnostic imaging.,But here we can get,both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.,And you can see the points there on the graph.,The temperature was raised,to 43 degrees C temporarily.,This doesn't cause any damage.,But the point is we are right on target.,So once the physician verifies,that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,,then we move to perform,a full-energy ablation,like you see here.,And you see the temperature rises,to like 55 to 60 degrees C.,If you do it for more than a second,,it's enough to basically destroy,the proteins of the cells. 
 This is the outcome from a patient perspective --,same day after the treatment.,This is an immediate relief.,(Applause),Thank you.,John is one of [about] a dozen,very heroic, courageous people,who volunteered for the study.,And you have to understand,what is in people's mind,when they are willing to take the risk.,And this is a quote from John after he wrote it.,He said, "Miraculous.",And his wife said, "This is the happiest moment of my life.",And you wonder why.,I mean, one of the messages I like to carry over,is, what about defending quality of life?,I mean, those people lose their independence.,They are dependent on others.,And John today is fully independent.,He returned to a normal life routine.,And he also plays golf,,like you do in Virginia,when you are retired.,Okay, so you can see here the spot.,It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.,There's no damage outside.,He suffers from no neurodeficit.,There's no recovery needed, no nothing.,He's back to his normal life. 
 Let's move now,to a more painful subject.,Pain is something,that can make your life miserable.,And people are suffering from all kinds of pain,like neuropathic pain, lower-back pain,and cancer pain from bone metastases,,when the metastases get to your bones,,sometimes they are very painful.,All those I've indicated,have already been shown,to be successfully treated,by focused ultrasound,relieving the pain, again, very fast.,And I would like to tell you,about PJ.,He's a 78 year-old farmer,who suffered from -- how should I say it? --,it's called pain in the butt.,He had metastases in his right buttock,,and he couldn't sit,even with medication.,He had to forgo all the farm activities.,He was treated with radiation therapy,,state-of-the-art radiation therapy,,but it didn't help.,Many patients like that favor radiation therapy. 
 And again, he volunteered,to a pivotal study,that we ran worldwide,,also in the U.S.,And his wife actually took him.,They drove like three hours,from their farm to the hospital.,He had to sit on a cushion,,stand still, not move,,because it was very painful.,He took the treatment,,and on the way back,,he drove the truck by himself.,So again, this is an immediate relief.,And you have to understand,what those people feel,and what their family experiences,when it happens.,He returned again,to his daily routine on the farm.,He rides his tractor.,He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.,And he has been very happy. 
 But now, you ask me,,but what about war, the war on cancer?,Show us some primary cancer.,What can be done there?,So I have good news and bad news.,The good news: there's a lot that can be done.,And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.,And doing that in the U.S.,is very painful.,I don't see, without this nation,taking it as some collective will,or something that is a national goal to make that happen,,it will not happen.,And it's not just because of regulation;,it's because of the amount of money needed,under the current evidence-based medicine,and the size of trials and so on,to make it happen. 
 So the first two applications,are breast cancer and prostate cancer.,They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.,And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.,But I have a message for the men here.,We heard here yesterday Quyen,talking about the adverse event trait,in prostate cancer.,There is a unique opportunity now,with focused ultrasound guided by MR,,because we can actually think about,prostate lumpectomy --,treating just the focal lesion,and not removing the whole gland,,and by that, avoiding all the issues,with potency and incontinence.,Well, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen --,quite lethal, very lethal actually --,pancreas, liver, kidney.,The challenge there,with a breathing and awake patient --,and in all our treatments,,the patient is awake and conscious,and speaks with the physician --,is you have to teach the MR some tricks,how to do it in real time.,And this will take time.,This will take two years. 
 But I have now a message to the ladies.,And this is, in 2004,,the FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds,for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.,Women suffer from that disease.,All those tumors,have heavy bleeding during periods,,abdominal pressure, back pain,,frequent urination.,And sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnant,because of the fibroid.,This is Frances.,She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.,This is a big fibroid.,She was offered a hysterectomy,,but this is an inconceivable proposition,for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.,So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure,in 2008.,And in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.,So new life was born. 
 (Applause) 
 So in conclusion,,I'd like to leave you with actually four messages.,One is, think about the amount,of suffering that is saved,from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,,and also the economical and emotional burden,removed from their families and communities,and the society at large --,and I think also from their physicians, by the way.,And the other thing I would like you to think about,is the new type of relationship,between physician and patients,when you have a patient on the table,[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.,In all our treatments,,the patient holds a stop sonication button.,He can stop the surgery at any moment. 
 And with that note,,I would like to thank you for listening. 
 (Applause)Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer --,if not personally,,then through a loved one, a family member,,colleague, friend.,And once our lives are touched by cancer,,we quickly learn,that there are basically,three weapons, or three tools, that are available,to fight the disease:,surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.,And once we get involved,in the therapeutic decisions,,again either personally,or with our loved ones and family members,,we also very quickly learn,the benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations,of these tools. 
 I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark,and the TEDMED team,for inviting me today,to describe a fourth tool, a new tool,,that we call Tumor Treating Fields.,Tumor Treating Fields,were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti,,professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.,And they use low-intensity,electric fields,to fight cancer.,To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work,,we first need to understand,what are electric fields. 
 Let me first address,a few popular misconceptions.,First of all, electric fields,are not an electric current,that is coursing through the tissue.,Electric fields,are not ionizing radiation,,like X-rays or proton beams,,that bombard tissue,to disrupt DNA.,And electric fields,are not magnetism.,What electric fields are,are a field of forces.,And these forces,act on, attract, bodies,that have an electrical charge. 
 The best way to visualize an electric field,is to think of gravity.,Gravity is also a field of forces,that act on masses.,We can all picture astronauts in space.,They float freely in three dimensions,without any forces acting on them.,But as that space shuttle,returns to Earth,,and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field,,they begin to see the effects of gravity.,They begin to be attracted towards Earth.,And as they land,,they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.,We're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.,That's why you're all in your chairs.,And that's why we have to use our muscle energy,to stand up, to walk around,and to lift things. 
 In cancer,,cells rapidly divide,and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.,We can think of a cell,from an electrical perspective,as if it's a mini space station.,And in that space station,we have the genetic material, the chromosomes,,within a nucleus.,And out in the cytoplasmic soup,we have special proteins,that are required for cell division,that float freely in this soup,in three dimensions.,Importantly, those special proteins,are among the most highly charged objects,in our body.,As cell division begins,the nucleus disintegrates,,the chromosomes line up,in the middle of the cell,and those special proteins,undergo a three-dimensional sequence,whereby they attach,and they literally click into place end-on-end,to form chains.,These chains,then progress and attach,to the genetic material,and pull the genetic material,from one cell into two cells.,And this is exactly how,one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells,,two cancer cells become four cancer cells,,and we have ultimately,uncontrolled tumor growth. 
 Tumor Treating Fields,use externally placed transducers,attached to a field generator,to create an artificial electric field,on that space station.,And when that cellular space station,is within the electric field,,it acts on those highly charged proteins,and aligns them.,And it prevents them from forming those chains,,those mitotic spindles,,that are necessary to pull the genetic material,into the daughter cells.,What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide,for several hours.,And they will either enter into,this so-called cellular suicide,,programmed cell death,,or they will form unhealthy daughter cells,and enter into apoptosis,once they have divided.,And we can observe this. 
 What I'm going to show you next,are two in vitro experiments.,This is cultures, identical cultures,,of cervical cancer cells.,And we've stained these cultures,with a green florescent dye,so that we can look at these proteins,that form these chains.,The first clip shows,a normal cell division,without the Tumor Treating Fields.,What we see,are, first of all, a very active culture,,a lot of divisions,,and then very clear nuclei,once the cells have separated.,And we can see them dividing throughout.,When we apply the fields --,again, in the identical time-scale,to the identical culture --,you're going to see something different.,The cells round up for division,,but they're very static in that position.,We'll see two cells,in the upper part of the screen,attempting to divide.,The one within the circle manages.,But see how much of the protein,is still throughout the nucleus,,even in the dividing cell.,The one up there can't divide at all.,And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling,,is the hallmark,of apoptosis in this cell. 
 Formation of healthy mitotic spindles,is necessary for division,in all cell types.,We've applied Tumor Treating Fields,to over 20 different cancers in the lab,,and we see this effect,in all of them.,Now importantly,,these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect,on normal undividing cells. 
 10 years ago,,Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure,to develop his discovery,into a practical therapy for patients.,In that time, Novocure's developed two systems --,one system for cancers in the head,and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.,The first cancer that we have focused on,is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.,GBM affects about 10,000 people,in the U.S. each year.,It's a death sentence.,The expected five year survival,is less than five percent.,And the typical patient,with optimal therapy,survives just a little over a year,,and only about seven months,from the time that the cancer is first treated,and then comes back and starts growing again. 
 Novocure conducted,its first phase three randomized trial,in patients with recurrent GBM.,So these are patients,who had received surgery,,high dose radiation to the head,and first-line chemotherapy,,and that had failed and their tumors had grown back.,We divided the patients into two groups.,The first group received second-line chemotherapy,,which is expected to double the life expectancy,,versus no treatment at all.,And then the second group,received only Tumor Treating Field therapy.,What we saw in that trial,is that that the life expectancies of both groups --,so the chemotherapy treated group,and the Tumor Treating Field group --,was the same.,But importantly,,the Tumor Treating Field group,suffered none of the side effects,typical of chemotherapy patients.,They had no pain,,suffered none of the infections.,They had no nausea, diarrhea,,constipation, fatigue,that would be expected. 
 Based on this trial,,in April of this year,,the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields,for the treatment of patients,with recurrent GBM.,Importantly, it was the first time ever,that the FDA included,in their approval of an oncology treatment,a quality of life claim. 
 So I'm going to show you now,one of the patients,from this trial.,Robert Dill-Bundi,is a famous Swiss cycling champion.,He won the gold medal in Moscow,in the 4,000 meter pursuit.,And five years ago,,Robert was diagnosed with GBM.,He received the standard treatments.,He received surgery.,He received high dose radiation to the head.,And he received first-line chemotherapy.,A year after this treatment --,in fact, this is his baseline MRI.,You can see that the black regions,in the upper right quadrant,are the areas where he had surgery.,And a year after that treatment,,his tumor grew back with a vengeance.,That cloudy white mass that you see,is the recurrence of the tumor. 
 At this point, he was told by his doctors,that he had about 3 months to live.,He entered our trial.,And here we can see him getting the therapy.,First of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.,They're attached to the skin,in the area of the tumor.,Here you can see,that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.,The patients learn to do this themselves,And then the patients,can undergo all the activities of their daily life.,There's none of the tiredness.,There's none of what is called the "chemo head.",There's no sensation.,It doesn't interfere,with computers or electrical equipment.,And the therapy is delivered continuously,at home,,without having to go into the hospital,either periodically or continually. 
 These are Robert's MRIs,,again, under only TTField treatment.,This is a therapy that takes time to work.,It's a medical device;,it works when it's on.,But what we can see is, by month six,,the tumor has responded,and it's begun to melt away.,It's still there.,By month 12,,we could argue whether,there's a little bit of material around the edges,,but it's essentially completely gone.,It's now five years,since Robert's diagnosis,,and he's alive,,but importantly, he's healthy,and he's at work.,I'm going to let him, in this very short clip,,describe his impressions of the therapy,in his own words. 
 (Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life,,I rate what I have today,a bit different than what most people would assume.,I am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.,And every single morning I appreciate life.,Every night I fall asleep very well,,and I am, I repeat,,the happiest man in the world,,and I'm thankful I am alive. 
 BD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer,as the second target.,We've run a phase two trial,in Switzerland,on, again, recurrent patients --,patients who have received standard therapy,and whose cancer has come back.,I'm going to show you another clip,of a woman named Lydia.,Lydia's a 66 year-old farmer,in Switzerland.,She was diagnosed with lung cancer,five years ago.,She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy,over two years,,none of which had an effect.,Her cancer continued to grow.,Three years ago,,she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial. 
 You can see, in her case,,she's wearing her transducer arrays,,one of the front of her chest, one on the back,,and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.,You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator,,but importantly you can also see that she is living her life.,She is managing her farm.,She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.,And when we talked to her,,she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy,,she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.,Her whole family suffered,as her side effect profile came and went.,Now she can run,all of the activities of her farm.,It's only the beginning. 
 (Applause) 
 In the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies,between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.,There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School,to pick the optimum pairs,to maximize that benefit.,We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation,and interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.,There's now a new research project underway,at the Karolinska in Sweden,to prove that hypothesis. 
 We have more trials planned,for lung cancer,,pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer,and breast cancer.,And I firmly believe,that in the next 10 years,Tumor Treating Fields,will be a weapon available to doctors and patients,for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.,I'm also very hopeful,that in the next decades,,we will make big strides,on reducing that death rate,that has been so challenging in this disease. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've spent the last decade,subjecting myself to pain and humiliation,,hopefully for a good cause,,which is self-improvement.,And I've done this in three parts.,So first I started with the mind.,And I decided to try to get smarter,by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica,from A to Z --,or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec.",And here's a little image of that.,And this was an amazing year.,It was really a fascinating journey.,It was painful at times,,especially for those around me.,My wife started to fine me one dollar,for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.,So it had its downsides. 
 But after that,,I decided to work on the spirit.,As I mentioned last year,,I grew up with no religion at all.,I'm Jewish,,but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.,(Laughter),Not really.,But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage,by actually diving in,and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.,So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.,And from the Ten Commandments,to growing my beard --,because Leviticus says you cannot shave.,So this is what I looked like by the end.,Thank you for that reaction.,(Laughter),I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.,I got both of them.,So there was the topiary there.,And there's the sheep. 
 Now the final part of the trilogy,was I wanted to focus on the body,and try to be the healthiest person I could be,,the healthiest person alive.,So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.,And I just finished a couple of months ago.,And I have to say, thank God.,Because living so healthily was killing me.,(Laughter),It was so overwhelming,,because the amount of things you have to do,,it's just mind-boggling.,I was listening to all the experts,and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.,And they were telling me,all the things I had to do.,I had to eat right,,exercise, meditate, pet dogs,,because that lowers the blood pressure.,I wrote the book on a treadmill,,and it took me about a thousand miles,to write the book.,I had to put on sunscreen.,This was no small feat,,because if you listen to dermatologists,,they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.,And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.,So I think half of my book advance,went into sunscreen.,I was like a glazed doughnut,for most of the year.,There was the washing of hands.,I had to do that properly.,And my immunologist told me,that I should also wipe down,all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,,because those are just orgies of germs.,So that took a lot of time. 
 I also tried to be the safest person I could be,,because that's a part of health.,I was inspired,by the Danish Safety Council.,They started a public campaign,that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet.",So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,,but also for walking around.,And you can see there,they're shopping with their helmets.,(Laughter),Well yeah, I tried that.,Now it's a little extreme, I admit.,But if you think about this,,this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this --,that more people die on a per mile basis,from drunk walking,than from drunk driving.,So something to think about tonight,if you've had a couple. 
 So I finished,,and it was a success in a sense.,All of the markers went in the right direction.,My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,,my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.,So that was nice.,And it was successful overall.,But I also learned that I was too healthy,,and that was unhealthy.,I was so focused on doing all these things,that I was neglecting my friends and family.,And as Dan Buettner can tell you,,having a strong social network,is so crucial to our health. 
 So I finished.,And I kind of went overboard,on the week after the project was over.,I went to the dark side,,and I just indulged myself.,It was like something out of Caligula.,(Laughter),Without the sex part.,Because I have three young kids,,so that wasn't happening.,But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.,And I finally have stabilized.,So now I'm back,to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore --,but dozens of healthy behaviors,that I adopted during my year.,It was really a life-changing project.,And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.,Let me just tell you two really quickly. 
 The first is -- and this was surprising to me;,I didn't expect this to come out --,but I live a much quieter life now.,Because we live in such a noisy world.,There's trains and planes and cars,and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.,(Laughter),And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard --,not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,,but it actually initiates,the fight-or-flight response.,A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.,And this, over the years,,can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.,The World Health Organization just did a big study,that they published this year.,And it was done in Europe.,And they estimated,that 1.6 million years of healthy living,are lost every year in Europe,because of noise pollution.,So they think it's actually very deadly. 
 And by the way,,it's also terrible for your brain.,It really impairs cognition.,And our Founding Fathers knew about this.,When they wrote the Constitution,,they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall,so that they could concentrate.,So without noise reduction technology,,our country would not exist.,So as a patriot,,I felt it was important to --,I wear all the earplugs and the earphones,,and it's really improved my life,in a surprising and unexpected way. 
 And the second point I want to make, the final point,,is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED --,that joy is so important to your health,,that very few of these behaviors,will stick with me,unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.,And just to give you one instance of this:,food.,The junk food industry,is really great,at pressing our pleasure buttons,and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.,But I think we can use their techniques,and apply them to healthy food.,To give just one example,,we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.,So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness,into a lot of my recipes --,throw in some sunflower seeds.,And you can almost trick yourself,into thinking you're eating Doritos.,(Laughter),And it has made me a healthier person. 
 So that is it.,The book about it comes out in April.,It's called "Drop Dead Healthy.",And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.,That's my greatest hope. 
 So thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Now when we think of our senses,,we don't usually think of the reasons,why they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.,We don't really think of the evolutionary need,to be protected by our senses,,but that's probably why our senses really evolved --,to keep us safe, to allow us to live.,Really when we think of our senses,,or when we think of the loss of the sense,,we really think about something more like this:,the ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,,to smell something fragrant,,to see something beautiful.,This is what we want out of our senses.,We want beauty; we don't just want function.,And when it comes to sensory restoration,,we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty.,And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today. 
 Likewise for hearing.,When we think about why we hear,,we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren,,although clearly that's an important thing.,Really what we want to hear is music. 
 (Music) 
 So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.,Many of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf,,when he wrote that.,Now I'd like to impress upon you,how unusual it is that we can hear music.,Music is just one of the strangest things that there is.,It's acoustic vibrations in the air,,little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.,Somehow in tickling our eardrum,that transmits energy down our hearing bones,,which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea,and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves,that somehow wind up in our brains,as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music.,That process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual.,And we could discuss that topic alone for days,to really try to figure out, how is it that we hear something that's emotional,from something that starts out as a vibration in the air? 
 Turns out that if you have hearing loss,,most people that lose their hearing,lose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear.,And it's at the hair cell level that they do this.,Now if you had to pick a sense to lose,,I have to be very honest with you,and say, we're better at restoring hearing,than we are at restoring any sense that there is.,In fact, nothing even actually comes close,to our ability to restore hearing.,And as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients,that if you had to pick a sense to lose,,we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.,As a musician, I can tell you,that if I had to have a cochlear implant,,I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken,,because I know that music would never sound the same to me. 
 Now this is a video that I'm going to show you,of a girl who's born deaf.,She's in a very supportive environment.,Her mother's doing everything she can.,Okay, play that video please. 
 (Video) Mother: That's an owl.,Owl, yeah.,Owl. Owl.,Yeah.,Baby. Baby.,You want it?,(Kiss) 
 Charles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child,in terms of family support,and simple infused learning,,there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf,,has in this world,in terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities.,I'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful, wonderful life.,I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles,that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face. 
 Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss,has really evolved in the past 200 years.,I mean literally,,they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears,and stick funnels in.,And that was the best you could do for hearing loss.,Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.,So it's not too surprising,that there were no good treatments for hearing loss. 
 And now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant,,which is an outpatient procedure.,It's surgically placed inside the inner ear.,It takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done,,under general anesthesia.,And in the end, you achieve something like this,where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea.,Now actually, this is quite crude,in comparison to our regular inner ear. 
 But here is that same girl who is implanted now.,This is her 10 years later.,And this is a video that was taken,by my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.,If we could play this video please. 
 (Video) John Niparko: So you've written two books? 
 Girl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?),Girl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.) 
 JN: Well this book has seven chapters,,and the last chapter,is entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf.",Do you remember writing that chapter? 
 Girl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter. 
 JN: Yeah.,Girl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.,So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her. 
 JN: I see. And who is that? 
 Girl: Holly. (JN: Okay.) 
 Mother: Her sister. (JN: Her sister.) Girl: My sister. 
 JN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her? 
 Girl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.,(Laughter),It comes in handy. 
 JN: So you don't want to hear everything that's out there? 
 Girl: No. 
 CL: And so she's phenomenal.,And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.,It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.,However, despite this incredible facility,that some cochlear implant users display with language,,you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.,In fact, most implant users really struggle,and dislike music because it sounds so bad.,And so when it comes to this idea,of restoring beauty to somebody's life,,we have a long way to go when it comes to audition. 
 Now there are a lot of reasons for that.,I mentioned earlier the fact,that music is a different capacity because it's abstract.,Language is very different. Language is very precise.,In fact, the whole reason we use it,is because it has semantic-specificity.,When you say a word,,what you care is that word was perceived correctly.,You don't care that the word sounded pretty,when it was spoken. 
 Music is entirely different.,When you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?,There's really very little point in listening to music,when it doesn't sound good to you.,The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.,And you can see on this figure,,that the frequency range,and the decibel range, the dynamic range of music,is far more heterogeneous.,So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant,,what we would try to do,is target it to be able to allow music transmission.,Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.,If you can hear music,,you should be able to hear anything. 
 Now the problems begin first with pitch perception.,I mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.,And without the ability to perceive pitch well,,music and melody is a very difficult thing to do --,forget about a harmony and things like that.,Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.,Now if we could just play this. 
 (Music) 
 Okay, now if we consider,that in a cochlear implant patient,pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves,,let's see what happens here,when we randomize this to within one semitone.,We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.,Go ahead and play this one. 
 (Music) 
 Now my goal in showing you that,is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.,You distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.,And it might be that you kind of like that.,That's kind of hypnotic.,But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.,And you're not hearing the same thing,that most people who have normal hearing are hearing. 
 Now the other issue comes with,,not just the ability to tell pitches apart,,but the ability to tell sounds apart.,Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument.,If we could play these two sound clips in succession.,(Trumpet),The trumpet.,And the second one.,(Violin),That's a violin.,These have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments.,Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference,between these instruments.,The sound quality, or the sound of the sound,is how I like to describe timbre, tone color --,they cannot tell these things whatsoever.,This implant is not transmitting,the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth. 
 Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant,and you have them listen to speech,,have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody,,what you find is that the auditory cortex,is the most active during speech.,You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech,,they were designed for speech.,But actually if you look at melody,,what you find is that there's very little cortical activity,in implant users compared with normal hearing controls.,So for whatever reason,,this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices,during melody perception. 
 Now the next question is,,well how does it really sound?,Now we've been doing some studies,to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users.,I'm going to play you two clips of Usher,,one which is normal,and one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies,and not even that many mid frequencies.,Go ahead and play that. 
 (Music) 
 (Limited Frequency Music) 
 I had patients tell me that those sound the same.,They cannot differentiate sound quality differences,between those two clips.,Again, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to. 
 Now the question comes to mind: Is there any hope?,And yes, there is hope.,Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is.,This is ... does somebody know?,This is Beethoven.,Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like?,Because his grave was exhumed.,And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died,to try to look at the cause of his deafness,,which is why he has molding clay,and his skull is bulging out on the side there.,But Beethoven composed music,long after he lost his hearing.,What that suggests is that, even in the case of hearing loss,,the capacity for music remains.,The brains remain hardwired for music. 
 I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo,where I've been working on deaf cats that are white,and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.,This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food. 
 (Music) 
 Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her.,(Music),The "1812 Overture" isn't worth waking for.,(Trumpet),But she jumps to action when called to duty!,(Trumpet) 
 CL: Now I'm not suggesting,that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.,I'm suggesting that with training,you can imbue a musical sound with significance,,even in a cat.,If we were to direct efforts,towards training cochlear implant users to hear music --,because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that,,no rehabilitative strategies,,very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music --,we would come a long way. 
 Now I want to show you one last video.,And this is of a student of mine named Joseph,who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab.,He's deaf, and he learned to play the piano,after he received the cochlear implant.,And here's a video of Joseph. 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Joseph: I was born in 1986.,And at about four months old,,I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss.,Not long after,,I was fitted with hearing aids.,But although these hearing aids,were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time,,they weren't very helpful.,So as a result, I had to rely on lip reading a lot,,and I couldn't really hear what people were saying.,When I was 12 years old,,I was one of the first few people in Singapore,who underwent cochlear implantation.,And not long after I got my cochlear implant,,I started learning how to play piano.,And it was absolutely wonderful.,Since then, I've never looked back. 
 CL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.,He is now a medical student at Yale University,,and he's contemplating a surgical career --,one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery.,There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.,And this is really unheard of stuff, and this is all because of this technology.,And the fact that he can play the piano like that,is a testament to his brain.,Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant,,because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time.,You don't actually have to hear it.,I know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke.,(Laughter),And it's one of the most awful things --,heartwarming, but awful.,(Laughter),And so there is certainly a lot of hope,,but there's a lot more that needs to be done. 
 So I just want to conclude with the following words.,When it comes to restoration of hearing,,we have certainly come a long way, a remarkably long way.,And we have a much longer way to go,when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing.,And let me tell you right now,,it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech.,But I tell you, if we lost our hearing,,if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing,,you would want perfect hearing back.,You wouldn't want decent hearing, you would want perfect hearing.,Restoration of basic sensory function is critical.,And I don't mean to understate,how important it is to restore basic function.,But it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty,where we can get inspiring.,And I don't think that we should give up on beauty. 
 And I want to thank you for your time. 
 (Applause)Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60,,and I don't like being 60.,(Laughter),And I started grappling,with this existential angst,of what little I had done with my life.,It wasn't the resume,of breaking this record here,,it was more like, who had I become?,How had I spent my valuable time?,How could this have gone by,like lightning?,And I couldn't forgive myself,for the countless, countless hours,I had lost,in negative thought --,all the time I had spent beating myself up,for losing my marriage,and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid,and career moves,and this and this and this.,Just why, why didn't I do it better? Why? Why? Why?,And then my mother died at 82.,And so I starting thinking,,not only am I not happy with the past,,now I'm getting choked with,,"I've only got 22 years left.",What am I going to do with this short amount of time,that's just fleeting?,And I'm not in the present whatsoever. 
 And I decided the remedy to all this malaise,was going to be,for me to chase,an elevated dream,,an extreme dream,,something that would require,utter conviction,and unwavering passion,,something that would make me,be my best self,in every aspect of my life,,every minute of every day,,because the dream was so big,that I couldn't get there,without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction.,And I decided,,it was an old dream that was lingering,,that was from so many years ago,,three decades ago --,the only sort of world class swim,I had tried and failed at back in my 20s --,was going from Cuba to Florida.,It was deep in my imagination. 
 No one's ever done it without a shark cage.,It's daunting.,It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.,It's probably, at my speed, at my age --,for anybody's speed at anybody's age --,going to take 60, maybe 70, hours,of continuous swimming,,never getting out on the boat. 
 And I started to train.,I hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.,And I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal.,As a matter of fact,,this picture is supposed to be me during training.,It's a smiling face.,And when you're training for this sport, you are not smiling.,(Laughter),It's an arduous, difficult sport,,and I don't remember smiling,at any time during this sport.,As I said, I respect other sports,,and I compare this sport sometimes,to cycling and to mountain climbing,and other of the expedition type events,,but this is a sensory deprivation,,a physical duress.,And when I started in,with the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours,and the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims,,I knew I had it,,because I was making it through these. 
 And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim,,and we're coming into the dock after a long day,and it's now night,,and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes,and I can touch the dock and we're done,,the trainer says, "That's great.,It's 14 hours 58 minutes. Who cares the last two minutes?",I say, "No, it's got to be 15 hours,",and I swim another minute out and another minute back,to make the 15 hours. 
 And I put together an expedition.,It's not that I didn't have help,,but honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader.,And to get the government permissions,,you read in the paper,,you think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday?,Try going in with an armada like we had,of 50 people and five boats,and CNN's crew, etc.,The navigation is difficult.,There's a big river called the Gulf Stream,that runs across,and it's not going in the direction you are.,It's going to the east and you'd like to go north.,It's tricky.,And there's dehydration.,And there's hypothermia.,And there are sharks.,And there are all kinds of problems.,And I gathered together, honestly,,the world's leading experts in every possible way. 
 And a month ago,,the 23rd of September,,I stood on that shore,and I looked across,to that long, long faraway horizon,and I asked myself,,do you have it?,Are your shoulders ready?,And they were. They were prepared.,No stone left unturned.,Was the mind ready?,You know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles,,you're swimming at 60 strokes a minute,,so you're never really focused on anything, you don't see well.,You've got tight bathing caps over your ears,trying to keep the heat of the head,,because it's where the hypothermia starts,,and so you don't hear very well.,You're really left alone with your own thoughts.,And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there,in English, followed by German,,followed by Spanish, followed by French.,You save the French for last. 
 And I had songs, I had a playlist in my head --,not through headphones, in my own head --,of 65 songs.,And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night,,because that's when Neil Young comes out.,(Laughter),And it's odd, isn't it?,You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah",out in the majesty of the ocean,,not songs about heroin addiction in New York City.,But no, for some reason,I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night,and be singing,,♫ "A heard you knocking at my cellar door ♫,♫ I love you baby and I want some more ♫,♫ Ooh, ooh, the damage done" ♫ 
 (Applause) 
 The night before I started,,I finished Stephen Hawking's "The Grand Design.",And I couldn't wait,to trip the mind fantastic.,About the 50th hour,,I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe.,Is there an edge?,Is this an envelope we're living inside of,,or no, does it go onto infinity in both time and space?,And there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean,that gets you thinking about things like this.,I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am,,that nobody else in the world can do this swim.,And I knew I could do it. 
 And when I jumped into that water,,I yelled in my mother's French, "Courage!",And I started swimming,,and, oh my God, it was glassy.,And we knew it, all 50 people on the boat,,we all knew this was it,,this was our time.,And I reminded myself a couple hours in,,you know, the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself.,First of all, you're going to hit obstacles.,And even though you're feeling great at any one moment,,don't take it for granted, be ready,,because there's going to be pain, there's going to be suffering.,It's not going to feel this good all the way across.,And I was thinking of the hypothermia,and maybe some shoulder pain,and all the other things --,the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater.,You're immersed in the liquid.,Your body doesn't like the saltwater.,After a couple of days, three days,,you tend to rebel,in a lot of physical ways. 
 But no, two hours in,,wham! Never in my life ...,I knew there were Portuguese men o' war,,all kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things,,but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans,is not supposed to be in these waters.,And I was on fire --,excruciating, excruciating pain.,I don't know if you can still see,the red line here and up the arm.,Evidently, a piece this big of tentacle,has a hundred-thousand little barbs on it,and each barb is not just stinging your skin,,it's sending a venom.,The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean,is the box jellyfish.,And every one of those barbs,is sending that venom into this central nervous system.,So first I feel like boiling hot oil,,I've been dipped in.,And I'm yelling out, "Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!,Help me! Somebody help me!",And the next thing is paralysis.,I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here,,and I can't breathe.,And now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke,,I'm sort of crabbing it this way.,Then come convulsions. 
 A young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me.,He's stung.,They drag him out on the boat,,and he's -- evidently, I didn't see any of this -- but lying on the boat,and giving himself epinephrine shots,and crying out.,He's 29 years old,,very well-built, lean, he's six-foot, five,,weighs 265 lbs.,,and he is down.,And he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer,who's trying to help me.,And he's saying, "Bonnie, I think I'm going to die.,My breath is down to three breaths a minute.,I need help, and I can't help Diana." 
 So that was at eight o'clock at night.,The doctor, medical team from University of Miami,arrived at five in the morning.,So I swam through the night,,and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots.,I didn't get out,,but was in the water taking prednisone shots, taking Xanax,,oxygen to the face.,It was like an ICU unit,in the water.,(Laughter),And I guess the story is,that even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly,,they're done.,They either die or they quickly get to a hospital. 
 And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.,And the next night at dusk,,again, wham!,The box jelly again --,all across the neck, all across here.,And this time,,I don't like it, I didn't want to give into it,,but there's a difference between a non-stop swim,and a staged swim.,And I gave in,to the staged swim.,And they got me out and they started again,with the epinephrine and the prednisone,and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board.,And I got back in.,And I swam through that night and into the next day.,And at 41 hours,,this body couldn't make it.,The devastation of those stings,had taken the respiratory system down,so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted.,And the dream was crushed. 
 And how odd,is this intelligent person who put this together,and got all these world experts together.,And I knew about the jellyfish,,but I was sort of cavalier.,A lot of athletes have this, you know,,sort of invincibility.,They should worry about me. I don't worry about them.,I'll just swim right through them.,We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it.,Well there was no grin and bearing this. 
 As a matter of fact, the best advice I got,was from an elementary school class,in the Caribbean.,And I was telling these kids, 120 of them --,they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor --,and I was telling them about the jellyfish,and how they're gelatinous,and you can't see them at night especially.,And they have these,long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles.,And they do this wrapping.,And they can send the poison into the system. 
 And a little kid from the back was like this.,And I said, "What's your name?" "Henry.","Henry, what's your question?",He said, "Well, I didn't have a question so much,as I had a suggestion.",He said, "You know those guys,who really believe in what they believe in,and so they wear bombs?",And I said, "Well it's odd that you've learned of this,as a noble kind of pursuit, but yeah, I know those guys.",He said, "That's what you need.,You need like a school of fish,that would swim in front of you like this.",(Laughter),"And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish,,they're going to be busy with them,,and you'll just scoot around.",I said, "Oh, it's like a suicide army.",He said, "That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need." 
 And little did I know,,that you should listen to eight year-olds.,And so I started that swim,in a bathing suit like normal,,and, no joke, this is it; it came from the shark divers.,I finished the swim like this.,I was swimming with this thing on.,That's how scared of the jellyfish I was. 
 So now what do I do?,I wouldn't mind,if every one of you came up on this stage tonight,and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.,Because we've all had them, haven't we?,We've all had a heartache.,And so my journey now,is to find some sort of grace,in the face of this defeat.,And I can look at the journey,,not just the destination.,I can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight,and say I was courageous.,Yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 And with all sincerity, I can say,,I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way,,because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore,,I got there with that goal.,When you live that way, when you live with that kind of passion,,there's no time, there's no time for regrets,,you're just moving forward.,And I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way,,swim or no swim.,But the difference,in accepting this particular defeat,is that sometimes,,if cancer has won,,if there's death and we have no choice,,then grace and acceptance,are necessary. 
 But that ocean's still there.,This hope is still alive.,And I don't want to be the crazy woman,who does it for years and years and years,,and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails,,but I can swim from Cuba to Florida,,and I will swim from Cuba to Florida. 
 Thank you.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 And so, what after that?,Are you going to swim the Atlantic?,No, that's the last swim.,It's the only swim I'm interested in.,But I'm ready.,And by the way, a reporter called me the other day,and he said he looked on Wikipedia,and he said he saw my birthday was August 22nd 1949,,and for some odd reason in Wikipedia,,they had my death date too.,(Laughter),He said, "Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City,,and it's going to be in January of '35?",I said, "Nope. I didn't know.",And now I'm going to live to 85.,I have three more years than I thought. 
 And so I ask myself,,I'm starting to ask myself now,,even before this extreme dream,gets achieved for me,,I'm asking myself,,and maybe I can ask you tonight too,,to paraphrase the poet,Mary Oliver,,she says, "So what is it,,what is it you're doing,,with this one wild and precious life of yours?" 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you.,Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause),Live it large. Live it large.I want to talk to you,about one of the biggest myths in medicine,,and that is the idea,that all we need are more medical breakthroughs,and then all of our problems will be solved.,Our society loves to romanticize,the idea of the single, solo inventor,who, working late in the lab one night,,makes an earthshaking discovery,,and voila, overnight everything's changed.,That's a very appealing picture,,however, it's just not true.,In fact, medicine today is a team sport.,And in many ways,,it always has been.,I'd like to share with you a story,about how I've experienced this very dramatically,in my own work. 
 I'm a surgeon,,and we surgeons have always had,this special relationship with light.,When I make an incision inside a patient's body, it's dark.,We need to shine light to see what we're doing.,And this is why, traditionally,,surgeries have always started so early in the morning --,to take advantage of daylight hours.,And if you look at historical pictures,of the early operating rooms,,they have been on top of buildings.,For example, this is the oldest operating room in the Western world,,in London,,where the operating room,is actually on top of a church,with a skylight coming in.,And then this is a picture,of one of the most famous hospitals in America.,This is Mass General in Boston.,And do you know where the operating room is?,Here it is,on the top of the building,with plenty of windows to let light in. 
 So nowadays in the operating room,,we no longer need to use sunlight.,And because we no longer need to use sunlight,,we have very specialized lights,that are made for the operating room.,We have an opportunity,to bring in other kinds of lights --,lights that can allow us to see,what we currently don't see.,And this is what I think,is the magic of fluorescence. 
 So let me back up a little bit.,When we are in medical school,,we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this,where everything's color-coded.,Nerves are yellow, arteries are red,,veins are blue.,That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?,However, when we have a real patient on the table,,this is the same neck dissection --,not so easy to tell the difference,between different structures.,We heard over the last couple days,what an urgent problem,cancer still is in our society,,what a pressing need it is,for us to not have,one person die every minute.,Well if cancer can be caught early,,enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out,,excised with surgery,,I don't care if it has this gene or that gene,,or if it has this protein or that protein,,it's in the jar.,It's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer. 
 This is how we excise cancers.,We do our best, based upon our training,and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels,and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience,,we say, you know what, the cancer's gone.,We've made a good job. We've taken it out.,That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room,when the patient's on the table.,But then we actually don't know that it's all out.,We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed,,what's left behind in the patient,,and then send those bits to the pathology lab.,In the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table.,The nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon,,all the assistants are waiting around.,And we wait.,The pathologist takes that sample,,freezes it, cuts it, looks in the microscope one by one,and then calls back into the room.,And that may be 20 minutes later per piece.,So if you've sent three specimens,,it's an hour later.,And very often they say,,"You know what, points A and B are okay,,but point C, you still have some residual cancer there.,Please go cut that piece out.",So we go back and we do that again, and again. 
 And this whole process:,"Okay you're done.,We think the entire tumor is out.",But very often several days later,,the patient's gone home,,we get a phone call:,"I'm sorry,,once we looked at the final pathology,,once we looked at the final specimen,,we actually found that there's a couple other spots,where the margins are positive.,There's still cancer in your patient.",So now you're faced with telling your patient, first of all,,that they may need another surgery,,or that they need additional therapy,such as radiation or chemotherapy.,So wouldn't it be better,if we could really tell,,if the surgeon could really tell,,whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field?,I mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it,,we're still operating in the dark. 
 So in 2004, during my surgical residency,,I had the great fortune,to meet Dr. Roger Tsien,,who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry,in 2008.,Roger and his team,were working on a way to detect cancer,,and they had a very clever molecule,that they had come up with.,The molecule they had developed,had three parts.,The main part of it is the blue part, polycation,,and it's basically very sticky,to every tissue in your body. 
 So imagine that you make a solution,full of this sticky material,and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer,,everything's going to get lit up.,Nothing will be specific.,There's no specificity there.,So they added two additional components.,The first one is a polyanionic segment,,which basically acts as a non-stick backing,like the back of a sticker.,So when those two are together, the molecule is neutral,and nothing gets stuck down.,And the two pieces are then linked,by something that can only be cut,if you have the right molecular scissors --,for example, the kind of protease enzymes,that tumors make.,So here in this situation,,if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule,along with the dye, which is shown in green,,and you inject it into the vein,of someone who has cancer,,normal tissue can't cut it.,The molecule passes through and gets excreted.,However, in the presence of the tumor,,now there are molecular scissors,that can break this molecule apart,right there at the cleavable site.,And now, boom,,the tumor labels itself,and it gets fluorescent. 
 So here's an example of a nerve,that has tumor surrounding it.,Can you tell where the tumor is?,I couldn't when I was working on this.,But here it is. It's fluorescent.,Now it's green.,See, so every single one in the audience,now can tell where the cancer is.,We can tell in the operating room, in the field,,at a molecular level,,where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do,and how much more work they need to do,to cut that out.,And the cool thing about fluorescence,is that it's not only bright,,it actually can shine through tissue.,The light that the fluorescence emits,can go through tissue.,So even if the tumor is not right on the surface,,you'll still be able to see it. 
 In this movie, you can see,that the tumor is green.,There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that?,And I'm peeling that muscle away.,But even before I peel that muscle away,,you saw that there was a tumor underneath.,So that's the beauty of having a tumor,that's labeled with fluorescent molecules.,That you can, not only see the margins,right there on a molecular level,,but you can see it even if it's not right on the top --,even if it's beyond your field of view.,And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also. 
 Sentinel lymph node dissection,has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer, melanoma.,Women used to get,really debilitating surgeries,to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.,But when sentinel lymph node,came into our treatment protocol,,the surgeon basically looks for the single node,that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.,And then if that node has cancer,,the woman would go on to get,the axillary lymph node dissection.,So what that means,is if the lymph node did not have cancer,,the woman would be saved,from having unnecessary surgery. 
 But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today,,is kind of like having a road map,just to know where to go.,So if you're driving on the freeway,and you want to know where's the next gas station,,you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.,It doesn't tell you whether or not,the gas station has gas.,You have to cut it out, bring it back home,,cut it up, look inside,and say, "Oh yes, it does have gas.",So that takes more time.,Patients are still on the operating room table.,Anesthesiologists, surgeons are waiting around.,That takes time. 
 So with our technology, we can tell right away.,You see a lot of little, roundish bumps there.,Some of these are swollen lymph nodes,that look a little larger than others.,Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?,That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside.,Well with our technology,,the surgeon is able to tell immediately,which nodes have cancer.,I won't go into this very much,,but our technology, besides being able,to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence,,we can also use the same smart three-part molecule,to tag gadolinium onto the system,so you can do this noninvasively.,The patient has cancer,,you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer,even before you go in.,Well you can see this on an MRI. 
 So in surgery,,it's important to know what to cut out.,But equally important,is to preserve things,that are important for function.,So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury.,And what I'm talking about,are nerves.,Nerves, if they are injured,,can cause paralysis,,can cause pain.,In the setting of prostate cancer,,up to 60 percent of men,after prostate cancer surgery,may have urinary incontinence,and erectile disfunction.,That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems --,and this is even in,so-called nerve-sparing surgery,,which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem,,and they are trying to avoid the nerves. 
 But you know what, these little nerves are so small,,in the context of prostate cancer,,that they are actually never seen.,They are traced,just by their known anatomical path,along vasculature.,And they're known because somebody has decided to study them,,which means that we're still learning,about where they are.,Crazy to think that we're having surgery,,we're trying to excise cancer, we don't know where the cancer is.,We're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are. 
 So I said, wouldn't it be great,if we could find a way,to see nerves with fluorescence?,And at first this didn't get a lot of support.,People said, "We've been doing it this way for all these years.,What's the problem?,We haven't had that many complications.",But I went ahead anyway.,And Roger helped me.,And he brought his whole team with him.,So there's that teamwork thing again.,And we eventually discovered molecules,that were specifically labeling nerves.,And when we made a solution of this,,tagged with the fluorescence,and injected in the body of a mouse,,their nerves literally glowed.,You can see where they are. 
 Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse,,and you can see that that big, fat portion you can see very easily.,But in fact, at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now,,there's actually very fine arborizations,that can't really be seen.,You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out.,We have been able to see nerves,for facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing --,every single nerve --,nerves for urinary function around the prostate.,We've been able to see every single nerve.,When we put these two probes together ...,So here's a tumor.,Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?,Now you do.,What about the nerve that's going into this tumor?,That white portion there is easy to see.,But what about the part that goes into the tumor?,Do you know where it's going?,Now you do. 
 Basically, we've come up with a way,to stain tissue,and color-code the surgical field.,This was a bit of a breakthrough.,I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.,We published our results,in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,and in Nature Biotechnology.,We received commentary in Discover magazine,,in The Economist.,And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.,They said, "Wow!,I have patients,who would benefit from this.,I think that this will result in my surgeries,with a better outcome,and fewer complications." 
 What needs to happen now,is further development of our technology,along with development,of the instrumentation,that allows us to see,this sort of fluorescence in the operating room.,The eventual goal,is that we'll get this into patients.,However, we've discovered,that there's actually no straightforward mechanism,to develop a molecule,for one-time use.,Understandably, the majority of the medical industry,is focused on multiple-use drugs,,such as long-term daily medications.,We are focused on making this technology better.,We're focused on adding drugs,,adding growth factors,,killing nerves that are causing problems,and not the surrounding tissue.,We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it. 
 I'd like to leave you with this final thought.,Successful innovation,is not a single breakthrough.,It is not a sprint.,It is not an event for the solo runner.,Successful innovation,is a team sport, it's a relay race.,It requires one team for the breakthrough,and another team,to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.,And this takes the long-term steady courage,of the day-in day-out struggle,to educate, to persuade,and to win acceptance.,And that is the light that I want to shine,on health and medicine today. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a computer science professor,,and my area of expertise is,computer and information security.,When I was in graduate school,,I had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother,describing to one of her fellow senior citizens,what I did for a living.,Apparently, I was in charge of making sure that,no one stole the computers from the university. (Laughter),And, you know, that's a perfectly reasonable thing,for her to think, because I told her I was working,in computer security,,and it was interesting to get her perspective. 
 But that's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,anyone say about my work.,The most ridiculous thing I ever heard is,,I was at a dinner party, and a woman heard,that I work in computer security,,and she asked me if -- she said her computer had been,infected by a virus, and she was very concerned that she,might get sick from it, that she could get this virus. (Laughter),And I'm not a doctor, but I reassured her,that it was very, very unlikely that this would happen,,but if she felt more comfortable, she could be free to use,latex gloves when she was on the computer,,and there would be no harm whatsoever in that. 
 I'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get,a virus from your computer, in a serious way.,What I'm going to talk to you about today,are some hacks, some real world cyberattacks that people,in my community, the academic research community,,have performed, which I don't think,most people know about,,and I think they're very interesting and scary,,and this talk is kind of a greatest hits,of the academic security community's hacks.,None of the work is my work. It's all work,that my colleagues have done, and I actually asked them,for their slides and incorporated them into this talk. 
 So the first one I'm going to talk about,are implanted medical devices.,Now medical devices have come a long way technologically.,You can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented.,1960, the first internal pacemaker was implanted,,hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there,,and the technology has continued to move forward.,In 2006, we hit an important milestone from the perspective,of computer security.,And why do I say that?,Because that's when implanted devices inside of people,started to have networking capabilities.,One thing that brings us close to home is we look,at Dick Cheney's device, he had a device that,pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart,,and as you can see at the bottom there,,it was controlled by a computer controller,,and if you ever thought that software liability,was very important, get one of these inside of you. 
 Now what a research team did was they got their hands,on what's called an ICD.,This is a defibrillator, and this is a device,that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm,,and these have saved many lives.,Well, in order to not have to open up the person,every time you want to reprogram their device,or do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able,to communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did,is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol,,and they built the device you see pictured here,,with a little antenna, that could talk the protocol,to the device, and thus control it.,In order to make their experience real -- they were unable,to find any volunteers, and so they went,and they got some ground beef and some bacon,and they wrapped it all up to about the size,of a human being's area where the device would go,,and they stuck the device inside it,to perform their experiment somewhat realistically.,They launched many, many successful attacks.,One that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name.,I don't know why you would want to do that,,but I sure wouldn't want that done to me.,And they were able to change therapies,,including disabling the device -- and this is with a real,,commercial, off-the-shelf device --,simply by performing reverse engineering and sending,wireless signals to it. 
 There was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs,could actually have their performance disrupted,simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them. 
 Now, wireless and the Internet,can improve health care greatly.,There's several examples up on the screen,of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices,inside of people, and all of these devices now,,it's standard that they communicate wirelessly,,and I think this is great,,but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing,,and without understanding what attackers can do,and the security risks from the beginning,,there's a lot of danger in this. 
 Okay, let me shift gears and show you another target.,I'm going to show you a few different targets like this,,and that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles. 
 This is a car, and it has a lot of components,,a lot of electronics in it today.,In fact, it's got many, many different computers inside of it,,more Pentiums than my lab did when I was in college,,and they're connected by a wired network.,There's also a wireless network in the car,,which can be reached from many different ways.,So there's Bluetooth, there's the FM and XM radio,,there's actually wi-fi, there's sensors in the wheels,that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure,to a controller on board.,The modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device. 
 And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this?,Well, that's what the researchers,that I'm going to talk about today did.,They basically stuck an attacker on the wired network,and on the wireless network.,Now, they have two areas they can attack.,One is short-range wireless, where you can actually,communicate with the device from nearby,,either through Bluetooth or wi-fi,,and the other is long-range, where you can communicate,with the car through the cellular network,,or through one of the radio stations.,Think about it. When a car receives a radio signal,,it's processed by software.,That software has to receive and decode the radio signal,,and then figure out what to do with it,,even if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio,,and that software that does that decoding,,if it has any bugs in it, could create a vulnerability,for somebody to hack the car. 
 The way that the researchers did this work is,,they read the software in the computer chips,that were in the car, and then they used sophisticated,reverse engineering tools,to figure out what that software did,,and then they found vulnerabilities in that software,,and then they built exploits to exploit those.,They actually carried out their attack in real life.,They bought two cars, and I guess,they have better budgets than I do.,The first threat model was to see what someone could do,if an attacker actually got access,to the internal network on the car.,Okay, so think of that as, someone gets to go to your car,,they get to mess around with it, and then they leave,,and now, what kind of trouble are you in?,The other threat model is that they contact you,in real time over one of the wireless networks,like the cellular, or something like that,,never having actually gotten physical access to your car. 
 This is what their setup looks like for the first model,,where you get to have access to the car.,They put a laptop, and they connected to the diagnostic unit,on the in-car network, and they did all kinds of silly things,,like here's a picture of the speedometer,showing 140 miles an hour when the car's in park.,Once you have control of the car's computers,,you can do anything.,Now you might say, "Okay, that's silly.",Well, what if you make the car always say,it's going 20 miles an hour slower than it's actually going?,You might produce a lot of speeding tickets. 
 Then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars,,the target victim car and the chase car,,and they launched a bunch of other attacks.,One of the things they were able to do from the chase car,is apply the brakes on the other car,,simply by hacking the computer.,They were able to disable the brakes.,They also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in,and wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like,going over 20 miles an hour, or something like that.,The results are astonishing, and when they gave this talk,,even though they gave this talk at a conference,to a bunch of computer security researchers,,everybody was gasping.,They were able to take over a bunch of critical computers,inside the car: the brakes computer, the lighting computer,,the engine, the dash, the radio, etc.,,and they were able to perform these on real commercial,cars that they purchased using the radio network.,They were able to compromise every single one of the,pieces of software that controlled every single one,of the wireless capabilities of the car.,All of these were implemented successfully. 
 How would you steal a car in this model?,Well, you compromise the car by a buffer overflow,of vulnerability in the software, something like that.,You use the GPS in the car to locate it.,You remotely unlock the doors through the computer,that controls that, start the engine, bypass anti-theft,,and you've got yourself a car. 
 Surveillance was really interesting.,The authors of the study have a video where they show,themselves taking over a car and then turning on,the microphone in the car, and listening in on the car,while tracking it via GPS on a map,,and so that's something that the drivers of the car,would never know was happening. 
 Am I scaring you yet?,I've got a few more of these interesting ones.,These are ones where I went to a conference,,and my mind was just blown, and I said,,"I have to share this with other people." 
 This was Fabian Monrose's lab,at the University of North Carolina, and what they did was,something intuitive once you see it,,but kind of surprising.,They videotaped people on a bus,,and then they post-processed the video.,What you see here in number one is a,reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone,that they're typing in.,They wrote software to stabilize --,even though they were on a bus,and maybe someone's holding their phone at an angle --,to stabilize the phone, process it, and,you may know on your smartphone, when you type,a password, the keys pop out a little bit, and they were able,to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing,,and had a language model for detecting typing.,What was interesting is, by videotaping on a bus,,they were able to produce exactly what people,on their smartphones were typing,,and then they had a surprising result, which is that,their software had not only done it for their target,,but other people who accidentally happened,to be in the picture, they were able to produce,what those people had been typing, and that was kind of,an accidental artifact of what their software was doing. 
 I'll show you two more. One is P25 radios.,P25 radios are used by law enforcement,and all kinds of government agencies,and people in combat to communicate,,and there's an encryption option on these phones.,This is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone.,It's more of a two-way radio.,Motorola makes the most widely used one, and you can see,that they're used by Secret Service, they're used in combat,,it's a very, very common standard in the U.S. and elsewhere.,So one question the researchers asked themselves is,,could you block this thing, right?,Could you run a denial-of-service,,because these are first responders?,So, would a terrorist organization want to black out the,ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency?,They found that there's this GirlTech device used for texting,that happens to operate at the same exact frequency,as the P25, and they built what they called,My First Jammer. (Laughter),If you look closely at this device,,it's got a switch for encryption or cleartext.,Let me advance the slide, and now I'll go back.,You see the difference?,This is plain text. This is encrypted.,There's one little dot that shows up on the screen,,and one little tiny turn of the switch.,And so the researchers asked themselves, "I wonder how,many times very secure, important, sensitive conversations,are happening on these two-way radios where they forget,to encrypt and they don't notice that they didn't encrypt?" 
 So they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal,and they run at the frequency of the P25,,and what they did is they hopped around frequencies,and they wrote software to listen in.,If they found encrypted communication, they stayed,on that channel and they wrote down, that's a channel,that these people communicate in,,these law enforcement agencies,,and they went to 20 metropolitan areas and listened in,on conversations that were happening at those frequencies.,They found that in every metropolitan area,,they would capture over 20 minutes a day,of cleartext communication.,And what kind of things were people talking about?,Well, they found the names and information,about confidential informants. They found information,that was being recorded in wiretaps,,a bunch of crimes that were being discussed,,sensitive information.,It was mostly law enforcement and criminal.,They went and reported this to the law enforcement,agencies, after anonymizing it,,and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface,wasn't good enough. If you're talking,about something really secure and sensitive, it should,be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted.,That one's pretty easy to fix. 
 The last one I thought was really, really cool,,and I just had to show it to you, it's probably not something,that you're going to lose sleep over,like the cars or the defibrillators,,but it's stealing keystrokes.,Now, we've all looked at smartphones upside down.,Every security expert wants to hack a smartphone,,and we tend to look at the USB port, the GPS for tracking,,the camera, the microphone, but no one up till this point,had looked at the accelerometer.,The accelerometer is the thing that determines,the vertical orientation of the smartphone.,And so they had a simple setup.,They put a smartphone next to a keyboard,,and they had people type, and then their goal was,to use the vibrations that were created by typing,to measure the change in the accelerometer reading,to determine what the person had been typing.,Now, when they tried this on an iPhone 3GS,,this is a graph of the perturbations that were created,by the typing, and you can see that it's very difficult,to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing,,but the iPhone 4 greatly improved the accelerometer,,and so the same measurement,produced this graph.,Now that gave you a lot of information while someone,was typing, and what they did then is used advanced,artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning,to have a training phase,,and so they got most likely grad students,to type in a whole lot of things, and to learn,,to have the system use the machine learning tools that,were available to learn what it is that the people were typing,and to match that up,with the measurements in the accelerometer.,And then there's the attack phase, where you get,somebody to type something in, you don't know what it was,,but you use your model that you created,in the training phase to figure out what they were typing.,They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.,They typed in, "The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled,that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago",— see, I tied it in to the last talk —,"and ordered him to stay on the ballot.",Now, the system is interesting, because it produced,"Illinois Supreme" and then it wasn't sure.,The model produced a bunch of options,,and this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques,,is that computers are good at some things,,humans are good at other things,,take the best of both and let the humans solve this one.,Don't waste computer cycles.,A human's not going to think it's the Supreme might.,It's the Supreme Court, right?,And so, together we're able to reproduce typing,simply by measuring the accelerometer.,Why does this matter? Well, in the Android platform,,for example, the developers have a manifest,where every device on there, the microphone, etc.,,has to register if you're going to use it,so that hackers can't take over it,,but nobody controls the accelerometer. 
 So what's the point? You can leave your iPhone next to,someone's keyboard, and just leave the room,,and then later recover what they did,,even without using the microphone.,If someone is able to put malware on your iPhone,,they could then maybe get the typing that you do,whenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard. 
 There's several other notable attacks that unfortunately,I don't have time to go into, but the one that I wanted,to point out was a group from the University of Michigan,which was able to take voting machines,,the Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that,were going to be used in New Jersey in the election,that were left in a hallway, and put Pac-Man on it.,So they ran the Pac-Man game. 
 What does this all mean?,Well, I think that society tends to adopt technology,really quickly. I love the next coolest gadget.,But it's very important, and these researchers are showing,,that the developers of these things,need to take security into account from the very beginning,,and need to realize that they may have a threat model,,but the attackers may not be nice enough,to limit themselves to that threat model,,and so you need to think outside of the box. 
 What we can do is be aware,that devices can be compromised,,and anything that has software in it,is going to be vulnerable. It's going to have bugs.,Thank you very much. (Applause)Is there a real you?,This might seem to you nlike a very odd question.,Because, you might ask,,how do we find the real you,,how do you know what the real you is?,And so forth. 
 But the idea that there must be a real you,,surely that's obvious.,If there's anything real nin the world, it's you.,Well, I'm not quite sure.,At least we have to understand na bit better what that means.,Now certainly, I think there arenlots of things in our culture around us,which sort of reinforce the idea,that for each one of us,nwe have a kind of a core, an essence.,There is something about what it meansnto be you which defines you,,and it's kind of permanent and unchanging.,The most kind of crude waynin which we have it,,are things like horoscopes.,You know, people are very weddednto these, actually.,People put them on their Facebook profile,as though they are meaningul,,you even know nyour Chinese horoscope as well.,There are also nmore scientific versions of this,,all sorts of ways of profilingnpersonality type,,such as the Myers-Briggs tests,nfor example.,I don't know if you've done those.,A lot of companies nuse these for recruitment.,You answer a lot of questions,,and this is supposed to revealnsomething about your core personality.,And of course, the popular fascination nwith this is enormous.,In magazines like this, you'll see,,in the bottom left corner,nthey'll advertise in virtually every issue,some kind of personality thing.,And if you pick up one of those magazines,,it's hard to resist, isn't it?,Doing the test to findnwhat is your learning style,,what is your loving style,nor what is your working style?,Are you this kind of person or that? 
 So I think that we have a common-sense idea,that there is a kind of core nor essence of ourselves,to be discovered.,And that this is kind of a permanent truthnabout ourselves,,something that's the same throughout life.,Well, that's the idea I want to challenge.,And I have to say now,nI'll say it a bit later,,but I'm not challenging thisnjust because I'm weird,,the challenge actually has a very,nvery long and distinguished history.,Here's the common-sense idea.,There is you.,You are the individuals you are,nand you have this kind of core.,Now in your life, what happensnis that you, of course,,accumulate different experiencesnand so forth.,So you have memories,,and these memories help nto create what you are.,You have desires, maybe for a cookie,,maybe for somethingnthat we don't want to talk about,at 11 o'clock in the morningnin a school.,You will have beliefs.,This is a number platenfrom someone in America.,I don't know whether this number plate,nwhich says "messiah 1,",indicates that the drivernbelieves in the messiah,,or that they are the messiah.,Either way, they have beliefs nabout messiahs.,We have knowledge.,We have sensations and experiences as well.,It's not just intellectual things.,So this is kind of nthe common-sense model, I think,,of what a person is.,There is a person who has all the thingsnthat make up our life experiences. 
 But the suggestion nI want to put to you today,is that there's something nfundamentally wrong with this model.,And I can show you what's wrongnwith one click.,Which is there isn't actually a "you"nat the heart of all these experiences.,Strange thought?nWell, maybe not.,What is there, then?,Well, clearly there are memories,ndesires, intentions, sensations,,and so forth.,But what happens isnthese things exist,,and they're kind of all integrated,,they're overlapped, they're connectednin various different ways.,They're connecting partly,nand perhaps even mainly,,because they all belong to one bodynand one brain.,But there's also a narrative, na story we tell about ourselves,,the experiences we havenwhen we remember past things.,We do things because of other things.,So what we desirenis partly a result of what we believe,,and what we remember is alsoninforming us what we know.,And so really, there are all these things,,like beliefs, desires, nsensations, experiences,,they're all related to each other,,and that just is you.,In some ways, it's a small differencenfrom the common-sense understanding.,In some ways, it's a massive one. 
 It's the shift between thinking of yourself,as a thing which has nall the experiences of life,,and thinking of yourselfnas simply that collection,of all experiences in life.,You are the sum of your parts.,Now those parts are also physical parts, nof course,,brains, bodies and legs and things,,but they aren't so important, actually.,If you have a heart transplant,nyou're still the same person.,If you have a memory transplant,nare you the same person?,If you have a belief transplant, nwould you be the same person?,Now this idea, that what we are, nthe way to understand ourselves,,is as not of some permanent being,nwhich has experiences,,but is kind of a collection of experiences,,might strike you as kind of weird. 
 But actually, I don't think nit should be weird.,In a way, it's common sense.,Because I just invite you nto think about, by comparison,,think about pretty much anything elsenin the universe,,maybe apart from the nvery most fundamental forces or powers.,Let's take something like water.,Now my science isn't very good.,We might say something like nwater has two parts hydrogen,and one parts oxygen, right?,We all know that.,I hope no one in this roomnthinks that what that means,is there is a thing called water, nand attached to it,are hydrogen and oxygen atoms,,and that's what water is.,Of course we don't.,We understand, very easily,nvery straightforwardly,,that water is nothing more,than the hydrogen and oxygen moleculesnsuitably arranged.,Everything else in the universe is the same.,There's no mystery about my watch,nfor example.,We say the watch has a face, and hands,,and a mechanism and a battery,,But what we really mean is,,we don't think nthere is a thing called the watch,to which we then attach all these bits.,We understand very clearly nthat you get the parts of the watch,,you put them together,nand you create a watch.,Now if everything else nin the universe is like this,,why are we different? 
 Why think of ourselves,as somehow not just being na collection of all our parts,,but somehow being a separate,npermanent entity which has those parts?,Now this view is not particularly new, nactually.,It has quite a long lineage.,You find it in Buddhism,,you find it in 17th, n18th-century philosophy,going through to the current day,npeople like Locke and Hume.,But interestingly, it's also a view,increasingly being heard reinforcednby neuroscience.,This is Paul Broks, nhe's a clinical neuropsychologist,,and he says this:,"We have a deep intuitionnthat there is a core,,an essence there, nand it's hard to shake off,,probably impossible to shake off, nI suspect.,But it's true that neuroscience showsnthat there is no centre in the brain,where things do all come together.",So when you look at the brain,,and you look at how the brainnmakes possible a sense of self,,you find that there isn't na central control spot in the brain.,There is no kind of centernwhere everything happens.,There are lots of different processesnin the brain,,all of which operate, in a way,nquite independently.,But it's because of the way nthat they relate,that we get this sense of self.,The term I use in the book, nI call it the ego trick.,It's like a mechanical trick.,It's not that we don't exist,,it's just that the trick is nto make us feel that inside of us,is something more unifiednthan is really there. 
 Now you might thinknthis is a worrying idea.,You might think that if it's true,,that for each one of us there isnno abiding core of self,,no permanent essence,,does that mean that really,nthe self is an illusion?,Does it mean that we really don't exist?,There is no real you.,Well, a lot of people actually do use nthis talk of illusion and so forth.,These are three psychologists,nThomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,,Susan Blackmore,,a lot of these people do talk nthe language of illusion,,the self is an illusion, it's a fiction.,But I don't think this is na very helpful way of looking at it.,Go back to the watch.,The watch isn't an illusion, nbecause there is nothing to the watch,other than a collection of its parts.,In the same way, nwe're not illusions either.,The fact that we are, in some ways,njust this very, very complex collection,,ordered collection of things,,does not mean we're not real.,I can give you na very sort of rough metaphor for this.,Let's take something like a waterfall.,These are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.,Now if you take something like this,,you can appreciate the fact nthat in lots of ways,,there's nothing permanent about this.,For one thing, it's always changing.,The waters nare always carving new channels.,with changes and tides and the weather,,some things dry up, nnew things are created.,Of course the water that flows nthrough the waterfall,is different every single instance.,But it doesn't mean that nthe Iguazu Falls are an illusion.,It doesn't mean it's not real.,What it means is we have nto understand what it is,as something which has a history,,has certain things that keep it together,,but it's a process, it's fluid, nit's forever changing. 
 Now that, I think, is a modelnfor understanding ourselves,,and I think it's a liberating model.,Because if you think that you haventhis fixed, permanent essence,,which is always the same,nthroughout your life, no matter what,,in a sense you're kind of trapped.,You're born with an essence,,that's what you are until you die,,if you believe in an afterlife, nmaybe you continue.,But if you think of yourselfnas being, in a way,,not a thing as such, nbut a kind of a process,,something that is changing,,then I think that's quite liberating.,Because unlike the the waterfalls,,we actually have the capacity to channel,the direction of our development for ourselvesnto a certain degree.,Now we've got to be careful here, right?,If you watch the X-Factor too much,nyou might buy into this idea,that we can all be whatever we want to be.,That's not true.,I've heard some fantastic musiciansnthis morning,,and I am very confidentnthat I could in no way be as good as them.,I could practice hard nand maybe be good,,but I don't haventhat really natural ability.,There are limits to what we can achieve.,There are limits to what nwe can make of ourselves.,But nevertheless, we do have nthis capacity,to, in a sense, shape ourselves.,The true self, as it were then,,is not something that is just therenfor you to discover,,you don't sort of look into your soulnand find your true self,,What you are partly doing, at least,,is actually creating your true self.,And this, I think, is very,nvery significant,,particularly at this stage of life you're at.,You'll be aware of the fact,how much of you changed over recent years.,If you have any videos of yourself, nthree or four years ago,,you probably feel embarrassed nbecause you don't recognize yourself. 
 So I want to get that message over,nthat what we need to do,is think about ourselves as thingsnthat we can shape,,and channel and change.,This is the Buddha, again:,"Well-makers lead the water,,fletchers bend the arrow,,carpenters bend a log of wood,,wise people fashion themselves.",And that's the idea nI want to leave you with,,that your true self is not something nthat you will have to go searching for,,as a mystery, and maybe never ever find.,To the extent you have a true self,,it's something that you in part discover,,but in part create.,and that, I think, nis a liberating and exciting prospect.,Thank you very much.I was born in Den Bosch,,where the painter Hieronymus Boschnnamed himself after.,And I've always been very fondnof this painter,who lived and worked in the 15th century.,And what is interesting about himnin relation to morality,is that he lived at a timenwhere religion's influence was waning,,and he was sort of wondering, I think,,what would happen with societynif there was no religion,or if there was less religion.,And so he painted this famous painting,n"The Garden of Earthly Delights,",which some have interpretednas being humanity before the Fall,,or being humanity without any Fall at all.,And so it makes you wonder,,what would happen if we hadn't tastednthe fruit of knowledge, so to speak,,and what kind of morality would we have. 
 Much later, as a student,nI went to a very different garden,,a zoological garden in Arnhemnwhere we keep chimpanzees.,This is me at an early agenwith a baby chimpanzee. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I discovered there,that the chimpanzees are very power-hungrynand wrote a book about it.,And at that time the focusnin a lot of animal research,was on aggression and competition.,I painted a whole picturenof the animal kingdom,and humanity included, was that deep downnwe are competitors, we are aggressive,,we are all outnfor our own profit, basically.,This is the launch of my book.,I'm not sure how wellnthe chimpanzees read it,,but they surely seemedninterested in the book. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now in the process of doing all this work,on power and dominancenand aggression and so on,,I discovered that chimpanzeesnreconcile after fights.,And so what you see herenis two males who have had a fight.,They ended up in a tree, and one of themnholds out a hand to the other.,And about a secondnafter I took the picture,,they came together in the fork of the tree,and kissed and embraced each other. 
 And this is very interesting,because at the time, everythingnwas about competition and aggression,,so it wouldn't make any sense.,The only thing that mattersnis that you win or you lose.,But why reconcile after a fight?nThat doesn't make any sense.,This is the way bonobos do it.nBonobos do everything with sex.,And so they also reconcile with sex.,But the principle is exactly the same.,The principle is that you havena valuable relationship,that is damaged by conflict,nso you need to do something about it.,So my whole picture of the animal kingdom,nand including humans also,,started to change at that time. 
 So we have this image in politicalnscience, economics, the humanities,,the philosophy for that matter,nthat man is a wolf to man.,And so deep down,nour nature is actually nasty.,I think it's a very unfairnimage for the wolf.,The wolf is, after all,na very cooperative animal.,And that's why many of younhave a dog at home,,which has all these characteristics also.,And it's really unfair to humanity,,because humanity is actuallynmuch more cooperative and empathic,than given credit for.,So I started gettingninterested in those issues,and studying that in other animals. 
 So these are the pillars of morality.,If you ask anyone,n"What is morality based on?",these are the two factorsnthat always come out.,One is reciprocity,,and associated with it is a sensenof justice and a sense of fairness.,And the other one is empathynand compassion.,And human morality is more than this,nbut if you would remove these two pillars,,there would be not muchnremaining, I think.,So they're absolutely essential. 
 So let me give you a few examples here.,This is a very old videonfrom the Yerkes Primate Center,,where they trainednchimpanzees to cooperate.,So this is alreadynabout a hundred years ago,that we were doingnexperiments on cooperation.,What you have here is twonyoung chimpanzees who have a box,,and the box is too heavynfor one chimp to pull in.,And of course, there's food on the box.,Otherwise they wouldn'tnbe pulling so hard.,And so they're bringing in the box.,And you can see that they're synchronized.,You can see that they work together,nthey pull at the same moment.,It's already a big advancenover many other animals,who wouldn't be able to do that.,Now you're going to getna more interesting picture,,because now onenof the two chimps has been fed.,So one of the two is not really interestednin the task anymore. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 [- and sometimes appears to conveynits wishes and meanings by gestures.],Now look at what happensnat the very end of this. 
 (Laughter) 
 He takes basically everything. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are two interestingnparts about this.,One is that the chimp on the right,has a full understandingnhe needs the partner --,so a full understandingnof the need for cooperation.,The second one is that the partnernis willing to work,even though he's notninterested in the food.,Why would that be?,Well, that probablynhas to do with reciprocity.,There's actually a lot of evidencenin primates and other animals,that they return favors.,He will get a return favornat some point in the future.,And so that's how this all operates. 
 We do the same task with elephants.,Now, it's very dangerousnto work with elephants.,Another problem with elephantsnis that you cannot make an apparatus,that is too heavy for a single elephant.,Now you can probably make it,,but it's going to be a prettynclumsy apparatus, I think.,And so what we did in that case --,we do these studies in Thailandnfor Josh Plotnik --,is we have an apparatus around whichnthere is a rope, a single rope.,And if you pull on this side of the rope,nthe rope disappears on the other side.,So two elephants need to pick it upnat exactly the same time, and pull.,Otherwise nothing is going to happennand the rope disappears. 
 The first tape you're going to see,is two elephants who are released togethernarrive at the apparatus.,The apparatus is on the left,nwith food on it.,And so they come together,nthey arrive together,,they pick it up together,nand they pull together.,So it's actually fairly simple for them.,There they are.,So that's how they bring it in.,But now we're going to make itnmore difficult.,Because the purpose of this experiment,is to see how wellnthey understand cooperation.,Do they understand that as wellnas the chimps, for example? 
 What we do in the next step is we releasenone elephant before the other,and that elephant needs to be smart enough,to stay there and waitnand not pull at the rope --,because if he pulls at the rope,nit disappears and the whole test is over.,Now this elephant does something illegalnthat we did not teach it.,But it shows the understanding he has,,because he puts his big foot on the rope,,stands on the ropenand waits there for the other,,and then the other is goingnto do all the work for him.,So it's what we call freeloading. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it shows the intelligencenthat the elephants have.,They developed severalnof these alternative techniques,that we did not approve of, necessarily. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the other elephant is now coming ...,and is going to pull it in.,Now look at the other;nit doesn't forget to eat, of course. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was the cooperationnand reciprocity part. 
 Now something on empathy.,Empathy is my main topicnat the moment, of research.,And empathy has two qualities:,One is the understanding part of it.,This is just a regular definition:,the ability to understand and sharenthe feelings of another.,And the emotional part.,Empathy has basically two channels:nOne is the body channel,,If you talk with a sad person,,you're going to adoptna sad expression and a sad posture,,and before you know it, you feel sad.,And that's sort of the body channelnof emotional empathy,,which many animals have.,Your average dog has that also.,That's why people keep mammals in the home,and not turtles or snakesnor something like that,,who don't have that kind of empathy.,And then there's a cognitive channel,,which is more that you can takenthe perspective of somebody else.,And that's more limited.,Very few animals, I think elephantsnand apes, can do that kind of thing. 
 So synchronization,,which is part of that wholenempathy mechanism,,is a very old one in the animal kingdom.,In humans, of course,nwe can study that with yawn contagion.,Humans yawn when others yawn.,And it's related to empathy.,It activates the same areas in the brain.,Also, we know that peoplenwho have a lot of yawn contagion,are highly empathic.,People who have problems with empathy,nsuch as autistic children,,they don't have yawn contagion.,So it is connected. 
 And we study that in our chimpanzeesnby presenting them with an animated head.,So that's what you see on the upper-left,nan animated head that yawns.,And there's a chimpanzee watching,,an actual real chimpanzeenwatching a computer screen,on which we play these animations. 
 (Laughter) 
 So yawn contagionnthat you're probably all familiar with --,and maybe you're goingnto start yawning soon now --,is something that we sharenwith other animals.,And that's related to that wholenbody channel of synchronization,that underlies empathy,,and that is universalnin the mammals, basically. 
 We also study more complex expressions --nThis is consolation.,This is a male chimpanzeenwho has lost a fight and he's screaming,,and a juvenile comes overnand puts an arm around him,and calms him down.,That's consolation.,It's very similar to human consolation.,And consolation behavior -- 
 (Laughter) 
 it's empathy driven.,Actually, the way to studynempathy in human children,is to instruct a family membernto act distressed,,and then to see what young children do.,And so it is related to empathy,,and that's the kindnof expressions we look at. 
 We also recently published an experimentnyou may have heard about.,It's on altruism and chimpanzees,,where the question is: Do chimpanzees carenabout the welfare of somebody else?,And for decades it had been assumednthat only humans can do that,,that only humans worrynabout the welfare of somebody else.,Now we did a very simple experiment.,We do that on chimpanzeesnthat live in Lawrenceville,,in the field station of Yerkes.,And so that's how they live.,And we call them into a roomnand do experiments with them.,In this case, we putntwo chimpanzees side-by-side,,and one has a bucket full of tokens,nand the tokens have different meanings.,One kind of token feedsnonly the partner who chooses,,the other one feeds both of them. 
 So this is a study we didnwith Vicki Horner.,And here, you have the two color tokens.,So they have a whole bucket full of them.,And they have to picknone of the two colors.,You will see how that goes.,So if this chimp makes the selfish choice,,which is the red token in this case,,he needs to give it to us,,we pick it up, we put it on a tablenwhere there's two food rewards,,but in this case, only the onenon the right gets food.,The one on the left walks awaynbecause she knows already,that this is not a good test for her.,Then the next one is the pro-social token. 
 So the one who makes the choices --nthat's the interesting part here --,for the one who makes the choices,nit doesn't really matter.,So she gives us now a pro-socialntoken and both chimps get fed.,So the one who makes the choicesnalways gets a reward.,So it doesn't matter whatsoever.,And she should actuallynbe choosing blindly.,But what we find is that they prefernthe pro-social token.,So this is the 50 percent line,nthat's the random expectation.,And especially if the partner drawsnattention to itself, they choose more. 
 And if the partnernputs pressure on them --,so if the partner starts spitting waternand intimidating them --,then the choices go down. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's as if they're saying,,"If you're not behaving,nI'm not going to be pro-social today.",And this is what happensnwithout a partner,,when there's no partner sitting there.,So we found that the chimpanzees do carenabout the well-being of somebody else --,especially, these are other membersnof their own group. 
 So the final experimentnthat I want to mention to you,is our fairness study.,And so this became a very famous study.,And there are now many more,,because after we did thisnabout 10 years ago,,it became very well-known.,And we did that originallynwith Capuchin monkeys.,And I'm going to show younthe first experiment that we did.,It has now been donenwith dogs and with birds,and with chimpanzees.,But with Sarah Brosnan,nwe started out with Capuchin monkeys. 
 So what we did is we putntwo Capuchin monkeys side-by-side.,Again, these animals, live in a group,nthey know each other.,We take them out of the group,nput them in a test chamber.,And there's a very simple tasknthat they need to do.,And if you give both of themncucumber for the task,,the two monkeys side-by-side,,they're perfectly willingnto do this 25 times in a row.,So cucumber, even thoughnit's only really water in my opinion,,but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.,Now if you give the partner grapes --,the food preferencesnof my Capuchin monkeys,correspond exactly with the pricesnin the supermarket --,and so if you give them grapes --nit's a far better food --,then you create inequity between them.,So that's the experiment we did. 
 Recently, we videotaped itnwith new monkeys,who'd never done the task,,thinking that maybe they would havena stronger reaction,,and that turned out to be right.,The one on the left is the monkeynwho gets cucumber.,The one on the rightnis the one who gets grapes.,The one who gets cucumber --,note that the first piecenof cucumber is perfectly fine.,The first piece she eats.,Then she sees the other one getting grape,nand you will see what happens.,So she gives a rock to us.nThat's the task.,And we give her a piecenof cucumber and she eats it.,The other one needs to give a rock to us.,And that's what she does.,And she gets a grape ...,and eats it.,The other one sees that.,She gives a rock to us now,,gets, again, cucumber. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter ends) 
 She tests a rock now against the wall.,She needs to give it to us.,And she gets cucumber again. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is basicallynthe Wall Street protest that you see here. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I still have two minutes left --,let me tell you a funny story about this.,This study became very famousnand we got a lot of comments,,especially anthropologists,neconomists, philosophers.,They didn't like this at all.,Because they had decidednin their minds, I believe,,that fairness is a very complex issue,nand that animals cannot have it.,And so one philosopher even wrote us,that it was impossible that monkeysnhad a sense of fairness,because fairness was inventednduring the French Revolution. 
 (Laughter) 
 And another one wrote a whole chapter,saying that he would believenit had something to do with fairness,,if the one who got grapesnwould refuse the grapes.,Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan,nwho's been doing this with chimpanzees,,had a couple of combinationsnof chimpanzees,where, indeed, the onenwho would get the grape,would refuse the grapenuntil the other guy also got a grape.,So we're getting very closento the human sense of fairness.,And I think philosophers neednto rethink their philosophy for a while. 
 So let me summarize.,I believe there's an evolved morality.,I think morality is much morenthan what I've been talking about,,but it would be impossiblenwithout these ingredients,that we find in other primates,,which are empathy and consolation,,pro-social tendencies and reciprocitynand a sense of fairness.,And so we work on these particular issues,to see if we can create a moralitynfrom the bottom up, so to speak,,without necessarilyngod and religion involved,,and to see how we can getnto an evolved morality. 
 And I thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)I'm here to share my photography.,Or is it photography?,Because, of course, this is a photograph,that you can't take with your camera. 
 Yet, my interest in photography started,as I got my first digital camera,at the age of 15.,It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,,but it was a bit different,,because using the camera,,the process was in the planning instead.,And when you take a photograph with a camera,,the process ends when you press the trigger.,So to me it felt like photography was more about,being at the right place and the right time.,I felt like anyone could do that. 
 So I wanted to create something different,,something where the process starts,when you press the trigger.,Photos like this:,construction going on along a busy road.,But it has an unexpected twist.,And despite that,,it retains a level of realism.,Or photos like these --,both dark and colorful,,but all with a common goal,of retaining the level of realism.,When I say realism,,I mean photo-realism.,Because, of course,,it's not something you can capture really,,but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow,as a photograph.,Photos where you will need a brief moment to think,to figure out the trick.,So it's more about capturing an idea,than about capturing a moment really. 
 But what's the trick,that makes it look realistic?,Is it something about the details,or the colors?,Is it something about the light?,What creates the illusion?,Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.,But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world,and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.,It's not really what is realistic,,it's what we think looks realistic really. 
 So I think the basics,are quite simple.,I just see it as a puzzle of reality,where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together,to create alternate reality.,And let me show you a simple example.,Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,,something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.,But combined in a certain way,,they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,,like it could exist.,But at the same time, we know it can't.,So we trick our brains,,because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact,that it doesn't really make sense.,And I see the same process,with combining photographs.,It's just really about combining different realities. 
 So the things that make a photograph look realistic,,I think it's the things that we don't even think about,,the things all around us in our daily lives.,But when combining photographs,,this is really important to consider,,because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.,So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow,to achieve a realistic result.,As you can see, these images aren't really special.,But combined, they can create something like this. 
 So the first rule is that photos combined,should have the same perspective.,Secondly, photos combined,should have the same type of light.,And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --,shot at the same height and in the same type of light.,The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish,where the different images begin and end,by making it seamless.,Make it impossible to say,how the image actually was composed.,So by matching color, contrast and brightness,in the borders between the different images,,adding photographic defects,like depth of field,,desaturated colors and noise,,we erase the borders between the different images,and make it look like one single image,,despite the fact that one image,can contain hundreds of layers basically. 
 So here's another example.,(Laughter),One might think that this is just an image of a landscape,and the lower part is what's manipulated.,But this image is actually entirely composed,of photographs from different locations.,I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place,than to find a place,,because then you don't need to compromise,with the ideas in your head.,But it does require a lot of planning.,And getting this idea during winter,,I knew that I had several months to plan it,,to find the different locations,for the pieces of the puzzle basically.,So for example,,the fish was captured on a fishing trip.,The shores are from a different location.,The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.,And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red,to make it look more Swedish. 
 So to achieve a realistic result,,I think it comes down to planning.,It always starts with a sketch, an idea.,Then it's about combining the different photographs.,And here every piece is very well planned.,And if you do a good job capturing the photos,,the result can be quite beautiful,and also quite realistic.,So all the tools are out there,,and the only thing that limits us,is our imagination. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Do you remember the story,of Odysseus and the Sirens,from high school or junior high school?,There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home,after the Trojan War.,And he's standing on the deck of his ship,,he's talking to his first mate,,and he's saying,,"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,,and on those rocks sit some beautiful women,called Sirens.,And these women sing an enchanting song,,a song so alluring,that all sailors who hear it,crash into the rocks and die.",Now you would expect, given that,,that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,,but instead Odysseus says,,"I want to hear that song.,And so what I'm going to do,is I'm going to pour wax in the ears,of you and all the men --,stay with me --,so that you can't hear the song,,and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast,so that I can listen,and we can all sail by unaffected.",So this is a captain,putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk,so that he can hear a song. 
 And I'd like to think if this was the case,,they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.,Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.,You tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.,And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.,All right, so tie me to the mast.",And the first mate takes a rope,and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.,And Odysseus does his best job playacting,and says, "Untie me. Untie me.,I want to hear that song. Untie me.",And the first mate wisely resists,and doesn't untie Odysseus.,And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.,All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner.",And the first mate hesitates.,He's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,,or should I untie him?",And the first mate thinks,,"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end.",So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.,He's like, "You idiot. You moron.,If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,,every single one of the men will be dead.,Now just don't untie me no matter what.",He throws the first mate to the ground.,This repeats itself through the night --,rehearsal, tying to the mast,,conning his way out of it,,beating the poor first mate up mercilessly.,Hilarity ensues. 
 Tying yourself to a mast,is perhaps the oldest written example,of what psychologists call a commitment device.,A commitment device is a decision that you make,with a cool head to bind yourself,so that you don't do something regrettable,when you have a hot head.,Because there's two heads inside one person,when you think about it.,Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves,when it comes to questions of temptation.,There is first, the present self.,This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.,He just wants to get to the front row.,He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.,But then there's this other self, the future self.,This is Odysseus as an old man,who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa,with his wife Penelope,outside of Ithaca -- the other one. 
 So why do we need commitment devices?,Well resisting temptation is hard,,as the 19th century English economist,Nassau William Senior said,,"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,,or to seek distant rather than immediate results,,are among the most painful exertions,of the human will.",If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,,you probably realize,it's not that your goals are physically impossible,that's keeping you from achieving them,,it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.,It's physically possible to lose weight.,It's physically possible to exercise more.,But resisting temptation,is hard. 
 The other reason,that it's difficult to resist temptation,is because it's an unequal battle,between the present self and the future self.,I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.,It's in control. It's in power right now.,It has these strong, heroic arms,that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.,And the future self is not even around.,It's off in the future. It's weak.,It doesn't even have a lawyer present.,There's nobody to stick up for the future self.,And so the present self can trounce,all over its dreams.,So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,,and we need commitment devices,to level the playing field between the two. 
 Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.,Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones,such as locking a credit card away with a key,or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it,or unplugging your Internet connection,so you can use your computer.,I was creating commitment devices of my own,long before I knew what they were.,So when I was a starving post-doc,at Columbia University,,I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.,I had to write five pages a day,towards papers,or I would have to give up five dollars. 
 And when you try to execute these commitment devices,,you realize the devil is really in the details.,Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.,I mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.,And I thought, well I could give it to a charity,or give it to my wife or something like that.,But then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.,Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.,So then I would kind of justify not writing,by giving a gift.,And then I kind of flipped that around and thought,,well I could give it to the neo-Nazis.,But then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,,and so that wouldn't work.,So ultimately, I just decided,I would leave it in an envelope on the subway.,Sometimes a good person would find it,,sometimes a bad person would find it.,On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money,that I would regret.,(Laughter),Such it is with commitment devices. 
 But despite my like for them,,there's two nagging concerns,that I've always had about commitment devices,,and you might feel this if you use them yourself.,So the first is,,when you've got one of these devices going,,such as this contract to write everyday or pay,,it's just a constant reminder,that you have no self-control.,You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,,I am nothing, I have no self-discipline.",And then when you're ever in a situation,where you don't have a commitment device in place --,like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,,and I have no defense mechanism," --,you just eat it.,So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.,I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.,The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets. 
 The other problem with commitment devices,is that you can always weasel your way out of them.,You say, "Well, of course I can't write today,,because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,,and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.,And so there's no way that this is going to work.",So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate,in one person.,You're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,,and you're weaseling your way out of it,,and then you're beating yourself up afterwards. 
 So I've been working,for about a decade now,on finding other ways,to change people's relationship to the future self,without using commitment devices.,In particular, I'm interested in the relationship,to the future financial self.,And this is a timely issue.,I'm talking about the topic of saving.,Now saving is a classic two selves problem.,The present self does not want to save at all.,It wants to consume.,Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.,So this is a timely problem.,We look at the savings rate,and it has been declining since the 1950s.,At the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,,the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,,has been increasing.,And we're at a situation now,where for every three baby boomers,,the McKinsey Global Institute predicts,that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs,while they're in retirement. 
 So what can we do about this?,There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,,who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.,He said that, "We might neglect our future selves,because of some failure of belief or imagination.",That is to say,,we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,,or we might not be able to imagine,that we're going to get old some day.,On the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.,Of course, we know that we're going to get old.,But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time? 
 So my coauthors and I have used computers,,the greatest tool of our time,,to assist people's imagination,and help them imagine what it might be like,to go into the future.,And I'll show you some of these tools right here.,The first is called the distribution builder.,It shows people what the future might be like,by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes,that might be obtained in the future.,Each outcome is shown by one of these markers,,and each sits on a row,that represents a level of wealth and retirement.,Being up at the top,means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.,Being down at the bottom,means that you're struggling to make ends meet.,When you make an investment,,what you're really saying is, "I accept,that any one of these 100 things,could happen to me and determine my wealth." 
 Now you can try to move your outcomes around.,You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,,but it costs you something to do it.,It means that you have to save more today.,Once you find an investment that you're happy with,,what people do is they click "done",and the markers begin to disappear,,slowly, one by one.,It simulates what it is like to invest in something,and to watch that investment pan out.,At the end, there will only be one marker left standing,and it will determine our wealth in retirement. 
 Yes, this person retired,at 150 percent of their working income in retirement.,They're making more money while retired,than they were making while they were working.,If you're like most people,,just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy --,just to think about making,50 percent more money in retirement than before.,However, had you ended up on the very bottom,,it might have given you a slight sense,of dread and/or nausea,thinking about struggling to get by in retirement.,By using this tool over and over,and simulating outcome after outcome,,people can understand,that the investments and savings that they undertake today,determine their well-being in the future. 
 Now people are motivated through emotions,,but different people find different things motivating.,This is a simulation,that uses graphics,,but other people find motivating what money can buy,,not just numbers.,So here I made a distribution builder,where instead of showing numerical outcomes,,I show people what those outcomes will get you,,in particular apartments that you can afford,if you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,,2,000 dollars per month and so on.,As you move down the ladder of apartments,,you see that they get worse and worse.,Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.,And as you get to the very bottom,,you're faced with the unfortunate reality,that if you don't save anything for retirement,,you won't be able to afford any housing at all.,Those are actual pictures of actual apartments,renting for that amount,as advertised on the Internet. 
 The last thing I'll show you,,the last behavioral time machine,,is something that I created with Hal Hershfield,,who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,,Bill Sharpe.,And what it is,is an exploration into virtual reality.,So what we do is we take pictures of people --,in this case, college-age people --,and we use software to age them,and show these people what they'll look like,when they're 60, 70, 80 years old.,And we try to test,whether actually assisting your imagination,by looking at the face of your future self,can change you investment behavior. 
 So this is one of our experiments.,Here we see the face of the young subject on the left.,He's given a control,that allows him to adjust his savings rate.,As he moves his savings rate down,,it means that he's saving zero,when it's all the way here at the left.,You can see his current annual income --,this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today --,is quite high, 91 percent,,but his retirement income is quite low.,He's going to retire on 44 percent,of what he earned while he was working.,If he saves the maximum legal amount,,his retirement income goes up,,but he's unhappy,because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.,Other conditions show people the future self.,And from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.,If you save very little,,the future self is unhappy,living on 44 percent of the income.,Whereas if the present self saves a lot,,the future self is delighted,,where the income is close up near 100 percent. 
 To bring this to a wider audience,,I've been working with Hal and Allianz,to create something we call the behavioral time machine,,in which you not only get to see yourself in the future,,but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions,to different levels of retirement wealth.,So for instance,,here is somebody using the tool.,And just watch the facial expressions,as they move the slider.,The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.,The older face is miserable.,And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.,And then it's a high savings rate.,The younger face is getting unhappy.,The older face is quite pleased,with the decision.,We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.,And what's nice about it,is it's not something that biasing people actually,,because as one face smiles,,the other face frowns.,It's not telling you which way to put the slider,,it's just reminding you that you are,connected to and legally tied to,this future self. 
 Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being.,And that's something that's easy to forget.,This use of virtual reality,is not just good for making people look older.,There are programs you can get,to see how people might look,if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,,if they gain weight and so on.,And what's good is,,unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,,you don't have to program these by yourself,in order to see the virtual reality.,There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars,that do the same thing.,This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.,You might recognize him from the previous demos.,And just for kicks we ran his picture,through the balding, aging and weight gain software,to see how he would look.,Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself,to disabuse you of that last image.,And I'll close it there. 
 On behalf of Hal and myself,,I wish all the best to your present and future selves.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)So that's Johnny Depp, of course.,And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder.,And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo.,Some of you might know that, in 1990,,Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder,,and he had tattooed on his right shoulder,"Winona forever.",And then three years later --,which in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards --,they broke up,,and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.,And now his shoulder says, "Wino forever." 
 (Laughter) 
 So like Johnny Depp,,and like 25 percent of Americans,between the ages of 16 and 50,,I have a tattoo.,I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s,,but I deliberately waited a really long time.,Because we all know people,who have gotten tattoos when they were 17,or 19 or 23,and regretted it by the time they were 30.,That didn't happen to me.,I got my tattoo when I was 29,,and I regretted it instantly.,And by "regretted it,",I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place --,this is just a couple miles from here,down on the Lower East Side --,and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight,on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.,(Laughter),Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares.,(Laughter),And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown,,which I'll say more about in a minute. 
 And this was all actually quite shocking to me,,because prior to this moment,,I had prided myself,on having absolutely no regrets.,I made a lot of mistakes,and dumb decisions, of course.,I do that hourly.,But I had always felt like, look, you know,,I made the best choice I could make,given who I was then,,given the information I had on hand.,I learned a lesson from it.,It somehow got me to where I am in life right now.,And okay, I wouldn't change it.,In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret,,which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past,is an absolute waste of time,,that we should always look forward and not backward,,and that one of the noblest and best things we can do,is strive to live a life free of regrets. 
 This idea is nicely captured by this quote:,"Things without all remedy,should be without regard;,what's done is done.",And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first --,something we might all agree to sign onto ...,until I tell you who said it.,Right, so this is Lady MacBeth,basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss,for feeling bad about murdering people.,And as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here,,as he generally was.,Because the inability to experience regret,is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics,of sociopaths.,It's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.,So people who have damage,to their orbital frontal cortex,seem to be unable to feel regret,in the face of even obviously very poor decisions.,So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret,,there is an option open to you.,It's called a lobotomy.,But if you want to be fully functional,and fully human,and fully humane,,I think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it. 
 So let's start off by defining some terms.,What is regret?,Regret is the emotion we experience,when we think that our present situation,could be better or happier,if we had done something different in the past.,So in other words, regret requires two things.,It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.,And second of all, it requires imagination.,We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice,,and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward,and imagine how things would be playing out in our present.,And in fact, the more we have of either of these things --,the more agency and the more imagination,with respect to a given regret,,the more acute that regret will be. 
 So let's say for instance,that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding,and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic,,and you finally arrive at your gate,and you've missed your flight.,You're going to experience more regret in that situation,if you missed your flight by three minutes,than if you missed it by 20.,Why?,Well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes,,it is painfully easy to imagine,that you could have made different decisions,that would have led to a better outcome.,"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.,I should have gone through that yellow light.",These are the classic conditions that create regret.,We feel regret when we think we are responsible,for a decision that came out badly,,but almost came out well. 
 Now within that framework,,we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.,This session today is about behavioral economics.,And most of what we know about regret,comes to us out of that domain.,We have a vast body of literature,on consumer and financial decisions,and the regrets associated with them --,buyer's remorse, basically.,But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back,and say, well okay, but overall,,what do we regret most in life?,Here's what the answers turn out to look like. 
 So top six regrets --,the things we regret most in life:,Number one by far, education.,33 percent of all of our regrets,pertain to decisions we made about education.,We wish we'd gotten more of it.,We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.,We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic.,Others very high on our list of regrets,include career, romance, parenting,,various decisions and choices about our sense of self,and how we spend our leisure time --,or actually more specifically,,how we fail to spend our leisure time.,The remaining regrets,pertain to these things:,finance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting,,health, friends,,spirituality and community. 
 So in other words, we know most of what we know about regret,by the study of finance.,But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life,,you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.,They account for less than three percent of our total regrets.,So if you're sitting there stressing,about large cap versus small cap,,or company A versus company B,,or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius,,you know what, let it go.,Odds are, you're not going to care in five years. 
 But for these things that we actually do really care about,and do experience profound regret around,,what does that experience feel like?,We all know the short answer.,It feels terrible. Regret feels awful.,But it turns out that regret feels awful,in four very specific and consistent ways.,So the first consistent component of regret,is basically denial.,When I went home that night after getting my tattoo,,I basically stayed up all night.,And for the first several hours,,there was exactly one thought in my head.,And the thought was,,"Make it go away!",This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.,I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!",We're not trying to solve the problem.,We're not trying to understand how the problem came about.,We just want it to vanish. 
 The second characteristic component of regret,is a sense of bewilderment.,So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night,was, "How could I have done that?,What was I thinking?",This real sense of alienation,from the part of us that made a decision we regret.,We can't identify with that part.,We don't understand that part.,And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part --,which explains the third consistent component of regret,,which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.,That's why, in the face of our regret,,the thing we consistently say is, "I could have kicked myself.",The fourth component here,is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.,To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly,on the exact same thing.,Now the effect of perseveration,is to basically take these first three components of regret,and put them on an infinite loop.,So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night,,thinking, "Make it go away.",It's that I sat there and I thought,,"Make it go away. Make it go away.,Make it go away. Make it go away.",So if you look at the psychological literature,,these are the four consistent defining components of regret. 
 But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one.,And I think of this,as a kind of existential wake-up call.,That night in my apartment,,after I got done kicking myself and so forth,,I lay in bed for a long time,,and I thought about skin grafts.,And then I thought about how,,much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God,,probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.,In point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.,The whole point of acts of idiocy,is that they leave you totally uninsured;,they leave you exposed to the world,and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility,in face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe. 
 This is obviously an incredibly painful experience.,And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West,in the grips of what I sometimes think of,as a Control-Z culture --,Control-Z like the computer command,,undo.,We're incredibly used to not having to face,life's hard realities, in a certain sense.,We think we can throw money at the problem,or throw technology at the problem --,we can undo and unfriend,and unfollow.,And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life,that we desperately want to change,and we cannot.,Sometimes instead of Control-Z,,we actually have zero control.,And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists --,and I know where of I speak --,this is really hard,,because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right. 
 Now there is a case to be made,that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos,,and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.,But first I want to say,that the intensity and persistence,with which we experience these emotional components of regret,is obviously going to vary,depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.,So for instance, here's one of my favorite,automatic generators of regret in modern life.,(Laughter),Text: Relpy to all.,And the amazing thing,about this really insidious technological innovation,is that even just with this one thing,,we can experience a huge range of regret.,You can accidentally hit "reply all" to an email,and torpedo a relationship.,Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.,Or you can have your last day at work. 
 And this doesn't even touch,on the really profound regrets of a life.,Because of course, sometimes we do make decisions,that have irrevocable and terrible consequences,,either for our own or for other people's,health and happiness and livelihoods,,and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.,Now obviously, those kinds of regrets,are incredibly piercing and enduring.,I mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets,can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days. 
 So how are we supposed to live with this?,I want to suggest that there's three things,that help us to make our peace with regret.,And the first of these,is to take some comfort in its universality.,If you Google regret and tattoo,,you will get 11.5 million hits.,(Laughter),The FDA estimates,that of all the Americans who have tattoos,,17 percent of us regret getting them.,That is Johnny Depp and me,and our seven million friends.,And that's just regret about tattoos.,We are all in this together. 
 The second way that we can help make our peace with regret,is to laugh at ourselves.,Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem,,because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself,when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy,because you don't like your new tattoo.,But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion,when it comes to these more profound regrets.,I don't think that's the case though.,All of us who've experienced regret,that contains real pain and real grief,understand that humor and even black humor,plays a crucial role in helping us survive.,It connects the poles of our lives back together,,the positive and the negative,,and it sends a little current of life back into us. 
 The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret,is through the passage of time,,which, as we know, heals all wounds --,except for tattoos, which are permanent.,So it's been several years,since I got my own tattoo.,And do you guys just want to see it?,All right.,Actually, you know what, I should warn you,,you're going to be disappointed.,Because it's actually not that hideous.,I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face,on some indiscreet part of myself or something.,When other people see my tattoo,,for the most part they like how it looks.,It's just that I don't like how it looks.,And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.,But I'll let you see it anyway. 
 This is my tattoo.,I can guess what some of you are thinking.,So let me reassure you about something.,Some of your own regrets,are also not as ugly as you think they are.,I got this tattoo,because I spent most of my 20s,living outside the country and traveling.,And when I came and settled in New York afterward,,I was worried that I would forget,some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.,Specifically the two things I learned about myself,that I most didn't want to forget,was how important it felt to keep exploring,and, simultaneously, how important it is,to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.,And what I loved about this image of the compass,was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas,in one simple image.,And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device. 
 Well it did.,But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would;,it reminds me constantly of something else instead.,It actually reminds me,of the most important lesson regret can teach us,,which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.,And ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing,I possibly could have tattooed onto my body --,partly as a writer,,but also just as a human being.,Here's the thing,,if we have goals,and dreams,,and we want to do our best,,and if we love people,and we don't want to hurt them or lose them,,we should feel pain when things go wrong.,The point isn't to live without any regrets.,The point is to not hate ourselves for having them. 
 The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo,and that I want to leave you with today,is this:,We need to learn to love,the flawed, imperfect things,that we create,and to forgive ourselves for creating them.,Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly.,It reminds us that we know we can do better. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Do you know how many choices you make,in a typical day?,Do you know how many choices you make,in typical week?,I recently did a survey,with over 2,000 Americans,,and the average number of choices,that the typical American reports making,is about 70 in a typical day.,There was also recently a study done with CEOs,in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.,And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks,that these CEOs engaged in,and how much time they spent engaging,in making decisions related to these tasks.,And they found that the average CEO,engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.,Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.,50 percent of their decisions,were made in nine minutes or less.,Only about 12 percent of the decisions,did they make an hour or more of their time.,Think about your own choices.,Do you know how many choices,make it into your nine minute category,versus your one hour category?,How well do you think you're doing,at managing those choices? 
 Today I want to talk,about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,,which is the choice overload problem.,I want to talk about the problem,and some potential solutions.,Now as I talk about this problem,,I'm going to have some questions for you,and I'm going to want to know your answers.,So when I ask you a question,,since I'm blind,,only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.,(Laughter),Otherwise, when I ask you a question,,and if your answer is yes,,I'd like you to clap your hands.,So for my first question for you today:,Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?,(Applause),Thank you. 
 So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,,I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;,at least at that time it was truly upscale.,It was a store called Draeger's.,Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.,They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars,and over 500 different kinds,of fruits and vegetables,and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --,and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.,I used to love going to this store,,but on one occasion I asked myself,,well how come you never buy anything?,Here's their olive oil aisle.,They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,,including those that were in a locked case,that came from thousand-year-old olive trees. 
 So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,,and I asked the manager,,"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?",And he pointed to the busloads of tourists,that would show up everyday,,with cameras ready usually.,We decided to do a little experiment,,and we picked jam for our experiment.,Here's their jam aisle.,They had 348 different kinds of jam.,We set up a little tasting booth,right near the entrance of the store.,We there put out six different flavors of jam,or 24 different flavors of jam,,and we looked at two things:,First, in which case,were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?,More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,,than when there were six,,about 40 percent.,The next thing we looked at,is in which case were people more likely,to buy a jar of jam.,Now we see the opposite effect.,Of the people who stopped when there were 24,,only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.,Of the people who stopped when there were six,,well now we saw that 30 percent of them,actually bought a jar of jam.,Now if you do the math,,people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam,if they encountered six,than if they encountered 24. 
 Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam,is probably good for us --,at least it's good for our waistlines --,but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us,even in very consequential decisions.,We choose not to choose,,even when it goes against our best self-interests.,So now for the topic of today: financial savings.,Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did,with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang,where we looked at the retirement savings decisions,of nearly a million Americans,from about 650 plans,all in the U.S.,And what we looked at,was whether the number of fund offerings,available in a retirement savings plan,,the 401(k) plan,,does that affect people's likelihood,to save more for tomorrow.,And what we found,was that indeed there was a correlation.,So in these plans, we had about 657 plans,that ranged from offering people,anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.,And what we found was that,,the more funds offered,,indeed, there was less participation rate. 
 So if you look at the extremes,,those plans that offered you two funds,,participation rates were around in the mid-70s --,still not as high as we want it to be.,In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,,participation rates have now dropped,to about the 60th percentile.,Now it turns out,that even if you do choose to participate,when there are more choices present,,even then, it has negative consequences.,So for those people who did choose to participate,,the more choices available,,the more likely people were,to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.,The more choices available,,the more likely they were,to put all their money in pure money market accounts.,Now neither of these extreme decisions,are the kinds of decisions,that any of us would recommend for people,when you're considering their future financial well-being. 
 Well, over the past decade,,we have observed three main negative consequences,to offering people more and more choices.,They're more likely to delay choosing --,procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.,They're more likely to make worse choices --,worse financial choices, medical choices.,They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,,even when they do objectively better.,The main reason for this,is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls,of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,,but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting,and actually picking from that stunning display.,So what I want to propose to you today,are four simple techniques --,techniques that we have tested in one way or another,in different research venues --,that you can easily apply,in your businesses. 
 The first: Cut.,You've heard it said before,,but it's never been more true than today,,that less is more.,People are always upset when I say, "Cut.",They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.,But in fact, what we're seeing more and more,is that if you are willing to cut,,get rid of those extraneous redundant options,,well there's an increase in sales,,there's a lowering of costs,,there is an improvement of the choosing experience.,When Proctor & Gamble,went from 26 different kinds of Head & Shoulders to 15,,they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.,When the Golden Cat Corporation,got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,,they saw an increase in profits,by 87 percent --,a function of both increase in sales,and lowering of costs.,You know, the average grocery store today,offers you 45,000 products.,The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.,But the ninth largest retailer,,the ninth biggest retailer in the world today,is Aldi,,and it offers you only 1,400 products --,one kind of canned tomato sauce. 
 Now in the financial savings world,,I think one of the best examples that has recently come out,on how to best manage the choice offerings,has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,,which was the program that they have at Harvard.,Every single Harvard employee,is now automatically enrolled,in a lifecycle fund.,For those people who actually want to choose,,they're given 20 funds,,not 300 or more funds.,You know, often, people say,,"I don't know how to cut.,They're all important choices.",And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,,"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.,And if your employees can't tell them apart,,neither can your consumers." 
 Now before we started our session this afternoon,,I had a chat with Gary.,And Gary said that he would be willing,to offer people in this audience,an all-expenses-paid free vacation,to the most beautiful road in the world.,Here's a description of the road.,And I'd like you to read it.,And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it,and then I want you to clap your hands,if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.,(Light clapping),Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.,Is that all?,All right, let me show you some more about this.,(Laughter),You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.,(Honk),Now who's ready to go on this trip.,(Applause),(Laughter),I think I might have actually heard more hands. 
 All right.,Now in fact,,you had objectively more information,the first time around than the second time around,,but I would venture to guess,that you felt that it was more real the second time around.,Because the pictures made it feel,more real to you.,Which brings me to the second technique,for handling the choice overload problem,,which is concretization.,That in order for people to understand,the differences between the choices,,they have to be able to understand,the consequences associated with each choice,,and that the consequences need to be felt,in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.,Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more,when they use an ATM card or a credit card,as opposed to cash?,Because it doesn't feel like real money.,And it turns out,that making it feel more concrete,can actually be a very positive tool,to use in getting people to save more. 
 So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi,and Alessandro Previtero,,we did a study with people at ING --,employees that are all working at ING --,and now these people were all in a session,where they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.,And during that session,,we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,,but we added one little thing.,The one little thing we added,was we asked people,to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life,if you saved more.,By doing that simple thing,,there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent,and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save,or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account,by four percent. 
 The third technique: Categorization.,We can handle more categories,than we can handle choices.,So for example,,here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.,It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores,up and down the northeast corridor,,the magazine aisles range anywhere,from 331 different kinds of magazines,all the way up to 664.,But you know what?,If I show you 600 magazines,and I divide them up into 10 categories,,versus I show you 400 magazines,and divide them up into 20 categories,,you believe that I have given you,more choice and a better choosing experience,if I gave you the 400,than if I gave you the 600.,Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. 
 Here are two different jewelry displays.,One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing.",If you think the display on the left is Swing,and the display on the right is Jazz,,clap your hands.,(Light Clapping),Okay, there's some.,If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,,clap your hands.,Okay, a bit more.,Now it turns out you're right.,The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,,but you know what?,This is a highly useless categorization scheme.,(Laughter),The categories need to say something,to the chooser, not the choice-maker.,And you often see that problem,when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.,Who are they actually supposed to be informing? 
 My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.,It turns out we can actually,handle a lot more information than we think we can,,we've just got to take it a little easier.,We have to gradually increase the complexity.,I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.,Let's take a very, very complicated decision:,buying a car.,Here's a German car manufacturer,that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.,You've got to make 60 different decisions,,completely make up your car.,Now these decisions vary,in the number of choices that they offer per decision.,Car colors, exterior car colors --,I've got 56 choices.,Engines, gearshift -- four choices.,So now what I'm going to do,is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.,So half of the customers,are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,,to low choice, four gearshifts.,The other half of the customers,are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,,to 56 car colors, high choice. 
 What am I going to look at?,How engaged you are.,If you keep hitting the default button per decision,,that means you're getting overwhelmed,,that means I'm losing you.,What you find,is the people who go from high choice to low choice,,they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.,We're losing them.,They go from low choice to high choice,,they're hanging in there.,It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.,The only thing that I have done,is I have varied the order,in which that information is presented.,If I start you off easy,,I learn how to choose.,Even though choosing gearshift,doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,,it still prepares me for how to choose.,It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,,so I'm more willing to be motivated,to be engaged. 
 So let me recap.,I have talked about four techniques,for mitigating the problem of choice overload --,cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;,concretize -- make it real;,categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;,condition for complexity.,All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today,are designed to help you manage your choices --,better for you, you can use them on yourself,,better for the people that you are serving.,Because I believe that the key,to getting the most from choice,is to be choosy about choosing.,And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing,the better we will be able,to practice the art of choosing. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk today about saving more,,but not today, tomorrow.,I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.,It's a program that Richard Thaler,from the University of Chicago and I,devised maybe 15 years ago.,The program, in a sense,,is an example of behavioral finance,on steroids --,how we could really use behavioral finance.,Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?,So let's think about how we manage our money.,Let's start with mortgages.,It's kind of a recent topic,,at least in the U.S.,A lot of people buy,the biggest house they can afford,,and actually slightly bigger than that.,And then they foreclose.,And then they blame the banks,for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages. 
 Let's also think about,how we manage risks --,for example, investing in the stock market.,Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,,markets did well.,We were risk takers, of course.,Then market stocks seize,and we're like, "Wow.,These losses, they feel, emotionally,,they feel very different,from what we actually thought about it,when markets were going up.",So we're probably not doing a great job,when it comes to risk taking. 
 How many of you have iPhones?,Anyone? Wonderful.,I would bet many more of you,insure your iPhone --,you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.,What if you lose your iPhone?,What if you do this?,How many of you have kids?,Anyone?,Keep your hands up,if you have sufficient life insurance.,I see a lot of hands coming down.,I would predict,,if you're a representative sample,,that many more of you,insure your iPhones than your lives,,even when you have kids.,We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance. 
 The average American household,spends 1,000 dollars a year,on lotteries.,And I know it sounds crazy.,How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?,No one.,So that tells us that the people not in this room,are spending more than a thousand,to get the average to a thousand.,Low-income people,spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.,So where does it take us?,We're not doing a great job managing money. 
 Behavioral finance is really a combination,of psychology and economics,,trying to understand,the money mistakes people make.,And I can keep standing here,for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left,and make fun of all sorts of ways,we manage money,,and at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?",And that's what I really want to focus on today.,How do we take an understanding,of the money mistakes people make,,and then turning the behavioral challenges,into behavioral solutions?,And what I'm going to talk about today,is Save More Tomorrow. 
 I want to address the issue,of savings.,We have on the screen,a representative sample,of 100 Americans.,And we're going to look at their saving behavior.,First thing to notice is,,half of them,do not even have access,to a 401(k) plan.,They cannot make savings easy.,They cannot have money go away from their paycheck,into a 401(k) plan,before they see it,,before they can touch it.,What about the remaining half of the people?,Some of them elect not to save.,They're just too lazy.,They never get around to logging into a complicated website,and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.,And then they have to decide how they're going to invest,in their 52 choices,,and they never heard about what is a money market fund.,And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.,How many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?,One third of Americans.,Two thirds are not saving now. 
 Are they saving enough?,Take out those,who say they save too little.,One out of 10,are saving enough.,Nine out of 10,either cannot save through their 401(k) plan,,decide not to save -- or don't decide --,or save too little.,We think we have a problem,of people saving too much.,Let's look at that.,We have one person --,well, actually we're going to slice him in half,because it's less than one percent.,Roughly half a percent of Americans,feel that they save too much. 
 What are we going to do about it?,That's what I really want to focus on.,We have to understand,why people are not saving,,and then we can hopefully flip,the behavioral challenges,into behavioral solutions,,and then see how powerful it might be.,So let me divert for a second,as we're going to identify the problems,,the challenges, the behavioral challenges,,that prevent people from saving.,I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate. 
 Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.,And during the break,there would be a snack,and you could choose bananas or chocolate.,How many of you think you would like to have bananas,during this hypothetical TED event next week?,Who would go for bananas?,Wonderful.,I predict scientifically,74 percent of you will go for bananas.,Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.,And then count down the days,and see what people ended up eating.,The same people that imagined themselves,eating the bananas,ended up eating chocolates,a week later. 
 Self-control,is not a problem in the future.,It's only a problem now,when the chocolate is next to us.,What does it have to do with time and savings,,this issue of immediate gratification?,Or as some economists call it, present bias.,We think about saving. We know we should be saving.,We know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.,Christmas is coming,,we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.,So this issue of present bias,causes us to think about saving,,but end up spending. 
 Let me now talk,about another behavioral obstacle to saving,having to do with inertia.,But again, a little diversion,to the topic of organ donation.,Wonderful study comparing different countries.,We're going to look at two similar countries,,Germany and Austria.,And in Germany,,if you would like to donate your organs --,God forbid something really bad,happens to you --,when you get your driving license or an I.D.,,you check the box saying,,"I would like to donate my organs.",Not many people like checking boxes.,It takes effort. You need to think.,Twelve percent do.,Austria, a neighboring country,,slightly similar, slightly different.,What's the difference?,Well, you still have choice.,You will decide,whether you want to donate your organs or not.,But when you get your driving license,,you check the box,if you do not want to donate your organ.,Nobody checks boxes.,That's kind of too much effort.,One percent check the box. The rest do nothing.,Doing nothing is very common.,Not many people check boxes. 
 What are the implications,to saving lives,and having organs available?,In Germany, 12 percent check the box.,Twelve percent are organ donors.,Huge shortage of organs,,God forbid, if you need one.,In Austria, again, nobody checks the box.,Therefore, 99 percent of people,are organ donors.,Inertia, lack of action.,What is the default setting,if people do nothing,,if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?,Very powerful.,We're going to talk,about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared,to make their 401(k) choices.,Are we going to make them automatically join the plan,,or are they going to be left out?,In too many 401(k) plans,,if people do nothing,,it means they're not saving for retirement,,if they don't check the box.,And checking the box takes effort. 
 So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.,One more before we flip the challenges into solutions,,having to do with monkeys and apples.,No, no, no, this is a real study,and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.,One group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.,The other group gets two apples, one is taken away.,They still have an apple left.,They're really mad.,Why have you taken our apple?,This is the notion of loss aversion.,We hate losing stuff,,even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.,You would hate to go to the ATM,,take out 100 dollars,and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.,It's very painful,,even though it doesn't mean anything.,Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.,So this notion of loss aversion,kicks in when it comes to savings too,,because people, mentally,and emotionally and intuitively,frame savings as a loss,because I have to cut my spending. 
 So we talked about,all sorts of behavioral challenges,having to do with savings eventually.,Whether you think about immediate gratification,,and the chocolates versus bananas,,it's just painful to save now.,It's a lot more fun,to spend now.,We talked about inertia and organ donations,and checking the box.,If people have to check a lot of boxes,to join a 401(k) plan,,they're going to keep procrastinating,and not join.,And last, we talked about loss aversion,,and the monkeys and the apples.,If people frame mentally,saving for retirement as a loss,,they're not going to be saving for retirement. 
 So we've got these challenges,,and what Richard Thaler and I,were always fascinated by --,take behavioral finance,,make it behavioral finance on steroids,or behavioral finance 2.0,or behavioral finance in action --,flip the challenges into solutions.,And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution,called Save More, not today, Tomorrow.,How is it going to solve the challenges,we chatted about?,If you think about the problem,of bananas versus chocolates,,we think we're going to eat bananas next week.,We think we're going to save more next year.,Save More Tomorrow,invites employees,to save more maybe next year --,sometime in the future,when we can imagine ourselves,eating bananas,,volunteering more in the community,,exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet. 
 Now we also talked about checking the box,and the difficulty of taking action.,Save More Tomorrow,makes it easy.,It's an autopilot.,Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future,,let's say every January,you're going to be saving more automatically,and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan,before you see it, before you touch it,,before you get the issue,of immediate gratification.,But what are we going to do about the monkeys,and loss aversion?,Next January comes,and people might feel that if they save more,,they have to spend less, and that's painful.,Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January.,Maybe we should make people save more,when they make more money.,That way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,,they don't have to cut their spending.,They take a little bit,of the increase in the paycheck home,and spend more --,take a little bit of the increase,and put it in a 401(k) plan. 
 So that is the program,,embarrassingly simple,,but as we're going to see,,extremely powerful.,We first implemented it,,Richard Thaler and I,,back in 1998.,Mid-sized company in the Midwest,,blue collar employees,struggling to pay their bills,repeatedly told us,they cannot save more right away.,Saving more today is not an option.,We invited them to save,three percentage points more,every time they get a pay raise.,And here are the results.,We're seeing here a three and a half-year period,,four pay raises,,people who were struggling to save,,were saving three percent of their paycheck,,three and a half years later,saving almost four times as much,,almost 14 percent. 
 And there's shoes and bicycles,and things on this chart,because I don't want to just throw numbers,in a vacuum.,I want, really, to think about the fact,that saving four times more,is a huge difference,in terms of the lifestyle,that people will be able to afford.,It's real.,It's not just numbers on a piece of paper.,Whereas with saving three percent,,people might have to add nice sneakers,so they can walk,,because they won't be able to afford anything else,,when they save 14 percent,they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes,to walk to the car to drive.,This is a real difference.,By now, about 60 percent of the large companies,actually have programs like this in place.,It's been part of the Pension Protection Act.,And needless to say that Thaler and I,have been blessed to be part of this program,and make a difference. 
 Let me wrap,with two key messages.,One is behavioral finance,is extremely powerful.,This is just one example.,Message two,is there's still a lot to do.,This is really the tip of the iceberg.,If you think about people and mortgages,and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,,we need to think about that.,If you're thinking about people taking too much risk,and not understanding how much risk they're taking,or taking too little risk,,we need to think about that.,If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year,on lottery tickets,,we need to think about that.,The average actually,,the record is in Singapore.,The average household,spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.,We've got a lot to do,,a lot to solve,,also in the retirement area,when it comes to what people do with their money,after retirement. 
 One last question:,How many of you feel comfortable,that as you're planning for retirement,you have a really solid plan,when you're going to retire,,when you're going to claim Social Security benefits,,what lifestyle to expect,,how much to spend every month,so you're not going to run out of money?,How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future,when it comes to post-retirement decisions.,One, two, three, four.,Less than three percent,of a very sophisticated audience.,Behavioral finance has a long way.,There's a lot of opportunities,to make it powerful again and again and again. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play.,I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.,I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.,So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Okay, so first of all,,let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,,(Applause),Burniss Travis on the bass,,(Applause),and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano. 
 (Applause) 
 So the bandstand, as we call it,,this is an incredible space.,It is really a sacred space.,And one of the things that is really sacred about it,is that you have no opportunity to think about the future,,or the past.,You really are alive right here in this moment.,There are so many decisions being made,when you walk on the bandstand.,We had no idea what key we were going to play in.,In the middle, we sort of made our way,into a song called "Titi Boom.",But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.,Everyone's listening. We're responding.,You have no time for projected ideas. 
 So the idea of a mistake:,From the perspective of a jazz musician,,it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.,So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand --,first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.,The only mistake lies,in that I'm not able to perceive,what it is that someone else did.,Every "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.,So it's hard to even describe,what a funny note would be. 
 So for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,,that sounded like this ...,(Music),So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.,(Music),See, these are all right inside of the color palette.,If you played an E.,See, these all lie right inside,of this general emotional palette that we were painting.,If you played an F# though,,(Dissonance),to most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake. 
 So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.,And we're going to play on this palette.,And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.,And we won't react to it.,He'll introduce it for a second,and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.,We'll see what happens when we play with this palette. 
 (Music) 
 So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.,The only way that I would say it was a mistake,is in that we didn't react to it.,It was an opportunity that was missed.,So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.,He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.,We'll all accept his ideas,,or not. 
 (Music) 
 So you see, he played this note.,I ended up creating a melody out of it.,The texture changed in the drums this time.,It got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intense,in response to how I responded to it.,So there is no mistake.,The only mistake is if I'm not aware,,if each individual musician is not aware,and accepting enough of his fellow band member,to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity. 
 So jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.,It's a very purifying experience.,And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.,We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.,So how does this all relate to behavioral finance?,Well we're jazz musicians,,so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.,And the other dynamic of it,is that we don't micromanage in jazz.,You have some people who do.,But what that does,is it actually limits the artistic possibilities.,If I come up and I dictate to the band,that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,,and I just jump right in ...,ready, just play some time.,One, two, one, two, three, four.,(Music),It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.,I'm telling them, "You come with me over this way." 
 If I really want the music to go there,,the best way for me to do it is to listen.,This is a science of listening.,It has far more to do with what I can perceive,than what it is that I can do.,So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,,the first step for me is,to be patient, to listen to what's going on,and pull from something that's going on around me.,When you do that, you engage and inspire the other musicians,and they give you more, and gradually it builds.,Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four. 
 (Music) 
 Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.,It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.,It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.,It's about being here in the moment,,accepting one another,and allowing creativity to flow. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It is actually a reality today,that you can download products from the Web --,product data, I should say, from the Web --,perhaps tweak it and personalize it,to your own preference or your own taste,,and have that information sent,to a desktop machine,that will fabricate it for you on the spot.,We can actually build for you,,very rapidly,,a physical object.,And the reason we can do this,is through an emerging technology,called additive manufacturing,,or 3D printing. 
 This is a 3D printer.,They have been around,for almost 30 years now,,which is quite amazing to think of,,but they're only just starting,to filter into the public arena.,And typically, you would take data,,like the data of a pen here,,which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,,and we would pass that data with material,into a machine.,And a process that would happen in the machine,would mean layer by layer that product would be built.,And we can take out the physical product,,and ready to use,,or to, perhaps, assemble into something else. 
 But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,,why don't we know about them?,Because typically they've been too inefficient,,inaccessible,,they've not been fast enough,,they've been quite expensive.,But today,,it is becoming a reality,that they are now becoming successful.,Many barriers are breaking down.,That means that you guys,will soon be able to access one of these machines,,if not this minute.,And it will change and disrupt,the landscape of manufacturing,,and most certainly our lives, our businesses,and the lives of our children. 
 So how does it work?,It typically reads CAD data,,which is a product design data,created on professional product design programs.,And here you can see an engineer --,it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer --,create a product in 3D.,And this data gets sent to a machine,that slices the data,into two-dimensional representations of that product,all the way through --,almost like slicing it like salami.,And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,,starting at the base of the product,and depositing material, layer upon layer,,infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer,in an additive process.,And this material that's deposited,either starts as a liquid form,or a material powder form.,And the bonding process can happen,by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.,In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.,It's actually using a laser,to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.,And over time --,quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours --,we can build a physical product,,ready to take out of the machine and use.,And this is quite an extraordinary idea,,but it is reality today. 
 So all these products that you can see on the screen,were made in the same way.,They were all 3D printed.,And you can see,,they're ranging from shoes,,rings that were made out of stainless steal,,phone covers out of plastic,,all the way through to spinal implants, for example,,that were created out of medical-grade titanium,,and engine parts.,But what you'll notice about all of these products,is they're very, very intricate.,The design is quite extraordinary.,Because we're taking this data in 3D form,,slicing it up before it gets past the machine,,we can actually create structures,that are more intricate,than any other manufacturing technology --,or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.,And you can create parts with moving components,,hinges, parts within parts. 
 So in some cases, we can abolish totally,the need for manual labor.,It sounds great.,It is great.,We can have 3D printers today,that build structures like these.,This is almost three meters high.,And this was built,by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer,in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness --,slowly growing this structure.,This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.,And you can actually walk into it.,And on the other end of the spectrum,,this is a microstructure.,It's created depositing layers,of about four microns.,So really the resolution is quite incredible.,The detail that you can get today,is quite amazing. 
 So who's using it?,Typically, because we can create products very rapidly,,it's been used by product designers,,or anyone who wanted to prototype a product,and very quickly create or reiterate a design.,And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well,is that you can create bespoke products en masse.,There's very little economies of scale.,So you can now create one-offs very easily.,Architects, for example,,they want to create prototypes of buildings.,Again you can see,,this is a building of the Free University in Berlin,and it was designed by Foster and Partners.,Again, not buildable in any other way.,And very hard to even create this by hand. 
 Now this is an engine component.,It was developed by a company called Within Technologies,and 3T RPD.,It's very, very, very detailed,inside with the design.,Now 3D printing,can break away barriers in design,which challenge the constraints,of mass production.,If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,,you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,,which means it's a more efficient product.,You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques,even if you tried to do it manually.,It's more efficient,because we can now create all these cavities within the object,that cool fluid.,And it's used by aerospace,and automotive.,It's a lighter part,and it uses less material waste.,So it's overall performance and efficiency,just exceeds standard mass produced products. 
 And then taking this idea,of creating a very detailed structure,,we can apply it to honeycomb structures,and use them within implants.,Typically an implant,is more effective within the body,if it's more porous,,because our body tissue will grow into it.,There's a lower chance of rejection.,But it's very hard to create that in standard ways.,With 3D printing,,we're seeing today,that we can create much better implants.,And in fact, because we can create,bespoke products en masse, one-offs,,we can create implants,that are specific to individuals. 
 So as you can see,,this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.,And we're starting to see it being used,for final end products.,And in fact, as the detail is improving,,the quality is improving,,the price of the machines are falling,and they're becoming quicker.,They're also now small enough,to sit on a desktop.,You can buy a machine today for about $300,that you can create yourself,,which is quite incredible. 
 But then it begs the question,,why don't we all have one in our home?,Because, simply, most of us here today,don't know how to create the data,that a 3D printer reads.,If I gave you a 3D printer,,you wouldn't know how to direct it,to make what you want it to.,But there are more and more,technologies, software and processes today,that are breaking down those barriers.,I believe we're at a tipping point,where this is now something,that we can't avoid.,This technology,is really going to disrupt,the landscape of manufacturing,and, I believe, cause a revolution,in manufacturing. 
 So today,,you can download products from the Web --,anything you would have on your desktop,,like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.,You can use software like Google SketchUp,to create products from scratch,very easily.,3D printing can be also used,to download spare parts from the Web.,So imagine you have, say,,a Hoover in your home,and it has broken down. You need a spare part,,but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.,Can you imagine going online --,this is a reality --,and finding that spare part,from a database of geometries,of that discontinued product,and downloading that information, that data,,and having the product made for you at home,,ready to use, on your demand?,And in fact, because we can create spare parts,with things the machines,are quite literally making themselves.,You're having machines fabricate themselves.,These are parts of a RepRap machine,,which is a kind of desktop printer. 
 But what interests my company the most,is the fact that you can create,individual unique products en masse.,There's no need to do a run,of thousands of millions,or send that product to be injection molded in China.,You can just make it physically on the spot.,Which means,that we can now present to the public,the next generation of customization.,This is something that is now possible today,,that you can direct personally,how you want your products to look. 
 We're all familiar with the idea,of customization or personalization.,Brands like Nike are doing it.,It's all over the Web.,In fact, every major household name,is allowing you,to interact with their products,on a daily basis --,all the way from Smart Cars,to Prada,to Ray Ban, for example.,But this is not really mass customization;,it's known as variant production,,variations of the same product.,What you could do is really influence your product now,and shape-manipulate your product. 
 I'm not sure about you guys,,but I've had experiences,when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted,and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp,that I know where I want to sit in my house,and I just can't find the right thing,,or that perfect piece of jewelry,as a gift or for myself.,Imagine that you can now,engage with a brand,and interact,,so that you can pass your personal attributes,to the products that you're about to buy. 
 You can today,download a product with software like this,,view the product in 3D.,This is the sort of 3D data,that a machine will read.,This is a lamp.,And you can start iterating the design.,You can direct what color that product will be,,perhaps what material.,And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,,but within boundaries that are safe.,Because obviously the public are not professional product designers.,The piece of software will keep an individual,within the bounds of the possible.,And when somebody is ready to purchase the product,in their personalized design,,they click "Enter" and this data gets converted,into the data that a 3D printer reads,and gets passed to a 3D printer,,perhaps on someone's desktop. 
 But I don't think that that's immediate.,I don't think that will happen soon.,What's more likely, and we're seeing it today,,is that data gets sent,to a local manufacturing center.,This means lower carbon footprint.,We're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,,we're sending data across the Internet.,Here's the product being built.,You can see, this came out of the machine in one piece,and the electronics were inserted later.,It's this lamp, as you can see here.,So as long as you have the data,,you can create the part on demand. 
 And you don't necessarily need to use this,for just aesthetic customization,,you can use it for functional customization,,scanning parts of the body,and creating things that are made to fit.,So we can run this through to something like prosthetics,,which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.,Or we can create very specific prosthetics,for that individual.,Scanning teeth today,,you can have your teeth scanned,and dental coatings made in this way to fit you.,While you wait at the dentist,,a machine will quietly be creating this for you,ready to insert in the teeth. 
 And the idea of now creating implants,,scanning data, an MRI scan of somebody,can now be converted into 3D data,and we can create very specific implants for them.,And applying this,to the idea of building up what's in our bodies.,You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.,It's very intricate.,You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.,But with MRI data,,we can just build the product,,as you can see, very intricately.,Using this process,,pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.,So one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,,and he has been working,on layering cells to create body parts --,bladders, valves, kidneys.,Now this is not something that's ready for the public,,but it is in working progress. 
 So just to finalize, we're all individual.,We all have different preferences, different needs.,We like different things.,We're all different sizes and our companies the same.,Businesses want different things.,Without a doubt in my mind,,I believe that this technology,is going to cause a manufacturing revolution,and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There's currently over a thousandnTED Talks on the TED website.,And I guess many of you herenthink that this is quite fantastic,,except for me, I don't agree with this.,I think we have a situation here.,Because if you think about it,n1,000 TED Talks,,that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.,How on earth are you goingnto spread a thousand ideas?,Even if you just trynto get all of those ideas into your head,by watching all those thousand TED videos,,it would actually currently take younover 250 hours to do so.,And I did a little calculation of this.,The damage to the economy for each onenwho does this is around $15,000.,So having seen this danger to the economy,,I thought, we need to findna solution to this problem. 
 Here's my approach to it all.,If you look at the current situation,nyou have a thousand TED Talks.,Each of those TED Talks hasnan average length of about 2,300 words.,Now take this together, and you end upnwith 2.3 million words of TED Talks,,which is aboutnthree Bibles-worth of content. 
 (Laughter) 
 The obvious question here is,ndoes a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?,Isn't there something shorter?,I mean, if you havenan idea worth spreading,,surely you can put itninto something shorter than 2,300 words.,The only question is,nhow short can you get?,What's the minimum amount of wordsnyou would need to do a TED Talk? 
 While I was pondering this question,,I came across this urban legendnabout Ernest Hemingway,,who allegedly saidnthat these six words here:,"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,",were the best novel he had ever written.,And I also encountered a projectncalled Six-Word Memoirs,where people were asked,ntake your whole life,and please sum this upninto six words, such as these here:,"Found true love, married someone else.",Or "Living in existentialnvacuum; it sucks.",I actually like that one.,So if a novel can be put into six words,and a whole memoir can be putninto six words,,you don't need more than sixnwords for a TED Talk.,We could have been done by lunch here. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if you did thisnfor all thousand TED Talks,,you would get from 2.3 millionnwords down to 6,000.,So I thought this was quite worthwhile. 
 So I started asking all my friends,,please take your favorite TED Talknand put that into six words.,So here are some of the resultsnthat I received.,I think they're quite nice.,For example, Dan Pink's talknon motivation, which was pretty good,,if you haven't seen it:n"Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning.",It's what he's basically talking aboutnin those 18,5 minutes.,Or some even included referencesnto the speakers,,such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style,nor the one of Tim Ferriss,,which might be consideredna bit strenuous at times. 
 The challenge here is,nif I try to systematically do this,,I would probably end upnwith a lot of summaries,,but not with many friends in the end.,So I had to find a different method,npreferably involving total strangers.,And luckily, there's a website for that,ncalled Mechanical Turk,,which is a websitenwhere you can post tasks,that you don't want to do yourself,,such as "Please summarize this textnfor me in six words.",And I didn't allow any low-costncountries to work on this,,but I found out I could getna six-word summary for just 10 cents,,which I think is a pretty good price. 
 Even then, unfortunately,,it's not possible to summarizeneach TED Talk individually.,Because if you do the math,nyou have a thousand TED Talks,,you pay 10 cents each;,you have to do more than one summarynfor each of those talks,,because some of them will probablynbe, or are, really bad.,So I would end up payingnhundreds of dollars.,So I thought of a different way,,by thinking, well, the talksnrevolve around certain themes.,So what if I don't let people summarizenindividual TED Talks to six words,,but give them 10 TED Talksnat the same time,and say, "Please do a six-wordnsummary for that one.",I would cut my costs by 90 percent.,So for $60,,I could summarize a thousand TED Talksninto just 600 summaries,,which would actually be quite nice. 
 Some of you might actuallynright now be thinking,,it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talksnsummarized into just six words.,But it's actually not,,because there's an examplenby statistics professor Hans Rosling.,I guess many of you have seennone or more of his talks.,He's got eight talks online,,and those can basically be summed upninto just four words,,because that's all he's basicallynshowing us, our intuition is really bad.,He always proves us wrong. 
 So people on the Internet,nsome didn't do so well.,And when I asked them to summarizenthe 10 TED Talks at the same time,,some took the easy route out.,They just had some general comment.,There were others --nand I found this quite cheeky --,They used their six wordsnto talk back to me,and ask me if I'd been too muchnon Google lately. 
 (Laughter) 
 And finally also, I never understood this,,some people really came upnwith their own version of the truth.,I don't know any TED Talknthat contains this. 
 But, oh well.,In the end, however,nand this is really amazing,,for each of those 10 TED Talknclusters that I submitted,,I actually received meaningful summaries.,Here are some of my favorites.,For example, for the TED Talks about food,,someone summed this up into: "Food shapingnbody, brains and environment,",which I think is pretty good.,Or happiness: "Striving toward happiness =nmoving toward unhappiness." 
 So here I was.,I had started outnwith a thousand TED Talks,and I had 600 six-wordnsummaries for those.,Actually, it sounded nicenin the beginning,,but when you look at 600 summaries,nit's quite a lot, it's a huge list. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I thought, I probably havento take this one step further here,and create summaries of the summaries,nand this is exactly what I did.,So I took the 600 summaries that I had,nput them into nine groups,according to the ratings that the talksnhad originally received on TED.com,and asked people to do summaries of those.,Again, there were some misunderstandings.,For example, when I had a clusternof all the "Beautiful" talks,,someone thought I was just tryingnto find the ultimate pick-up line.,But in the end, amazingly,,again, people were able to do it.,For example, all the courageous TED Talks:,"People dying" or "Peoplensuffering" was also one,,"with easy solutions around.",Or the recipe for the ultimatenjaw-dropping TED Talk:,"Flickr photos of intergalacticnclassical composer.",I mean that's the essence of it all. 
 Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean,nit's already quite a reduction.,But of course, once you are that far,nyou're not really satisfied.,I wanted to go all the way,nall the way down the distillery,,starting out with a thousand TED Talks.,I wanted to have a thousand TED Talksnsummarized into just six words --,which would be a 99.9997 percentnreduction in content.,And I would only pay $99.50 --,so stay even below $100 for it. 
 So I had 50 overall summaries done.,This time I paid 25 cents,because I thought the tasknwas a bit harder.,And unfortunately,nwhen I first received the answers --,and here, you'll see six of the answers --nI was a bit disappointed.,Because I think you'll agree,nthey all summarize some aspect of TED,,but to me, they felt a bit bland,,or they just hadna certain aspect of TED in them.,So I was almost ready to give up,when one night, I played aroundnwith these sentences,and found out that there's actuallyna beautiful solution in here.,So here it is,,a crowd-sourced, six-wordnsummary of a thousand TED Talks,at the value of $99.50:,"Why the worry? I'd rather wonder." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)This is Shivdutt Yadav,,and he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.,Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office,in Uttar Pradesh,,and he discovered,that official records were listing him as dead.,His land was no longer registered,in his name.,His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,,were also listed as dead. 
 Family members had bribed officials,to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land,by having the brothers declared dead,,allowing them to inherit,their father's share of the ancestral farmland.,Because of this, all three brothers and their families,had to vacate their home.,According to the Yadav family,,the local court has been scheduling a case review,since 2001,,but a judge has never appeared. 
 There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh,of people dying,before their case is given a proper review.,Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property,led to this corruption.,He was laid to rest in the Ganges River,,where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river,or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water. 
 Photographing these brothers,was a disorienting exchange,because on paper they don't exist,,and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.,Yet, these men remain dead.,This quandary led to the title of the project,,which considers in many ways,that we are all the living dead,and that we in some ways represent,ghosts of the past and the future. 
 So this story is the first of 18 chapters,in my new body of work titled "A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters.",And for this work,,I traveled around the world over a four-year period,researching and recording bloodlines,and their related stories.,I was interested in ideas surrounding fate,and whether our fate is determined,by blood, chance or circumstance.,The subjects I documented,ranged from feuding families in Brazil,to victims of genocide in Bosnia,to the first woman to hijack an airplane,and the living dead in India.,In each chapter, you can see the external forces,of governance, power and territory or religion,colliding with the internal forces,of psychological and physical inheritance. 
 Each work that I make,is comprised of three segments.,On the left are one or more portrait panels,in which I systematically order,the members of a given bloodline.,This is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form,,in which I construct,the narrative at stake.,And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.,It's a space that's more intuitive,in which I present fragments of the story,,beginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.,And it's meant to kind of reflect,how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,,in a less linear form.,So it's more disordered.,And this disorder is in direct contrast,to the unalterable order of a bloodline. 
 In my past projects I've often worked in serial form,,documenting things that have,the appearance of being comprehensive,through a determined title and a determined presentation,,but in fact, are fairly abstract.,In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction,and find an absolute catalog,,something that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.,This led me to blood.,A bloodline is determined and ordered.,But the project centers,on the collision of order and disorder --,the order of blood butting up against the disorder,represented in the often chaotic and violent stories,that are the subjects of my chapters. 
 In chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.,He was sent in 1907 to Palestine,by the Zionist organization,to look at areas for Jewish settlement,and acquire land for Jewish settlement.,He oversaw land acquisition,on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company,whose work led to the establishment,of a Jewish state.,Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,,I wanted to look at the early paperwork,of the establishment of the Jewish state.,And I found these maps which you see here.,And these are studies,commissioned by the Zionist organization,for alternative areas for Jewish settlement.,In this, I was interested in the consequences,of geography,and imagining how the world would be different,if Israel were in Uganda,,which is what these maps demonstrate.,These archives in Jerusalem,,they maintain a card index file,of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration,to Palestine, and later Israel,,from 1919 to 1965. 
 Chapter three:,Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo,treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya,for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,,mental illness, evil spirits.,He's most often paid for his services,in cash, cows or goats.,But sometimes when his female patients,can't afford his services,,their families give the women to Jura,in exchange for medical treatment.,As a result of these transactions,,Jura has nine wives,,32 children,and 63 grandchildren.,In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here. 
 Two of his wives were brought to him,suffering from infertility,and he cured them,,three for evil spirits,,one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain,and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love,,paying their families a total of 16 cows.,One wife deserted him,and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.,Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.,It's common among a privileged class,capable of paying numerous dowries,and keeping multiple homes.,Instances of prominent social and political figures,in polygamous relationships,has led to the perception of polygamy,as a symbol of wealth, status and power. 
 You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed,there are empty portraits.,These empty portraits represent individuals,,living individuals, who couldn't be present.,And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.,They include dengue fever,,imprisonment, army service,,women not allowed to be photographed,for religious and cultural reasons.,And in this particular chapter,,it's children whose mothers,wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot,for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it. 
 Twenty-four European rabbits,were brought to Australia in 1859,by a British settler,for sporting purposes, for hunting.,And within a hundred years,,that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.,The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,,and it competes with native wildlife,and damages native plants,and degrades the land.,Since the 1950s,,Australia has been introducing lethal diseases,into the wild rabbit population,to control growth.,These rabbits were bred at a government facility,,Biosecurity Queensland,,where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits,and have infected them with a lethal disease,and are monitoring their progress,to see if it will effectively kill them.,So they're testing its virulence.,During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,,except for a few, which were euthanized. 
 Haigh's Chocolate,,in collaboration,with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia,,stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate,and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.,Now this was done to counter,the annual celebration of rabbits,and presumably make the public more comfortable,with the killing of rabbits,and promote an animal that's native to Australia,,and actually an animal that is threatened,by the European rabbit. 
 In chapter seven, I focus on the effects,of a genocidal act,on one bloodline.,So over a two-day period,,six individuals from this bloodline,were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.,This is the only work,in which I visually represent the dead.,But I only represent those,that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre,,which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe,since the Second World War.,And during this massacre,,8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys,were systematically executed. 
 So when you look at a detail of this work,,you can see, the man on the upper-left,is the father of the woman sitting next to him.,Her name is Zumra.,She is followed by her four children,,all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.,Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister,who is then followed by her children,who were killed as well.,During the time I was in Bosnia,,the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son,were exhumed from a mass grave.,And I was therefore able to photograph,the fully assembled remains.,However, the other individuals,are represented by these blue slides,,which show tooth and bone samples,that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members,to prove they were the identities,of those individuals.,They've all been given a proper burial,,so what remains are these blue slides,at the International Commission for Missing Persons. 
 These are personal effects,dug up from a mass grave,that are awaiting identification from family members,and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory,,which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying,,and also the Serbian soldiers later,during the times of the executions.,This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial,,which from top to bottom,shows a Serbian scorpion unit,being blessed by an Orthodox priest,before rounding up the boys and men,and killing them. 
 Chapter 15 is more of a performance piece.,I solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009,to select a multi-generational bloodline,to represent China for this project.,They chose a large family from Beijing for its size,,and they declined to give me,any further reasoning for their choice.,This is one of the rare situations,where I have no empty portraits.,Everyone showed up.,You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy,as it travels through the bloodline. 
 Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda,,the State Council Information Office,is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.,It controls all foreign media and image production,outside of China,from foreign media working within China.,It also monitors the Internet,and instructs local media,on how to handle any potentially controversial issues,,including Tibet, ethnic minorities,,Human Rights, religion,,democracy movements and terrorism.,For the footnote panel in this work,,this office instructed me,to photograph their central television tower in Beijing.,And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me,when I left. 
 These are the descendants of Hans Frank,who was Hitler's personal legal advisor,and governor general of occupied Poland.,Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits,,highlighting a complex relationship,to one's family history.,The reasons for these absences,include people who declined participation.,There's also parents who participated,who wouldn't let their children participate,because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.,Another section of the family,presented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence,,because they didn't want to be identified,with the past that I was highlighting.,And finally, another individual,sat for me from behind,and later rescinded his participation,,so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable. 
 In the footnote panel that accompanies this work,I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp,and an imitation of that stamp,produced by British Intelligence,with Hans Frank's image on it.,It was released in Poland,to create friction between Frank and Hitler,,so that Hitler would imagine,Frank was trying to usurp his power. 
 Again, talking about fate,,I was interested in the stories and fate,of particular works of art.,These paintings were taken by Hans Frank,during the time of the Third Reich.,And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.,They are Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine,",Rembrandt's "Landscape With Good Samaritan",and Raphael's "Portrait of a Youth,",which has never been found. 
 Chapter 12 highlights,people being born into a battle that is not of their making,,but becomes their own.,So this is the Ferraz family,and the Novaes family.,And they are in an active blood feud.,This feud has been going on since 1991,in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco,,and it involved the deaths,of 20 members of the families,and 40 others associated with the feud,,including hired hit men, innocent bystanders,and friends.,Tensions between these two families date back to 1913,when there was a dispute over local political power.,But it got violent in the last two decades,and includes decapitation,and the death of two mayors.,Installed into a protective wall,surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes,,who's the head of the Novaes family,,are these turret holes,,which were used for shooting and looking. 
 Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco,is one of the nation's most violent regions.,It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice,,or an eye for an eye,,so retaliatory killings,have led to several deaths in the area.,This story, like many of the stories in my chapters,,reads almost as an archetypal episode,,like something out of Shakespeare,,that's happening now and will happen again in the future.,I'm interested in these ideas of repetition.,So after I returned home, I received word,that one member of the family,had been shot 30 times in the face. 
 Chapter 17,is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline,and the absence of a history.,Children at this Ukrainian orphanage,are between the ages of six and 16.,This piece is ordered by age,because it can't be ordered by blood.,In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,,only one child had been adopted.,Children have to leave the orphanage at age 16,,despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.,It's commonly reported in Ukraine,that children, when leaving the orphanage,are targeted for human trafficking,,child pornography and prostitution.,Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,,and high rates of suicide are recorded. 
 This is a boys' bedroom.,There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage,and not enough warm clothing.,Children bathe infrequently,because the hot water isn't turned on until October.,This is a girls' bedroom.,And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs,as an industrial size washing machine and dryer,,four vacuum cleaners, two computers,,a video projector, a copy machine,,winter shoes and a dentist's drill.,This photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms,,shows a sign which I had translated when I got home.,And it reads: "Those who do not know their past,are not worthy of their future." 
 There are many more chapters in this project.,This is just an abridged rendering,of over a thousand images.,And this mass pile of images and stories,forms an archive.,And within this accumulation of images and texts,,I'm struggling to find patterns,and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead,are just as coded as blood itself.,But archives exist,because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.,Something is said in the gaps,between all the information that's collected.,And there's this relentless persistence,of birth and death,and an unending collection of stories in between.,It's almost machine-like,the way people are born and people die,,and the stories keep coming and coming.,And in this, I'm considering,,is this actual accumulation,leading to some sort of evolution,,or are we on repeat,over and over again? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When we think of games,nthere's all kinds of things.,Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe,nyou're looking forward to a new game.,You've been up too late playing a game.,All these things happen to me.,But when we think about games,,a lot of times we thinknabout stuff like this:,first-person shooters, or the big,nwhat we would call AAA games,,or maybe you're a Facebook game player.,This is one my partner and I worked on.,Maybe you play Facebook games,nand that's what we're making right now.,This is a lighter form of game.,Maybe you think aboutnthe tragically boring board games,that hold us hostagenin Thanksgiving situations.,This would be one of the tragically boringnboard games that you can figure out.,Or maybe you're in your living room,,playing with the Wii with the kids,,and there's this whole range of games,nand that's very much what I think about.,I make my living from games,nI've been lucky enough to do this,since I was 15, which also qualifiesnas I've never really had a real job. 
 But we think about games as fun,nand that's completely reasonable,,but let's just think about this.,So this one here,nthis is the 1980 Olympics.,Now I don't know where you guys were,,but I was in my living room.,It was practically a religious event.,And this is when the Americansnbeat the Russians,,and this was --nyes, it was technically a game.,Hockey is a game.,But really, was this a game?,I mean, people cried.,I've never seen my mother crynlike that at the end of Monopoly. 
 (Laughter),And so this was an amazing experience. 
 Or, if anybody here is from Boston --,So when the Boston Red Soxnwon the World Series,after I believe, 351 years -- 
 (Laughter) 
 when they won the World Series,nit was amazing.,I happened to be livingnin Springfield at the time,,and the best part of it was,,you would close the women's doornin the bathroom,,and I remember seeing "Go Sox,"nand I thought, really?,Or the houses, you'd come out,nbecause every game,,well, I think almost every game,nwent into overtime, right?,So we'd be outside, and all the othernlights are on in the whole block.,And kids -- the attendancenwas down in school,,kids weren't going to school,nbut it's OK, it's the Red Sox, right?,I mean, there's education,nand then there's the Red Sox,,and we know where they're stacked.,So this was an amazing experience,,and again, yes, it was a game,nbut they didn't write newspaper articles,,people didn't say, "You know, really,nI can die now, because the Red Sox won.",And many people did. 
 So games, it means something more to us.,It absolutely means something more. 
 So now, this is an abrupt transition here.,There was three years wherenI actually did have a real job, sort of.,I was the head of a collegendepartment teaching games,,so, again, it was sort of a real job,,and now I got to talk about making themnas opposed to making them.,Part of the job of it,nwhen you're a chair of a department,,is to eat, and I did that very well --,and so I'm out at a dinnernwith this guy called Zig Jackson.,So this is Zig in this photograph,nthis is also one of Zig's photographs.,He's a photographer.,And he goes all around the countryntaking pictures of himself,,and you can see here he's gotnZig's Indian Reservation.,And this particular shot --,this is one of the more traditional shots.,This is a rain dancer. 
 And this is one of my favorite shots here.,So you can look at this, and maybenyou've even seen things like this.,This is an expression of culture, right?,And this is actuallynfrom his Degradation series.,And what was most fascinatingnto me about this series,is just, look at that little boy there,ncan you imagine?,We can see that'sna traditional Native American.,Now I just want to change that guy's race.,Just imagine if that's a black guy.,So, "Honey, come here, let's get youna picture with the black guy." Right?,Like, seriously, nobody would do this.,It baffles the mind.,And so Zig, being Indian,nlikewise it baffles his mind.,His favorite photograph --,my favorite photograph of his,nwhich I don't have in here --,is Indian taking picture of white peoplentaking pictures of Indians. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I happen to be at dinnernwith this photographer,,and he was talkingnwith another photographer,about a shooting that had occurred,,and it was on an Indian Reservation.,He'd taken his camera up therento photograph it,,but when he got there,nhe discovered he couldn't do it.,He just couldn't capture the picture.,And so they were talking back and forthnabout this question.,Do you take the picture or not?,And that was fascinatingnto me as a game designer,,because it never occurs to me,,should I make the gamenabout this difficult topic or not?,Because we just make things that are fun,or will make you feel fear,nthat visceral excitement.,But every other medium does it. 
 So this is my kid.,This is Maezza, and when she wasnseven years old,,she came home from school one day,,and like I do every single day,nI asked her, "What did you do today?",So she said, "We talkednabout the Middle Passage." 
 Now, this was a big moment.nMaezza's dad is black,,and I knew this day was coming.,I wasn't expecting it at seven,nI don't know why, but I wasn't. 
 Anyways, so I asked her,n"How do you feel about that?",So she proceeded to tell me,,and so any of you who are parentsnwill recognize the bingo buzzwords here.,"The ships start in England,nthey come down from England,,they go to Africa,nthey go across the ocean --,that's the Middle Passage part --,they come to America, wherenthe slaves are sold," she's telling me.,But Abraham Lincoln was elected president,,and then he passednthe Emancipation Proclamation,,and now they're free. 
 Pause for about 10 seconds. 
 "Can I play a game, Mommy?" 
 And I thought, that's it?nAnd so, you know,,this is the Middle Passage,nthis is an incredibly significant event,,and she's treating it like, basicallynsome black people went on a cruise,,this is more or less how it sounds to her. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so, to me,nI wanted more value in this,,so when she askednif she could play a game, I said, "Yes." 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I happened to havenall of these little pieces.,I'm a game designer, so I haventhis stuff sitting around my house.,I said, "Yeah, you can play a game,"nand I give her a bunch of these,,and I tell her to paint themnin different families.,These are pictures of Maezzanwhen she was --,God, it still chokes me up seeing these.,So she's painting her little families.,So then I grab a bunch of themnand I put them on a boat.,This was the boat,nit was made quickly, obviously.,And so the basic gist of it is,nI grabbed a bunch of families,,and she's like, "Mommy,nbut you forgot the pink baby,and you forgot the blue daddy,and you forgot all these other things.",And she says, "They want to go.",And I said, "Honey,nno, they don't want to go.,This is the Middle Passage, Nobody wantsnto go on the Middle Passage.",So she gave me a look that only a daughternof a game designer would give a mother,,and as we're going across the ocean,nfollowing these rules,,she realizes that she's rollingnpretty high,,and she says to me,n"We're not going to make it." 
 And she realizes,nwe don't have enough food,,and so she asks what to do,,and I say -- remember, she's seven --,"We can either putnsome people in the water,or we can hope that they don't get sick,and we make it to the other side.",Just the look on her face came over --,now mind you this is after a month of --,this is Black History Month, right?,After a month, she says to me,n"Did this really happen?",And I said, "Yes." And so she said --,this is her brother and sister --,"If I came out of the woods,nAvalon and Donovan might be gone.","Yes.","But I'd get to see them in America.","No.","But what if I saw them?nCouldn't we stay together?","So Daddy could be gone.","Yes.",She was fascinated by this,nand she started to cry,,I started to cry, her father startednto cry, and now we're all crying.,He didn't expect to come home from worknto the Middle Passage, but there it goes. 
 And so, we made this game, and she got it.,She got it because she spent timenwith these people.,It wasn't abstract stuffnin a brochure or in a movie. 
 And so it was just an incrediblynpowerful experience.,This is the game, which I've ended upncalling "The New World,",because I like the phrase.,I don't think the New Worldnfelt too new worldly exciting,to the people who werenbrought over on slave ships. 
 But when this happened,nI saw the whole planet; I was so excited.,I'd been making games for 20-some years,,and then I decided to do it again.,My history is Irish.,So this is a game called "Síochán Leat."nIt's "peace be with you.",It's the entire historynof my family in a single game. 
 I made another game called "Train.",I was making a series of six gamesnthat covered difficult topics,,and if you're going to cover a difficultntopic, this is one you need to cover,,and I'll let you figure outnwhat that's about on your own. 
 And I also made a gamenabout the Trail of Tears.,This is a gamenwith 50,000 individual pieces.,I was crazy when I decided to start it,nbut I'm in the middle of it now.,It's the same thing.,I'm hoping that I'll teachnculture through these games. 
 And the one I'm workingnon right now, which is --,because I'm right in the middle of it,,and these for some reasonnchoke me up like crazy --,is a game calledn"Mexican Kitchen Workers.",And originally, it wasna math problem, more or less.,Here's the economicsnof illegal immigration.,And the more I learnednabout Mexican culture --,my partner is Mexican —nthe more I learned that,,you know, for all of us,nfood is a basic need,,and it is obviously with Mexicans, too,nbut it's much more than that.,It's an expression of love.nIt's an expression of --,God, I'm totally choking upnway more than I thought.,I'll look away from the picture.,It's an expression of beauty,nit's how they say they love you.,It's how they say they care,,and you can't hear somebodyntalk about their Mexican grandmother,without saying "food"nin the first sentence.,And so to me, this beautiful culture,,this beautiful expression is somethingnthat I want to capture through games. 
 And so games, for a change,nit changes how we see topics,,it changes our perceptionsnabout those people in topics,,and it changes ourselves.,We change as people through games,,because we're involved, and we're playing,,and we're learning as we do so. 
 Thank you.I think we have to do something,about a piece of the culturenof medicine that has to change.,And I think it startsnwith one physician, and that's me.,And maybe I've been around long enough,that I can afford to give awaynsome of my false prestige,to be able to do that.,Before I actually beginnthe meat of my talk,,let's begin with a bit of baseball.,Hey, why not?,We're near the end, we're gettingnclose to the World Series.,We all love baseball, don't we?,(Laughter),Baseball is fillednwith some amazing statistics.,And there's hundreds of them.,"Moneyball" is about to come out,nand it's all about statistics,and using statistics to buildna great baseball team.,I'm going to focus on one stat,that I hope a lot of you have heard of.,It's called batting average.,So we talk about a 300,na batter who bats 300.,That means that ballplayernbatted safely, hit safely,three times out of 10 at bats.,That means hit the ball into the outfield,,it dropped, it didn't get caught,,and whoever tried to throw it to firstnbase didn't get there in time,and the runner was safe.,Three times out of 10.,Do you know what they call a 300 hitter,in Major League Baseball?,Good, really good,,maybe an all-star.,Do you know what they call,a 400 baseball hitter?,That's somebody who hit, by the way,,four times safely out of every 10.,Legendary --,as in Ted Williams legendary --,the last Major League Baseball player,to hit over 400 during a regular season.,Now let's take this backninto my world of medicine,where I'm a lot more comfortable,,or perhaps a bit less comfortable,after what I'm going to talk to you about.,Suppose you have appendicitis,and you're referred to a surgeon,who's batting 400 on appendectomies.,(Laughter),Somehow this isn't working out, is it?,Now suppose you live,in a certain partnof a certain remote place,and you have a loved one,who has blockages in two coronary arteries,and your family doctor refersnthat loved one to a cardiologist,who's batting 200 on angioplasties.,But, but, you know what?,She's doing a lot better this year.nShe's on the comeback trail.,And she's hitting a 257.,Somehow this isn't working.,But I'm going to ask you a question.,What do you think a batting average,for a cardiac surgeonnor a nurse practitioner,or an orthopedic surgeon,,an OBGYN, a paramedic,is supposed to be?,1,000, very good.,Now truth of the matter is,,nobody knows in all of medicine,what a good surgeon,or physician or paramedic,is supposed to bat.,What we do though is we sendneach one of them, including myself,,out into the world,with the admonition, be perfect.,Never ever, ever make a mistake,,but you worry about the details,nabout how that's going to happen.,And that was the message that I absorbed,when I was in med school.,I was an obsessive compulsive student.,In high school, a classmate once said,that Brian Goldman would studynfor a blood test.,(Laughter),And so I did.,And I studied in my little garret,at the nurses' residencenat Toronto General Hospital,,not far from here.,And I memorized everything.,I memorized in my anatomy class,the origins and exertions of every muscle,,every branch of every arterynthat came off the aorta,,differential diagnoses obscure and common.,I even knew the differential diagnosis,in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.,And all the while,,I was amassing more and more knowledge.,And I did well, I graduated with honors,,cum laude.,And I came out of medical school,with the impression,that if I memorized everythingnand knew everything,,or as much as possible,,as close to everything as possible,,that it would immunize menagainst making mistakes.,And it worked,for a while,,until I met Mrs. Drucker.,I was a resident at a teachingnhospital here in Toronto,when Mrs. Drucker was broughtnto the emergency department,of the hospital where I was working.,At the time I was assignednto the cardiology service,on a cardiology rotation.,And it was my job,,when the emergency staff callednfor a cardiology consult,,to see that patient in emerg.,and to report back to my attending.,And I saw Mrs. Drucker,nand she was breathless.,And when I listened to her,nshe was making a wheezy sound.,And when I listened to hernchest with a stethoscope,,I could hear crackly sounds on both sides,that told me that she was in congestivenheart failure.,This is a conditionnin which the heart fails,,and instead of being ablento pump all the blood forward,,some of the blood backs up into the lung,nthe lungs fill up with blood,,and that's why you havenshortness of breath.,And that wasn't a difficultndiagnosis to make.,I made it and I set to work treating her.,I gave her aspirin. I gave her medicationsnto relieve the strain on her heart.,I gave her medications that we callndiuretics, water pills,,to get her to pee out the access fluid.,And over the coursenof the next hour and a half or two,,she started to feel better.,And I felt really good.,And that's when I made my first mistake;,I sent her home.,Actually, I made two more mistakes.,I sent her home,without speaking to my attending.,I didn't pick up the phone and donwhat I was supposed to do,,which was call my attendingnand run the story by him,so he would have a chancento see her for himself.,And he knew her,,he would have been able to furnishnadditional information about her.,Maybe I did it for a good reason.,Maybe I didn't want to bena high-maintenance resident.,Maybe I wanted to be so successful,and so able to take responsibility,that I would do so,and I would be able to takencare of my attending's patients,without even having to contact him.,The second mistake that I made was worse.,In sending her home,,I disregarded a little voicendeep down inside,that was trying to tell me,,"Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this.",In fact, so lacking in confidence was I,that I actually asked the nurse,who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,,"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?",And the nurse thought about it,and said very matter-of-factly,n"Yeah, I think she'll do okay.",I can remember that like it was yesterday.,So I signed the discharge papers,,and an ambulance came, paramedicsncame to take her home.,And I went back to my work on the wards.,All the rest of that day,,that afternoon,,I had this kind of gnawingnfeeling inside my stomach.,But I carried on with my work.,And at the end of the day,nI packed up to leave the hospital,and walked to the parking lot,to take my car and drive home,when I did somethingnthat I don't usually do.,I walked through the emergencyndepartment on my way home.,And it was there that another nurse,,not the nurse who was lookingnafter Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,,said three words to me,that are the three words,that most emergencynphysicians I know dread.,Others in medicine dread them as well,,but there's something particularnabout emergency medicine,because we see patients so fleetingly.,The three words are:,Do you remember?,"Do you remembernthat patient you sent home?",the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.,"Well she's back,",in just that tone of voice.,Well she was back all right.,She was back and near death.,About an hour after she had arrived home,,after I'd sent her home,,she collapsed and her family called 911,and the paramedics brought hernback to the emergency department,where she had a blood pressure of 50,,which is in severe shock.,And she was barely breathingnand she was blue.,And the emerg. staffnpulled out all the stops.,They gave her medicationsnto raise her blood pressure.,They put her on a ventilator.,And I was shocked,and shaken to the core.,And I went through this roller coaster,,because after they stabilized her,,she went to the intensive care unit,,and I hoped against hopenthat she would recover.,And over the next two or three days,,it was clear that she was neverngoing to wake up.,She had irreversible brain damage.,And the family gathered.,And over the coursenof the next eight or nine days,,they resigned themselvesnto what was happening.,And at about the nine daynmark, they let her go --,Mrs. Drucker,,a wife, a mother,and a grandmother.,They say you never forget the names,of those who die.,And that was my first timento be acquainted with that.,Over the next few weeks,,I beat myself up,and I experienced for the first time,the unhealthy shame that exists,in our culture of medicine --,where I felt alone, isolated,,not feeling the healthy kindnof shame that you feel,,because you can't talknabout it with your colleagues.,You know that healthy kind,,when you betray a secret that a bestnfriend made you promise never to reveal,and then you get busted,and then your best friend confronts you,and you have terrible discussions,,but at the end of itnall that sick feeling guides you,and you say, I'll nevernmake that mistake again.,And you make amends and younnever make that mistake again.,That's the kind of shamenthat is a teacher.,The unhealthy shame I'm talking about,is the one that makes you so sick inside.,It's the one that says,,not that what you did was bad,,but that you are bad.,And it was what I was feeling.,And it wasn't because of my attending;nhe was a doll.,He talked to the family, and I'm quitensure that he smoothed things over,and made sure that I didn't get sued.,And I kept asking myself these questions.,Why didn't I ask my attending?nWhy did I send her home?,And then at my worst moments:,Why did I make such a stupid mistake?,Why did I go into medicine?,Slowly but surely,,it lifted.,I began to feel a bit better.,And on a cloudy day,,there was a crack in the cloudsnand the sun started to come out,and I wondered,,maybe I could feel better again.,And I made myself a bargain,that if only I redoublenmy efforts to be perfect,and never make another mistake again,,please make the voices stop.,And they did.,And I went back to work.,And then it happened again.,Two years later I was an attendingnin the emergency department,at a community hospitalnjust north of Toronto,,and I saw a 25 year-oldnman with a sore throat.,It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.,He kept pointing here.,I looked at his throat,nit was a little bit pink.,And I gave him a prescriptionnfor penicillin,and sent him on his way.,And even as he was walking out the door,,he was still sortnof pointing to his throat.,And two days later I came to donmy next emergency shift,,and that's when my chief askednto speak to me quietly in her office.,And she said the three words:,Do you remember?,"Do you remember that patientnyou saw with the sore throat?",Well it turns out, he didn'tnhave a strep throat.,He had a potentiallynlife-threatening condition,called epiglottitis.,You can Google it,,but it's an infection, notnof the throat, but of the upper airway,,and it can actually causenthe airway to close.,And fortunately he didn't die.,He was placed on intravenous antibiotics,and he recovered after a few days.,And I went through the same periodnof shame and recriminations,and felt cleansed and went back to work,,until it happened againnand again and again.,Twice in one emergency shift,nI missed appendicitis.,Now that takes some doing,,especially when you work in a hospital,that at the time sawnbut 14 people a night.,Now in both cases, I didn't send them home,and I don't think therenwas any gap in their care.,One I thought had a kidney stone.,I ordered a kidney X-ray. Whennit turned out to be normal,,my colleague who was doingna reassessment of the patient,noticed some tenderness in the rightnlower quadrant and called the surgeons.,The other one had a lot of diarrhea.,I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him,and asked my colleague to reassess him.,And he did,and when he noticed some tenderness in the rightnlower quadrant, called the surgeons.,In both cases,,they had their operationsnand they did okay.,But each time,,they were gnawing at me, eating at me.,And I'd like to be able to say to you,that my worst mistakes only happenednin the first five years of practice,as many of my colleaguesnsay, which is total B.S.,(Laughter),Some of my doozies havenbeen in the last five years.,Alone, ashamed and unsupported.,Here's the problem:,If I can't come clean,and talk about my mistakes,,if I can't find the still-small voice,that tells me what really happened,,how can I share it with my colleagues?,How can I teach them about what I did,so that they don't do the same thing?,If I were to walk into a room --,like right now, I have nonidea what you think of me.,When was the last timenyou heard somebody talk,about failure after failure after failure?,Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party,and you might hearnabout some other doctor,,but you're not going to hear somebody,talking about their own mistakes.,If I were to walk into a roomnfilled with my colleages,and ask for their support right now,and start to tell what I've justntold you right now,,I probably wouldn't getnthrough two of those stories,before they would startnto get really uncomfortable,,somebody would crack a joke,,they'd change the subjectnand we would move on.,And in fact, if I knewnand my colleagues knew,that one of my orthopedic colleaguesntook off the wrong leg in my hospital,,believe me, I'd have trouble,making eye contact with that person.,That's the system that we have.,It's a complete denial of mistakes.,It's a system,in which there are two kindsnof physicians --,those who make mistakes,and those who don't,,those who can't handle sleepndeprivation and those who can,,those who have lousy outcomes,and those who have great outcomes.,And it's almostnlike an ideological reaction,,like the antibodies beginnto attack that person.,And we have this idea,that if we drive the peoplenwho make mistakes,out of medicine,,what will we be leftnwith, but a safe system.,But there are two problems with that.,In my 20 years or so,of medical broadcasting and journalism,,I've made a personal study of medicalnmalpractice and medical errors,to learn everything I can,,from one of the first articlesnI wrote for the Toronto Star,to my show "White Coat, Black Art.",And what I've learned,is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.,We work in a system,where errors happen every day,,where one in 10 medications,are either the wrongnmedication given in hospital,or at the wrong dosage,,where hospital-acquired infectionsnare getting more and more numerous,,causing havoc and death.,In this country,,as many as 24,000 Canadians die,of preventable medical errors.,In the United States, the Institutenof Medicine pegged it at 100,000.,In both cases, thesenare gross underestimates,,because we really aren'tnferreting out the problem,as we should.,And here's the thing.,In a hospital system,where medical knowledge is doubling,every two or three years,nwe can't keep up with it.,Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.,We can't get rid of it.,We have our cognitive biases,,so that I can take a perfect historynon a patient with chest pain.,Now take the same patient with chest pain,,make them moist and garrulous,and put a little bitnof alcohol on their breath,,and suddenly my historynis laced with contempt.,I don't take the same history.,I'm not a robot;,I don't do things the same way each time.,And my patients aren't cars;,they don't tell me their symptomsnin the same way each time.,Given all of that,nmistakes are inevitable.,So if you take the system,nas I was taught,,and weed out all the error-pronenhealth professionals,,well there won't be anybody left.,And you know that business,about people not wanting,to talk about their worst cases?,On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,",I made it a habit of saying,n"Here's my worst mistake,",I would say to everybody,from paramedics to the chiefnof cardiac surgery,,"Here's my worst mistake,"nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah,,"What about yours?" and I would pointnthe microphone towards them.,And their pupils would dilate,,they would recoil,,then they would look down and swallow hard,and start to tell me their stories.,They want to tell their stories.nThey want to share their stories.,They want to be able to say,,"Look, don't make the same mistake I did.",What they need is an environmentnto be able to do that.,What they need is a redefinednmedical culture.,And it startsnwith one physician at a time.,The redefined physician is human,,knows she's human,,accepts it, isn't proudnof making mistakes,,but strives to learn one thing,from what happened,that she can teach to somebody else.,She shares her experience with others.,She's supportive when othernpeople talk about their mistakes.,And she points out othernpeople's mistakes,,not in a gotcha way,,but in a loving, supportive way,so that everybody can benefit.,And she works in a culture of medicine,that acknowledges,that human beings run the system,,and when human beings run the system,nthey will make mistakes from time to time.,So the system is evolving,to create backups,that make it easiernto detect those mistakes,that humans inevitably make,and also fostersnin a loving, supportive way,places where everybody who is observing,in the health care system,can actually point out thingsnthat could be potential mistakes,and is rewarded for doing so,,and especially people like me,nwhen we do make mistakes,,we're rewarded for coming clean.,My name is Brian Goldman.,I am a redefined physician.,I'm human. I make mistakes.,I'm sorry about that,,but I strive to learn one thing,that I can pass on to other people.,I still don't know what you think of me,,but I can live with that.,And let me closenwith three words of my own:,I do remember.,(Applause)Shall I ask for a shownof hands or a clapping,of people in different generations?,I'm interested in how manynare three to 12 years old. 
 (Laughter) 
 None, huh? 
 (Laughter),All right.,I'm going to talk about dinosaurs.,Do you remember dinosaursnwhen you were that age? 
 (Applause) 
 Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're going to kind of gonin a different direction right now.,I hope you all realize that.,So I'll just give you my message up front:,Try not to go extinct. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's it. 
 (Laughter) 
 People ask me a lot --,in fact, one of the most askednquestions I get,is, why do childrennlike dinosaurs so much?,What's the fascination?,And I usually just say,,"Well, dinosaurs were big,,different and gone.",They're all gone.,Well that's not true,,but we'll get to the goose in a minute.,So that's sort of the theme:,big, different and gone.,The title of my talk:,Shape-shifting Dinosaurs:,The cause of a premature extinction. 
 Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs.,And there's lots of different shapes.,Lots of different kinds.,A long time ago,,back in the early 1900s,nmuseums were out looking for dinosaurs.,They went out and gathered them up.,And this is an interesting story.,Every museum wanted a little biggernor better one than anybody else had.,So if the museum in Toronto went outnand collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,,then the museum in Ottawanwanted a bigger one, and a better one.,And that happened for all museums.,So everyone was out lookingnfor all these bigger and better dinosaurs.,And this was in the early 1900s. 
 By about 1970,,some scientists were sitting aroundnand they thought, "What in the world --,Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big.,Where are all the little ones?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And they thought about itnand they even wrote papers about it:,"Where are the little dinosaurs?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, go to a museum, you'll see,,see how many baby dinosaurs there are.,People assumed --nand this was actually a problem --,people assumednthat if they had little dinosaurs,,if they had juvenile dinosaurs,nthey'd be easy to identify.,You'd have a big dinosaurnand a littler dinosaur. 
 (Laughter) 
 But all they had were big dinosaurs. 
 And it comes down to a couple of things.,First off, scientists have egos,,and scientists like to name dinosaurs.,They like to name anything.,Everybody likes to haventheir own animal that they named. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so every time they found somethingnthat looked a little different,,they named it something different.,And what happened, of course,,is we ended up with a wholenbunch of different dinosaurs. 
 In 1975,,a light went on in somebody's head.,Dr. Peter Dodsonnat the University of Pennsylvania,actually realized that dinosaursngrew kind of like birds do,,which is differentnthan the way reptiles grow.,And in fact,,he used the cassowary as an example.,And it's kind of cool --nif you look at the cassowary,,or any of the birdsnthat have crests on their heads,,they grow to about 80 percent adult sizenbefore the crest starts to grow.,Now think about that.,They're basically retainingntheir juvenile characteristics,very late in what we call ontogeny.,So allometric cranial ontogenynis relative skull growth.,So you can see that if you actually foundnone that was 80 percent grown,and you didn't know that it was goingnto grow up to a cassowary,,you would thinknthey were two different animals. 
 So this was a problem,,and Peter Dodson pointed this outnusing some duck-billed dinosaurs,then called Hypacrosaurus.,And he showed that if you were to takena baby and an adult,and make an averagenof what it should look like,,if it grew in sort of a linear fashion,,it would have a crestnabout half the size of the adult.,But the actual subadult at 65 percentnhad no crest at all.,So this was interesting.,So this is where people went astray again.,I mean, if they'd have just taken that,,taken Peter Dodson's work,nand gone on with that,,then we would have a lot lessndinosaurs than we have.,But scientists have egos;nthey like to name things.,And so they went on naming dinosaursnbecause they were different. 
 Now we have a way of actually testing,to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,nis a young one or an older one.,And that's by actuallyncutting into their bones.,But cutting into the bones of a dinosaurnis hard to do, as you can imagine,,because in museums, bones are precious.,You go into a museum,nand they take really good care of them.,They put them in foam, little containers.,They're very well taken care of.,They don't like it if you come innand want to saw them open and look inside. 
 (Laughter) 
 So they don't normally let you do that. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I have a museumnand I collect dinosaurs,and I can saw mine open.,So that's what I do. 
 (Applause) 
 So if you cut open a little dinosaur,,it's very spongy inside, like A.,And if you cut into an older dinosaur,nit's very massive.,You can tell it's mature bone.,So it's real easy to tell them apart.,So what I want to do is show you these.,In North America in the northern plainsnof the United States,and the southern plainsnof Alberta and Saskatchewan,,there's this unit of rockncalled the Hell Creek Formation,that produces the lastndinosaurs that lived on Earth.,And there are 12 of themnthat everyone recognizes --,I mean the 12 primary dinosaursnthat went extinct.,And so we will evaluate them.,And that's sort of what I've been doing.,So my students, my staff,nwe've been cutting them open.,Now as you can imagine,ncutting open a leg bone is one thing,,but when you go to a museum,and say, "You don't mind if I cut opennyour dinosaur's skull, do you?",they say, "Go away." 
 (Laughter) 
 So here are 12 dinosaurs.,And we want to look at these three first. 
 So these are dinosaursnthat are called Pachycephalosaurus.,And everybody knowsnthat these three animals are related.,And the assumption is that they're relatednlike cousins or whatever.,But no one ever considerednthat they might be more closely related.,In other words,,people looked at themnand they saw the differences.,And you all knownthat if you are going to determine,whether you're relatednto your brother or your sister,,you can't do it by looking at differences.,You can only determine relatednessnby looking for similarities. 
 So people were looking at these,and they were talkingnabout how different they are.,Pachycephalosaurus has a big,nthick dome on its head,,and it's got some little bumpsnon the back of its head,,and it's got a bunch of gnarly thingsnon the end of its nose.,And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaurnfrom the same age, lived at the same time,,has spikes sticking outnthe back of its head.,It's got a little, tiny dome,,and it's got a bunchnof gnarly stuff on its nose.,And then there's this thingncalled Dracorex hogwartsia.,Guess where that came from?,Dragon.,So here's a dinosaur that has spikesnsticking out of its head,,no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose. 
 Nobody noticed the gnarly stuffnsort of looked alike.,But they did look at these three,and they said, "Thesenare three different dinosaurs,,and Dracorex is probablynthe most primitive of them.,And the other onenis more primitive than the other.",It's unclear to me how they actuallynsorted these three of them out.,But if you line them up,,if you just take those three skullsnand just line them up,,they line up like this.,Dracorex is the littlest one,,Stygimoloch is the middle-size one,,Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.,And one would think,nthat should give me a clue. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it didn't give them a clue. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because, well we know why.,Scientists like to name things. 
 So if we cut open Dracorex --,I cut open our Dracorex --,and look, it was spongy inside,nreally spongy inside.,I mean, it is a juvenilenand it's growing really fast.,So it is going to get bigger.,If you cut open Stygimoloch,nit is doing the same thing.,The dome, that little dome,nis growing really fast.,It's inflating very fast.,What's interesting is the spikenon the back of the Dracorex,was growing very fast as well.,The spikes on the back of the Stygimolochnare actually resorbing,,which means they're getting smallernas that dome is getting bigger.,And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,,Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome,and its little bumps on the backnof its head were also resorbing. 
 So just with these three dinosaurs,,as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize,that it is just a growth seriesnof the same animal.,Which of course means,that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which of course meansnwe have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with. 
 So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --nhe and I were looking at Triceratops.,And before the year 2000 --,now remember, Triceratops was firstnfound in the 1800s --,before 2000, no one had ever seenna juvenile Triceratops.,There's a Triceratopsnin every museum in the world,,but no one had ever collected a juvenile.,And we know why, right?,Because everybody wants to have a big one.,So everyone had a big one.,So we went out and collectedna whole bunch of stuff,and we found a whole bunch of little ones.,They're everywhere,nthey're all over the place.,So we have a whole bunchnof them at our museum. 
 (Laughter) 
 And everybody saysnit's because I have a little museum.,When you have a little museum,nyou have little dinosaurs. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you look at the Triceratops,,you can see it's changing,nit's shape-shifting.,As the juveniles are growing up,ntheir horns actually curve backwards.,And then as they get older,nthe horns grow forward.,And that's pretty cool.,If you look along the edge of the frill,,they have these little triangular bonesnthat actually grow big as triangles,and then they flatten against the frill,pretty much like the spikes donon the Pachycephalosaurs.,And then, because the juvenilesnare in my collection,,I cut them open ... 
 (Laughter) 
 and look inside.,And the little one is really spongy.,And the middle-size one is really spongy.,But what was interestingnwas the adult Triceratops was also spongy.,And this is a skullnthat is two meters long.,It's a big skull. 
 But there's another dinosaurnthat is found in this formation,that looks like a Triceratops,nexcept it's bigger,,and it's called Torosaurus.,And Torosaurus, when we cutninto it, has mature bone.,But it's got these bignholes in its shield.,And everybody says,,"A Triceratops and a Torosaurusncan't possibly be the same animal,because one of them's biggernthan the other one." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And it has holes in its frill.",And I said, "Well do we havenany juvenile Torosauruses?",And they said, "Well, no,nbut it has holes in its frill." 
 So one of my graduatenstudents, John Scannella,,looked through our whole collection,and he actually discovered that the holenstarting to form in Triceratops,and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus --,so he found the transitional onesnbetween Triceratops and Torosaurus,,which was pretty cool.,So now we know that Torosaurusnis actually a grown-up Triceratops.,Now when we name dinosaurs,,when we name anything,nthe original name gets to stick,and the second name is thrown out.,So Torosaurus is extinct.,Triceratops, if you've heard the news,na lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.,They thought Torosaurus should be keptnand Triceratops thrown out,,but that's not going to happen. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, so we can do thisnwith a bunch of dinosaurs.,I mean, here's Edmontosaurus,and Anatotitan.,Anatotitan: giant duck.,It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.,Here's another one.,So we look at the bone histology.,The bone histology tells usnthat Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,,or at least a subadult,,and the other one is an adult,nand we have an ontogeny.,And we get rid of Anatotitan. 
 So we can just keep doing this.,And the last one is T. Rex.,So there's these two dinosaurs,nT. Rex and Nanotyrannus. 
 (Laughter) 
 Again, it makes you wonder. 
 (Laughter) 
 But they had a good question.,They were looking at them and they said,n"One's got 17 teeth,,and the biggest one's got 12 teeth.,And that doesn't make any sense at all,,because we don't know of any dinosaursnthat gain teeth as they get older.,So it must be true --,they must be different.",So we cut into them.,And sure enough,nNanotyrannus has juvenile bone,and the bigger one has more mature bone.,It looks like it could still get bigger.,And at the Museumnof the Rockies where we work,,I have four T. rexes,nso I can cut a whole bunch of them.,But I didn't have to cutnany of them really,,because I just lined up their jaws,and it turned outnthe biggest one had 12 teeth,and the next smallest one had 13,and the next smallest had 14.,And of course, Nano has 17.,And we just went out and lookednat other people's collections,and we found one that hasnsort of 15 teeth.,So again, real easy to say,that Tyrannosaurus ontogenynincluded Nanotyrannus,,and therefore we can take outnanother dinosaur. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when it comes downnto our end Cretaceous,,we have seven left.,And that's a good number.,That's a good numbernto go extinct, I think.,Now as you can imagine,,this is not very popularnwith fourth-graders. 
 (Laughter) 
 Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs,nthey memorize them.,And they're not happy with this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Every year in the United States alone,,2,077,000 couples makena legal and spiritual decision,to spend the restnof their lives together -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And not to have sex with anyone else.,Ever.,He buys a ring, she buys a dress.,They go shopping for all sorts of things.,She takes him to Arthur Murraynfor ballroom-dancing lessons.,And the big day comes.,And they'll stand before God and family,and some guy her dadnonce did business with,,and they'll vow that nothing --,not abject poverty,,not life-threatening illness,,not complete and utter misery --,will ever put the tiniest dampernon their eternal love and devotion. 
 (Laughter) 
 These optimistic young bastardsnpromise to honor and cherish each other,through hot flashes and midlife crises,and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain,,until that far-off day, when one of themnis finally able to rest in peace. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, because they can't hearnthe snoring anymore.,And then they'll get stupid drunk,and smash cake in each other's facesnand do the Macarena.,And we'll be there,,showering them with towels and toastersnand drinking their free booze,and throwing birdseed at themnevery single time ...,even though we know, statistically,,half of them will be divorcednwithin a decade. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, the other half won't, right?,They'll keep forgetting anniversaries,and arguing about where to spend holidays,and debating -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Which way the toilet papernshould come off of the roll.,And some of them will even stillnbe enjoying each other's company,when neither of them can chewnsolid food anymore. 
 And researchers want to know why.,I mean, look -- it doesn't takena double-blind, placebo-controlled study,to figure out what makesna marriage not work:,disrespect, boredom,,too much time on Facebook,,having sex with other people.,But you can have the exactnopposite of all of those things --,respect, excitement,,a broken Internet connection,,mind-numbing monogamy --,and the thing still can gonto hell in a handbasket.,So, what's going on when it doesn't?,What do the folks who make it all the waynto side-by-side burial plots,have in common?,What are they doing right?,What can we learn from them?,And if you're still happily sleeping solo,,why should you stop what you're doingnand make it your life's work,to find that one special person,that you can annoynfor the rest of your life? 
 Well, researchers spendnbillions of your tax dollars,trying to figure that out.,They stalk blissful couples,and study their every move and mannerism.,And they try to pinpointnwhat it is that sets them apart,from their miserablenneighbors and friends.,And it turns out, the success storiesnshare a few similarities,,beyond that they don't have sexnwith other people. 
 For instance, in the happiest marriages,,the wife is thinner and better-looking,than the husband. 
 (Laughter) 
 Obvious. Right?,It's obvious that this leadsnto marital bliss,,because women -- we care a great dealnabout being thin and good-looking,,whereas men mostly care about sex,,ideally, with women who are thinnernand better looking than they are.,The beauty of this research, though,,is that no one is suggestingnthat women have to be thin to be happy.,We just have to be thinnernthan our partners.,So instead of all that laboriousndieting and exercising,,we just need to waitnfor them to get fat -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Maybe bake a few pies.,This is good information to have,nand it's not that complicated. 
 (Laughter) 
 Research also suggests,that the happiest couples are the onesnthat focus on the positives.,For example: the happy wife.,Instead of pointing outnher husband's growing gut,or suggesting he go for a run,,she might say,,"Wow, honey, thank younfor going out of your way,to make me relatively thinner." 
 (Laughter) 
 These are couplesnwho can find good in any situation.,"Yeah, it was devastatingnwhen we lost everything in that fire.,But it's kind of nice sleepingnout here under the stars.,And it's a good thing you've gotnall that body fat to keep us warm." 
 (Laughter) 
 One of my favorite studies found,that the more willingna husband is to do housework,,the more attractivenhis wife will find him.,Because we needed a study to tell us this. 
 (Laughter) 
 But here's what's going on here.,The more attractive she finds him,nthe more sex they have;,the more sex they have,nthe nicer he is to her;,the nicer he is to her,,the less she nags himnabout leaving wet towels on the bed,,and ultimately,nthey live happily ever after.,In other words, men,nyou might want to pick it up a notch,in the domestic department. 
 Here's an interesting one.,One study found that peoplenwho smile in childhood photographs,are less likely to get a divorce.,This is an actual study,nand let me clarify:,the researchers were not lookingnat documented self-reports,of childhood happiness,,or even studying old journals.,The data were based entirelynon whether people looked happy,in these early pictures.,Now, I don't know how old all of you are,nbut when I was a kid,,your parents took picturesnwith a special kind of camera,that held something called "film.",And, by God, film was expensive.,They didn't take 300 shots of younin that rapid-fire digital video mode,and then pick out the nicest,nsmiliest one for the Christmas card.,Oh, no.,They dressed you up, they lined you up,,and you smiled for the fucking cameranlike they told you to,or you could kissnyour birthday party goodbye.,But still, I have a huge pilenof fake happy childhood pictures,and I'm glad they make me less likelynthan some people to get a divorce. 
 So, what else can you donto safeguard your marriage?,Do not win an Oscar for best actress. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm serious.,Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford,nHalle Berry, Hilary Swank,,Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon --,all of them single,nsoon after taking home that statue.,They actually call it the Oscar curse.,It is the marriage kiss of deathnand something that should be avoided. 
 And it's not just successfullynstarring in films that's dangerous.,It turns out, merely watchingna romantic comedy,causes relationshipnsatisfaction to plummet. 
 (Laughter) 
 Apparently, the bitter realizationnthat maybe it could happen to us,,but it obviously hasn'tnand it probably never will,,makes our lives seemnunbearably grim in comparison.,And theoretically,,I suppose if we opt for a filmnwhere someone gets brutally murdered,or dies in a fiery car crash,,we are more likely to walk outnof that theater,feeling like we've got it pretty good. 
 (Laughter) 
 Drinking alcohol, it seems,nis bad for your marriage.,Yeah.,I can't tell you anymore about that one,because I stopped reading itnat the headline.,But here's a scary one:ndivorce is contagious.,That's right, when you havena close couple friend split up,,it increases your chancesnof getting a divorce by 75 percent.,Now, I have to say,nI don't get this one at all.,My husband and I have watchednquite a few friends divide their assets,and then strugglenwith being our age and single,in an age of sextingnand Viagra and eHarmony.,And I'm thinking they've donenmore for my marriage,than a lifetime of therapy ever could. 
 So now you may be wondering:nWhy does anyone get married ever?,Well, the US federal governmentncounts more than a thousand legal benefits,to being someone's spouse.,A list that includesnvisitation rights in jail,,but hopefully, you'll never need that one.,But beyond the profound federal perks,,married people make more money.,We're healthier,nphysically and emotionally.,We produce happier, more stablenand more successful kids.,We have more sex than our supposedlynswinging single friends,,believe it or not.,We even live longer,,which is a pretty compelling argumentnfor marrying someone you like a lot,in the first place. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, if you're not currently experiencingnthe joy of the joint tax return,,I can't tell you how to findna chore-loving person,of the approximately ideal sizenand attractiveness,,who prefers horror movies,and doesn't have a lot of friendsnhovering on the brink of divorce,,but I can only encourage you to try,,because the benefits, as I've pointed out,,are significant.,The bottom line is: whether you're in itnor you're searching for it,,I believe marriage is an institutionnworth pursuing and protecting.,So I hope you'll use the informationnI've given you today,to weigh your personal strengthsnagainst your own risk factors. 
 For instance, in my marriage,nI'd say I'm doing OK.,One the one hand,,I have a husband who's annoyingly leannand incredibly handsome.,So I'm obviously goingnto need fatten him up.,And like I said, we haventhose divorced friends,who may secretly or subconsciouslynbe trying to break us up.,So we have to keep an eye on that.,And we do like a cocktail or two.,On the other hand,,I have the fake happy picture thing.,And also, my husband doesna lot around the house,,and would happily never seenanother romantic comedy,as long as he lives. 
 So I've got all those things going for me.,But just in case,,I plan to work extra hardnto not win an Oscar anytime soon.,And for the good of your relationships,,I would encourage you to do the same.,I'll see you at the bar. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today --,we think of financial and economic primarily --,the ones that concern me most,is the deficit of political dialogue --,our ability to address modern conflicts,as they are,,to go to the source of what they're all about,and to understand the key players,and to deal with them.,We who are diplomats,,we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.,And I can tell you, our agenda is full.,There is trade, there is disarmament,,there is cross-border relations. 
 But the picture is changing,,and we are seeing that there are new key players,coming onto the scene.,We loosely call them "groups.",They may represent social, religious,,political, economic, military realities.,And we struggle with how to deal with them.,The rules of engagement:,how to talk, when to talk,,and how to deal with them. 
 Let me show you a slide here,which illustrates the character of conflicts,since 1946 until today.,You see the green,is a traditional interstate conflict,,the ones we used to read about.,The red is modern conflict,,conflicts within states.,These are quite different,,and they are outside the grasp,of modern diplomacy.,And the core of these key actors,are groups,who represent different interests,inside countries.,And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries.,So in a way, it is everybody's business. 
 Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years,,recent years,,is that very few,of these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts,can be solved militarily.,They may have to be dealt with with military means,,but they cannot be solved by military means.,They need political solutions.,And we, therefore, have a problem,,because they escape traditional diplomacy.,And we have among states,a reluctance in dealing with them.,Plus, during the last decade,,we've been in the mode,where dealing with groups,was conceptually and politically dangerous.,After 9/11,,either you were with us or against us.,It was black or white.,And groups are very often,immediately label terrorists.,And who would talk to terrorists?,The West, as I would see it,,comes out of that decade weakened,,because we didn't understand the group.,So we've spent more time,on focusing on why we should not talk to others,than finding out how we talk to others. 
 Now I'm not naive.,You cannot talk to everybody all the time.,And there are times you should walk.,And sometimes military intervention is necessary.,I happen to believe that Libya was necessary,and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary.,And my country relies on its security,through military alliance, that's clear.,But still we have a large deficit,in dealing with and understanding modern conflict. 
 Let us turn to Afghanistan.,10 years after that military intervention,,that country is far from secure.,The situation, to be honest, is very serious.,Now again, the military is necessary,,but the military is no problem-solver.,When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister,,I met the commander of ISAF,,the international troops.,And he told me that, "This can be won militarily, minister.,We just have to persevere.",Now four COM ISAF's later,,we hear a different message:,"This cannot be won militarily.,We need military presence,,but we need to move to politics.,We can only solve this through a political solution.,And it is not us who will solve it;,Afghans have to solve it.",But then they need a different political process,than the one they were given in 2001, 2002.,They need an inclusive process,where the real fabric of this very complicated society,can deal with their issues. 
 Everybody seems to agree with that.,It was very controversial to say three, four, five years ago.,Now everybody agrees.,But now, as we prepare to talk,,we understand how little we know.,Because we didn't talk.,We didn't grasp what was going on.,The International Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC,,is talking to everyone,,and it is doing so because it is neutral.,And that's one reason why,that organization probably,is the best informed key player,to understand modern conflict --,because they talk. 
 My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk.,And you don't have to agree,when you sit down with the other side.,And you can always walk.,But if you don't talk,,you can't engage the other side.,And the other side which you're going to engage,is the one with whom you profoundly disagree.,Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process,,"You don't make peace with your friends,,you make peace with your enemies.",It's hard, but it is necessary. 
 Let me go one step further.,This is Tahrir Square.,There's a revolution going on.,The Arab Spring is heading into fall,and is moving into winter.,It will last for a long, long time.,And who knows what it will be called in the end.,That's not the point.,The point is that we are probably seeing,,for the first time in the history of the Arab world,,a revolution bottom-up --,people's revolution.,Social groups are taking to the streets.,And we find out in the West,that we know very little about what's happening.,Because we never talk to the people in these countries.,Most governments followed,the dictate of the authoritarian leaders,to stay away from these different groups,,because they were terrorists.,So now that they are emerging in the street,and we salute the democratic revolution,,we find out how little we know. 
 Right now, the discussion goes,,"Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood?,Should we talk to Hamas?,If we talk to them, we may legitimize them.",I think that is wrong.,If you talk in the right way, you make it very clear,that talking is not agreeing.,And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood,,as we should,,that they must respect minority rights,,if we don't accept majority rights?,Because they may turn out to be a majority.,How can we escape [having] a double-standard,,if we at the same time preach democracy,and at the same time,don't want to deal with the groups that are representative?,How will we ever be interlocutors?,Now my diplomats are instructed,to talk to all these groups.,But talking can be done in different ways.,We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level,and talking at the political level.,Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.,Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion. 
 There's a big array,of the ways of dealing with this.,So if we refuse,to talk to these new groups,that are going to be dominating the news in years to come,,we will further radicalization,,I believe.,We will make the road from violent activities into politics,harder to travel.,And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups,that if you move towards democracy,,if you move towards taking part,in civilized and normal standards among states,,there are some rewards on the other side.,The paradox here,is that the last decade probably was a lost decade,for making progress on this. 
 And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising --,and for one reason primarily.,And the reason is what happened in South Africa:,Nelson Mandela.,When Mandela came out of prison,after 27 years of captivity,,if he had told his people,,"It's time to take up the arms,,it's time to fight,",he would have been followed.,And I think the international community,would have said, "Fair enough.,It's their right to fight.",Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that.,In his memoirs, "Long Road to Freedom,",he wrote that he survived,during those years of captivity,because he always decided to look upon his oppressor,as also being a human being,,also being a human being.,So he engaged a political process of dialogue,,not as a strategy of the weak,,but as a strategy of the strong.,And he engaged talking profoundly,by settling some of the most tricky issues,through a truth and reconciliation process,where people came and talked.,Now South African friends will know,that was very painful. 
 So what can we learn from all of this?,Dialogue is not easy --,not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments --,but it is very necessary.,If we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts,,if we're going to understand these new groups,which are coming from bottom-up,,supported by technology, which is available to all,,we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets,believing that we are doing interstate relations.,We have to connect,with these profound changes. 
 And what is dialogue really about?,When I enter into dialogue,,I really hope that the other side,would pick up my points of view,,that I would impress upon them,my opinions and my values.,I cannot do that,unless I send the signals that I will be open,to listen to the other side's signals.,We need a lot more training on how to do that,and a lot more practice,on how that can take problem-solving forward.,We know from our personal experiences,that it's easy sometimes,just to walk,,and sometimes you may need to fight.,And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances.,Sometimes you have to.,But that strategy seldom takes you very far.,The alternative is a strategy,of engagement and principled dialogue.,And I believe we need to strengthen this approach,in modern diplomacy,,not only between states,,but also within states. 
 We are seeing some new signs.,We could never have done,the convention against anti-personnel landmines,and the convention that is banning cluster munitions,unless we had done diplomacy differently,,by engaging with civil society.,All of a sudden,,NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans,,but they were taking [them] into the negotiations,,partly because they represented the victims of these weapons.,And they brought their knowledge.,And there was an interaction,between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up.,This is perhaps a first element,of a change.,In the future, I believe,,we should draw examples from these different illustrations,,not to have diplomacy,which is disconnected from people and civil society. 
 And we have to go also,beyond traditional diplomacy,to the survival issue of our times,,climate change.,How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations,,unless we are able to make civil society and people,,not part of the problem, but part of the solution?,It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy,very different from the one we are practicing today,as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations,,but when we move toward something,which has to be much more,along a broad mobilization.,It's crucial to understand, I believe,,because of technology and because of globalization,,societies from bottom-up. 
 We as diplomats,need to know the social capital,of communities.,What is it that makes people trust each other,,not only between states,,but also within states?,What is the legitimacy of diplomacy,,of the the solution we devise as diplomats,if they cannot be reflected and understood,by also these broader forces of societies,that we now very loosely call groups? 
 The good thing is that we are not powerless.,We have never had,as many means of communication,,means of being connected, means of reaching out,,means of including.,The diplomatic toolbox,is actually full of different tools we can use,to strengthen our communication.,But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade,where we had a fear of touching it.,Now, I hope, in the coming years,,that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples,that fear is receding,and that we can take courage,from that alliance,with civil society,in different countries,to support their problem-solving,,among the Afghans,,inside the Palestinian population,,between the peoples of Palestine and Israel. 
 And as we try to understand this broad movement,across the Arab world,,we are not powerless.,We need to improve the necessary skills,,and we need the courage to use them.,In my country,,I have seen how the council of Islamist groups,and Christian groups,came together, not as a government initiative,,but they came together on their own initiative,to establish contact and dialogue,in times where things were pretty low-key tension.,And when tension increased,,they already had that dialogue,,and that was a strength to deal with different issues. 
 Our modern Western societies,are more complex than before,,in this time of migration.,How are we going to settle and build a bigger "We",to deal with our issues,if we don't improve our skills of communication?,So there are many reasons,,and for all of these reasons,,this is time and this is why we must talk. 
 Thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)So, people want a lot of things out of life,,but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.,Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end,towards which all other things aim.,According to this view, the reason we want a big house,or a nice car,or a good job,isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.,It's that we expect them to bring us,happiness. 
 Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten,a lot of the things that we want. We're richer.,We live longer. We have access to technology,that would have seemed like science fiction,just a few years ago.,The paradox of happiness is that even though the,objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically,,we haven't actually gotten any happier. 
 Maybe because these conventional notions of progress,haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness,,there's been an increased interest in recent years,in happiness itself.,People have been debating the causes of happiness,for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years,,but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.,Well, as with many other domains in life, I think,the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.,In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion,in research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot,about its demographics, how things like income,and education, gender and marriage relate to it.,But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that,factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.,Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less,,or to graduate from college instead of dropping out,,but the differences in happiness tend to be small. 
 Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?,I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,,but I think something that has the potential to be an answer,is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with,the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.,It certainly seems that we're going about our lives,,that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about,,have a big influence on our happiness, and yet,these are the very factors that have been very difficult,,in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study. 
 A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness,moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives,on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never,been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org,,it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.,How does this work? Basically, I send people signals,at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them,a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience,at the instant just before the signal.,The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness,goes up and down over the course of the day,,minute to minute in some cases,,and try to understand how what people are doing,,who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all,the other factors that describe our day, how those might,relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able,to discover some of the things that really have,a big influence on happiness.,We've been fortunate with this project to collect,quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think,has ever been collected before,,over 650,000 real-time reports,from over 15,000 people.,And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group,,people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s,,a wide range of incomes, education levels,,people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.,They collectively represent every one of,86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries. 
 What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today,is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been,investigating, and that's mind-wandering.,As human beings, we have this unique ability,to have our minds stray away from the present.,This guy is sitting here working on his computer,,and yet he could be thinking about,the vacation he had last month,,wondering what he's going to have for dinner.,Maybe he's worried that he's going bald. (Laughter),This ability to focus our attention on something other,than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn,and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.,And yet it's not clear what the relationship is,between our use of this ability and our happiness.,You've probably heard people suggest that you should,stay focused on the present. "Be here now,",you've probably heard a hundred times.,Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely,immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.,Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering,is a bad thing.,On the other hand, when our minds wander,,they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality,in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.,Since we know people want to be happy, maybe,when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place,that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.,In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind,allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering. 
 Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to,resolve this debate with some data, and in particular,I'd like to present some data to you from three questions,that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from,sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.,There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:,How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad,to very good? Second, an activity question:,What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities,including things like eating and working and watching TV?,And finally a mind-wandering question:,Are you thinking about something other,than what you're currently doing?,People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task --,or yes -- I am thinking about something else --,and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,,neutral or unpleasant.,Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering. 
 So what did we find?,This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,,and you can see that bar there representing how happy,people are when they're focused on the present,,when they're not mind-wandering.,As it turns out, people are substantially less happy,when their minds are wandering than when they're not.,Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure,,on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,,but surely when their minds are straying away,from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,,at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.,Nope. As it turns out,,people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,no matter what they're doing. For example,,people don't really like commuting to work very much.,It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet,they are substantially happier when they're focused,only on their commute than when their mind is going,off to something else.,It's amazing. 
 So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,,a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,,we often think about unpleasant things, and they are,enormously less happy when they do that,,our worries, our anxieties, our regrets,,and yet even when people are thinking about something,neutral, they're still considerably less happy,than when they're not mind-wandering at all.,Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,,they're actually just slightly less happy,than when they aren't mind-wandering.,If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like,having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars,or one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter) 
 So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,,that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all,I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.,It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case,that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.,Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever,disentangle these two possibilites?,Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact,you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not,backward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.,We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,,and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering,tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness,tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight,into the causal direction.,As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between,mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,,consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.,In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy,now and mind-wandering a short time later.,In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be,an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness. 
 A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering,to a slot machine you'd never want to play.,Well, how often do people's minds wander?,Turns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.,Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking,about something other than what they're currently doing.,How does that depend on what people are doing?,This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities,ranging from a high of 65 percent — (Laughter) —,when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth,,to 50 percent when they're working,,to 40 percent when they're exercising,,all the way down to this one short bar on the right,that I think some of you are probably laughing at.,Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering,when they're having sex. (Laughter),But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,,and that is, basically with one exception,,no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering,at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,,that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.,It pervades basically everything that we do. 
 In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,,a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important,in the equation for happiness.,My hope is that over time, by tracking people's,moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences,in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,,and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness,will help us create a future that's not only richer,and healthier, but happier as well.,Thank you. (Applause),(Applause)It's really, really great to be here.,You have the power to change the world.,I’m not saying that to be cliché,,you really have the powernto change the world.,Deep inside of you,nevery single one of you,has the most powerful device known to man.,And that's an idea. 
 So a single idea, from the human mind,,it could start a groundswell,,it could be a flash point for a movement,and it can actually rewrite our future. 
 But an idea is powerless,if it stays inside of you.,If you never pull that idea outnfor others to contend with,,it will die with you.,Now, maybe some of you guysnhave tried to convey your idea,and it wasn't adopted, it was rejected,,and some other mediocrenor average idea was adopted.,And the only difference between those twonis in the way it was communicated.,Because if you communicate an ideanin a way that resonates,,change will happen,nand you can change the world. 
 In my family, we collectnthese vintage European posters.,Every time we go to Maui,nwe go to the dealer there,,and he turns these great big posters.,I love them. They all have one idea,and one really clear visualnthat conveys the idea.,They are about the size of a mattress.nThey're really big.,They're not as thick as a mattress,nbut they're big.,And the guy will tell the storynas he turns the pages.,And this one timenI was flanked by my two kids,and he turns the pagenand this poster is underneath,,and right when I lean forward and say,,"Oh my God, I love this poster,",both of my kids jumped backnand they are like,,"Oh my God, mom, it's you.",And this is the poster. 
 (Laughter) 
 See, I'm like "Fire it up!" 
 The thing I lovednabout this poster was the irony.,Here's this chick all fired up,nheaded into battle --,as the standard bearer --,and she's holding thesenlittle Suavitos baking spices,,like something so seemingly insignificant,,though she's willing to risk, you know,nlife and limb to promote this thing. 
 So if you are to swap outnthose little Suavitos baking spices,with a presentation --,Yeah, it's me, pretty fired up.,I was fired up about presentations,back when it wasn't coolnto be fired up about presentations.,I really think they have the powernto change the world,when you communicateneffectively through them.,And changing the world is hard.,It won't happen with just one personnwith one single idea.,That idea has got to spread,nor it won't be effective.,So it has to come out of you,and out into the open for people to see.,And the way that ideas are conveyednthe most effectively is through story. 
 You know, for thousands of years,,illiterate generations would pass onntheir values and their culture,from generation to generation,,and they would stay intact.,So there's something kind of magicalnabout a story structure,that makes it so that when it's assembled,,it can be ingested and then recalled,by the person who's receiving it. 
 So basically a story,nyou get a physical reaction;,your heart can race, your eyes can dilate,,you could talk about,n"Oh, I got a chill down my spine",or, "I could feel itnin the pit of my stomach.",We actually physically reactnwhen someone is telling us a story.,So even though the stage is the same,na story can be told,,but once a presentation is told,nit completely flatlines.,And I wanted to figure out why. 
 Why is it that we physically sitnwith rapt attention during a story,,but it just dies for a presentation.,So I wanted to figure out, how do younincorporate story into presentations.,So we've had thousands of presentationsnback at the shop --,hundreds of thousandsnof presentations, actually,,so I knew the contextnof a really bad presentation.,I decided to study cinema and literature,,and really dig innand figure out what was going on,and why it was broken. 
 So, I want to show younsome of the findings,that led up to what I've uncoverednas a presentation form. 
 So it was obvious to start with Aristotle,,he had a three-act structure,na beginning, a middle and an end.,We studied poetics and rhetoric,,and a lot of presentations don't evennhave that in its most simple form.,And then when I moved onnto studying hero archetypes,,I thought, "OK, the presenter is the hero,,they're up on the stage,nthey're the star of the show.",It's easy to feel, as the presenter,nthat you're the star of the show.,I realized right away,nthat that's really broken.,Because I have an idea,nI can put it out there,,but if you guys don't grab that ideanand hold it as dear,,the idea goes nowherenand the world is never changed.,So in reality,nthe presenter isn't the hero,,the audience is the hero of our idea. 
 So if you look atnJoseph Campbell's hero's journey,,just in the front part, there werensome really interesting insights there.,So there is this likable heronin an ordinary world,,and they get this call to adventure.,So the world isnkind of brought out of balance.,And at first they're resistant.,They're like, "I don't knownif I want to jump into this,",and then a mentor comes along,and helps them movenfrom their ordinary world,into a special world.,And that's the role of the presenter.,It's to be the mentor.nYou're not Luke Skywalker, you're Yoda.,You're the onenthat actually helps the audience,move from one thingnand into your new special idea,,and that's the power of a story.,So in its most simple structure,nit's a three-part structure of a story.,You have a likable hero who has a desire,,they encounter a roadblock,and ultimately they emerge, transform,nand that's the basic structure. 
 But it wasn't until I came acrossna Gustav Freytag's pyramid --,he drew this shape in 1863.,Now, he was a German dramatist ...,he was a German dramatist,and he believednthere is a five-act structure,,which has an exposition, a rising action,,a climax, a falling actionnand a denouement,,which is the unravelingnor the resolution of the story.,I love this shape.nSo we talk about shapes.,A story has an arc --nwell, an arc is a shape.,We talk about classical musicnhaving a shapeliness to it.,So I thought, hey,nif presentations had a shape,,what would that shape be?,And how did the greatestncommunicators use that shape,,or do they use a shape? 
 So I'll never forget,nit was a Saturday morning.,After all this study --nit was a couple of years of study --,I drew a shape.,And I was like,n"Oh my gosh, if this shape is real,,I should be able to takentwo completely different presentations,and overlay it, and it should be true." 
 So I took the obvious,,I took Martin Luther King'sn"I Have a Dream" speech,,and I took Steve Jobs'n2007 iPhone launch speech,,I overlaid it over it, and it worked.,I sat in my office, just astounded.,I actually cried a little,,because I was like,n"I've been given this gift,",and here it is,,this is the shape of a great presentation.,Isn't it amazing? 
 (Laughter) 
 I was crying.,I want to walk you through it,nit's pretty astounding.,There is a beginning, a middle and an end,nand I want to walk you through it.,Because the greatest communicators --nI went through speeches, everything --,I can overlay the shape.,Even the Gettysburg Addressnfollows the shape. 
 At the beginning of any presentation,nyou need to establish what is.,You know, here's the status quo,nhere's what's going on.,And then you neednto compare that to what could be.,You need to make that gapnas big as possible,,because there is this commonplacenof the status quo,,and you need to contrast thatnwith the loftiness of your idea.,So it's like, you know,nhere's the past, here's the present,,but look at our future.,Here's a problem,nbut look at that problem removed.,Here's a roadblock,nlet's annihilate the roadblock.,You need to really amplify that gap.,This would be likenthe inciting incident in a movie.,That's when suddenlynthe audience has to contend,with what you just put out there:,"Wow, do I want to agreenwith this and align with it or not?",And in the rest of your presentationnshould support that. 
 So the middle goes back and forth,,it traverses betweennwhat is and what could be,,what is and what could be.,Because what you are trying to do,is make the status quonand the normal unappealing,,and you're wanting to draw them,towards what could benin the future with your idea adopted. 
 Now, on your way to change the world,npeople are going to resist.,They're not going to be excited,nthey may love the world the way it is.,So you'll encounter resistance.,That's why younhave to move back and forth.,It's similar to sailing.,When you're sailing against the windnand there is wind resistance,,you have to move your boat back and forth,nand back and forth.,That's so you can capture the wind.,You have to actuallyncapture the resistance,coming against you when you're sailing.,Now interesting,nif you capture the wind just right,and you set your sail just right,,your ship will actuallynsail faster than the wind itself.,It is a physics phenomenon.,So by planting in there,the way they're going to resistnbetween what is and what can be,,is actually going to drawnthem towards your idea,quicker than should you not do that. 
 So after you've moved back and forthnbetween what is and what could be,,the last turning pointnis a call to action,,which every presentation should have,nbut at the very end.,You need to describe the worldnas a new bliss.,"This is utopia with my idea adopted.","This is the waynthe world is going to look,,when we join togethernand we solve this big problem.",You need to use that as your ending,,in a very poetic and dramatic way.,So, interestingly, when I was done,,I was like, "You know what?nI could use this as an analysis tool." 
 I actually transcribe speeches,,and I would actually map out,nhow much they map to this tool.,So I want to show you some of that today,,and I want to startnwith the very two people,that I used when I first did. 
 Here's Mr. Jobs,nhas completely changed the world.,Changed the world of personal computing,nchanged the music industry,and now he's on his waynto change the mobile device industry.,So he's definitely changed the world.,And this is the shapenof his iPhone launch 2007,,when he launched his iPhone. 
 It's a 90-minute talknand you can see he starts with what is,,traverses back and forthnand ends with what could be.,So I want to zoom in on this:,the white linenis him speaking, he's talking.,The next color linenyou'll see popped up there,,that's when he cuts to video.,So he's adding some varietynand he cuts to demo.,So it's not just himntalking the whole time.,And these lines are representative there.,And then towards the endnyou'll see a blue line,,which will be the guest speaker. 
 So this is where it getsnkind of interesting:,every tick mark herenis when he made them laugh.,And every tick mark herenis when he made them clap.,They are so involved physically,,they are physically reactingnto what he is saying,,which is actually fantastic,,because then you knownyou have the audience in your hand.,So he kicks off what could be with,,"This is a day I've been lookingnforward to for two and a half years.",So he is launching a product,that he's known about alreadynfor a couple of years.,So this is not a new product to him. 
 But look at this,,he does this other thing: he marvels.,He marvels at his own product.,He marvels himselfnmore than the audience laughs or claps.,So he is like, "Isn't this awesome?nIsn't this beautiful?",He is modeling for the audiencenwhat he wants them to feel.,So he is actually doing a jobnof compelling them to feel a certain way.,So he kicks off with what could be with,n"Every once in a while,,a revolutionary product comes alongnthat changes everything.",So he starts to kick innand talk about his new product. 
 Now, at the beginning of it,nhe actually keeps the phone off.,You'll see that the linenis pretty white up until this point,,so he goes off between,,"Here's this new phone,nand here's the sucky competitors.,Here's this new phone,nand here's the sucky competitors.",And then, right about here,nhe has the star moment --,and that something we'll always remember.,He turns the phone on.,The audience sees scrollingnfor the first time,,you can hear the oxygennsucked out of the room.,They gasped. You can actually hear it.,So he creates a momentnthat they'll always remember. 
 So if we move along this model,nyou can see the blue,,where the external speakers are going,,and towards the bottom right,nthe line breaks.,That's because his clicker broke.,He wants to keepnthis heightened sense of excitement.,He tells a personal story,,right there, wherenthe technology didn't work.,So he's the master communicator,,and he turns to storynto keep the audience involved. 
 So the top rightnhe ends with the new bliss.,He leaves them with the promise,that Apple will continuento build revolutionary new products.,And he says,,"There's an old Wayne Gretzkynquote that I love:,'I skate to where the puck is going to be,nnot to where it has been.',We've always tried to do thatnat Apple since the very beginning,and we always will.",So he ends with the new bliss. 
 So let's look at Mr. King.,He was an amazing visionary, a clergyman,who spent his lifenworking hard for equality.,And this is the shapenof the "I Have a Dream" speech. 
 You can see he starts with what is,,moves back and forthnbetween what is and what could be,,and ends with a very poetic new bliss,nwhich is the famous part we all know.,So I'm going to spread it outna little bit here,,stretch it for you,,and what I'm doing here isnI put the actual transcript there,along with the text.,I know you can't read it.,But at the end of every line break,nI broke the line,,because he took a breath and he paused. 
 Now he was a Southern Baptist preacher,nmost people hadn't heard that,,so he had a real cadence and a rhythmnthat was really new for people there.,So I want to cover upnthese lines of text with a bar,because I want to use this barnas an information device here. 
 So let's walk throughnhow he actually spoke to the people.,The blue bars herenare going to be when he used,the actual rhetorical devicenof repetition.,So he was repeating himself,,he was using the same words and phrases,,so people could remember and recall them.,But then he also usedna lot of metaphors and visual words.,This was a way to takenreally complicated ideas,and make them memorablenand knowledgeable, so people got it.,He actually created very --,almost like scenesnwith his words to make it,so they could envision what he was saying. 
 And then there were also a lot of familiarnsongs and scriptures that he used.,This is just the front end of itnthat you're seeing.,And then he also madena lot of political references,of the promisesnthat were made to the people. 
 So if we look atnthe very first end of what is,,at the very end of what isnwas the very first time,that people actually clappednand roared really loud.,So the end of what isnwhat he did is he said,,"America has givennthe Negro people a bad check,,a check which has come backnmarked insufficient funds.",Well, everyone knows what it's likento not have money in your account.,So he used the metaphornpeople were very familiar with.,But when they really charged up,,the very first timenthey really screamed was:,"So we have come to cash this check,,a check that will give us upon demand,the riches of freedomnand the security of justice.",That's when they really clapped.,It was when he comparednwhat currently is to what could be. 
 So when we move alongna little farther in the model,,you'll see it goes back and forthnat a more frenzied pace.,And this is when he goesnback and forth, and back and forth.,Now the audience was in a frenzy.,They were all excited,nand so you can actually do this,to keep them in a heightenednsense of excitement.,So he says, "I have a dream,that one day this nation will rise upnand live out the meaning of its creed.,'We hold these truths to be self-evident,nthat all men are created equal.'",So he uses the little orange text therento remind them of the promise,that the politicians had made to himnor that this country had made.,Then he moves back and forth between,"I have a dream that one day,nI have a dream that one day,,I have a dream that one day,",and at the end,nit gets really interesting.,Because he uses --nyou can look at the four shades of green,,there's a lot of blue there,nwhich was a lot of repetition --,he had a heightened sense of repetition. 
 And the green was a heightened sensenof songs and scriptures.,So the first batch of green,was the actual scripturenfrom the Book of Isaiah.,The second batch of greennwas "My Country, 'Tis of Thee.",Now, that's a familiar songnthat was specifically very significant,for the black people at the time,,because this song was the song theynchose to change the words to as an outcry,,saying that promises had not been kept.,So the third batch of green was actuallyna stanza from "My Country, 'Tis of Thee.",And then the fourth was a Negro spiritual.,"Free at last! Free at last!nThank God Almighty, I'm free at last!" 
 So what he did is he actually reachedninside of the hearts of the audience.,He pulled from scriptures,nwhich is important.,He pulled from songsnthat they'd sung together,as an outcry against this outrage,,and he used those as a devicento connect and resonate with the audience.,Ending -- painting a picturenof this new bliss,,using the very things inside of themnthat they already held as sacred. 
 So he was a great man.nHe had a big, big dream.,There's a lot of people here,nyou guys have really big dreams.,You have really big ideas inside of you,that you need to get out.,But you know what? We encounter hardships.,It's not easy to change the world;,it's a big job.,You know he was --,his house was bombed,nhe was stabbed with a letter opener,,ultimately, he lost his life,,you know, for what he cared about.,But a lot of us aren't going tonbe required to pay that kind of sacrifice.,But what happens is,that it basically is a little bitnlike that basic story structure.,Life can be like that. 
 You know, you guys are all likable people,,you have a desire,nyou encounter roadblocks,,and we stop there.,We're just like, you know,n"I had this idea,,but I'm not going to put it out there.,It's been rejected.",You know, we self-sabotage our own ideas,,we just butt up against the roadblocksnand butt up against the roadblocks,instead of choosingnto let the struggle transform us,and choosing to go aheadnand have a dream and make it real.,And you know, if anyone --nif I can do this, anybody can do this. 
 I was raised in an economicallynand emotionally starved environment.,First time I got to go to a campnwith my sister, I was abused.,Wasn't the first time I was abused,nit was just the most aggressive.,And my mom and dad --nthey married each other three times, 
 (Audience murmurs) 
 Yeah, that was tumultuous,nand when they weren't fighting,they were helping sober upnsome alcoholic that was living with us,because they were both sober alcoholics.,So my mom abandoned usnwhen I was sixteen years old.,And I took on a role of caretakernof my home and of my siblings.,And I married. I met a man.,Fell in love. I went to a year of college.,I did what every single,nbright, young girl should do --,I got married whennI was eighteen years old. 
 And you know what?,I knew, I knew,that I was born for more than this.,And right at the pointnin the story of my life I had a choice.,I could let all these things push me down,and I could let all my ideasndie inside of me.,I could just say, you know,nlife is too hard to change the world.,It's just too tough.,But I chose a different story for my life. 
 (Laughter) 
 Don't you know it?,And so I feel likenthere's people in this room --,you got those littlenSuavitos baking spices,and you're just like,n"You know, It's not that big a deal.","It's really notnthe whole world I can change.",But you know, you can change your world.,You can change your life.,You can change the worldnthat you have control over,,you can change your sphere.,I want to encourage you to do that.,Because you know what?,The future isn't a placenthat we're going to go.,It's a place that you get to create. 
 I want to thank you.nBless you. God bless you. 
 (Applause)When we park in a big parking lot,,how do we remember where we parked our car?,Here's the problem facing Homer.,And we're going to try to understand,what's happening in his brain. 
 So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,,which is the organ of memory.,If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,,you can't remember things including where you parked your car.,It's named after Latin for "seahorse,",which it resembles.,And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons. 
 So the human brain,has about a hundred billion neurons in it.,And the neurons communicate with each other,by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity,via connections to each other.,The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,,which are very densely interconnected.,And scientists have begun to understand,how spatial memory works,by recording from individual neurons,in rats or mice,while they forage or explore an environment,looking for food. 
 So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron,in the hippocampus of this rat here.,And when it fires a little spike of electricity,,there's going to be a red dot and a click.,So what we see,is that this neuron knows,whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.,And it signals to the rest of the brain,by sending a little electrical spike.,So we could show the firing rate of that neuron,as a function of the animal's location.,And if we record from lots of different neurons,,we'll see that different neurons fire,when the animal goes in different parts of its environment,,like in this square box shown here.,So together they form a map,for the rest of the brain,,telling the brain continually,,"Where am I now within my environment?" 
 Place cells are also being recorded in humans.,So epilepsy patients sometimes need,the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.,And some of these patients played a video game,where they drive around a small town.,And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,,start sending electrical impulses,whenever they drove through a particular location in that town. 
 So how does a place cell know,where the rat or person is within its environment?,Well these two cells here,show us that the boundaries of the environment,are particularly important.,So the one on the top,likes to fire sort of midway between the walls,of the box that their rat's in.,And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.,The one below likes to fire,whenever there's a wall close by to the south.,And if you put another wall inside the box,,then the cell fires in both place,wherever there's a wall to the south,as the animal explores around in its box.,So this predicts,that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you --,extended buildings and so on --,is particularly important for the hippocampus.,And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,,cells are found which project into the hippocampus,,which do respond exactly,to detecting boundaries or edges,at particular distances and directions,from the rat or mouse,as it's exploring around. 
 So the cell on the left, you can see,,it fires whenever the animal gets near,to a wall or a boundary to the east,,whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box,or the circular wall of the circular box,or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.,And the cell on the right there,fires whenever there's a boundary to the south,,whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall,or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.,So that's one way in which we think,place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around. 
 We can also test where we think objects are,,like this goal flag, in simple environments --,or indeed, where your car would be.,So we can have people explore an environment,and see the location they have to remember.,And then, if we put them back in the environment,,generally they're quite good at putting a marker down,where they thought that flag or their car was.,But on some trials,,we could change the shape and size of the environment,like we did with the place cell. 
 In that case, we can see,how where they think the flag had been changes,as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.,And what you see, for example,,if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,,and then if you ask people where it was,,but you've made the environment bigger,,where they think the flag had been,stretches out in exactly the same way,that the place cell firing stretched out.,It's as if you remember where the flag was,by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells,at that location,,and then you can get back to that location,by moving around,so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells,with that stored pattern.,That guides you back to the location that you want to remember. 
 But we also know where we are through movement.,So if we take some outbound path --,perhaps we park and we wander off --,we know because our own movements,,which we can integrate over this path,roughly what the heading direction is to go back.,And place cells also get this kind of path integration input,from a kind of cell called a grid cell. 
 Now grid cells are found, again,,on the inputs to the hippocampus,,and they're a bit like place cells.,But now as the rat explores around,,each individual cell fires,in a whole array of different locations,which are laid out across the environment,in an amazingly regular triangular grid.,And if you record from several grid cells --,shown here in different colors --,each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,,and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly,relative to the other cells.,So the red one fires on this grid,and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one. 
 So together, it's as if the rat,can put a virtual grid of firing locations,across its environment --,a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,,but using triangles.,And as it moves around,,the electrical activity can pass,from one of these cells to the next cell,to keep track of where it is,,so that it can use its own movements,to know where it is in its environment. 
 Do people have grid cells?,Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns,have the same axes of symmetry,,the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,,it means that the net activity,of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain,should change,according to whether we're running along these six directions,or running along one of the six directions in between.,So we can put people in an MRI scanner,and have them do a little video game,like the one I showed you,and look for this signal.,And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,,which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats. 
 So back to Homer.,He's probably remembering where his car was,in terms of the distances and directions,to extended buildings and boundaries,around the location where he parked.,And that would be represented,by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.,He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,,which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.,Now both of these kinds of cells,can make the place cells fire.,And he can return to the location where he parked,by moving so as to find where it is,that best matches the firing pattern,of the place cells in his brain currently,with the stored pattern where he parked his car.,And that guides him back to that location,irrespective of visual cues,like whether his car's actually there.,Maybe it's been towed.,But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it. 
 So beyond spatial memory,,if we look for this grid-like firing pattern,throughout the whole brain,,we see it in a whole series of locations,which are always active,when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,,like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.,So it may be that the neural mechanisms,for representing the space around us,are also used for generating visual imagery,so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,,of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them. 
 So if this was happening,,your memories could start by place cells activating each other,via these dense interconnections,and then reactivating boundary cells,to create the spatial structure,of the scene around your viewpoint.,And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.,Another kind of cell, head direction cells,,which I didn't mention yet,,they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.,They could define the viewing direction,from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,,so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example. 
 So this is just one example,of a new era really,in cognitive neuroscience,where we're beginning to understand,psychological processes,like how you remember or imagine or even think,in terms of the actions,of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I want to discuss with you this afternoon,why you're going to failnto have a great career. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm an economist. 
 I do dismal.,End of the day, it's readynfor dismal remarks.,I only want to talk to those of younwho want a great career.,I know some of you have already decidednyou want a good career.,You're going to fail, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because -- goodness,nyou're all cheery about failing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Canadian group, undoubtedly. 
 (Laughter) 
 Those trying to have good careersnare going to fail,,because, really, good jobsnare now disappearing.,There are great jobs and great careers,,and then there are the high-workload,,high-stress, bloodsucking,nsoul-destroying kinds of jobs,,and practically nothing in-between. 
 So people looking for good jobsnare going to fail.,I want to talk about thosenlooking for great jobs, great careers,,and why you're going to fail.,First reason is that no matternhow many times people tell you,,"If you want a great career,nyou have to pursue your passion,,you have to pursue your dreams,nyou have to pursue,the greatest fascination in your life,",you hear it again and again,nand then you decide not to do it.,It doesn't matternhow many times you download,Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address,,you still look at itnand decide not to do it. 
 I'm not quite surenwhy you decide not to do it.,You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.,You're afraid if you looknfor your passion and don't find it,,you'll feel like you're an idiot,nso then you make excuses,about why you're not goingnto look for your passion.,They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.,We're going to go throughna whole long list --,your creativity in thinking of excusesnnot to do what you really need to do,if you want to have a great career. 
 So, for example,none of your great excuses is: 
 (Sigh) 
 "Well, great careers arenreally and truly, for most people,,just a matter of luck.,So I'm going to stand around,nI'm going to try to be lucky,,and if I'm lucky,nI'll have a great career.,If not, I'll have a good career.",But a good career is an impossibility,nso that's not going to work. 
 Then, your other excuse is,,"Yes, there are special peoplenwho pursue their passions,,but they are geniuses.,They are Steven J.,I'm not a genius.,When I was five, I thought I was a genius,,but my professors have beaten that ideanout of my head long since." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And now I knownI am completely competent.",Now, you see, if this was 1950,,being completely competent --,that would have given you a great career.,But guess what?,This is almost 2012,nand saying to the world,,"I am totally, completely competent,",is damning yourselfnwith the faintest of praise. 
 And then, of course, another excuse:,"Well, I would do this,nI would do this, but, but --,well, after all, I'm not weird.,Everybody knows that peoplenwho pursue their passions,are somewhat obsessive.,A little strange.,Hmm? Hmm? Okay?,You know, a fine linenbetween madness and genius.,"I'm not weird. I've readnSteven J.'s biography.,Oh my goodness --nI'm not that person. I am nice.,I am normal.,I'm a nice, normal person,nand nice, normal people --,don't have passion." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Ah, but I still want a great career.,I'm not prepared to pursue my passion,,so I know what I'm going to do,,because I have a solution.,I have a strategy.,It's the one Mommynand Daddy told me about.,Mommy and Daddy told menthat if I worked hard,,I'd have a good career.,So, if you work hardnand have a good career,,if you work really, really, really hard,,you'll have a great career.,Doesn't that, like,nmathematically make sense?",Hmm. Not.,But you've managednto talk yourself into that. 
 You know what? Here's a little secret:,You want to work? You want to worknreally, really, really hard?,You know what? You'll succeed.,The world will give you the opportunity,to work really, really,nreally, really hard.,But, are you so sure,that that's going to give youna great career,,when all the evidence is to the contrary? 
 So let's deal with those of younwho are trying to find your passion.,You actually understandnthat you really had better do it,,never mind the excuses.,You're trying to find your passion -- 
 (Sigh) 
 and you're so happy.,You found something you're interested in. 
 "I have an interest! I have an interest!" 
 You tell me.,You say, "I have an interest!"nI say, "That's wonderful!,And what are you trying to tell me?","Well, I have an interest.",I say, "Do you have passion?","I have an interest," you say.,"Your interest is compared to what?","Well, I'm interested in this.","And what about the restnof humanity's activities?","I'm not interested in them.","You've looked at them all, have you?","No. Not exactly." 
 Passion is your greatest love.,Passion is the thing,that will help you createnthe highest expression of your talent.,Passion, interest --nit's not the same thing.,Are you really going to gonto your sweetie and say,,"Marry me! You're interesting." 
 (Laughter) 
 Won't happen.,Won't happen, and you will die alone. 
 (Laughter) 
 What you want,,what you want, what you want,,is passion.,It is beyond interest.,You need 20 interests,nand then one of them,,one of them might grab you,,one of them might engage younmore than anything else,,and then you may have foundnyour greatest love,,in comparison to all the other thingsnthat interest you,,and that's what passion is. 
 I have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.,He was an economically rational person.,He said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.,Let us merge our interests." 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, he did. 
 "I love you truly," he said.n"I love you deeply.,I love you more than any other womannI've ever encountered.,I love you more than Mary,nJane, Susie, Penelope,,Ingrid, Gertrude, Gretel --,I was on a German exchange program then.,I love you more than --",All right.,She left the room,halfway through his enumerationnof his love for her.,After he got over his surprisenat being, you know, turned down,,he concluded he'd had a narrow escape,from marrying an irrational person.,Although, he did make a note to himselfnthat the next time he proposed,,it was perhaps not necessary,to enumerate all of the womennhe had auditioned for the part. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the point stands.,You must look for alternativesnso that you find your destiny,,or are you afraid of the word "destiny"?,Does the word "destiny" scare you?,That's what we're talking about.,And if you don't findnthe highest expression of your talent,,if you settle for "interesting,"nwhat the hell ever that means,,do you know what will happennat the end of your long life?,Your friends and family will bengathered in the cemetery,,and there beside your gravesitenwill be a tombstone,,and inscribed on that tombstone,it will say, "Here liesna distinguished engineer,,who invented Velcro.",But what that tombstone should have said,,in an alternative lifetime,,what it should have said if it wasnyour highest expression of talent,,was, "Here lies the lastnNobel Laureate in Physics,,who formulatednthe Grand Unified Field Theory,and demonstratednthe practicality of warp drive." 
 (Laughter) 
 Velcro, indeed! 
 (Laughter) 
 One was a great career.,One was a missed opportunity.,But then, there are some of you who,,in spite of all thesenexcuses, you will find,,you will find your passion.,And you'll still fail. 
 You're going to fail, because --,because you're not going to do it,,because you will haveninvented a new excuse,,any excuse to fail to take action,,and this excuse, I've heard so many times:,"Yes, I would pursue a great career,,but, I value human relationships -- 
 (Laughter) 
 more than accomplishment.,I want to be a great friend.,I want to be a great spouse.,I want to be a great parent,,and I will not sacrifice them,on the altar of great accomplishment." 
 (Laughter) 
 What do you want me to say?,Now, do you really wantnme to say now, tell you,,"Really, I swear I don't kick children." 
 (Laughter) 
 Look at the worldviewnyou've given yourself.,You're a hero no matter what.,And I, by suggesting ever so delicately,that you might want a great career,nmust hate children.,I don't hate children. I don't kick them.,Yes, there was a little kidnwandering through this building,when I came here, and no,nI didn't kick him. 
 (Laughter) 
 Course, I had to tell himnthe building was for adults only,,and to get out.,He mumbled something about his mother,,and I told him she'd probablynfind him outside anyway.,Last time I saw him,nhe was on the stairs crying. 
 (Laughter) 
 What a wimp. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what do you mean?nThat's what you expect me to say.,Do you really think it's appropriate,that you should actually takenchildren and use them as a shield?,You know what will happen someday,,you ideal parent, you?,The kid will come to you someday and say,,"I know what I want to be.,I know what I'm going to do with my life.",You are so happy.,It's the conversationna parent wants to hear,,because your kid's good in math,,and you know you're going to likenwhat comes next.,Says your kid,,"I have decided I want to be a magician.,I want to performnmagic tricks on the stage." 
 (Laughter) 
 And what do you say?,You say, you say,,"That's risky, kid.,Might fail, kid. Don't makena lot of money at that, kid.,I don't know, kid, you shouldnthink about that again, kid.,You're so good at math, why don't you --" 
 The kid interrupts you and says,,"But it is my dream.nIt is my dream to do this.",And what are you going to say?,You know what you're going to say?,"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but --,But --",So how are you going to finishnthe sentence with your "but"?,"But. I had a dream too, once,nkid, but I was afraid to pursue it.",Or are you going to tell him this:,"I had a dream once, kid.,But then, you were born." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Do you really want to use your family,,do you really ever want to looknat your spouse and your kid,,and see your jailers?,There was somethingnyou could have said to your kid,,when he or she said, "I have a dream.",You could have said --,looked the kid in the face and said,,"Go for it, kid!,Just like I did.",But you won't be able to say that,,because you didn't.,So you can't. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so the sins of the parents,are visited on the poor children.,Why will you seek refugenin human relationships,as your excuse not to findnand pursue your passion?,You know why.,In your heart of hearts, you know why,,and I'm being deadly serious.,You know why you would getnall warm and fuzzy,and wrap yourselfnup in human relationships.,It is because you are --,you know what you are. 
 You're afraid to pursue your passion.,You're afraid to look ridiculous.,You're afraid to try.,You're afraid you may fail.,Great friend, great spouse,ngreat parent, great career.,Is that not a package?nIs that not who you are?,How can you be one without the other?,But you're afraid. 
 And that's why you're notngoing to have a great career.,Unless --,"unless," that most evocativenof all English words --,"unless.",But the "unless" word is also attached,to that other, most terrifying phrase,,"If only I had ...","If only I had ...",If you ever have that thoughtnricocheting in your brain,,it will hurt a lot. 
 So, those are the many reasons,why you are going to fail,to have a great career.,Unless -- 
 Unless. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Look, I had second thoughts, really,,about whether I could talk about this,to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.,Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,,which goes,,"The truth will set you free,,but first it will piss you off." (Laughter),So -- (Laughter) 
 So with that in mind, I'm going to set about,trying to do those things here,,and talk about dying in the 21st century.,Now the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,,is that all of us are, in fact, going to die,in the 21st century.,There will be no exceptions to that.,There are, apparently, about one in eight of you,who think you're immortal, on surveys, but --,(Laughter),Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen. 
 While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,,a hundred million of my cells will die,,and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells,will die and never come back,,so you could argue that the dying process,starts pretty early in the piece. 
 Anyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the,21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,,is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck,for most of us,,unless we do something to try and reclaim this process,from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on. 
 So there you go. That's the truth.,No doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see,whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.,Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,,and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday,of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.,This has been fantastic.,We have machines that go ping.,There's many of them up there.,And we have some wizard technology which I think,has worked really well, and over the course of the time,I've worked in intensive care, the death rate,for males in Australia has halved,,and intensive care has had something to do with that.,Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use,have got something to do with that. 
 So we have had tremendous success, and we kind of,got caught up in our own success quite a bit,,and we started using expressions like "lifesaving.",I really apologize to everybody for doing that,,because obviously, we don't.,What we do is prolong people's lives,,and delay death,,and redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,,save lives on any sort of permanent basis. 
 And what's really happened over the period of time,that I've been working in intensive care is that,the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,,'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century,of diseases that we no longer have the answers to,in quite the way we did then. 
 So what's happening now is there's been a big shift,in the way that people die,,and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable,to what we can do as what it used to be like,when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s. 
 So we kind of got a bit caught up with this,,and we haven't really squared with you guys about,what's really happening now, and it's about time we did.,I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s,when I met this guy.,This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.,I was called down to the ward to see him.,His is the little hand.,I was called down to the ward to see him,by a respiratory physician.,He said, "Look, there's a guy down here.,He's got pneumonia,,and he looks like he needs intensive care.,His daughter's here and she wants everything possible,to be done.",Which is a familiar phrase to us.,So I go down to the ward and see Jim,,and his skin his translucent like this.,You can see his bones through the skin.,He's very, very thin,,and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,,and he's too sick to talk to me,,so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,,"Did you and Jim ever talk about,what you would want done,if he ended up in this kind of situation?",And she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!",I thought, "Okay. Take this steady.",And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,,"You know, we always thought there'd be time." 
 Jim was 94. (Laughter),And I realized that something wasn't happening here.,There wasn't this dialogue going on,that I imagined was happening.,So a group of us started doing survey work,,and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home,residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,,and discovered that only one in a hundred of them,had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.,One in a hundred.,And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do,if they became seriously ill.,And I realized, of course, this dialogue,is definitely not occurring in the public at large. 
 Now, I work in acute care.,This is John Hunter Hospital.,And I thought, surely, we do better than that.,So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I,went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes,in the medical records department,looking at whether there was any sign at all,that anybody had had any conversation about,what might happen to them if the treatment they were,receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.,And we didn't find a single record of any preference,about goals, treatments or outcomes from any,of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient. 
 So we started to realize,that we had a problem,,and the problem is more serious because of this. 
 What we know is that obviously we are all going to die,,but how we die is actually really important,,obviously not just to us, but also to how that,features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.,How we die lives on in the minds of everybody,who survives us, and,the stress created in families by dying is enormous,,and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying,in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,,so dying in intensive care is not your top option,if you've got a choice. 
 And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,,all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that,many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,,will die in intensive care.,In the U.S., it's one in five.,In Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.,So this is the sort of momentum,that we've got at the moment. 
 The reason why this is all happening is due to this,,and I do have to take you through what this is about.,These are the four ways to go.,So one of these will happen to all of us.,The ones you may know most about are the ones,that are becoming increasingly of historical interest:,sudden death.,It's quite likely in an audience this size,this won't happen to anybody here.,Sudden death has become very rare.,The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff,just doesn't happen anymore.,The dying process of those with terminal illness,that we've just seen,occurs to younger people.,By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.,Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer. 
 The big growth industry are these.,What you die of is increasing organ failure,,with your respiratory, cardiac, renal,,whatever organs packing up. Each of these,would be an admission to an acute care hospital,,at the end of which, or at some point during which,,somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop. 
 And this one's the biggest growth industry of all,,and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room,will die in this form, which is,the dwindling of capacity,with increasing frailty,,and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,,and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing,that people die of now,,and the last few years, or the last year of your life,is spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately. 
 Enjoying it so far? (Laughs),(Laughter),Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.,(Laughter) 
 What can I say that's positive? What's positive is,that this is happening at very great age, now.,We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.,You know, historically, we didn't do that.,This is what happens to you,when you live to be a great age,,and unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean,more old age, not more youth.,I'm sorry to say that. (Laughter),What we did, anyway, look, what we did,,we didn't just take this lying down,at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.,We've started a whole series of projects,to try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve,people much more in the way that things happen to them.,But we realized, of course, that we are dealing,with cultural issues,,and this is, I love this Klimt painting,,because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get,the whole issue that's going on here,,which is clearly the separation of death from the living,,and the fear — Like, if you actually look,,there's one woman there,who has her eyes open.,She's the one he's looking at,,and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?,She looks terrified.,It's an amazing picture. 
 Anyway, we had a major cultural issue.,Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,,or, we thought that.,So with loads of funding from the Federal Government,and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing,at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.,We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards,and talk to people about the fact that they would die,,and what would they prefer under those circumstances.,They loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.,Ninety-eight percent of people really thought,this just should have been normal practice,,and that this is how things should work.,And when they expressed wishes,,all of those wishes came true, as it were.,We were able to make that happen for them.,But then, when the funding ran out,,we went back to look six months later,,and everybody had stopped again,,and nobody was having these conversations anymore.,So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,,because we thought this was going to really take off.,The cultural issue had reasserted itself. 
 So here's the pitch:,I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway,to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not,that's where we all want to end up,,particularly as we become older and increasingly frail,and ICU has less and less and less to offer us.,There has to be a little side road,off there for people who don't want to go on that track.,And I have one small idea,,and one big idea about what could happen. 
 And this is the small idea.,The small idea is, let's all of us,engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.,Why can't we have these kinds of conversations,with our own elders,and people who might be approaching this?,There are a couple of things you can do.,One of them is, you can,,just ask this simple question. This question never fails.,"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,,who would you like to speak for you?",That's a really important question to ask people,,because giving people the control over who that is,produces an amazing outcome.,The second thing you can say is,,"Have you spoken to that person,about the things that are important to you,so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?",So that's the little idea. 
 The big idea, I think, is more political.,I think we have to get onto this.,I suggested we should have Occupy Death.,(Laughter),My wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.,Yeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter),So that one didn't really run,,but I was very struck by this.,Now, I'm an aging hippie.,I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but,I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s,when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers,are used to taking charge of the situation,,so if you just replace all these words of birth,,I like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option.,I do think we have to get political,and start to reclaim this process from,the medicalized model in which it's going. 
 Now, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.,I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,,I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.,I don't think euthanasia matters.,I actually think that,,in places like Oregon,,where you can have physician-assisted suicide,,you take a poisonous dose of stuff,,only half a percent of people ever do that.,I'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent,of people who don't want to do that.,I think most people don't want to be dead,,but I do think most people want to have some control,over how their dying process proceeds.,So I'm an opponent of euthanasia,,but I do think we have to give people back some control.,It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.,I think we should be looking at stopping,the want for euthanasia,,not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all. 
 This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,,whom I met when I was a medical student.,She founded the hospice movement.,And she said, "You matter because you are,,and you matter to the last moment of your life.",And I firmly believe that,that's the message that we have to carry forward.,Thank you. (Applause)I think the beautiful Malin [Akerman] put it perfectly.,Every man deserves the opportunity,to grow a little bit of luxury. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, and more importantly,,Mo Bros and Mo Sistas — (Laughter) —,for the next 17 minutes, I'm going to share with you,my Movember journey, and how, through that journey,,we've redefined charity, we're redefining the way,prostate cancer researchers are working together,throughout the world, and I hope, through that process,,that I inspire you to create something significant,in your life, something significant that will go on,and make this world a better place. 
 So the most common question I get asked,,and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it,over drinks tonight, is how did this come about?,How did Movember start?,Well, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone,that is directly affected by a cause.,They then go on to create an event, and beyond that,,a foundation to support that.,Pretty much in every case, that's how a charity starts.,Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very,traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon.,I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers,,and I was watching the world go by,,had a few more beers, and the conversation turned,to '70s fashion — (Laughter) —,and how everything manages to come back into style.,And a few more beers, I said, "There has to be some stuff,that hasn't come back." (Laughter),Then one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache?,Why hasn't that made a comeback? (Laughter),So then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended,with a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter) 
 So in Australia, "mo" is slang for mustache,,so we renamed the month of November "Movember",and created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today.,And they are: start the month clean-shaven,,rock a mustache -- not a beard, not a goatee, a mustache --,for the 30 days of November, and then we agreed,that we would come together at the end of the month,,have a mustache-themed party, and award a prize,for the best, and of course, the worst mustache. (Laughter) 
 Now trust me, when you're growing a mustache,back in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then,,and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement,— (Laughter) —,it created a lot of controversy. (Laughter),So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients.,My girlfriend at the time, who's no longer my girlfriend — (Laughter) — hated it.,Parents would shuffle kids away from us. (Laughter),But we came together at the end of the month and,we celebrated our journey, and it was a real journey.,And we had a lot of fun, and in 2004, I said to the guys,,"That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this,so we can get away with it year on year." (Laughter) 
 So we started thinking about that, and we were inspired,by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer.,And we thought, you know what, there's nothing for men's health.,Why is that? Why can't we combine growing a mustache,and doing something for men's health?,And I started to research that topic, and discovered,prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer,in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it. 
 But there was nothing for this cause,,so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer,,and then we created our tagline, which is,,"Changing the face of men's health.",And that eloquently describes the challenge,,changing your appearance for the 30 days,,and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve:,getting men engaged in their health, having them have,a better understanding about the health risks that they face. 
 So with that model, I then,cold-called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.,I said to him, "I've got the most amazing idea,that's going to transform your organization." (Laughter),And I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone,,so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne,in 2004.,And we sat down, and I shared with him my vision,of getting men growing mustaches across Australia,,raising awareness for this cause,,and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership,to legitimately do that.,And I said, "We're going to come together at the end,,we're going to have a mustache-themed party, we're going to have DJs,,we're going to celebrate life, and we're going to change the face of men's health.",And he just looked at me and laughed, and he said,,he said, "Adam, that's a really novel idea,,but we're an ultraconservative organization.,We can't have anything to do with you." (Laughter),So I paid for coffee that day — (Laughter) —,and his parting comment as we shook hands was,,"Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this,,we'll gladly take it." (Laughter) 
 So my lesson that year was persistence.,And we persisted, and we got 450 guys,growing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars,,and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia,,and that represented at the time the single biggest donation,they'd ever received. 
 So from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.,Every day -- this morning, I wake up and go, my life,is about a mustache. (Laughter),Essentially, I'm a mustache farmer. (Laughter),And my season is November. (Applause),(Applause) 
 So in 2005, the campaign got more momentum,,was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand,,and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.,It was consuming so much of our time after hours,on weekends that we thought, we either need,to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember,so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time,in the organization and take it to the next level. 
 It's really interesting when you try and figure a way,to fund a fundraising organization,built off growing mustaches. (Laughter),Let me tell you that there's not too many people interested,in investing in that, not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation,,who we'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage.,So again we persisted, and Foster's Brewing came to the party,and gave us our first ever sponsorship,,and that was enough for me to quit my job, I did consulting on the side.,And leading into Movember 2006,,we'd run through all the money from Foster's,,we'd run through all the money I had, and essentially,we had no money left, and we'd convinced all our suppliers --,creative agencies, web development agencies,,hosting companies, whatnot -- to delay their billing until December.,So we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars,worth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen,,the four founders, well, we would've been broke,,we would've been homeless, sitting on the street,with mustaches. (Laughter),But we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing,that happens, so what?,We're going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us,the importance of taking risks and really smart risks. 
 Then in early 2007, a really interesting thing happened.,We had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S.,,and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying,,hey, there's nothing for prostate cancer.,Bring this campaign to these countries.,So we thought, why not? Let's do it.,So I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada,,and I said to him, "I have this most amazing concept.",(Laughter),"It's going to transform your organization. I don't want,to tell you about it now, but will you meet with me,if I fly all the way to Toronto?" So I flew here,,met down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom,,and I said, "Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches,all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization.",And he looked at me and laughed and said,,"Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're,an ultraconservative organization." (Laughter),I've heard this before. I know how it goes.,But he said, "We will partner with you,,but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure,a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work." 
 So what we did was, we took some of the money that,we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across,to this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that,because we knew, if this was successful,,we could raise infinitely more money globally,than we could just in Australia. And that money,fuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.,And we're not about finding an Australian cure,or a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure. 
 So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here,,and it was, it set the stage for the campaign.,It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be.,We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia,and New Zealand at that stage.,So that year really taught us the importance of being patient,and really understanding the local market before you,become so bold as to set lofty targets. 
 But what I'm really pleased to say is, in 2010,,Movember became a truly global movement.,Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of,the number one fundraising campaign in the world.,Last year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world,and together we raised 77 million dollars.,(Applause),And that makes Movember now the biggest funder,of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.,And that is an amazing achievement when you think about,us growing mustaches. (Laughter) 
 And for us, we have redefined charity.,Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon. (Laughter),Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas,,and I think that's been fundamental to our success.,We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.,We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way. 
 So now I live in Los Angeles, because,the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there,,and I always get asked by the media down there,,because it's so celebrity-driven,,"Who are your celebrity ambassadors?",And I say to them, "Last year we were fortunate enough,to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors.",And they go, "What, what do you mean?",And it's like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro,and Mo Sista that participates in Movember,is our celebrity ambassador, and that is so, so important,and fundamental to our success. 
 Now what I want to share with you is,one of my most touching Movember moments,,and it happened here in Toronto last year,,at the end of the campaign.,I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember.,We'd had a great campaign, and to be honest, we'd had,our fair share of beer that night, but I said,,"You know what, I think we've got one more bar left in us." (Laughter),So we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver,,and I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around,and said, "Where are you going?",And I said, "Hang on, that is an amazing mustache.",(Laughter),And he said, "I'm doing it for Movember." And I said,,"So am I." And I said, "Tell me your Movember story.",And he goes, "Listen, I know it's about men's health,,I know it's about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer.",And I said, "Okay, that's interesting.",And he goes, "Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka,,because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her,",and he said, "This mustache is my tribute to my mom.",And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi,,and I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate,,and I just shook his hand and I said, "Thank you so much.,Your mom would be so proud.",And from that moment I realized that Movember,is so much more than a mustache, having a joke.,It's about each person coming to this platform,,embracing it in their own way,,and being significant in their own life. 
 For us now at Movember, we really focus on,three program areas, and having a true impact:,awareness and education,,survivor support programs, and research.,Now we always focus, naturally, on how much we raise,,because it's a very tangible outcome, but for me,,awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise,,because I know that is changing and saving lives today,,and it's probably best exampled by,a young guy that I met at South by Southwest,in Austin, Texas, at the start of the year.,He came up to me and said, "Thank you for starting Movember.",And I said, "Thank you for doing Movember.",And I looked at him, and I was like, "I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache." (Laughter),And I said, "What's your Movember story?",And he said, "I grew the worst mustache ever." (Laughter),"But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly,the conversation around the table turned to,what the hell was going on." (Laughter),"And we talked -- I talked to them about Movember,,and then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age,of 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad,one on one about men's health. I had a conversation,with my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned,that my grandfather had prostate cancer,and I was able to share with my dad that he was,twice as likely to get that disease, and he didn't know that,,and he hadn't been getting screened for it.",So now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer. 
 So those conversations, getting men engaged in this,,at whatever age, is so critically important,,and in my view so much more important,than the funds we raise. 
 Now to the funds we raise, and research,,and how we're redefining research.,We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries.,We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions,and researchers around the world, and when we looked,at this more recently, we realized there's a real lack,of collaboration going on even within institutions,,let alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique,to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.,And so we said, right, we'd redefined charity. We need,to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that?,So what we did was, we created a global action plan,,and we're taking 10 percent of what's raised in each country,now and putting it into a global fund, and we've got,the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world,that look after that fund,,and they come together each year and identify,the number one priority,,and that, last year, was getting a better screening test.,So they identified that as a priority, and then,they've got and recruited now 300 researchers,from around the world that are studying that topic,,essentially the same topic.,So now we're funding them to the tune of about,five or six million dollars to collaborate,and bringing them together, and that's a unique thing,in the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration,,it will accelerate outcomes.,And that's how we're redefining the research world. 
 So, what I know about my Movember journey is that,,with a really creative idea,,with passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience,,four mates, four mustaches,,can inspire a room full of people,,and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city,,and that city is Melbourne, my home.,And that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state,can go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that,,you can create a global movement,that is changing the face of men's health. 
 My name is Adam Garone, and that's my story.,Thank you. (Applause)We are today talkingnabout moral persuasion:,What is moral and immoralnin trying to change people's behaviors,by using technology and using design? 
 And I don't know what you expect,,but when I was thinking about that issue,,I early on realized what I'm not ablento give you are answers.,I'm not able to tell younwhat is moral or immoral,,because we're livingnin a pluralist society.,My values can be radicallyndifferent from your values,,which means that what I considernmoral or immoral based on that,might not necessarily benwhat you consider moral or immoral. 
 But I also realizednthere is one thing that I could give you,,and that is what this guynbehind me gave the world --,Socrates.,It is questions.,What I can do and whatnI would like to do with you,is give you, like that initial question,,a set of questionsnto figure out for yourselves,,layer by layer, like peeling an onion,,getting at the core of what you believenis moral or immoral persuasion.,And I'd like to do thatnwith a couple of examples of technologies,where people have used game elementsnto get people to do things. 
 So it's at first a very simple,nvery obvious question,I would like to give you:,What are your intentionsnif you are designing something?,And obviously, intentionsnare not the only thing,,so here is another examplenfor one of these applications.,There are a couple of these kindsnof Eco dashboards right now --,dashboards built into cars --,which try to motivate younto drive more fuel-efficiently.,This here is Nissan's MyLeaf,,where your driving behaviornis compared with the driving behavior,of other people,,so you can compete for who drives a routenthe most fuel-efficiently.,And these things arenvery effective, it turns out --,so effective that they motivate peoplento engage in unsafe driving behaviors,,like not stopping at a red light,,because that way you havento stop and restart the engine,,and that would use quitensome fuel, wouldn't it?,So despite this beingna very well-intended application,,obviously there was a side effect of that. 
 Here's another examplenfor one of these side effects.,Commendable: a site that allows parentsnto give their kids little badges,for doing the thingsnthat parents want their kids to do,,like tying their shoes.,And at first that sounds very nice,,very benign, well-intended.,But it turns out, if you look intonresearch on people's mindset,,caring about outcomes,,caring about public recognition,,caring about these kindsnof public tokens of recognition,is not necessarily very helpful,for your long-termnpsychological well-being.,It's better if you carenabout learning something.,It's better when you care about yourself,than how you appearnin front of other people.,So that kind of motivational toolnthat is used actually, in and of itself,,has a long-term side effect,,in that every time we use a technology,that uses somethingnlike public recognition or status,,we're actually positively endorsing this,as a good and normal thingnto care about --,that way, possibly havingna detrimental effect,on the long-term psychologicalnwell-being of ourselves as a culture. 
 So that's a second, very obvious question:,What are the effectsnof what you're doing --,the effects you're havingnwith the device, like less fuel,,as well as the effectsnof the actual tools you're using,to get people to do things --,public recognition? 
 Now is that all -- intention, effect?,Well, there are some technologiesnwhich obviously combine both.,Both good long-term and short-term effects,and a positive intentionnlike Fred Stutzman's "Freedom,",where the whole pointnof that application is --,well, we're usually so bombardednwith constant requests by other people,,with this device,,you can shut off the Internetnconnectivity of your PC of choice,for a pre-set amount of time,,to actually get some work done.,And I think most of us will agreenthat's something well-intended,,and also has good consequences.,In the words of Michel Foucault,,it is a "technology of the self.",It is a technologynthat empowers the individual,to determine its own life course,,to shape itself. 
 But the problem is,nas Foucault points out,,that every technology of the self,has a technology of dominationnas its flip side.,As you see in today's modernnliberal democracies,,the society, the state,nnot only allows us to determine our self,,to shape our self,,it also demands it of us.,It demands that we optimize ourselves,,that we control ourselves,,that we self-manage continuously,,because that's the only waynin which such a liberal society works.,These technologies want usnto stay in the game,that society has devised for us.,They want us to fit in even better.,They want us to optimizenourselves to fit in. 
 Now, I don't say thatnis necessarily a bad thing;,I just think that this examplenpoints us to a general realization,,and that is: no matter what technologynor design you look at,,even something we considernas well-intended,and as good in its effectsnas Stutzman's Freedom,,comes with certain values embedded in it.,And we can question these values.,We can question: Is it a good thing,that all of us continuouslynself-optimize ourselves,to fit better into that society? 
 Or to give you another example:,What about a piecenof persuasive technology,that convinces Muslim womennto wear their headscarves?,Is that a good or a bad technology,in its intentions or in its effects?,Well, that basically depends onnthe kind of values you bring to bear,to make these kinds of judgments. 
 So that's a third question:,What values do you use to judge?,And speaking of values:,I've noticed that in the discussionnabout moral persuasion online,and when I'm talking with people,,more often than not,nthere is a weird bias.,And that bias is that we're asking:,Is this or that "still" ethical?,Is it "still" permissible?,We're asking things like:,Is this Oxfam donation form,,where the regular monthlyndonation is the preset default,,and people, maybe without intending it,,are encouraged or nudgedninto giving a regular donation,instead of a one-time donation,,is that "still' permissible?,Is it "still" ethical?,We're fishing at the low end. 
 But in fact, that question,n"Is it 'still' ethical?",is just one way of looking at ethics.,Because if you look at the beginningnof ethics in Western culture,,you see a very different ideanof what ethics also could be.,For Aristotle, ethicsnwas not about the question,,"Is that still good, or is it bad?",Ethics was about the questionnof how to live life well.,And he put that in the word "arête,",which we, from [Ancient Greek],ntranslate as "virtue.",But really, it means "excellence.",It means living up to your ownnfull potential as a human being. 
 And that is an idea that, I think,,Paul Richard Buchanannput nicely in a recent essay,,where he said,n"Products are vivid arguments,about how we should live our lives.",Our designs are not ethical or unethical,in that they're using ethicalnor unethical means of persuading us.,They have a moral component,just in the kind of visionnand the aspiration of the good life,that they present to us. 
 And if you look into the designednenvironment around us,with that kind of lens,,asking, "What is the visionnof the good life,that our products, our design,npresent to us?",,then you often get the shivers,,because of how littlenwe expect of each other,,of how little we actuallynseem to expect of our life,,and what the good life looks like. 
 So that's a fourth questionnI'd like to leave you with:,What vision of the good lifendo your designs convey?,And speaking of design,,you'll notice that I alreadynbroadened the discussion,,because it's not just persuasiventechnology that we're talking about here,,it's any piece of designnthat we put out here in the world. 
 I don't know whether you know,the great communication researchernPaul Watzlawick who, back in the '60s,,made the argumentnthat we cannot not communicate.,Even if we choose to be silent,nwe chose to be silent,,and we're communicating somethingnby choosing to be silent.,And in the same waynthat we cannot not communicate,,we cannot not persuade:,whatever we do or refrain from doing,,whatever we put out therenas a piece of design, into the world,,has a persuasive component.,It tries to affect people.,It puts a certain vision of the good lifenout there in front of us, 
 which is what Peter-Paul Verbeek,,the Dutch philosopher of technology, says.,No matter whether we as designersnintend it or not,,we materialize morality.,We make certain thingsnharder and easier to do.,We organize the existence of people.,We put a certain vision,of what good or bad or normal or usual is,in front of people,,by everything we putnout there in the world. 
 Even something as innocuousnas a set of school chairs,is a persuasive technology,,because it presents and materializesna certain vision of the good life --,a good life in which teachingnand learning and listening,is about one person teaching,nthe others listening;,in which it is aboutnlearning-is-done-while-sitting;,in which you learn for yourself;,in which you're not supposednto change these rules,,because the chairsnare fixed to the ground. 
 And even something as innocuousnas a single-design chair,,like this one by Arne Jacobsen,,is a persuasive technology,,because, again, it communicatesnan idea of the good life:,a good life -- a life that you,nas a designer, consent to by saying,,"In a good life, goods are producednas sustainably or unsustainably,as this chair.,Workers are treated as well or as badly,as the workers were treatednthat built that chair.",The good life is a lifenwhere design is important,because somebody obviously tooknthe time and spent the money,for that kind of well-designed chair;,where tradition is important,,because this is a traditional classicnand someone cared about this;,and where there is somethingnas conspicuous consumption,,where it is OK and normal to spendna humongous amount of money,on such a chair,,to signal to other peoplenwhat your social status is. 
 So these are the kinds of layers,nthe kinds of questions,I wanted to lead you through today;,the question of: What are the intentionsnthat you bring to bear,when you're designing something?,What are the effects, intendednand unintended, that you're having?,What are the valuesnyou're using to judge those?,What are the virtues, the aspirations,that you're actually expressing in that?,And how does that apply,,not just to persuasive technology,,but to everything you design? 
 Do we stop there?,I don't think so.,I think that all of these thingsnare eventually informed,by the core of all of this,,and this is nothing but life itself.,Why, when the questionnof what the good life is,informs everything that we design,,should we stop at designnand not ask ourselves:,How does it apply to our own life?,"Why should the lampnor the house be an art object,,but not our life?",as Michel Foucault puts it. 
 Just to give you a practicalnexample of Buster Benson.,This is Buster setting upna pull-up machine,at the office of his newnstart-up, Habit Labs,,where they're trying to buildnother applications like "Health Month",for people.,And why is he building a thing like this?,Well, here is the set of axioms,that Habit Labs, Buster's start-up,nput up for themselves,on how they wanted to workntogether as a team,when they're buildingnthese applications --,a set of moral principlesnthey set themselves,for working together --,one of them being,,"We take care of our own healthnand manage our own burnout." 
 Because ultimately,nhow can you ask yourselves,and how can you find an answernon what vision of the good life,you want to convey and createnwith your designs,without asking the question:,What vision of the good lifendo you yourself want to live? 
 And with that,,I thank you. 
 (Applause)In the 1980s, in communistnEastern Germany,,if you owned a typewriter,,you had to register itnwith the government.,You had to register a sample sheet of textnout of the typewriter.,And this was donenso the government could track,where the text was coming from.,If they found a papernwhich had the wrong kind of thought,,they could track downnwho created that thought.,And we in the West,couldn't understandnhow anybody would do this,,how much this would restrictnfreedom of speech.,We would never do thatnin our own countries. 
 But today, in 2011, if you gonand buy a color laser printer,from any major laser printer manufacturer,and print a page,,that page will end up,having slight yellow dotsnprinted on every single page,,in a pattern which makes the page uniquento you and to your printer.,This is happening to us today.,And nobody seemsnto be making a fuss about it.,And this is an example,of the ways our own governmentsnare using technology,against us, the citizens.,And this is one of the main three sourcesnof online problems today. 
 If we look at what's reallynhappening in the online world,,we can group the attacksnbased on the attackers.,We have three main groups.,We have online criminals.,Like here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,,from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.,And the motives of online criminalsnare very easy to understand.,These guys make money.,They use online attacksnto make lots of money --,and lots and lots of it.,We actually have several casesnof millionaires online, multimillionaires,,who made money with their attacks.,Here's Vladimir Tsastsin,nfrom Tartu in Estonia.,This is [Albert] Gonzalez.,This is Stephen Watt.,This is Bjorn Sundin.,This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour,and so on and so on. 
 These guys make their fortunes online,,but they make it through the illegal means,of using things like banking Trojans,to steal money from our bank accountsnwhile we do online banking,,or with keyloggers,to collect our credit card information,while we are doing online shoppingnfrom an infected computer.,The US Secret Service,,two months ago,nfroze the Swiss bank account,of Mr. Sam Jain right here,,and that bank accountnhad 14.9 million US dollars in it,when it was frozen.,Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;nnobody knows where he is.,And I claim it's already today,that it's more likely for any of usnto become the victim of a crime online,than here in the real world.,And it's very obviousnthat this is only going to get worse.,In the future, the majority of crimenwill be happening online. 
 The second major group of attackersnthat we are watching today,are not motivated by money.,They're motivated by something else --,motivated by protests,,motivated by an opinion,,motivated by the laughs.,Groups like Anonymousnhave risen up over the last 12 months,and have become a major playernin the field of online attacks. 
 So those are the three main attackers:,criminals who do it for the money,,hacktivists like Anonymousndoing it for the protest,,but then the last groupnare nation states --,governments doing the attacks.,And then we look at casesnlike what happened in DigiNotar.,This is a prime example of what happensnwhen governments attack,against their own citizens.,DigiNotar is a certificatenauthority from the Netherlands --,or actually, it was.,It was running into bankruptcy last fall,,because they were hacked into.,Somebody broke innand they hacked it thoroughly.,And I asked last week,,in a meeting with Dutchngovernment representatives,,I asked one of the leaders of the team,whether he found plausiblenthat people died,because of the DigiNotar hack.,And his answer was: yes. 
 So how do people die,as the result of a hack like this?,Well, DigiNotar is a CA.,They sell certificates.,What do you do with certificates?,Well, you need a certificatenif you have a website,that has https, SSL encrypted services,,services like Gmail.,Now we all, or a big part of us,nuse Gmail or one of their competitors,,but these services are especially popularnin totalitarian states like Iran,,where dissidentsnuse foreign services like Gmail,because they know they are morentrustworthy than the local services,and they are encryptednover SSL connections,,so the local governmentncan't snoop on their discussions.,Except they can,,if they hack into a foreign CAnand issue rogue certificates.,And this is exactly what happenednwith the case of DigiNotar. 
 What about Arab Spring,and things that have been happening,nfor example, in Egypt?,Well, in Egypt,,the rioters looted the headquartersnof the Egyptian secret police,in April 2011,,and when they were looting the building,nthey found lots of papers.,Among those papersnwas this binder entitled, "FinFisher.",And within that binder were notesnfrom a company based in Germany,,which had sold to the Egyptian government,a set of tools for intercepting,nat a very large scale,,all the communicationnof the citizens of the country.,They had sold this tool for 280,000 eurosnto the Egyptian government.,The company headquarters are right here. 
 So Western governments are providingntotalitarian governments with tools,to do this against their own citizens.,But Western governmentsnare doing it to themselves as well.,For example, in Germany,,just a couple of weeks ago,nthe so-called "State Trojan" was found,,which was a Trojan usednby German government officials,to investigate their own citizens.,If you are a suspect in a criminal case,,well, it's pretty obvious,nyour phone will be tapped.,But today, it goes beyond that.,They will tap your Internet connection.,They will even use tools like State Trojan,to infect your computer with a Trojan,,which enables themnto watch all your communication,,to listen to your online discussions,,to collect your passwords. 
 Now, when we think deepernabout things like these,,the obvious responsenfrom people should be,,"OK, well, that sounds bad,nbut that doesn't really affect me,,because I'm a legal citizen.,Why should I worry?nBecause I have nothing to hide.",And this is an argumentnwhich doesn't make sense.,Privacy is implied.,Privacy is not up for discussion.,This is not a question,between privacy,against security.,It's a question of freedom,against control.,And while we might trust our governmentsnright now, right here in 2011,,any rights we give awaynwill be given away for good.,And do we trust, do we blindly trust,nany future government,,a government we might haven50 years from now?,And these are the questions,that we have to worry aboutnfor the next 50 years.So I want to talk todaynabout money and happiness,,which are two things a lot of usnspend a lot of our time thinking about,,either trying to earn themnor trying to increase them.,And a lot of us resonate with this phrase,,we see it in religionsnand self-help books:,money can't buy happiness.,And I want to suggest todaynthat, in fact, that's wrong. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm at a business school,nso that's what we do.,So that's wrong,,and in fact, if you think that,nyou're just not spending it right.,So instead of spending itnthe way you usually spend it,,maybe if you spent it differently,nthat might work a little bit better.,Before I tell you the ways you can spendnit that will make you happier,,let's think about the waysnwe usually spend it,that don't, in fact, make us happier.,We had a little natural experiment.,So CNN, a little while ago,nwrote this interesting article,on what happens to peoplenwhen they win the lottery.,It turns out people thinknwhen they win the lottery,their lives will be amazing.,This article's aboutnhow their lives get ruined.,What happens when people win the lottery,is, one, they spendnall the money and go into debt;,and two, all of their friendsnand everyone they've ever met,find them and bug them for money.,It ruins their socialnrelationships, in fact.,So they have more debtnand worse friendships,than they had before they won the lottery. 
 What was interestingnabout the article was,,people started commentingnon the article, readers of the thing.,And instead of talkingnabout how it made them realize,that money doesn't lead to happiness,,everyone started saying, "You knownwhat I'd do if I won the lottery ...?",and fantasizing about what they'd do.,Here's just two of the ones we sawnthat are interesting to think about.,One person wrote, "When I win,nI'm going to buy my own little mountain,and have a little house on top." 
 (Laughter) 
 And another person wrote,n"I would fill a big bathtub with money,and get in the tubnwhile smoking a big fat cigar,and sipping a glass of champagne.",This is even worse:n"... then I'd have a picture taken,and dozens of glossies made.,Anyone begging for moneynor trying to extort from me,would receive a copynof the picture and nothing else." 
 (Laughter) 
 And so many of the commentsnwere exactly of this type,,where people got moneynand, in fact, it made them antisocial.,So I told you it ruins people's livesnand their friends bug them.,Also, money often makesnus feel very selfish,and we do things only for ourselves.,We thought maybe the reason moneyndoesn't make us happy,is that we're spending itnon the wrong things;,in particular, we're alwaysnspending it on ourselves.,And we wondered what would happen,if we made people spendnmore of their money on others.,So instead of being antisocialnwith your money,,what if you were more pro-social with it? 
 We thought, let's make peoplendo it and see what happens.,Let's have some peoplendo what they usually do,,spend money on themselves,,and let's make some peoplengive money away,,and measure their happinessnand see if, in fact, they get happier.,The first way we did this was,none Vancouver morning,,we went out on the campusnat University of British Columbia,,approached people and said,n"Do you want to be in an experiment?",They said, "Yes.",We asked them how happy they were,nand then gave them an envelope.,One of the envelopesnhad things in it that said,,"By 5pm today,nspend this money on yourself.",We gave some examplesnof what you could spend it on.,Other people gotna slip of paper that said,,"By 5pm today, spend this moneynon somebody else.",Also inside the envelope was money. 
 And we manipulatednhow much money we gave them;,some people got this slipnof paper and five dollars,,some got this slipnof paper and 20 dollars.,We let them go about their daynand do whatever they wanted.,We found out they did spend itnin the way we asked them to.,We called them up and asked them,n"What did you spend it on?,How happy do you feel now?",What did they spend it on?,These are college undergrads;,a lot of what they spent it onnfor themselves,were things like earrings and makeup.,One woman said she boughtna stuffed animal for her niece.,People gave money to homeless people.,Huge effect here of Starbucks. 
 (Laughter) 
 So if you givenundergraduates five dollars,,it looks like coffee to them,,and they run over to Starbucksnand spend it as fast as they can.,Some people bought coffee for themselves,nthe way they usually would,,but others bought coffeenfor somebody else.,So the very same purchase,,just targeted toward yourselfnor targeted toward somebody else.,What did we find when we callednat the end of the day?,People who spent moneynon others got happier;,people who spent it on themselves,nnothing happened.,It didn't make them less happy,nit just didn't do much for them. 
 The other thing we saw is the amountnof money doesn't matter much.,People thought 20 dollarsnwould be way better than five.,In fact, it doesn't matternhow much money you spent.,What really mattersnis that you spent it on somebody else,rather than on yourself.,We see this again and again,when we give people money to spendnon others instead of on themselves.,Of course, these arenundergraduates in Canada --,not the world's mostnrepresentative population.,They're also fairly wealthy and affluentnand other sorts of things. 
 We wanted to see if this holds trueneverywhere in the world,or just among wealthy countries.,So we went to Ugandanand ran a very similar experiment.,Imagine, instead of just peoplenin Canada, we say,,"Name the last time you spentnmoney on yourself or others.,Describe it. How happy did it make you?",Or in Uganda, "Name the last timenyou spent money on yourself or others,and describe that.",Then we asked themnhow happy they are, again.,And what we see is sort of amazing,,because there's human universalsnon what you do with your money,,and real cultural differencesnon what you do as well.,So for example, one guynfrom Uganda says this:,"I called a girl I wished to love.",They basically went out on a date,,and he says at the endnthat he didn't "achieve" her up till now. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's a guy from Canada.,Very similar thing.,"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.,We went to a movie, we left early,,and then went back to her roomnfor ... cake," just cake. 
 (Laughter) 
 Human universal:,you spend money on others,nyou're being nice.,Maybe you have somethingnin mind, maybe not.,But then we see extraordinary differences.,So look at these two.,This is a woman from Canada.,We say, "Name a time you spentnmoney on somebody else.",She says, "I bought a present for my mom.,I drove to the mall, boughtna present, gave it to my mom.",Perfectly nice thing to do.,It's good to get giftsnfor people you know.,Compare that to this woman from Uganda:,"I was walking and met a longtime friendnwhose son was sick with malaria.,They had no money, they went to a clinicnand I gave her this money.",This isn't $10,000,nit's the local currency.,So it's a very smallnamount of money, in fact.,But enormously different motivations here.,This is a real medical need,nliterally a lifesaving donation.,Above, it's just kind of,nI bought a gift for my mother. 
 What we see again, though,,is that the specific way you spendnon other people isn't nearly as important,as the fact that you spend on other peoplenin order to make yourself happy,,which is really quite important.,So you don't have to donamazing things with your money,to make yourself happy.,You can do small, trivial things and stillnget the benefits from doing this.,These are only two countries.,We wanted to look at every countrynin the world if we could,,to see what the relationship isnbetween money and happiness. 
 We got data from the Gallup Organization,,which you know fromnall the political polls happening lately.,They asked people, "Did you donatenmoney to charity recently?",and, "How happy are younwith life in general?",We can see what the relationship isnbetween those two things.,Are they positively correlated,ngiving money makes you happy?,Or are they negatively correlated?,On this map, green will meannthey're positively correlated,,red means they're negatively correlated.,And you can see,nthe world is crazily green.,So in almost every country in the worldnwhere we have this data,,people who give moneynto charity are happier people,than people who don't givenmoney to charity.,I know you're lookingnat the red country in the middle.,I would be a jerk and notntell you what it is,,but it's Central African Republic.,You can make up stories.,Maybe it's different therenfor some reason.,Just below that to the rightnis Rwanda, though,,which is amazingly green. 
 So almost everywhere we look,,we see that giving money awaynmakes you happier,than keeping it for yourself.,What about work, which is wherenwe spend the rest of our time,,when we're not with the people we know.,We decided to infiltrate some companiesnand do a very similar thing.,These are sales teams in Belgium.,They work in teams,ngo out and sell to doctors,and try to get them to buy drugs.,We can look and seenhow well they sell things,as a function of being a member of a team.,We give people on some teams some money,"Spend it however you want on yourself,",just like we didnwith the undergrads in Canada.,To other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro.nSpend it on one of your teammates.,Buy them something as a giftnand give it to them.,Then we can see, we've got teamsnthat spend on themselves,and these pro-social teamsnwho we give money to make the team better.,The reason I havena ridiculous pinata there,is one team pooled their moneynand bought a pinata,,they smashed the pinata,nthe candy fell out and things like that.,A silly, trivial thing to do,,but think of the difference on a teamnthat didn't do that at all,,that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,nmaybe bought themselves a coffee,,or teams that hadnthis pro-social experience,where they bonded togethernto buy something and do a group activity.,What we see is that the teamsnthat are pro-social sell more stuff,than the teams that only gotnmoney for themselves. 
 One way to think of it is: for everyn15 euro you give people for themselves,,they put it in their pocket and don't donanything different than before.,You don't get money from that;,you lose money, since it doesn'tnmotivate them to perform better.,But when you give them 15 euronto spend on their teammates,,they do so much better on their teams,that you actually get a huge winnon investing this kind of money. 
 You're probably thinkingnto yourselves, this is all fine,,but there's a context that's incrediblynimportant for public policy,,and I can't imagine it would work there.,And if he doesn't show menthat it works here,,I don't believe anything he said.,I know what you're all thinkingnabout are dodgeball teams. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was a huge criticism that we got,,that if you can't show itnwith dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.,So we went and found these dodgeballnteams and infiltrated them,,and did the exact same thing as before.,So we give people on some teamsnmoney to spend on themselves.,Other teams, we give them moneynto spend on their dodgeball teammates.,The teams that spend money on themselves,have the same winningnpercentages as before.,The teams we give the moneynto spend on each other,become different teams;,they dominate the leaguenby the time they're done. 
 Across all of these different contexts --,your personal life, you work life,neven things like intramural sports --,we see spending on other peoplenhas a bigger return for you,than spending on yourself.,So if you think money can't buy happiness,nyou're not spending it right.,The implication isn't you should buynthis product instead of that product,,and that's the waynto make yourself happier.,It's that you should stop thinkingnabout which product to buy for yourself,,and try giving some of itnto other people instead. 
 And we luckily havenan opportunity for you.,DonorsChoose.org is a nonprofitnfor mainly public school teachers,in low-income schools.,They post projects like,,"I want to teach Huckleberry Finnnand we don't have the books,",or, "I want a microscopento teach my students science,and we don't have a microscope.",You and I can go on and buy it for them.,The teacher and the kidsnwrite you thank-you notes,,sometimes they send picturesnof them using the microscope.,It's an extraordinary thing. 
 Go to the website and start yourselfnon the process of thinking,less about "How can I spendnmoney on myself?",and more about "If I've gotnfive dollars or 15 dollars,,what can I do to benefit other people?",Ultimately, when you do that, you'll findnyou benefit yourself much more. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The world's largest and most devastatingnenvironmental and industrial project,is situated in the heart of the largestnand most intact forest in the world,,Canada's boreal forest.,It stretches right acrossnNorthern Canada, in Labrador,,it's home to the largest remainingnwild caribou herd in the world:,the George River caribou herd,,numbering approximately 400,000 animals.,Unfortunately, when I was there,nI couldn't find one of them,,but you have the antlers as proof. 
 All across the boreal,,we're blessed with this incrediblenabundance of wetlands.,Wetlands, globally, are onenof the most endangered ecosystems.,They're absolutely critical ecosystems,,they clean air, they clean water,,they sequester large amountsnof greenhouse gases,,and they're homento a huge diversity of species.,In the boreal, they are also the home,where almost 50 percent of the 800 birdnspecies found in North America,migrate north to breednand raise their young. 
 In Ontario, the boreal marches down southnto the north shore of Lake Superior.,And these incrediblynbeautiful boreal forests,were the inspiration for some of the mostnfamous art in Canadian history,,the Group of Sevennwere very inspired by this landscape,,and so the boreal is not just a really keynpart of our natural heritage,,but also an important partnof our cultural heritage. 
 In Manitoba, this is an imagenfrom the east side of Lake Winnipeg,,and this is the home of the newlyndesignated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.,In Saskatchewan,nas across all of the boreal,,home to some of our most famous rivers,,an incredible network of rivers and lakesnthat every school-age child learns about,,the Peace, the Athabasca,nthe Churchill here, the Mackenzie,,and these networksnwere the historical routes,for the voyageur and the coureur de bois,,the first non-aboriginalnexplorers of Northern Canada,that, taking fromnthe First Nations people,,used canoes and paddled to explore,for a trade route,na Northwest Passage for the fur trade. 
 In the North, the borealnis bordered by the tundra,,and just below that, in Yukon,,we have this incredible valley,nthe Tombstone Valley.,And the Tombstone Valley is homento the Porcupine caribou herd.,Now you've probably heardnabout the Porcupine caribou herd,in the context of its breeding groundnin Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.,Well, the wintering groundnis also critical,and it also is not protected,,and is potentially, could be potentially,nexploited for gas and mineral rights. 
 The western border of the borealnin British Columbia,is marked by the Coast Mountains,,and on the other side of those mountains,is the greatest remainingntemperate rainforest in the world,,the Great Bear Rainforest,,and we'll discuss that in a few minutesnin a bit more detail. 
 All across the boreal,,it's home for a huge incredible rangenof indigenous peoples,,and a rich and varied culture.,And I think that one of the reasons,why so many of these groups havenretained a link to the past,,know their native languages,,the songs, the dances, the traditions,,I think part of that reasonnis because of the remoteness,,the span and the wilderness,of this almost 95 percentnintact ecosystem.,And I think particularly now,,as we see ourselves in a timenof environmental crisis,,we can learn so much from these people,who have lived so sustainablynin this ecosystem,for over 10,000 years. 
 In the heart of this ecosystemnis the very antithesis,of all of these valuesnthat we've been talking about,,and I think thesenare some of the core values,that make us proud to be Canadians.,This is the Alberta tar sands,,the largest oil reserves on the planetnoutside of Saudi Arabia.,Trapped underneath the boreal forestnand wetlands of northern Alberta,are these vast reservesnof this sticky, tar-like bitumen.,And the miningnand the exploitation of that,is creating devastation on a scalenthat the planet has never seen before. 
 I want to try to conveynsome sort of a sense of the size of this.,If you look at that truck there,,it is the largest trucknof its kind on the planet.,It is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck,and its dimensions are 45 feet longnby 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.,If I stand beside that truck,,my head comes to around the bottomnof the yellow part of that hubcap.,Within the dimensions of that truck,,you could build a 3,000-square-footntwo-story home quite easily.,I did the math.,So instead of thinking of that as a truck,nthink of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.,That's not a bad size home.,And line those trucks / homesnback and forth,across there from the bottomnall the way to the top.,And then think of how largenthat very small section of one mine is. 
 Now, you can apply that same kindnof thinking here as well.,Now, here you see --nof course, as you go further on,,these trucks become like a pixel.,Again, imagine thosenall back and forth there.,How large is that one portion of a mine?,That would be a huge,nvast metropolitan area,,probably much largernthan the city of Victoria.,And this is just one of a number of mines,,10 mines so far right now.,This is one section of one mining complex,,and there are about another 40 or 50nin the approval process.,No tar sands mine has actuallynever been denied approval,,so it is essentially a rubber stamp. 
 The other method of extractionnis what's called the in situ.,And here, massive amounts of water,are superheated and pumpednthrough the ground,,through these vasts networks of pipelines,,seismic lines, drill paths,ncompressor stations.,And even though this looksnmaybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,,it's even more damaging in some ways.,It impacts and fragmentsna larger part of the wilderness,,where there is 90 percentnreduction of key species,,like woodland caribou and grizzly bears,,and it consumesneven more energy, more water,,and produces at leastnas much greenhouse gas.,So these in situ developments are at leastnas ecologically damaging as the mines. 
 The oil produced from either method,produces more greenhouse gasnemissions than any other oil.,This is one of the reasonsnwhy it's called the world's dirtiest oil.,It's also one of the reasons,why it is the largest and fastest-growingnsingle source of carbon in Canada,,and it is also a reasonnwhy Canada is now number three,in terms of producing carbon per person.,The tailings ponds are the largest toxicnimpoundments on the planet.,Oil sands -- or rather,nI should say tar sands --,oil sands is a PR-created term,so that the oil companiesnwouldn't be trying to promote something,that sounds like a sticky tar-likensubstance that's the world's dirtiest oil.,So they decided to call it oil sands.,The tar sands consume more waternthan any other oil process,,three to five barrels of waternare taken, polluted,and then returned into tailings ponds,,the largest toxicnimpoundments on the planet. 
 SemCrude, just one of the licensees,nin just one of their tailings ponds,,dumps 250,000 tonsnof this toxic gunk every single day.,That's creating the largest toxicnimpoundments in the history of the planet.,So far, this is enough toxin to covernthe face of Lake Erie a foot deep.,And the tailings pondsnrange in size up to 9,000 acres.,That's two-thirds the sizenof the entire island of Manhattan.,That's like from Wall Streetnat the southern edge of Manhattan,up to maybe 120th Street.,So this is one of the largerntailings ponds.,This might be, what? I don't know,nhalf the size of Manhattan.,And you can see in the context,,it's just a relatively small sectionnof one of 10 mining complexes,and another 40 to 50non stream to be approved soon. 
 And of course, these tailings ponds --,well, you can't seenmany ponds from outer space,and you can see these, so maybenwe should stop calling them ponds --,these massive toxic wastelands are built,unlined and on the banksnof the Athabasca River.,And the Athabasca River drains downstreamnto a range of aboriginal communities.,In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there,nare finding toxins in the food chain,,this has been scientifically proven.,The tar sands toxinsnare in the food chain,,and this is causing cancernrates up to 10 times,what they are in the rest of Canada. 
 In spite of that, people have to live,nhave to eat this food in order to survive.,The incredibly high price of flying food,into these remotenNorthern aboriginal communities,and the high rate of unemployment,makes this an absolutennecessity for survival.,And not that many years ago,nI was lent a boat by a First Nations man,,and he said, "When youngo out on the river,,do not under anyncircumstances eat the fish.,It's carcinogenic.",And yet, on the front porchnof that man's cabin,,I saw four fish.,He had to feed his family to survive.,And as a parent, I just can't imaginenwhat that does to your soul.,And that's what we're doing. 
 The boreal forestnis also perhaps our best defense,against global warming and climate change.,The boreal forest sequesters more carbonnthan any other terrestrial ecosystem.,And this is absolutely key.,So what we're doing is,,we're taking the most concentratedngreenhouse gas sink --,twice as much greenhousengases are sequestered,in the boreal per acrenthan the tropical rainforests.,And what we're doing is we're destroying,this carbon sink,nturning it into a carbon bomb.,And we're replacing thatnwith the largest industrial project,in the history of the world,,which is producing the most high-carbonngreenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.,And we're doing this on the second largestnoil reserves on the planet. 
 This is one of the reasons why Canada,noriginally a climate change hero --,we were one of the firstnsignatories of the Kyoto Accord.,Now we're the countrynthat has full-time lobbyists,in the European Union and Washington DC,,threatening trade wars,when these countries talk about wantingnto bring in positive legislation,to limit the import of high-carbon fuels,,of greenhouse gas emissions,nanything like this,,at international conferences,nwhether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun,,international conferencesnon climate change,,we're the country that getsnthe dinosaur award every single day,,as being the biggestnobstacle to progress on this issue. 
 Just 70 miles downstream,is the world's largest freshwater delta,nthe Peace-Athabasca Delta,,the only one at the juncturenof all four migratory flyways.,This is a globally significant wetland,nperhaps the greatest on the planet.,Incredible habitatnfor half the bird species,you find in North America, migrating here.,And also the last refugenfor the largest herd of wild bison,,and also, of course, critical habitatnfor another whole range of other species.,But it too is being threatened,by the massive amount of waternbeing drawn from the Athabasca,,which feeds these wetlands,,and also the incredible toxic burden,of the largest toxic unlinednimpoundments on the planet,,which are leaching in to the food chainnfor all the species downstream. 
 So as bad as all that is, things are goingnto get much worse -- much, much worse.,This is the infrastructurenas we see it about now.,This is what's planned for 2015.,And you can see herenthe Keystone Pipeline,,which would take tar sands rawndown to the Gulf Coast,,punching a pipeline throughnthe agricultural heart of North America,,of the United States,,and securing the contractnwith the dirtiest fuel in the world,by consumption of the United States,,and promoting a huge disincentive,to a sustainable clean-energynfuture for America. 
 Here you see the routendown the Mackenzie valley.,This would put a pipelinento take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea,through the heart of the third largestnwatershed basin in the world,,and the only onenwhich is 95 percent intact.,And building a pipelinenwith an industrial highway,would change forevernthis incredible wilderness,,which is a true raritynon the planet today. 
 So the Great Bear Rainforestnis just over the hill there,,within a few miles,nwe go from these dry boreal forests,of 100-year-old trees,nmaybe 10 inches across,,and soon, we're in the coastalntemperate rainforest,,rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,,20 feet across, a completelyndifferent ecosystem.,And the Great Bear Rainforestnis generally considered to be,the largest coastal temperate rainforestnecosystem in the world.,Some of the greatest densities,of some of the most iconicnand threatened species on the planet.,And yet there's a proposal,nof course, to build a pipeline,to take huge tankers,n10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez,,through some of the mostndifficult-to-navigate waters in the world,,where only just a few years ago,na BC ferry ran aground.,When one of these tar sands tankers,,carrying the dirtiest oil,n10 times as much as the Exxon Valdez,,eventually hits a rock and goes down,,we're going to havenone of the worst ecological disasters,this planet has ever seen. 
 And here we have the plan out to 2030.,What they're proposing is an almostnfour-times increase in production,,and that would industrializenan area the size of Florida.,In doing so, we'll be removingna large part of our greatest carbon sink,and replacing it with the most highngreenhouse-gas emission oil in the future.,The world does not neednany more tar mines.,The world does not need any more pipelines,to wed our addiction to fossil fuels.,And the world certainly does not need,the largest toxic impoundmentsnto grow and multiply,and further threatennthe downstream communities.,And let's face it, we all live downstream,in an era of global warmingnand climate change. 
 What we need, is we all need to act,to ensure that Canada respectsnthe massive amounts of freshwater,that we hold in this country.,We need to ensurenthat these wetlands and forests,that are our best and greatestnand most critical defense,against global warming are protected,,and we are not releasingnthat carbon bomb into the atmosphere.,And we need to all gather togethernand say no to the tar sands.,And we can do that.,there is a huge networknall over the world,,fighting to stop this project. 
 And I quite simply think,that this is not somethingnthat should be decided just in Canada.,Everyone in this room,neveryone across Canada,,everyone listening to this presentation,has a role to playnand, I think, a responsibility.,Because what we do herenis going to change our history,,it's going to colornour possibility to survive,,and for our children to survivenand have a rich future. 
 We have an incredible gift in the boreal,,an incredible opportunity to preservenour best defense against global warming,,but we could let that slip away.,The tar sands could threatennnot just a large section of the boreal.,It compromises the life and the health,of some of our most underprivilegednand vulnerable people,,the aboriginal communitiesnthat have so much to teach us.,It could destroy the Athabasca Delta,,the largest and possibly greatestnfreshwater delta in the planet.,It could destroynthe Great Bear Rainforest,,the largest temperatenrainforest in the world.,And it could have huge impacts,on the future of the agriculturalnheartland of North America. 
 I hope that you will all,nif you've been moved by this presentation,,join with the growingninternational community,to get Canada to step upnto its responsibilities,,to convince Canada to go backnto being a climate change champion,instead of a climate change villain,,and to say no to the tar sands,,and yes to a clean energy future for all.,Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,,and I professionally watch YouTube videos.,It's true.,So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral,and then why that even matters.,We all want to be stars --,celebrities, singers, comedians --,and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.,But now Web video has made it,so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do,can become completely famous,in a part of our world's culture.,Any one of you could be famous on the Internet,by next Saturday.,But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube,every minute.,And of that, only a tiny percentage,ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.,So how does it happen?,Three things:,tastemakers, communities of participation,and unexpectedness.,All right, let's go. 
 (Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.,Oh, my God!,Wooo!,Ohhhhh, wowwww! 
 KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video,that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.,In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.,(Laughter),This is a chart of what it looked like,when it first became popular last summer.,But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.,He just wanted to share a rainbow.,Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.,(Laughter),And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.,And this video had actually been posted,all the way back in January.,So what happened here?,Jimmy Kimmel actually.,Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet,that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.,Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel,introduce us to new and interesting things,and bring them to a larger audience. 
 (Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫,♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫,♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫ 
 KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation,without talking about this video I hope.,Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.,It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.,This is a chart of what it looked like.,And similar to "Double Rainbow,",it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. 
 So what happened on this day?,Well it was a Friday, this is true.,And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.,(Laughter),But what about this day,,this one particular Friday?,Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.,Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater,was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.,But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers,took a point of view,and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process. 
 And so then this community formed,of people who shared this big inside joke,and they started talking about it and doing things with it.,And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.,Even in the first seven days,,there was one parody for every other day of the week.,(Laughter),Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,,this community participation,is how we become a part of the phenomenon --,either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. 
 (Music) 
 So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation,with looped music.,It's this, just like this.,It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.,And if you think that that is weird,,you should know that there is a three-hour version of this,that's been viewed four million times.,(Laughter),Even cats were watching this video.,(Laughter),Cats were watching other cats watch this video. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what's important here,is the creativity that it inspired,amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.,There were remixes.,(Laughter),Someone made an old timey version.,(Laughter),And then it went international.,(Laughter),An entire remix community sprouted up,that brought it from being just a stupid joke,to something that we can all actually be a part of.,Because we don't just enjoy now,,we participate. 
 And who could have predicted any of this?,Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black,or "Nyan Cat?",What scripts could you have written,that would have contained this in it?,In a world where over two days of video,get uploaded every minute,,only that which is truly unique and unexpected,can stand out in the way that these things have.,When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video,about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,,I admit I wasn't very interested. 
 (Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,,but often there are obstructions,that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. 
 (Laughter) 
 KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,,Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point,seen five million times.,And so this approach holds,for anything new that we do creatively.,And so it all brings us,to one big question ... 
 (Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?,Ohhhh.,(Laughter) 
 KA: What does it mean?,Tastemakers, creative participating communities,,complete unexpectedness,,these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture,where anyone has access,and the audience defines the popularity.,I mean, as mentioned earlier,,one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,,got his start on YouTube.,No one has to green-light your idea.,And we all now feel some ownership,in our own pop culture.,And these are not characteristics of old media,,and they're barely true of the media of today,,but they will define the entertainment of the future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics. 
 I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,,and that means that I spend a good amount of time,designing and building new pieces of technology,,and more specifically designing and building electronics.,And what I've found is that the process of designing,and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.,So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive,,and the outcome of that process,,namely electronic circuit boards,,are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.,So they're really small, generally, they're square,and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them,just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I,have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up,the process and the outcome of designing electronics. 
 And so what if you could design and build electronics,like this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly,,extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,,really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?,Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up,all sorts of new possibilities? 
 I'm going to share with you two projects that are,investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.,(Video) Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.,A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.,Sticker templates.,Speed x 4.,Making a switch.,Music: DJ Shadow.,Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller.,Sketching an interface. 
 (Music),(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Pretty cool, huh? We think so.,So now that we developed these tools,and found these materials that let us do these things,,we started to realize that, essentially, anything,that we can do with paper, anything that we can do,with a piece of paper and a pen,we can now do with electronics.,So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a,deeper exploration of that possibility.,And I'll kind of let it speak for itself. 
 (Music),(Applause) 
 So the next step for us in this process,is now to find a way to let all of you,build things like this,,and so the way that we're approaching that is by,teaching workshops to people where we explain,how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also,working to get the tools and the materials and techniques,out into the real world in a variety of ways.,And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build,and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.,So thank you very much. (Applause)"My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax.,My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.,I'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean,,because it ain't about being heard, just being seen.,My leather Adidas baseball cap matches,my fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter),Ain't nobody who looks as good as me,,but this costs money, it sure ain't free,,and I gots no job, no money at all,,but it's easy to steal all this from the mall.,Parents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should.,Got to do what I can to make sure I look good,,and the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,,I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.,When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide,,and I really must get some new gear soon,or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.,But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.,My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear.,School's almost over. Summer is near.,And I'm sportin' torn Jordans.,I need something new. Only one thing left to do.,Cut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,,check out my victims hangin' around.,Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey.,Got to get some new gear. There's no other way.,I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.,This is serious business. This ain't no fun.,And I can't have my posse laughin' at me.,I'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see.,Come out of the station, West 4th near the park,,brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,,'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?',I says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.',They were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.,The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.,Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.,Had my pistol and knew just what to do.,Waited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.,He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,,and I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!',And the punk tried to run.,Took off fast, didn't get far. I fired,'Pow!',Fool fell between two parked cars.,He was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.,And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.,While laying there dying, all he could say,was, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away.",You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive.,As I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.,Very next day, I bopped into school,with my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.,I killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care,,because now I needs a new jacket to wear." 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 For the last 15 years that I have been performing,,all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.,See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.,It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition,,and while those things hold weight,,it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.,The hunger and thirst was, and still remains:,How do I get people who hate poetry,to love me?,Because I'm an extension of my work,,and if they love me, then they will love my work,,and if they love my work, then they will love poetry,,and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,,which is to transcend it to the world. 
 And in 1996, I found the answer in principles,in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,,who wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans.",And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,,and I read him one of my pieces,,and you know what he told me?,"Yo' wack.,You know what the problem is with you, homie?,You don't read other people's poetry,,and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures,to tonal consideration." (Laughter),Now he kept on rambling,about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights. 
 Now I could have quit. I should have quit.,I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.,I didn't know you actually have to have creative control. 
 So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.,When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.,I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning,to ask him who's the best poet.,I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea,because he told me it was brain food. 
 Then one day I told him,,"Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?" (Laughter),And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis,on a poet named Etheridge Knight,and the oral nature of poetry,,and from that point,,Reggie stopped becoming the best to me,,because what Etheridge Knight taught me,was that I could make my words sound like music,,even my small ones, the monosyllables,,the ifs, ands, buts, whats,,the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,,and from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.,I wanted to know which poet he read,,and I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"],,a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage,a poet could ever be:,Broadway, baby.,And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away,and attack the poetry with my body. 
 But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.,The biggest lesson I learned was many years later,when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent,who looked at me up and down,and said I don't look like I have any experience,to be working in this business. 
 And I said to him, "Listen, punk fool,,you're a failed actor who became an agent,,and you know why you failed as an actor?,Because people like me took your job.,I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex,in East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point,who were in my way on my way to master the art of space,,and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child,you can fit in there only so I can push them,to the back of the wall with my experience.,People have bought tickets to my experience,and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know,that the revolution is near, so stock up.,I'm so experienced that when you went,to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,,I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.,I can master shock of "The Crying Game" with the awe,of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know,that it was his father who gave it to my mother,,and that's a double entendre.,I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School,and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child,in it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught,teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans,and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.,Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,,"Something's always wrong when nothing's always right.",Method acting is nothing but a mixture,of multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,,like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.,Dude, you go to Riker's Island Academy.,I could make David Mamet,psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,,Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee,kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.,So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?,Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon,kung fu secret.,Boards don't hit back.,You think black entertainers have it hard finding work,in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto,,which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.,Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto,,buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,,so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack,go-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,,whatever slander you send my way,,your mother.,Thank you. (Applause)I'm an industrial designer,,which means I create all these cool things,from ideas that we surround ourselvesnwith, or in this case,,geeky people surround themselvesnwith, for the most part.,I have absolutely no backgroundnin biology, chemistry or engineering,,so bear with me, because I'll be talkingnabout biomedical engineering today. 
 (Laughter) 
 And please do stay here in the meantime. 
 Industrial design is aboutnmaking lots of things identical.,The downside about that is,nthere's something impersonal,about lots of identical things,,because when you're tryingnto design one thing for one person,to solve one issue,,you can't really do that,when you're making thingsnaimed more to a demographic model,or to a marketing requirements document,,which is what we live by.,So I got disheartenednby the whole process in general,,and went to rethink itnand redesign designing altogether,,went way back to my early, earlyndesign inspirations,,and back to about eight years old,nand that got me to this guy.,Anyone here from MIT knows him,or has a tattoo or posternof him somewhere. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyone else in the room, just for a hint,,he is the engineer of engineersnor the designer of designers.,He is the guy who made bionicsna household word,in the form of the polyester-cladnSix Million Dollar Man,that I grew up with. 
 The thing that came fromnthis pop culture show,,the real takeaway, was two main things:,if you're designing for the person,nfor a real person,,you don't settle for the minimumnfunctional requirements;,you see how far beyond that you can go,,where the rewards really arenway out in the fringe,of how far past that document you can go.,And if you can nail that,,you stand to improventhe quality of life for somebody,for every momentnfor the rest of their life.,I kind of distilled that downninto a design philosophy,,and infuse thatninto the studio that I have now;,I'm trying to get everyonento think along these lines.,It's not a profound philosophy,nbut it works for us. 
 We work with prosthetic limbs,,and the first thing you seenabout prosthetic limbs,is that they are engineering brilliance.,They can do amazing things;,they can return all kindsnof functionality and performance,back to somebody's life.,But from the vantagenof an industrial designer,,they're not quite there.,What we don't see is the sculpturenor the beauty or the individual qualities,or the uniqueness or the elegance to them.,They are brilliant, mechanical,nutilitarian devices.,And that's great, exceptnfor a lot of people, that doesn't work.,People come to our studio all the time,,and they have bubble wrap and duct tape,,trying to approximate their original form.,Or they'll have a gym socknstuffed with other gym socks,to try to recreatenthe shape that once was;,and that, to us, is not thriving. 
 The body, to us,nis not a mechanical entity,,where mechanical-only solutionsncan address them.,It's our personal sculpture,nour kinematic sculpture.,It is our canvas;,it represents not just our physicality,,but also a lot of our personality as well.,So when you're designing for the body,,maybe the thing isn't to designnfor mass production,,but to design with the body in mind,,to really think about curvesninstead of hard geometry,,or uniqueness instead of identical.,The problem is, we're constrainednby mass production,,which makes a million identical things,but can't make one unique,nindividualized thing.,So we scrapped thatnin the new design process,,and we start with the person. 
 This is a three-dimensional scanner,,and that's what happensnwhen you scan somebody:,you get three-dimensional dataninto your computer.,You can take the sound-side limb there,nthe surviving limb, mirror it over,,and from now on,,anything in the processnwill recreate symmetry --,something as personalnand as hard to achieve,as symmetry in the body.,And you create a productnthat, no matter what,,it's going to be as uniquenas their fingerprint.,In fact, our process is incapablenof creating two identical things.,So we run it throughncomputer modeling, 3D CAD.,Here, we actually infuse a lotnof the individual's taste and personality,into it, everywhere we can,,and we three-dimensionallynprint the results.,We call the resulting parts "fairings,",because they're namednafter the panels on a motorcycle,that turn it from a mechanical thingninto a sculptural thing. 
 We tried this on Chad.,Chad is a competitive soccer player,,lost his leg eight years ago to cancer.,You can imagine,nit's really tricky to play soccer,when you have titanium pipenwhere there used to be a leg.,The resulting parts recreated his shape,and deliberately had an aestheticnthat look like sporting gear.,We wanted it to make it look likenhe just pulled it out of the gym bag,,so it's fairly utilitarian in that regard.,Two things happened.,One, we expected: his sensenof his body came back to him.,He was suddenly able to controlnthe ball, to feel the ball,,because his body rememberednthat original shape that he had had,up until eight years ago.,The other thing, though,nis that the other members of the team,stopped thinking of himnas the amputee on the team.,Not that they didn't know, but it stoppednbecoming a focal point for him.,And there is a certainnvery quiet value in that,,we like to believe. 
 James lost his leg in a motorcycle crash.,And the motorcycle is still a big partnof James's personality and style.,Check out the tattoo on his forearm.,We three-dimensionally printed thatninto what would be his calf.,He has his tattoo, he has his morphology,and he has the materialsnof his motorcycle.,And the result is interesting in thatnyou can't really tell at first glance,where the motorcycle stopsnand where James starts.,It's kind of a chimera hybridnbetween the two,,and James likes that. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, we don't ever try to make somethingnlook like it could be human.,Our whole goal is to benunapologetically man-made,,to take what's already there, morphology,,and just make it reallyncool and beautiful,,something that somebodyncan't wait to show the world,,because that changes their look.,You don't look at him and say,n"He's an amputee with a prosthetic.",You say, "He's a guynwith something really cool going on. 
 Deborah wanted her curves back,,but she also just wantednwhat came out of it to be really sexy,,which is great for us to hear.,We created this lace patternnthat lends itself well to 3D printing.,We created the first leg, I think,,where the lace definesnthe contour of the leg,,instead of the legngiving form to the lace.,We switched things over.,What I like about this shotnis you can see daylight through it.,So we're not trying to hide anything;,the load-bearing carbon componentnis totally visible.,We're just giving it formnand shape and contours,that were hers to begin with.,We made her another legnthat matched her purse,,just because we could. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We made another onenwhere we laser-tattooed the leather,,because how cool would it be,to be able to change your tattoos outnfrom one minute to the next?,Love that.,We try to capture as muchnof somebody's personality as we can. 
 This is George.nHis will be finished next week.,This is the raw computer datanthat we deal with.,He's kind of a classic,ntimeless-type personality,,so we did herringbone tweed,nbut in polished nickel. 
 (Laughter) 
 And Uve was all too proudnto show his tattoos,,so we are laser-tattooing thoseninto the leather.,Part of it is, yes, we're showing off,nbecause we can do this,,but the other part is this connects himnto what will be a part of him.,That is something really valuable;nwe believe in that.,Tattoos are especially exciting for us.,What happens if you take the tattoo,,which is a combinationnof somebody's personal taste and choice,,and their morphology,,but now, let's say, you remove the person.,You get a free-floating tattoondefining their body.,So everything we do is about recreatingnand expressing something,that means something to that person,,and expressing that throughnwhat would be their body,,whether it's speed or attitude or bling,,whatever it is that capturesnand suggests them in the best way we can. 
 Back to the 3D-printing thingnand this whole process:,we have a process that lends itselfnto making one thing per person;,it's very individual, and it actuallynreally lends itself well to complexity.,So why not just print the entire leg?,That's the concept that precedednthe work we're doing now.,This is a three-dimensionally printed leg.nIt's symmetric to the other leg.,It is made in America,,it is a trivially low-carbon footprintnto create, curbside recyclable,,costs about 4,000 dollars to create,,and it is dishwasher-safe. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's a value to that, too.,People don't thinknabout that all the time,,but yes, throw it in the dishwasher,nit works just great.,This was based on the original ideanthat I could go anywhere in the world,with nothing more than a cameranand a laptop computer,,use the camera as a 3D scanner and createnfor somebody, in a matter of hours,,a very high-quality, three-dimensionallynprinted leg for a very low cost.,The proof of concept works great,nwe're finding it; we'll get there.,Or, we upped the quality of the materialsnand created this for John.,The fun thing with John's legnis that when his fiancee looked at this,,she joked and said, "I like that legnbetter than that leg." 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's a joke -- she knows full wellnwhat he goes through --,but at the same time,nthere's something very valuable.,He turned to us and said,n"Nobody says that.",He's never heard that in his life.,That connected with him very deeply. 
 So we like to thinknthat this is a new type of design,,where you're turningnthe original process on its head,,where there is a dialogue that formsnbetween the designer and the end user,,where the designer relinquishesnsome of the control --,designers hate doing that --,and instead, is the curator of a process.,And the end user relinquishes their bodyninto the process, and their taste.,I'd like to think that speaksnto a greater change that's happening,in the design world altogether;,in this case, it's one wherenproducts will be evaluated,on how well they address the individual.,The individual will actually benpart of the DNA of the end product itself.,We will be evaluating productsnon how well they address a unique person,,instead of a demographic model. 
 This all really hit home for usnin one of the first legs we did;,when Chad here put on the leg,,reached down and felt it,and thought about it for a while.,Then he turned to us and said,,"That's the first time I've feltnthat shape in eight years.",We thought about that.,And for all the technology,and all the nightsnand energy we put into it,,that's all we really wanted to hear. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 Good afternoon. 
 As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.,I come to you with a modest proposal,for easing the financial burden. 
 This idea came to me while talking to,a physicist friend of mine at MIT.,He was struggling to explain something to me:,a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.,Now he confused me from the very start,,because light doesn't cool things down.,It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.,The reason that you can see me standing here is because,this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,,and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.,All of them are different colors,,they're rippling with different frequencies,,and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,,and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,,and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here. 
 Now a laser is different.,It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,,and if you focus them into a beam,,what you have is an incredibly useful tool.,The control of a laser is so precise,that you can perform surgery inside of an eye,,you can use it to store massive amounts of data,,and you can use it for this beautiful experiment,that my friend was struggling to explain.,First you trap atoms in a special bottle.,It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms,from the noise of the environment.,And the atoms themselves are quite violent,,but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,,an atom will briefly absorb those photons,and tend to slow down.,Little by little it gets colder,until eventually it approaches absolute zero. 
 Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,,something truly bizarre happens.,It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.,It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.,The atoms lose their individual identity,,and the rules from the quantum world take over,,and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.,For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,,it is able to slow photons down,to 60 kilometers per hour.,Another spooky property is that it flows,with absolutely no viscosity or friction,,so if you were to take the lid off that bottle,,it won't stay inside.,A thin film will creep up the inside wall,,flow over the top and right out the outside.,Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,,and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,,it immediately turns back into normal matter.,Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.,And this is the great pleasure of science:,the defeat of our intuition through experimentation. 
 But the experiment is not the end of the story,,because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.,I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.,I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.,So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,,it seemed like the more he said,,the less I understood.,Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture,of a complex idea, to really capture its essence,,the fewer words you use, the better.,In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.,I remember thinking, my friend could have explained,that entire experiment with a dance.,Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them. 
 Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.,I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.,Instead of explaining their research with words,,scientists have to explain it with dance.,Now surprisingly, it seems to work.,Dance really can make science easier to understand.,But don't take my word for it.,Go on the Internet and search for "Dance Your Ph.D.",There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you. 
 The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest,is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.,For example, at the University of Minnesota,,there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,,and he works with dancers to study how cells move.,They do it by changing their shape.,When a chemical signal washes up on one side,,it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,,because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.,So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.,But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside,is really more like chaos inside,,because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,,and those fibers are constantly falling apart.,But just as quickly as they explode,,more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,,so it's constantly changing,just to remain exactly the same.,Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,,but before he does that, he works with dancers,to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.,It's basically efficient brainstorming,,and when I visited David to learn about his research,,he used dancers to explain it to me,rather than the usual method: PowerPoint. 
 And this brings me to my modest proposal.,I think that bad PowerPoint presentations,are a serious threat to the global economy. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,,but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.,Now that assumes half-hour presentations,for an average audience of four people,with salaries of 35,000 dollars,,and it conservatively assumes that,about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,,and given that there are some apparently,30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,,that would indeed add up to an annual waste,of 100 billion dollars.,Of course, that's just the time we're losing,sitting through presentations.,There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,,and like any tool, it can and will be abused.,To borrow a concept from my country's CIA,,it helps you to soften up your audience.,It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.,It allows you to create the illusion of competence,,the illusion of simplicity,,and most destructively, the illusion of understanding. 
 So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.,Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.,One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.,For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,,with its $150 million budget,,slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt,by about one one-thousandth of a percent.,One certainly can't argue with those numbers.,However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,,there will be some drawbacks.,The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.,Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,,and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.,All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place. 
 I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,,which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.,Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,,let's put them back to work,by using them instead of PowerPoint.,As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.,After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,,prone to injury and very slow to heal,due to our health care system.,Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,,we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.,Imagine our politicians using dance,to explain why we must invade a foreign country,or bail out an investment bank.,It's sure to help. 
 Of course someday, in the deep future,,a technology of persuasion,even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,,rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.,However, I trust that by that day,,we shall have passed this present financial calamity.,Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury,of just sitting in an audience,with no other purpose,than to witness the human form in motion.,(Music),(Applause)Music is the most universalnlanguage that we have,,way more so than any dialect or tongue.,You can play a melody to a child in China,and the same melodynto a child in South Africa.,And despite the huge differencesnbetween those two children,,they will still draw some of the samentruths from that melody. 
 Now, I think the reason whynmusic has this universality,,this way of speakingnto each and every one of us,,is that somehow it's capablenof holding up a mirror to us,that reveals, in some small or large way,,a little bit of who or what we are. 
 By logical extension of this,,if music is this universal force,,then surely groups of musicians --nlet's call them orchestras --,should reflect every aspectnof the community.,Logical, but not necessarily true. 
 At TEDxBrussels today, we've been lookingnforward to the future --,50 years from now.,Well, I'm going to ask younto go in the other direction for a minute,,to come back with men50 years into the past,,the early 1960s to be precise.,And if you took a looknat all the great orchestras,of the world at that time, a snapshot,,how many women do you think you would find,playing in those orchestras?,The answer: virtually none.,Well, here we are 50 years on, in 2011,,and pretty muchnevery orchestra on the planet,has a fantastic and healthy balancenbetween the sexes.,"Of course!" I hear younsay, "Totally logical." 
 But how about another aspectnof the community?,The disabled community.,Do we find them well-representednin the great orchestras of our world?,Well, I can tell you as a conductor,,I work with orchestrasnaround the world all the time,,and I can count on the fingers of one hand,the number of disablednmusicians I've encountered,in any orchestra,,anywhere.,Why is this?,You can't tell me that therenaren't millions upon millions,of prodigiously gifted musiciansnof disability around the world.,Where is their platform?,Where is the infrastructurenthat creates a space for them,so that they can collaboratenwith other great musicians? 
 So, ladies and gentlemen,nas you can probably tell,,I'm on a bit of a mission.,And this mission hasna personal root to it.,I have four children, the youngest of whomnwas born with cerebral palsy.,She's now five, and throughnher glorious existence,,I suppose I have now becomena fully paid-up member,of the amazing, dizzyingly wonderfulndisabled community.,And I find myself lookingnat the Paralympics,and thinking whatnan incredible model that is.,It's taken a good five decades, actually,,but I can say with hand on heart,that when the Paralympicsncomes to London next year,,there will not be an intelligentnperson anywhere on the planet,who does not absolutely believenin the validity of disabled sportspeople.,What an amazing position to be in! 
 So, ladies and gentlemen,nwhere the hell is music in all this?,Apologies to any of younwho are sports fans,,but music is far morenuniversal than sport.,Where is the platform?nWhere is their voice?,So, we in the UK are at the very earlynstages in forming what will be,Britain's first-evernnational disabled orchestra.,We are going to call itnthe British Paraorchestra,,because with the world's eyesnon London next year,and particularly on the Paralympics,,we want to throw down the gauntlet,to every single other countrynthat is represented there,,to say to them, "Here's our paraorchestra.,Where's yours?",Every country should havena multiplicity of paraorchestras,of all shapes and sizes,,no question. 
 Now, today is a very special day for me,,because it is the first timenthat the first four members,of my little embryonic paraorchestra,are going to play in public;,four extraordinary musiciansnof which the number will grow and grow.,I hope in the end the Paraorchestrancould even be as big as 50 musicians.,We present to you todayna little sonic adventure,,a little piece of improvisationalnwhimsy, if you like,,a piece on which, of course,nthe ink is still wet,,the clay is still wet.,After all, improvisationnis never a fixed thing.,We decided what we wantednto share with you,,at the heart of our improvisation,,was a tune which is belovednof British people.,It's one of the only folk melodies,that we still recognize in our culture.,And here's an interesting thing:nfolk music can tell you an awful lot,about the cultural DNA of the countrynfrom which it originates.,You see, we in Britainnare quietly melancholic.,You know, the rain ... it does rain.,The food's not so good. 
 (Laughter) 
 Quietly melancholic.,Not blackly so, just quietly so.,And as Shakespeare put it sonbrilliantly in "Twelfth Night,",he loves music that has "a dying fall." 
 So this melody, "Greensleeves,"nis chock-full of "dying fall.",You may know this tune. 
 (Singing) Da, da, da da da da, dying fall. 
 (Laughter) 
 Da da da, da da da da, dying fall. 
 Da dee, da da na na ... dying fall ...nna na nee, na ah ah ah ah. 
 Brief burst of sunshine, ladiesnand gentlemen, the chorus -- 
 (Singing) Ya da da da, dying fall ... 
 (Laughter) 
 (Singing) Da da dee,nda da da da, dying fall ... 
 Ya da da da, dying fall ... 
 OK?,It's like we need some melodic Viagranin our culture, ladies and gentlemen. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 It goes without saying,that we are very muchnat the starting gates with this project.,We need your help, we neednthe global community,to help us deliver this dream,,so that this orchestrancan be full steam ahead,by summer 2012.,If you think there's any way nthat you can help us,,please, please, get in touch. 
 And so, ladies and gentlemen, it givesnme enormous pride, pleasure and joy,to introduce to you,nwith a short improvisation,upon that most melancholicntune, "Greensleeves,",the first four membersnof the British Paraorchestra. 
 (Applause) (Cheers) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 (Cheers) (Applause)Good afternoon, I'm proudnto be here at TEDxKrakow.,I'll try to speak a little bit todaynabout a phenomenon,which can, and actually isnchanging the world,,and whose name is people power.,I'll start with an anecdote,,or for those of younwho are Monty Python lovers,,a Monty Python type of sketch.,Here it is. 
 It is December 15, 2010.,Somebody gives you a bet:nyou will look at a crystal ball,,and you will see the future;nthe future will be accurate.,But you need to share it with the world.,OK, curiosity killed the cat,nyou take the bet,,you look at the crystal ball.,One hour later, you're sittingnin a building of the national TV,,in a top show, and you tell the story.,Before the end of 2011,,Ben Ali, and Mubarak,nand Gaddafi would be down,,and prosecuted.,Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria,would be either challenged,nor already on their knees.,Osama bin Laden would be dead,,and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague. 
 Now, the anchor watches younwith a strange gaze on his face.,And then, on top of it you add:,"And thousands of young peoplenfrom Athens, Madrid and New York,will demonstrate for social justice,nclaiming they are inspired by Arabs." 
 Next thing you know,ntwo guys in white appear,,they give you the strange t-shirt,,take you to the nearestnmental institution.,So I would like to speak a little bit,about the phenomenon which is behindnwhat already seems to be,a very bad year for bad guys.,And this phenomenonnis called people power. 
 Well, people powernhas been there for a while.,It helped Gandhi kicknthe Brits from India,,it helped Martin Luther Kingnwin his historic racial struggle.,It helped a local, Lech Walesa,,to kick out one millionnSoviet troops from Poland,,and in beginning the endnof the Soviet Union as we know it. 
 So what's new in it?,What seems to be very new,,which is the idea I would likento share with you today,,is that there is a set of rules and skills,which can be learned and taught,in order to performnsuccessful nonviolent struggle.,If this is true, we can helpnthese movements. 
 Well, the first one - analytic skills.,I'll try where it all startednin the Middle East.,And for so many years,,we were living with a completely wrongnperception of the Middle East.,It was looking like the frozen region.,Literally a refrigerator.,And there were onlyntwo types of meal there.,Steak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Alintype of military police dictatorship,,or a potato, which stands forna Tehran type of theocracies.,And everybody was amazednwhen the refrigerator opened,,and millions of young,nmainly secular people,stepped out to do the change.,Guess what - they didn't watchnthe demographics.,What is the average agenof an Egyptian? 24.,How long was Mubarak in power? 31.,So, this system was justnobsolete, they expired.,And young people of the Arab worldnhave awakened one morning,,and understood that powernlies in their hands.,The rest is the year in front of us.,And guess what? The same Generation Y,,with their rules, with their tools,nwith their games,,and with their language,nwhich sounds a little bit strange to me.,I'm 38 now.,And can you look at the agenof the people on the streets of Europe?,It seems that Generation Y is coming. 
 Now, let me set another example.,I'm meeting different peoplenthroughout the world,,and they are, you know, academics,nand professors, and doctors,,and they will always talk conditions.,They will say: "People power will worknonly if the regime is not too oppressive.",They will say: "People power will work,,if the annual income of the countrynis between X and Z.",They will say: "People power will worknonly if there is a foreign pressure.",They will say: "People powernwill work only if there is no oil.",And, I mean, there is a set of conditions.,Well, the news herenis that your skills during the conflict,seem to be more importantnthan the conditions.,Namely, the skills of unity, planning,nand maintaining nonviolent discipline. 
 Let me give you an example.,I come from a country called Serbia.,It took us 10 years to uniten18 opposition party leaders,,with their big egos,nbehind one single candidate,against the Balkan dictatornSlobodan Milosevic.,Guess what? That wasnthe day of his defeat.,You look at the Egyptians,nthey fight on Tahrir Square,,they get rid of their individual symbols,,they appear on the streetnonly with the flag of Egypt.,I will give you a counter-example.,You see nine presidential candidatesnrunning against Lukashenko,,you all know the outcome.,So unity is a big thing.,And this can be achieved.,Same with planning.,Somebody has lied to you,about the successful and spontaneousnnonviolent revolution.,That thing doesn't exist in the world.,Whenever you see young peoplenin front of the row,trying to fraternizenwith the police or military,,somebody was thinking about it before. 
 Now, at the end, nonviolent discipline.,And this is probably the game-changer.,If you maintain nonviolent discipline,,you'll exclusively win.,You have 100,000 peoplenin a nonviolent march,,one idiot or agent-provocateurnthrowing a stone.,Guess what takes all the cameras.,That one guy.,One single act of violencencan literally destroy your movement. 
 Now, let me move to another place.,It's the selectionnof strategies and tactics.,There are certain rulesnin nonviolent struggle you may follow.,First, you start small.,Second, you pick the battles you can win.,It's only 200 of us in this room.,We won't call for the march of a million.,But what if we organized the sprayingnof graffiti throughout the night,,all over Krakow.,The city will know.,So, we pick tacticsnaccommodated to the event,,especially this thing we callnthe small tactics of dispersion.,They're very useful in violent oppression.,We are actually witnessing the picturenof one of the best tactics ever used.,It was on Tahrir square,,where the international communitynwas constantly frightened,that, you know, the Islamistsnwill overtake the revolution.,What they organized --,Christians protecting Muslimsnwhere they are praying,,a Coptic wedding cheerednby thousands of Muslims,,the world has just changed the picture,,but somebody was thinkingnabout this previously.,So there are so many things you can do,instead of getting into one place,,shouting, and you know, showing offnin front of the security forces. 
 Now, there is also anothernvery important dynamic.,And this is a dynamicnthat analysts normally don't see.,This is the dynamic betweennfear and apathy on the one side,,and enthusiasm and humor on another side.,So, it works like in a video game.,You have the fear high,nyou have status quo.,You have the enthusiasm higher,,you see the fear is starting to melt.,Day two, you see peoplenrunning towards the police,instead of from the police, in Egypt.,You can tell that somethingnis happening there. 
 And then, it's about the humor.,Humor is such a powerful game-changer,,and of course, it was very big in Poland.,You know, we were just a small groupnof crazy students in Serbia,when we made this big skit.,We put the big petrol barrel,with a portrait of Mr. President on it,nin the middle of the Main Street.,There was a hole in the top.,So you could literally come,nput a coin in,,get a baseball bat, and hit his face.,Sounds loud.,And within minutes,,we were sitting in a nearby cafénhaving coffee,,and there was a queue of peoplenwaiting to do this lovely thing.,Well, that's justnthe beginning of the show.,The real show startsnwhen the police appears. 
 (Laughter) 
 "What will they do?",Arrest us? We were nowhere to be seen.,We were like three blocks away,nobserving it from our espresso bar.,Arrest the shoppers, with kids?,Doesn't make sense.,Of course, you could bet,nthey did the most stupid thing.,They arrested the barrel.,And now, the picturenof the smashed face on the barrel,,with the policemenndragging it to the police car,,that was the best daynfor newspaper photographers,that they will ever have. 
 So, I mean, these arenthe things you can do.,And you can always use humor.,There is also one big thing about humor,,it really hurts.,Because these guys really arentaking themselves too seriously.,When you start to mock them, it hurts. 
 Now, everybody is talkingnabout His Majesty, the Internet,,and it is also a very useful skill.,But don't rush to label thingsnlike "a Facebook Revolution,","Twitter Revolution.",Don't mix the toolsnwith the substance.,It is true that the Internetnand the new media are very useful,in making things faster and cheaper.,They also make it a bit safernfor the participants,,because they give partial anonymity. 
 We're watching the great examplenof something else the Internet can do.,It can put the price tagnof state-sponsored violence,over a nonviolent protester.,This is the famous groupn"We are all Khaled Said,",made by Wael Ghonimnin Egypt, and his friend.,This is the mutilated face of the guynwho was beaten by the police.,This is how he became known to the public,,and this is what probably becamenthe straw that broke the camel's back. 
 But here is also the bad news.,The nonviolent struggle is wonnin the real world, in the streets.,You will never changenyour society towards democracy,,or, you know, the economy,nif you sit down and click.,There are risks to be taken,,and there are living peoplenwho are winning the struggle. 
 Well, the million-dollar question.,What will happen in the Arab world?,And though young peoplenfrom the Arab world,were pretty successfulnin bringing down three dictators,,shaking the region,,kind of persuading the clever kingsnfrom Jordan and Morocco,to do substantial reforms,,it is yet to be seennwhat will be the outcome.,Whether the Egyptians and Tunisiansnwill make it through the transition,,or this will end in bloodynethnic and religious conflicts,,whether the Syriansnwill maintain nonviolent discipline,,faced with a brutal daily violencenwhich kills thousands already,,or they will slip into violent struggle,and make ugly civil war.,Will these revolutions be pushednthrough the transitions and democracy,or be overtaken by the militarynor extremists of all kinds?,We cannot tell.,The same works for the Western sector,,where you can seenall these excited young people,protesting around the world,noccupying this, occupying that.,Are they going to become the world wave?,Are they going to find their skills,ntheir enthusiasm, and their strategy,to find what they really wantnand push for the reform,,or will they just stay complainingnabout the endless list,of the things they hate?,This is the differencenbetween the two paths. 
 Now, what do the statistics have?,My friend Maria Stephan's book,talks a lot about violentnand nonviolent struggle,,and there are some shocking data.,If you look at the last 35 yearsnand different social transitions,,from dictatorship to democracy,,you will see that,nout of 67 different cases,,in 50 of these casesnit was nonviolent struggle,which was the key power.,This is one more reasonnto look at this phenomenon,,this is one more reasonnto look at Generation Y.,Enough for me to give them credit,,and hope that they will find their skillsnand their courage,to use nonviolent struggle,and thus fix at least a part of the messnour generation is making in this world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As the highest military commandernof the Netherlands,,with troops stationed around the world,,I'm really honored to be here today. 
 When I look aroundnthis TEDxAmsterdam venue,,I see a very special audience.,You are the reason why I said yes,to the invitation to come here today.,When I look around, I see peoplenwho want to make a contribution.,I see people who wantnto make a better world,,by doing groundbreaking scientific work,,by creating impressive works of art,,by writing critical articlesnor inspiring books,,by starting up sustainable businesses.,And you all have chosennyour own instruments,to fulfill this missionnof creating a better world.,Some chose the microscopenas their instrument.,Others chose dancing or painting,,or making music like we just heard.,Some chose the pen.,Others work throughnthe instrument of money. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,nI made a different choice. 
 Thanks. 
 Ladies and gentlemen ... 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I share your goals.,I share the goalsnof the speakers you heard before.,I did not choose to take up the pen,,the brush,,the camera.,I chose this instrument.,I chose the gun. 
 For you, and you heard already,,being so close to this gunnmay make you feel uneasy.,It may even feel scary.,A real gun at a few feet's distance.,Let us stop for a momentnand feel this uneasiness.,You could even hear it.,Let us cherish the fact,that probably most of younhave never been close to a gun.,It means the Netherlandsnis a peaceful country.,The Netherlands is not at war.,It means soldiers are not needednto patrol our streets.,Guns are not a part of our lives.,In many countries,nit is a different story.,In many countries,npeople are confronted with guns.,They are oppressed.,They are intimidated --,by warlords,,by terrorists,,by criminals.,Weapons can do a lot of harm.,They are the cause of much distress. 
 Why then am I standing before younwith this weapon?,Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?,Today I want to tell you why.,Today I want to tell you,why I chose the gunnto create a better world.,And I want to tell younhow this gun can help. 
 My story starts in the city of Nijmegen,in the east of the Netherlands,,the city where I was born.,My father was a hardworking baker,,but when he had finishednwork in the bakery,,he often told me and my brother stories.,And most of the time,,he told me this storynI'm going to share with you now.,The story of what happened,when he was a conscripted soldiernin the Dutch armed forces,at the beginning of the Second World War.,The Nazis invaded the Netherlands.,Their grim plans were evident.,They meant to rule by means of repression.,Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.,Only brute force remained.,It was our last resort.,My father was there to provide it. 
 As the son of a farmernwho knew how to hunt,,my father was an excellent marksman.,When he aimed, he never missed.,At this decisive moment in Dutch history,my father was positionednon the bank of the river Waal,near the city of Nijmegen.,He had a clear shot at the German soldiersnwho came to occupy a free country,,his country,,our country.,He fired. Nothing happened.,He fired again.,No German soldier fell to the ground.,My father had been given an old gun,that could not even reachnthe opposite riverbank.,Hitler's troops marched on,,and there was nothingnmy father could do about it. 
 Until the day my father died,,he was frustratednabout missing these shots.,He could have done something.,But with an old gun,,not even the best marksmannin the armed forces,could have hit the mark.,So this story stayed with me. 
 Then in high school,,I was gripped by the storiesnof the Allied soldiers --,soldiers who left the safetynof their own homes and risked their lives,to liberate a country,and a people that they didn't know.,They liberated my birth town.,It was then that I decidednI would take up the gun --,out of respect and gratitudenfor those men and women,who came to liberate us.,From the awarenessnthat sometimes only the gun,can stand between good and evil. 
 And that is why I took up the gun --,not to shoot,,not to kill,,not to destroy,,but to stop those who would do evil,,to protect the vulnerable,,to defend democratic values,,to stand up for the freedom we havento talk here today in Amsterdam,about how we cannmake the world a better place. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,I do not stand here todaynto tell you about the glory of weapons.,I do not like guns.,And once you have beennunder fire yourself,,it brings home even more clearly,that a gun is notnsome macho instrument to brag about.,I stand here today,to tell you about the use of the gunnas an instrument of peace and stability.,The gun may be one of the most importantninstruments of peace and stability,that we have in this world. 
 Now this may sound contradictory to you.,But not only have I seen with my own eyes,during my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo,and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence,,this is also supportednby cold, hard statistics.,Violence has declined dramaticallynover the last 500 years.,Despite the picturesnwe are shown daily in the news,,wars between developed countriesnare no longer commonplace.,The murder rate in Europe,has dropped by a factor of 30nsince the Middle Ages.,And occurrencesnof civil war and repression,have declined since the endnof the Cold War.,Statistics show that we are livingnin a relatively peaceful era. 
 Why?,Why has violence decreased?,Has the human mind changed?,Well, we were talkingnabout the human mind this morning.,Did we simply losenour beastly impulses for revenge,,for violent rituals,,for pure rage?,Or is there something else?,In his latest book,nHarvard professor Steven Pinker --,and many other thinkers before him --,concludes that one of the main drivers,behind less violent societies,is the spread of the constitutional state,and the introduction, on a large scale,,of the state monopolynon the legitimized use of violence --,legitimized by a democraticallynelected government,,legitimized by checks and balancesnand an independent judicial system.,In other words, a state monopoly,that has the use of violencenwell under control. 
 Such a state monopoly on violence,nfirst of all, serves as a reassurance.,It removes the incentive for an arms race,between potentially hostile groupsnin our societies.,Secondly, the presence of penalties,that outweigh the benefitsnof using violence,tips the balance even further.,Abstaining from violence,becomes more profitablenthan starting a war.,Now nonviolence starts to worknlike a flywheel.,It enhances peace even further.,Where there is no conflict,ntrade flourishes.,And trade is another importantnincentive against violence.,With trade, there's mutual interdependencynand mutual gain between parties.,And when there is mutual gain,nboth sides stand to lose more,than they would gainnif they started a war.,War is simply no longer the best option,,and that is why violence has decreased. 
 This, ladies and gentlemen,,is the rationale behind the existencenof my armed forces.,The armed forces implementnthe state monopoly on violence.,We do this in a legitimized way,only after our democracynhas asked us to do so.,It is this legitimate,ncontrolled use of the gun,that has contributed greatly,to reducing the statistics of war,nconflict and violence around the globe.,It is this participationnin peacekeeping missions,that has led to the resolutionnof many civil wars.,My soldiers use the gunnas an instrument of peace. 
 And this is exactlynwhy failed states are so dangerous.,Failed states have no legitimized,ndemocratically controlled use of force.,Failed states do not know of the gunnas an instrument of peace and stability.,That is why failed states can drag downna whole region into chaos and conflict.,That is why spreading the conceptnof the constitutional state,is such an important aspectnof our foreign missions.,That is why we are tryingnto build a judicial system,right now in Afghanistan.,That is why we trainnpolice officers, we train judges,,we train public prosecutorsnaround the world.,And that is why --,and in the Netherlands,nwe are very unique in that --,that is why the Dutch constitution states,that one of the main tasksnof the armed forces,is to uphold and promotenthe international rule of law. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,looking at this gun, we are confrontednwith the ugly side of the human mind.,Every day I hope that politicians,ndiplomats, development workers,can turn conflict into peace,and threat,into hope.,And I hope that one daynarmies can be disbanded,and humans will find a waynof living together,without violence and oppression.,But until that day comes,,we will have to make idealsnand human failure,meet somewhere in the middle.,Until that day comes,nI stand for my father,who tried to shoot the Nazisnwith an old gun.,I stand for my men and womennwho are prepared to risk their lives,for a less violent world for all of us.,I stand for this soldiernwho suffered partial hearing loss,and sustained permanentninjuries to her leg,,when she was hit by a rocketnon a mission in Afghanistan. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,until the day comesnwhen we can do away with the gun,,I hope we all agree,that peace and stabilityndo not come free of charge.,It takes hard work,noften behind the scenes.,It takes good equipmentnand well-trained, dedicated soldiers.,I hope you will supportnthe efforts of our armed forces,to train soldiers like this young captain,and provide her with a good gun,,instead of the bad gunnmy father was given.,I hope you will support our soldiersnwhen they are out there,,when they come home,and when they are injurednand need our care.,They put their lives on the line,nfor us, for you,,and we cannot let them down. 
 I hope you will respect my soldiers,,this soldier with this gun.,Because she wants a better world.,Because she makes an activencontribution to a better world,,just like all of us here today. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.,I work for the Red Cross,and I'm a physical therapist.,My job is to make arms and legs --,well it's not completely true.,We do more than that.,We provide the patients,,the Afghan disabled,,first with the physical rehabilitation,then with the social reintegration.,It's a very logical plan,,but it was not always like this.,For many years, we were just providing them,with artificial limbs.,It took quite many years,for the program to become what it is now. 
 Today, I would like to tell you a story,,the story of a big change,,and the story of the people,who made this change possible.,I arrived in Afghanistan,in 1990,to work in a hospital,for war victims.,And then, not only for war victims,,but it was for any kind of patient.,I was also working,in the orthopedic center, we call it.,This is the place where we make the legs.,At that time,I found myself,in a strange situation.,I felt not quite ready,for that job.,There was so much to learn.,There were so many things new to me.,But it was a terrific job.,But as soon as the fighting intensified,,the physical rehabilitation was suspended.,There were many other things to do.,So the orthopedic center was closed,because physical rehabilitation,was not considered a priority.,It was a strange sensation.,Anyway, you know every time I make this speech --,it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion.,It's something that comes out from the past.,It's 21 years,,but they are still all there. 
 Anyway, in 1992,,the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan.,And the orthopedic center was closed.,I was assigned to work for the homeless,,for the internally displaced people.,But one day, something happened.,I was coming back,from a big food distribution in a mosque,where tens and tens of people,were squatting in terrible conditions.,I wanted to go home. I was driving.,You know, when you want to forget,,you don't want to see things,,so you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside,and say, "That's enough.",A bomb fell not far from my car --,well, far enough, but big noise.,And everybody disappeared from the street.,The cars disappeared as well.,I ducked.,And only one figure,remained in the middle of the road.,It was a man in a wheelchair,desperately trying to move away. 
 Well I'm not a particularly brave person,,I have to confess it,,but I could not just ignore him.,So I stopped the car,and I went to help.,The man was without legs,and only with one arm.,Behind him there was a child, his son,,red in the face,in an effort to push the father.,So I took him into a safe place.,And I ask, "What are you doing out in the street,in this situation?","I work," he said.,I wondered, what work?,And then I ask an even more stupid question:,"Why don't you have the prostheses?,Why don't you have the artificial legs?",And he said, "The Red Cross has closed.",Well without thinking, I told him,"Come tomorrow.,We will provide you with a pair of legs.",The man, his name was Mahmoud,,and the child, whose name was Rafi, left.,And then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?,The center is closed,,no staff around.,Maybe the machinery is broken.,Who is going to make the legs for him?",So I hoped that he would not come.,This is the streets of Kabul,in those days.,So I said, "Well I will give him some money." 
 And so the following day,,I went to the orthopedic center.,And I spoke with a gatekeeper.,I was ready to tell him,,"Listen, if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow,,please tell him that it was a mistake.,Nothing can be done.,Give him some money.",But Mahmoud and his son were already there.,And they were not alone.,There were 15, maybe 20, people like him waiting.,And there was some staff too.,Among them there was my right-hand man,,Najmuddin.,And the gatekeeper told me,,"They come everyday to see if the center will open.",I said, "No.,We have to go away. We cannot stay here.",They were bombing -- not very close -- but you could hear the noise of the bombs.,So, "We cannot stay here, it's dangerous.,It's not a priority.",But Najmuddin told me, "Listen now, we're here.",At least we can start repairing the prostheses, the broken prostheses of the people,and maybe try to do something,for people like Mahmoud.",I said, "No, please. We cannot do that.,It's really dangerous.,We have other things to do.",But they insisted.,When you have 20 people,in front of you, looking at you,and you are the one who has to decide ... 
 So we started doing some repairs.,Also one of the physical therapists,reported that Mahmoud,could be provided with a leg,,but not immediately.,The legs were swollen,and the knees were stiff,,so he needed a long preparation.,Believe me, I was worried,because I was breaking the rules.,I was doing something,that I was not supposed to do.,In the evening,,I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters,,and I told them -- I lied --,I told them, "Listen, we are going to start,a couple of hours per day,,just a few repairs.",Maybe some of them are here now. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we started.,I was working, I was going everyday,to work for the homeless.,And Najmuddin was staying there,,doing everything and reporting on the patients.,He was telling me, "Patients are coming.",We knew that many more patients,could not come, prevented by the fighting.,But people were coming.,And Mahmoud was coming every day.,And slowly, slowly,week after week,his legs were improving.,The stump or cast prosthesis was made,,and he was starting,the real physical rehabilitation.,He was coming every day,,crossing the front line.,A couple of times I crossed the front line,in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing.,I tell you, it was something so sinister,that I was astonished he could do it every day. 
 But finally, the great day arrived.,Mahmoud was going to be discharged,with his new legs.,It was April, I remember,,a very beautiful day.,April in Kabul is beautiful,,full of roses, full of flowers.,We could not possibly stay indoors,,with all these sandbags at the windows.,Very sad, dark.,So we chose a small spot in the garden.,And Mahmoud put on his prostheses,,the other patients did the same,,and they started practicing,for the last time before being discharged. 
 Suddenly, they started fighting.,Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting.,We could hear in the air,the bullets passing.,So we dashed, all of us,,towards the shelter.,Mahmoud grabbed his son, I grabbed someone else.,Everybody was grabbing something.,And we ran.,You know, 50 meters can be a long distance,if you are totally exposed,,but we managed to reach the shelter.,Inside, all of us panting,,I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father,,"Father, you can run faster than me.",(Laughter),And Mahmoud, "Of course I can.,I can run, and now you can go to school.,No need of staying with me all the day,pushing my wheelchair.",Later on, we took them home.,And I will never forget,Mahmoud and his son walking together,pushing the empty wheelchair.,And then I understood,,physical rehabilitation is a priority.,Dignity cannot wait for better times. 
 From that day on, we never closed a single day.,Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours,,but we never, we never closed it again.,I met Mahmoud one year later.,He was in good shape --,a bit thinner.,He needed to change his prostheses --,a new pair of prostheses.,I asked about his son.,He told me, "He's at school. He'd doing quite well.",But I understood he wanted to tell me something.,So I asked him, "What is that?",He was sweating.,He was clearly embarrassed.,And he was standing in front of me,,his head down.,He said, "You have taught me to walk.,Thank you very much.,Now help me not to be a beggar anymore.",That was the job.,"My children are growing.,I feel ashamed.,I don't want them to be teased at school,by the other students.",I said, "Okay.",I thought, how much money do I have in my pocket?,Just to give him some money.,It was the easiest way.,He read my mind,,and he said, "I ask for a job.",And then he added something,I will never forget for the rest of my life.,He said, "I am a scrap of a man,,but if you help me,,I'm ready to do anything,,even if I have to crawl on the ground.",And then he sat down.,I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere. 
 Legless, with only one arm,,illiterate,,unskilled --,what job for him?,Najmuddin told me, "Well we have a vacancy,in the carpentry shop.","What?" I said, "Stop.","Well yes, we need to increase the production of feet.,We need to employ someone,to glue and to screw the sole of the feet.,We need to increase the production.","Excuse me?",I could not believe.,And then he said,,"No, we can modify the workbench,maybe to put a special stool,,a special anvil, special vice,,and maybe an electric screwdriver.",I said, "Listen, it's insane.,And it's even cruel to think of anything like this.,That's a production line and a very fast one.,It's cruel,to offer him a job,knowing that he's going to fail.",But with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss.,So the only things I could manage to obtain,was a kind of a compromise.,Only one week --,one week try and not a single day more.,One week later,,Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line.,I told Najmuddin, "That's a trick.,I can't believe it.",The production was up 20 percent.,"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.,And then I asked for verification.,It was true. 
 The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove.,I understood,that I was wrong again.,Mahmoud had looked taller.,I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.,He was a new man,,taller again.,Of course, I understood,that what made him stand tall --,yeah they were the legs, thank you very much --,but as a first step,,it was the dignity.,He has regained his full dignity,thanks to that job.,So of course, I understood.,And then we started a new policy --,a new policy completely different.,We decided to employ,as many disabled as possible,to train them in any possible job.,It became a policy of "positive discrimination,",we call it now. 
 And you know what?,It's good for everybody.,Everybody benefits from that --,those employed, of course,,because they get a job,and dignity.,But also for the newcomers.,They are 7,000 every year --,people coming for the first time.,And you should see the faces of these people,when they realize that those assisting them are like them.,Sometimes you see them,,they look, "Oh.",And you see the faces.,And then the surprise turns into hope.,And it's easy for me as well to train someone,who has already passed through the experience of disability.,Poof, they learn much faster -- the motivation,,the empathy they can establish with the patient,is completely different, completely.,Scraps of men do not exist. 
 People like Mahmoud,are agents of change.,And when you start changing, you cannot stop.,So employing people, yes,,but also we started programming projects,of microfinance, education.,And when you start, you cannot stop.,So you do vocational training,,home education for those who cannot go to school.,Physical therapies can be done, not only in the orthopedic center,,but also in the houses of the people.,There is always a better way to do things.,That's Najmuddin, the one with the white coat.,Terrible Najmuddin, is that one.,I have learned a lot,from people like Najmuddin, Mahmoud, Rafi.,They are my teachers. 
 I have a wish, a big wish,,that this way of working, this way of thinking,,is going to be implemented in other countries.,There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.,It is possible and it is not difficult.,All we have to do,is to listen to the people,that we are supposed assist,,to make them part,of the decision-making process,and then, of course, to adapt.,This is my big wish. 
 Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over;,not at all. We are going on.,Recently we have just started a program,,a sport program --,basketball for wheelchair users.,We transport the wheelchairs everywhere.,We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan.,At the beginning,,when Anajulina told me,,"We would like to start it,",I hesitated.,I said, "No," you can imagine.,I said, "No, no, no, no, we can't.",And then I asked the usual question:,"Is it a priority?,Is it really necessary?",Well now you should see me.,I never miss a single training session.,The night before a match I'm very nervous.,And you should see me during the match.,I shout like a true Italian. 
 (Laughter) 
 What's next? What is going to be the next change?,Well I don't know yet,,but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends,,they have it already in mind. 
 That was my story. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The humanitarian model has barely changed,since the early 20th century.,Its origins are firmly rooted,in the analog age.,And there is a major shift coming on the horizon.,The catalyst for this change,was the major earthquake that struck Haiti,on the 12th of January in 2010.,Haiti was a game changer.,The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince,,claiming the lives of some 320,000 people,,rendering homeless,about 1.2 million people.,Government institutions were completely decapitated,,including the presidential palace.,I remember standing,on the roof of the Ministry of Justice,in downtown Port-au-Prince.,It was about two meters high,,completely squashed,by the violence of the earthquake. 
 For those of us on the ground in those early days,,it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans,that Haiti was something different.,Haiti was something we hadn't seen before.,But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented.,Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future,of what disaster response might look like,in a hyper-connected world,where people have access,to mobile smart devices. 
 Because out of the urban devastation,in Port-au-Prince,came a torrent of SMS texts --,people crying for help,,beseeching us for assistance,,sharing data, offering support,,looking for their loved ones.,This was a situation,that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.,We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet,,but 80 percent of the people,had mobile devices in their hands.,And we were unprepared for this,,and they were shaping the aid effort. 
 Outside Haiti also, things were looking different.,Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers,were scouring the Internet,,converting tweets,that had already been converted from texts,and putting these into open-source maps,,layering them with all sorts of important information --,people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map --,and putting these on the Web for everybody --,the media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves --,to participate in and to use. 
 Back in Haiti,,people were increasingly turning,to the medium of SMS.,People that were hungry and hurting,were signaling their distress,,were signaling their need for help.,On street sides all over Port-au-Prince,,entrepreneurs sprung up,offering mobile phone charging stations.,They understood more than we did,people's innate need,to be connected. 
 Never having been confronted,with this type of situation before,,we wanted to try and understand,how we could tap into this incredible resource,,how we could really leverage,this incredible use of mobile technology,and SMS technology.,We started talking with a local telecom provider called Voilà,,which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International.,We had basically three requirements.,We wanted to communicate,in a two-way form of communication.,We didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well.,We wanted to be able to target,specific geographic communities.,We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.,And we wanted it to be easy to use. 
 Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation,came something that we call TERA --,the Trilogy Emergency Response Application --,which has been used to support the aid effort,ever since.,It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.,It has been used to signal early warning,in advance of weather-related disasters.,It's used for public health awareness campaigns,such as the prevention of cholera.,And it is even used for sensitive issues,such as building awareness,around gender-based violence. 
 But does it work?,We have just published,an evaluation of this program,,and the evidence that is there for all to see,is quite remarkable.,Some 74 percent of people,received the data.,Those who were intended to receive the data,,74 percent of them received it.,96 percent of them,found it useful.,83 percent of them took action --,evidence that it is indeed empowering.,And 73 percent of them shared it. 
 The TERA system,was developed from Haiti,with support of engineers in the region.,It is a user-appropriate technology,that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.,Technology is transformational.,Right across the developing world,,citizens and communities,are using technology,to enable them to bring about change, positive change,,in their own communities.,The grassroots has been strengthened,through the social power of sharing,and they are challenging the old models,,the old analog models,of control and command. 
 One illustration of the transformational power of technology,is in Kibera.,Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums.,It's on the outskirts of Nairobi,,the capital city of Kenya.,It's home to an unknown number of people --,some say between 250,000,and 1.2 million.,If you were to arrive in Nairobi today,and pick up a tourist map,,Kibera is represented,as a lush, green national park,devoid of human settlement. 
 Young people living in Kibera,in their community,,with simple handheld devices,,GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones,,have literally put themselves on the map.,They have collated crowd-sourced data,and rendered the invisible visible.,People like Josh and Steve,are continuing to layer information upon information,,real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps,for all to use.,You can find out about the latest impromptu music session.,You can find out about the latest security incident.,You can find out about places of worship.,You can find out about the health centers.,You can feel the dynamism,of this living, breathing community.,They also have their own news network on YouTube,with 36,000 viewers at the moment. 
 They're showing us what can be done,with mobile, digital technologies.,They're showing that the magic of technology,can bring the invisible visible.,And they are giving a voice to themselves.,They are telling their own story,,bypassing the official narrative. 
 And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.,In Mongolia for instance,,where 30 percent of the people are nomadic,,SMS information systems are being used,to track migration and weather patterns.,SMS is even used,to hold herder summits,from remote participation.,And if people are migrating,into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments,,they can also be helped in anticipation,with social supporters ready and waiting for them,based on SMS knowledge.,In Nigeria,,open-source SMS tools,are being used by the Red Cross community workers,to gather information from the local community,in an attempt to better understand and mitigate,the prevalence of malaria.,My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program,,tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper,than the traditional way of doing things. 
 And not only is it empowering to the communities,,but really importantly,,this information stays in the community,where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.,We are on a planet,of seven billion people,,five billion mobile subscriptions.,By 2015,,there will be three billion smartphones in the world.,The U.N. broadband commission,has recently set targets,to help broadband access,in 50 percent of the Developing World,,compared to 20 percent today.,We are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world,where citizens from all cultures and all social strata,will have access to smart, fast mobile devices. 
 People are understanding,,from Cairo to Oakland,,that there are new ways to come together,,there are new ways to mobilize,,there are new ways to influence.,A transformation is coming which needs to be understood,by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models.,The collective voices of people,needs to be more integrated through new technologies,into the organizational strategies and plans of actions,and not just recycled,for fundraising or marketing.,We need to, for example, embrace,the big data,,the knowledge that is there from market leaders,who understand what it means,to use and leverage big data. 
 One idea that I'd like you to consider, for instance,,is to take a look at our IT departments.,They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers,,but they need to be elevated to software strategists.,We need people in our organizations,who know what it's like to work with big data.,We need technology,as a core organizational principle.,We need technological strategists in the boardroom,who can ask and answer the question,,"What would Amazon or Google,do with all of this data?",and convert it to humanitarian good. 
 The possibilities,that new digital technologies are bringing,can help humanitarian organizations,,not only ensure,that people's right to information is met,,or that they have their right to communicate,,but I think in the future,,humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate,the right for people to access,critical communication technologies,in order to ensure,that their voices are heard,,that they're truly participating,,that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world.,It has always been the elusive ideal,to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters,in the humanitarian effort.,We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.,There are no more reasons not to do it.,I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world,from analog to digital. 
 Thank you very much.

 Thank you. 
 (Applause)One out of two of you women,will be impacted by cardiovascular disease,in your lifetime.,So this is the leading killer of women.,It's a closely held secret,for reasons I don't know.,In addition to making this personal --,so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart,and all women's relationship with their heart --,we're going to wax into the politics.,Because the personal, as you know, is political.,And not enough is being done about this.,And as we have watched women,conquer breast cancer,through the breast cancer campaign,,this is what we need to do now with heart. 
 Since 1984,,more women die in the U.S. than men.,So where we used to think of heart disease,as being a man's problem primarily --,which that was never true,,but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and '60s,,and it was in all the textbooks.,It's certainly what I learned when I was training.,If we were to remain sexist, and that was not right,,but if we were going to go forward and be sexist,,it's actually a woman's disease.,So it's a woman's disease now. 
 And one of the things that you see,is that male line,,the mortality is going down, down, down, down, down.,And you see the female line since 1984,,the gap is widening.,More and more women, two, three, four times more women,,dying of heart disease than men.,And that's too short of a time period,for all the different risk factors that we know,to change.,So what this really suggested to us,at the national level,was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,,which had been developed in men, by men, for men,for the last 50 years --,and they work pretty well in men, don't they? --,weren't working so well for women.,So that was a big wake-up call,in the 1980's. 
 Heart disease kills more women,at all ages,than breast cancer.,And the breast cancer campaign --,again, this is not a competition.,We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign.,We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign,to address this crisis.,Now sometimes when people see this,,I hear this gasp.,We can all think of someone,,often a young woman,,who has been impacted by breast cancer.,We often can't think of a young woman,who has heart disease.,I'm going to tell you why.,Heart disease kills people,,often very quickly.,So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men,,half of the time it's sudden cardiac death --,no opportunity to say good-bye,,no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy,,no opportunity to help her pick out a wig. 
 Breast cancer,,mortality is down to four percent.,And that is the 40 years,that women have advocated.,Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up,and said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor,",and it was okay to talk about it.,And then physicians have gone to bat.,We've done the research.,We have effective therapies now.,Women are living longer than ever.,That has to happen in heart disease, and it's time.,It's not happening, and it's time. 
 We owe an incredible debt of gratitude,to these two women.,As Barbara depicted,in one of her amazing movies, "Yentl,",she portrayed a young woman,who wanted an education.,And she wanted to study the Talmud.,And so how did she get educated then?,She had to impersonate a man.,She had to look like a man.,She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man,and she could have the same rights,that the men had.,Bernadine Healy, Dr. Healy,,was a cardiologist.,And right around that time, in the 1980's,,that we saw women and heart disease deaths,going up, up, up, up, up,,she wrote an editorial,in the New England Journal of Medicine,and said, the Yentl syndrome.,Women are dying of heart disease,,two, three, four times more than men.,Mortality is not going down, it's going up.,And she questioned,,she hypothesized,,is this a Yentl syndrome? 
 And here's what the story is.,Is it because women don't look like men,,they don't look like that male-pattern heart disease,that we've spent the last 50 years understanding,and getting really good diagnostics,and really good therapeutics,,and therefore, they're not recognized for their heart disease.,And they're just passed.,They don't get treated, they don't get detected,,they don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines. 
 Doctor Healy then subsequently became,the first female director,of our National Institutes of Health.,And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research,in the world.,And it funds a lot of my research.,It funds research all over the place.,It was a very big deal,for her to become director.,And she started,,in the face of a lot of controversy,,the Women's Health Initiative.,And every woman in the room here,has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative.,It told us about hormone replacement therapy.,It's informed us about osteoporosis.,It informed us about breast cancer, colon cancer in women.,So a tremendous fund of knowledge,despite, again,,that so many people told her not to do it,,it was too expensive.,And the under-reading was women aren't worth it.,She was like, "Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it." 
 Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative,that went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,,which is the cardiology part of the NIH.,And we got to do the WISE study --,and the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation --,and I have chaired this study for the last 15 years.,It was a study to specifically ask,,what's going on with women?,Why are more and more women dying,of ischemic heart disease?,So in the WISE, 15 years ago,,we started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations,and we should probably follow up on that.",And our colleagues in Washington, D.C.,had recently published,that when women have heart attacks and die,,compared to men who have heart attacks and die --,and again, this is millions of people,,happening every day --,women, in their fatty plaque --,and this is their coronary artery,,so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle --,women erode,,men explode.,You're going to find some interesting analogies,in this physiology. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'll describe the male-pattern heart attack first.,Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.,Horrible chest pain.,EKG goes pbbrrhh,,so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG.,There's a big clot in the middle of the artery.,And they go up to the cath lab,and boom, boom, boom get rid of the clot.,That's a man heart attack.,Some women have those heart attacks,,but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack,,where it erodes,,doesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle,,EKG findings are different --,female-pattern.,So what do you think happens to these gals?,They're often not recognized, sent home.,I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas. 
 So we picked up on that,and we said, "You know, we now have the ability,to look inside human beings,with these special catheters called IVUS:,intravascular ultrasound.",And we said, "We're going to hypothesize,that the fatty plaque in women,is actually probably different,,and deposited differently, than men.",And because of the common knowledge,of how women and men get fat.,When we watch people become obese,,where do men get fat?,Right here, it's just a focal -- right there.,Where do women get fat?,All over.,Cellulite here, cellulite here.,So we said, "Look, women look like they're pretty good,about putting kind of the garbage away,,smoothly putting it away.,Men just have to dump it in a single area.",So we said, "Let's look at these." 
 And so the yellow is the fatty plaque,,and panel A is a man.,And you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.,He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.,Panel B is the woman, very smooth.,She's just laid it down nice and tidy.,(Laughter),And if you did that angiogram,,which is the red,,you can see the man's disease.,So 50 years,of honing and crafting these angiograms,,we easily recognize,male-pattern disease.,Kind of hard to see that female-pattern disease.,So that was a discovery.,Now what are the implications of that?,Well once again, women get the angiogram,and nobody can tell that they have a problem. 
 So we are working now on a non-invasive --,again, these are all invasive studies.,Ideally you would love to do all this non-invasively.,And again, 50 years,of good non-invasive stress testing,,we're pretty good at recognizing male-pattern disease,with stress tests.,So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.,We're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute,in the Women's Heart Center.,We selected this for the research.,This is not in your community hospital,,but we would hope to translate this.,And we're about two and a half years,into a five-year study. 
 This was the only modality,that can see the inner lining of the heart.,And if you look carefully, you can see,that there's a black blush right there.,And that is microvascular obstruction.,The syndrome, the female-pattern,now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction, or obstruction.,The second reason we really liked MRI,is that there's no radiation.,So unlike the CAT scans, X-rays, thalliums,,for women,whose breast is in the way,of looking at the heart,,every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation,,we say, "Do we really need that test?",So we're very excited about M.R.,You can't go and order it yet,,but this is an area of active inquiry,where actually studying women,is going to advance the field for women and men. 
 What are the downstream consequences,then, when female-pattern heart disease,is not recognized?,This is a figure,from an editorial that I published,in the European Heart Journal this last summer.,And it was just a pictogram,to sort of show,why more women are dying of heart disease,,despite these good treatments,that we know and we have work.,And when the woman,has male-pattern disease --,so she looks like Barbara in the movie --,they get treated.,And when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman,,as Barbara does here with her husband,,they don't get the treatment.,These are our life-saving treatments.,And those little red boxes are deaths.,So those are the consequences.,And that is female-pattern,and why we think the Yentl syndrome,actually is explaining,a lot of these gaps. 
 There's been wonderful news also,about studying women,,finally, in heart disease.,And one of the the cutting-edge areas,that we're just incredibly excited about,is stem cell therapy.,If you ask, what is the big difference,between women and men physiologically?,Why are there women and men?,Because women bring new life into the world.,That's all stem cells.,So we hypothesized,that female stem cells might be better,at identifying the injury,,doing some cellular repair,or even producing new organs,,which is one of the things,that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy.,These are female and male stem cells.,And if you had an injured organ,,if you had a heart attack,and we wanted to repair that injured area,,do you want those robust,,plentiful stem cells on the top?,Or do you want these guys,,that look like they're out to lunch? 
 (Laughter) 
 And some of our investigative teams,have demonstrated,that female stem cells --,and this is in animals,and increasingly we're showing this in humans --,that female stem cells,,when put even into a male body,,do better than male stem cells,going into a male body.,One of the things that we say,about all of this female physiology --,because again, as much as we're talking about women and heart disease,,women do, on average,,have better longevity than men --,is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology,and understanding that,is going to help men and women.,So this is not a zero-sum game in anyway. 
 Okay, so here's where we started.,And remember, paths crossed in 1984,,and more and more women,were dying of cardiovascular disease.,What has happened in the last 15 years with this work?,We are bending the curve.,We're bending the curve.,So just like the breast cancer story,,doing research, getting awareness going,,it works, you just have to get it going.,Now are we happy with this?,We still have two to three more women dying for every man. 
 And I would propose,,with the better longevity,that women have overall,,that women probably should theoretically do better,,if we could just get treated.,So this is where we are,,but we have a long row to hoe.,We've worked on this for 15 years.,And I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease,for 50 years.,So we're 35 years behind.,And we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years.,And in fact, it probably won't.,But we cannot stop now.,Too many lives are at stake. 
 So what do we need to do?,You now, hopefully, have a more personal relationship,with your heart.,Women have heard the call,for breast cancer,and they have come out,for awareness campaigns.,The women are very good about getting mammograms now.,And women do fundraising.,Women participate.,They have put their money where their mouth is,and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns.,This is what we need to do with heart disease now. 
 And it's political.,Women's health, from a federal funding standpoint,,sometimes it's popular,,sometimes it's not so popular.,So we have these feast and famine cycles.,So I implore you,to join the Red Dress Campaign,in this fundraising.,Breast cancer, as we said,,kills women,,but heart disease kills a whole bunch more.,So if we can be as good as breast cancer,and give women this new charge,,we have a lot of lives to save. 
 So thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)How can I speak in 10 minutes,about the bonds of womennover three generations,,about how the astonishingnstrength of those bonds,took hold in the lifenof a four-year-old girl,huddled with her young sister,nher mother and her grandmother,for five days and nightsnin a small boat in the China Sea,more than 30 years ago.,Bonds that took holdnin the life of that small girl,and never let go --,that small girl nownliving in San Francisco,and speaking to you today.,This is not a finished story.,It is a jigsaw puzzlenstill being put together.,Let me tell you about some of the pieces. 
 Imagine the first piece:na man burning his life's work.,He is a poet, a playwright,,a man whose whole life,had been balanced on the single hopenof his country's unity and freedom.,Imagine him as the communistsnenter Saigon --,confronting the factnthat his life had been a complete waste.,Words, for so long his friends,nnow mocked him.,He retreated into silence.,He died broken by history.,He is my grandfather.,I never knew him in real life.,But our lives are much morenthan our memories.,My grandmother nevernlet me forget his life.,My duty was not to allownit to have been in vain,,and my lesson was to learnnthat, yes, history tried to crush us,,but we endured. 
 The next piece of the jigsawnis of a boat in the early dawn,slipping silently out to sea.,My mother, Mai, was 18nwhen her father died --,already in an arranged marriage,,already with two small girls.,For her, life had distillednitself into one task:,the escape of her familynand a new life in Australia.,It was inconceivable to hernthat she would not succeed.,So after a four-year saganthat defies fiction,,a boat slipped out to seandisguised as a fishing vessel.,All the adults knew the risks.,The greatest fearnwas of pirates, rape and death.,Like most adults on the boat,,my mother carriedna small bottle of poison.,If we were captured,nfirst my sister and I,,then she and my grandmother would drink. 
 My first memories are from the boat --,the steady beat of the engine,,the bow dipping into each wave,,the vast and empty horizon.,I don't remember the piratesnwho came many times,,but were bluffed by the bravadonof the men on our boat,,or the engine dyingnand failing to start for six hours.,But I do remember the lightsnon the oil rig off the Malaysian coast,and the young man who collapsed and died,,the journey's end too much for him,,and the first apple I tasted,ngiven to me by the men on the rig.,No apple has ever tasted the same. 
 After three months in a refugee camp,nwe landed in Melbourne.,And the next piece of the jigsawnis about four women,across three generationsnshaping a new life together.,We settled in Footscray,,a working-class suburbnwhose demographic is layers of immigrants.,Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs,nwhose existence I was oblivious of,,there was no sensenof entitlement in Footscray.,The smells from shop doorsnwere from the rest of the world.,And the snippets of halting English,were exchanged between peoplenwho had one thing in common:,They were starting again. 
 My mother worked on farms,,then on a car assembly line,,working six days, double shifts.,Somehow, she found time to study English,and gain IT qualifications.,We were poor.,All the dollars were allocated,and extra tuition in Englishnand mathematics was budgeted for,regardless of what missed out,,which was usually new clothes;,they were always secondhand.,Two pairs of stockings for school,,each to hide the holes in the other.,A school uniform down to the ankles,nbecause it had to last for six years.,And there were rarenbut searing chants of "slit-eye",and the occasional graffiti:,"Asian, go home.",Go home to where?,Something stiffened inside me.,There was a gathering of resolvenand a quiet voice saying,,"I will bypass you." 
 My mother, my sister and Inslept in the same bed.,My mother was exhausted each night,,but we told one another about our day,and listened to the movementsnof my grandmother around the house.,My mother suffered from nightmares,nall about the boat.,And my job was to stay awakenuntil her nightmares came,so I could wake her.,She opened a computer store,,then studied to be a beauticiannand opened another business.,And the women came with their stories,about men who could notnmake the transition,,angry and inflexible,,and troubled childrenncaught between two worlds. 
 Grants and sponsors were sought.,Centers were established.,I lived in parallel worlds.,In one, I was the classic Asian student,,relentless in the demandsnthat I made on myself.,In the other, I was enmeshednin lives that were precarious,,tragically scarred by violence,ndrug abuse and isolation.,But so many over the years were helped.,And for that work,nwhen I was a final-year law student,,I was chosen as the YoungnAustralian of the Year.,And I was catapulted fromnone piece of the jigsaw to another,,and their edges didn't fit. 
 Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,,was now Tan Le,nrefugee and social activist,,invited to speak in venuesnshe had never heard of,and into homes whose existencenshe could never have imagined.,I didn't know the protocols.,I didn't know how to use the cutlery.,I didn't know how to talk about wine.,I didn't know how to talk about anything.,I wanted to retreatnto the routines and comfort,of life in an unsung suburb --,a grandmother, a mother and two daughters,ending each day as they hadnfor almost 20 years,,telling one another the story of their day,and falling asleep,nthe three of us still in the same bed.,I told my mother I couldn't do it.,She reminded me that I was nownthe same age she had been,when we boarded the boat.,"No" had never been an option.,"Just do it," she said,,"and don't be what you're not." 
 So I spoke out on youthnunemployment and education,and the neglect of the marginalizednand disenfranchised.,And the more candidly I spoke,nthe more I was asked to speak.,I met people from all walks of life,,so many of them doingnthe thing they loved,,living on the frontiers of possibility.,And even though I finished my degree,,I realized I could not settleninto a career in law.,There had to be another piecenof the jigsaw.,And I realized, at the same time,,that it is OK to be an outsider,,a recent arrival,,new on the scene --,and not just OK,,but something to be thankful for,,perhaps a gift from the boat.,Because being an insider can so easilynmean collapsing the horizons,,can so easily mean acceptingnthe presumptions of your province.,I have stepped outsidenmy comfort zone enough now,to know that, yes,nthe world does fall apart,,but not in the way that you fear. 
 Possibilities that would notnhave been allowed,were outrageously encouraged.,There was an energy there,,an implacable optimism,,a strange mixture of humility and daring.,So I followed my hunches.,I gathered around mena small team of people,for whom the label "It can't be done"nwas an irresistible challenge.,For a year, we were penniless.,At the end of each day,nI made a huge pot of soup,which we all shared.,We worked well into each night.,Most of our ideas were crazy,,but a few were brilliant,,and we broke through.,I made the decision to movento the US after only one trip.,My hunches again.,Three months later, I had relocated,nand the adventure has continued. 
 Before I close, though,nlet me tell you about my grandmother.,She grew up at a time when Confucianismnwas the social norm,and the local mandarinnwas the person who mattered.,Life hadn't changed for centuries.,Her father died soon after she was born.,Her mother raised her alone.,At 17, she became the second wifenof a mandarin whose mother beat her.,With no support from her husband,,she caused a sensationnby taking him to court,and prosecuting her own case,,and a far greater sensation when she won. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "It can't be done" was shown to be wrong. 
 I was taking a showernin a hotel room in Sydney,the moment she died,,600 miles away, in Melbourne.,I looked through the shower screennand saw her standing on the other side.,I knew she had come to say goodbye.,My mother phoned minutes later.,A few days later,,we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscraynand sat around her casket.,We told her stories and assured hernthat we were still with her.,At midnight, the monk camenand told us he had to close the casket.,My mother asked us to feel her hand.,She asked the monk,,"Why is it that her hand is so warmnand the rest of her is so cold?","Because you have been holding itnsince this morning," he said.,"You have not let it go." 
 If there is a sinew in our family,nit runs through the women.,Given who we werenand how life had shaped us,,we can now see that the mennthat might have come into our lives,would have thwarted us.,Defeat would have come too easily.,Now I would like to have my own children,nand I wonder about the boat.,Who could ever wish it on their own?,Yet I am afraid of privilege,,of ease,,of entitlement.,Can I give them a bow in their lives,ndipping bravely into each wave,,the unperturbed and steadynbeat of the engine,,the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?,I don't know.,But if I could give it,and still see them safely through,,I would. 
 (Applause) 
 Trevor Neilson: And also,nTan's mother is here today,,in the fourth or fifth row. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk to you today,about the design of medical technologynfor low-resource settings.,I study health systems in these countries.,And one of the major gaps in care,,almost across the board,,is access to safe surgery.,Now one of the majornbottlenecks that we've found,that's sort of preventingnboth the access in the first place,,and the safety of those surgeriesnthat do happen, is anesthesia.,And actually, it's the modelnthat we expect to work,for delivering anesthesianin these environments. 
 Here, we have a scene that you would findnin any operating room across the US,,or any other developed country.,In the background there,is a very sophisticatednanesthesia machine.,And this machine is ablento enable surgery and save lives,because it was designednwith this environment in mind.,In order to operate,nthis machine needs a number of things,that this hospital has to offer.,It needs an extremelynwell-trained anesthesiologist,with years of trainingnwith complex machines,to help her monitor the flows of the gas,and keep her patientsnsafe and anesthetized,throughout the surgery.,It's a delicate machinenrunning on computer algorithms,,and it needs special care, TLC,nto keep it up and running,,and it's going to break pretty easily.,And when it does, it needsna team of biomedical engineers,who understand its complexities,ncan fix it, can source the parts,and keep it saving lives. 
 It's a pretty expensive machine.,It needs a hospitalnwhose budget can allow it,to support one machinencosting upwards of 50 or $100,000.,And perhaps most obviously,,but also most importantly --,and the path to conceptsnthat we've heard about,kind of illustrates this --,it needs infrastructure that can supplynan uninterrupted source of electricity,,of compressed oxygen,nand other medical supplies,that are so criticalnto the functioning of this machine.,In other words, this machinenrequires a lot of stuff,that this hospital cannot offer. 
 This is the electrical supplynfor a hospital in rural Malawi.,In this hospital,,there is one person qualifiednto deliver anesthesia,,and she's qualified,because she has 12, maybe 18 monthsnof training in anesthesia.,In the hospital and in the entire region,there's not a single biomedical engineer.,So when this machine breaks,,the machines that they havento work with break,,they've got to try and figure it out,,but most of the time,nthat's the end of the road.,Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.,And the price tagnof the machine that I mentioned,could represent maybe a quarter or a third,of the annual operating budgetnfor this hospital. 
 And finally, I think you can seenthat infrastructure is not very strong.,This hospital is connectednto a very weak power grid,,one that goes down frequently.,So it runs frequently,nthe entire hospital,,just on a generator.,And you can imagine,nthe generator breaks down,or runs out of fuel.,And the World Bank sees this,and estimates that a hospitalnin this setting in a low-income country,can expect up ton18 power outages per month.,Similarly, compressed oxygennand other medical supplies,are really a luxury,,and can often be out of stocknfor months or even a year. 
 So it seems crazy, but the modelnthat we have right now,is taking those machinesnthat were designed,for that first environmentnthat I showed you,and donating or selling themnto hospitals in this environment.,It's not just inappropriate,,it becomes really unsafe. 
 One of our partners at Johns Hopkins,was observing surgeries in Sierra Leonenabout a year ago.,And the first surgery of the daynhappened to be an obstetrical case.,A woman came in,nshe needed an emergency C-section,to save her life and the life of her baby.,And everything began pretty auspiciously.,The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.,The nurse was there.,She was able to anesthetize her quickly,nand it was important,because of the emergencynnature of the situation.,And everything began well,until the power went out.,And now in the middle of this surgery,,the surgeon is racingnagainst the clock to finish his case,,which he can do -- he's got a headlamp.,But the nurse is literally runningnaround a darkened operating theater,trying to find anythingnshe can use to anesthetize her patient,,to keep her patient asleep.,Because her machine doesn't worknwhen there's no power.,This routine surgery that many of younhave probably experienced,,and others are probably the product of,nhas now become a tragedy.,And what's so frustratingnis this is not a singular event;,this happens across the developing world.,35 million surgeriesnare attempted every year,without safe anesthesia. 
 My colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton,nwas living this reality.,He was the chief of anesthesiology,in a hospital in Malawi,na teaching hospital.,He went to work every day,in an operating theater like this one,,trying to deliver anesthesianand teach others how to do so,using that same equipment,that became so unreliable,nand frankly unsafe, in his hospital.,And after umpteen surgeries,and, you can imagine,nreally unspeakable tragedy,,he just said, "That's it.nI'm done. That's enough.,There has to be something better.",He took a walk down the hall,to where they threw all those machinesnthat had just crapped out on them,,I think that's the scientific term,,and he started tinkering.,He took one part from herenand another from there,,and he tried to come upnwith a machine that would work,in the reality that he was facing. 
 And what he came up with:,was this guy.,The prototype for the UniversalnAnesthesia Machine --,a machine that would worknand anesthetize his patients,no matter the circumstancesnthat his hospital had to offer.,Here it is, back at home,at that same hospital, developedna little further, 12 years later,,working on patientsnfrom pediatrics to geriatrics. 
 Let me show you a little bitnabout how this machine works.,Voila!,Here she is.,When you have electricity,,everything in this machinenbegins in the base.,There's a built-innoxygen concentrator down there.,Now you've heard me mentionnoxygen a few times at this point.,Essentially, to deliver anesthesia,nyou want as pure oxygen as possible,,because eventually you're goingnto dilute it, essentially, with the gas.,And the mixture that the patient inhales,needs to be at leastna certain percentage oxygen,or else it can become dangerous.,But so in here when there's electricity,,the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.,Now we know room air is gloriously free,,it is abundant,,and it's already 21 percent oxygen.,So all this concentrator doesnis take that room air in, filter it,and send 95 percent pure oxygennup and across here,,where it mixes with the anesthetic agent. 
 Now before that mixturenhits the patient's lungs,,it's going to pass by here --nyou can't see it,,but there's an oxygen sensor here --,that's going to read out on this screennthe percentage of oxygen being delivered.,Now if you don't have power,,or, God forbid, the power cuts outnin the middle of a surgery,,this machine transitions automatically,,without even having to touch it,,to drawing in room air from this inlet. 
 Everything else is the same.,The only difference is that now,you're only workingnwith 21 percent oxygen.,Now that used to bena dangerous guessing game,,because you only knewnif you gave too little oxygen,once something bad happened.,But we've put a long-lifenbattery backup on here.,This is the only partnthat's battery backed up.,But this gives control to the provider,nwhether there's power or not,,because they can adjust the flows,based on the percentage of oxygennthey see that they're giving the patient. 
 In both cases,nwhether you have power or not,,sometimes the patientnneeds help breathing.,It's just a reality of anesthesia,nthe lungs can be paralyzed.,And so we've just addednthis manual bellows.,We've seen surgeriesnfor three or four hours,to ventilate the patient on this. 
 So it's a straightforward machine.,I shudder to say simple;nit's straightforward.,And it's by design.,You do not need to be a highly trained,nspecialized anesthesiologist,to use this machine,,which is good because,nin these rural district hospitals,,you're not going to getnthat level of training.,It's also designed for the environmentnthat it will be used in. 
 This is an incredibly rugged machine.,It has to stand up to the heatnand the wear and tear,that happens in hospitalsnin these rural districts.,And so it's not goingnto break very easily,,but if it does, virtuallynevery piece in this machine,can be swapped out and replaced,with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.,And finally, it's affordable.,This machine comes innat an eighth of the cost,of the conventional machinenthat I showed you earlier.,So in other words, what we have herenis a machine that can enable surgery,and save lives,,because it was designednfor its environment,,just like the first machine I showed you. 
 But we're not content to stop there.,Is it working?,Is this the designnthat's going to work in place?,Well, we've seen good results so far.,This is in 13 hospitals in four countries,,and since 2010, we've donenwell over 2,000 surgeries,with no clinically adverse events.,So we're thrilled.,This really seems likena cost-effective, scalable solution,to a problem that's really pervasive.,But we still want to be sure,that this is the most effectivenand safe device,that we can be putting into hospitals. 
 So to do that, we've launchedna number of partnerships,with NGOs and universities,,to gather data on the user interface,,on the types of surgeriesnit's appropriate for,,and ways we can enhance the device itself.,One of those partnershipsnis with Johns Hopkins,just here in Baltimore.,They have a really cool anesthesiansimulation lab out in Baltimore.,So we're taking this machine,and recreating somenof the operating theater crises,that this machine might face,in one of the hospitalsnthat it's intended for,,and in a contained, safe environment,,evaluating its effectiveness.,We're then able to comparenthe results from that study,with real-world experience,,because we're puttingntwo of these in hospitals,that Johns Hopkinsnworks with in Sierra Leone,,including the hospitalnwhere that emergency C-section happened. 
 So I've talked a lot about anesthesia,nand I tend to do that.,I think it is incredibly fascinatingnand an important component of health.,And it really seems peripheral,nwe never think about it,,until we don't have access to it,,and then it becomes a gatekeeper.,Who gets surgery and who doesn't?,Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't?,But you know,nit's just one of so many ways,that design, appropriate design,,can have an impact on health outcomes.,If more peoplenin the health-delivery space,really working on some of thesenchallenges in low-income countries,could start their design process,ntheir solution search,,from outside of that proverbial box,and inside of the hospital --,In other words, if we could design,for the environment that existsnin so many parts of the world,,rather than the onenthat we wished existed --,we might just save a lot of lives. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We do not invest in victims,,we invest in survivors.,And in ways both big and small,,the narrative of the victim,shapes the way we see women.,You can't count what you don't see.,And we don't invest in what's invisible to us.,But this is the face,of resilience. 
 Six years ago,,I started writing about women entrepreneurs,during and after conflict.,I set out to write a compelling economic story,,one that had great characters, that no one else was telling,,and one that I thought mattered.,And that turned out to be women. 
 I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30,for business school,,a path I knew almost nothing about.,None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland,had graduated from college,,let alone considered business school.,But they had hustled to feed their kids,and pay their rent.,And I saw from a young age,that having a decent job and earning a good living,made the biggest difference,for families who were struggling. 
 So if you're going to talk about jobs,,then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.,And if you're talking about entrepreneurs,in conflict and post-conflict settings,,then you must talk about women,,because they are the population you have left.,Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide,was 77 percent female.,I want to introduce you,to some of those entrepreneurs I've met,and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years. 
 I went to Afghanistan in 2005,to work on a Financial Times piece,,and there I met Kamila,,a young women who told me she had just turned down,a job with the international community,that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month --,an astronomical sum in that context.,And she had turned it down, she said,,because she was going to start her next business,,an entrepreneurship consultancy,that would teach business skills,to men and women all around Afghanistan.,Business, she said,,was critical to her country's future.,Because long after this round of internationals left,,business would help keep her country,peaceful and secure.,And she said business was even more important for women,because earning an income earned respect,and money was power for women. 
 So I was amazed.,I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time,who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice.",(Laughter),So I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business?,Why are you so passionate?",She said, "Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business.,My first business was a dressmaking business,I started under the Taliban.,And that was actually an excellent business,,because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood.,And that's really how I became an entrepreneur." 
 Think about this:,Here were girls who braved danger,to become breadwinners,during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.,And at a time of economic collapse,when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces,and windows and doors,just to survive,,these girls made the difference,between survival and starvation,for so many.,I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either,,because everywhere I went I met more of these women,who no one seemed to know about,,or even wish to. 
 I went on to Bosnia,,and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official,who said, "You know, Gayle,,I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia,,but there is a lady selling cheese nearby,on the side of the road.,So maybe you could interview her.",So I went out reporting,and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic,who at that point was opening a new factory,on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo.,She had started her business,squatting in an abandoned garage,,sewing sheets and pillow cases,she would take to markets all around the city,so that she could support,the 12 or 13 family members,who were counting on her for survival.,By the time we met, she had 20 employees,,most of them women,,who were sending their boys and their girls to school.,And she was just the start.,I met women running essential oils businesses,,wineries,and even the country's largest advertising agency. 
 So these stories together,became the Herald Tribune business cover.,And when this story posted,,I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.,And I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs,to feature at your next investment conference,,here are a couple of women." 
 (Applause) 
 But think about this.,The IMF official is hardly the only person,to automatically file women under micro.,The biases, whether intentional or otherwise,,are pervasive,,and so are the misleading mental images.,If you see the word "microfinance,",what comes to mind?,Most people say women.,And if you see the word "entrepreneur,",most people think men.,Why is that?,Because we aim low and we think small,when it comes to women. 
 Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool,that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect,,but we must move beyond micro-hopes,and micro-ambitions for women,,because they have so much greater hopes for themselves.,They want to move from micro to medium and beyond.,And in many places,,they're there.,In the U.S., women-owned businesses,will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.,In South Korea and Indonesia,,women own nearly half a million firms.,China, women run 20 percent,of all small businesses.,And in the developing world overall,,That figure is 40 to 50 percent. 
 Nearly everywhere I go,,I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs,who are seeking access to finance, access to markets,and established business networks.,They are often ignored,because they're harder to help.,It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan,than it is to give a 500 dollar loan.,And as the World Bank recently noted,,women are stuck in a productivity trap.,Those in small businesses,can't get the capital they need to expand,and those in microbusiness,can't grow out of them. 
 Recently I was at the State Department in Washington,and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.,She sells chocolates.,And she had come to Washington,,not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.,She had come seeking serious investment dollars,so that she could build the factory,and buy the equipment she needs,to export her chocolates,to Africa, Europe, the Middle East,and far beyond --,capital that would help her to employ,more than the 20 people,that she already has working for her,,and capital that would fuel her own country's,economic climb. 
 The great news is,we already know what works.,Theory and empirical evidence,Have already taught us.,We don't need to invent solutions because we have them --,cash flow loans,based in income rather than assets,,loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral,,because women often don't own land.,And Kiva.org, the microlender,,is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing,small and medium sized loans.,And that's just to start. 
 Recently it has become very much in fashion,to call women "the emerging market of the emerging market.",I think that is terrific.,You know why?,Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance --,500 billion dollars at least,has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.,Because investors saw the potential for return,at a time of slowing economic growth,,and so they created financial products,and financial innovation,tailored to the emerging markets. 
 How wonderful would it be,if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words,with our wallets,and invest 500 billion dollars,unleashing women's economic potential?,Just think of the benefits,when it comes to jobs, productivity,,employment, child nutrition,,maternal mortality, literacy,and much, much more.,Because, as the World Economic Forum noted,,smaller gender gaps are directly correlated,with increased economic competitiveness.,And not one country in all the world,has eliminated its economic participation gap --,not one. 
 So the great news,is this is an incredible opportunity.,We have so much room to grow.,So you see,,this is not about doing good,,this is about global growth,and global employment.,It is about how we invest,and it's about how we see women.,And women can no longer be,both half the population,and a special interest group. 
 (Applause) 
 Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters,who say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories,,but you're really writing about the exceptions.",Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons.,First of all, for exceptions,,there are a lot of them,and they're important.,Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding,,we rightly consider them,icons or pioneers or innovators,to be emulated.,And when we talk about women,,they are either exceptions to be dismissed,or aberrations to be ignored.,And finally,,there is no society anywhere in all the world,that is not changed,except by its most exceptional.,So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate,these change makers and job creators,rather than overlook them? 
 This topic of resilience is very personal to me,and in many ways has shaped my life.,My mom was a single mom,who worked at the phone company during the day,and sold Tupperware at night,so that I could have every opportunity possible.,We shopped double coupons,and layaway and consignment stores,,and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer,and could no longer work,,we even applied for food stamps.,And when I would feel sorry for myself,as nine or 10 year-old girls do,,she would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies,,yours is not a three." 
 (Laughter) 
 And when I was applying to business school,and felt certain I couldn't do it,and nobody I knew had done it,,I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband,and escaped a marriage of abuse,with only her dignity intact.,And she told me,,"Never import other people's limitations." 
 And when I complained to my grandmother,,a World War II veteran,who worked in film for 50 years,and who supported me from the age of 13,,that I was terrified,that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC,for a fellowship overseas,,I would never ever, ever find another job,,she said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.,First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright,,and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring.",(Laughter),"You will find a job. Take the leap." 
 The women in my family,are not exceptions.,The women in this room and watching in L.A.,and all around the world,are not exceptions.,We are not a special interest group.,We are the majority.,And for far too long,,we have underestimated ourselves,and been undervalued by others.,It is time for us to aim higher,when it comes to women,,to invest more and to deploy our dollars,to benefit women all around the world. 
 We can make a difference,,and make a difference, not just for women,,but for a global economy,that desperately needs their contributions.,Together we can make certain,that the so-called exceptions,begin to rule.,When we change the way we see ourselves,,others will follow.,And it is time for all of us,to think bigger. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.,I would watch Nova on PBS.,Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.,When I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor,,he gave me a book for my birthday.,It was an astronomy book,,and I poured over that thing for hours on end,,and it was a combination of all these things,that inspired me to pursue space exploration,as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,,I always wanted to just fly around the solar system,and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft. 
 Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA,and I found myself at NASA,,working for the jet propulsion laboratory,,and there our team was challenged,to create a 3D visualization of the solar system,,and today I want to show you what we've done so far. 
 Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here,you can do at home, because we built this,for the public for you guys to use. 
 So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.,You can see the United States and California,and San Diego, and you can use the mouse,or the keyboard to spin things around. 
 Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth,has seen this before, but one thing we like to say,in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.,Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.,We go from this view out to the stars.,So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show,are the spacecraft,,so I'm going to bring the interface back up,,and now you're looking at a number of satellites,orbiting the Earth.,These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.,We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites,and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.,If we did, it would be a complete mess,,because there's a lot of stuff out there.,And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models,for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit,any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them. 
 So I'm going to find the International Space Station,,double-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.,And now you're riding along with the ISS,where it is right now. 
 And the other cool thing is, not only can we,move the camera around, we can also control time,,so I can slide this jog dial here,to shuttle time forward, and now,we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like,,and they get one every 90 minutes. (Laughter) 
 All right, so what about the rest of it?,Well, I can click on this home button over here,,and that will take us up to the inner solar system,,and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.,You can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter,,and while we're here, I want to point out something.,It's actually pretty busy. 
 Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory,on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend. 
 Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.,We have Dawn orbiting Vesta,,and we have over here New Horizons,on a straight shot to Pluto. 
 And I mention this because,there's this strange public perception that,NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying,and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there. 
 Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,,and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.,Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,,well at least with our own launch vehicles,,but NASA is far from dead,,and one of the reasons why we write a program like this,is so that people realize that there's so many other things,that we're doing. 
 Anyway, while we're here, again,,if you want to visit anything,,all you need to do is double-click.,So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,,and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,,and this is happening right now.,I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see,Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.,You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees. 
 And just being able to visit different places,and go through different times,,we have data from 1950 to 2050.,Granted, we don't have everything in between,,because some of the data is hard to get.,Just being able to visit places in different times,,you can explore this for hours,,literally hours on end,,but I want to show you one thing in particular,,so I'm going to open up the destination tab,,spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,,and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.,So now we've gone back in time.,We're now riding along with Voyager 1.,The date here is November 11, 1980. 
 Now, there's a funny thing going on here.,It doesn't look like anything's going on.,It looks like I've paused the program.,It's actually running at real rate right now,,one second per second, and in fact,,Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at,I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.,It only looks like nothing's moving because, well,,Saturn here is 700,000 miles away,,and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.,It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening. 
 But to make it more interesting,,I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch,as Voyager 1 flies by Titan,,which is a hazy moon of Saturn.,It actually has a very thick atmosphere.,And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.,I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you,Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn. 
 There's a point to be made here.,With a 3D visualization like this,,we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.,There's a whole story to tell here.,And even better, because it's an interactive application,,you can tell the story for yourself.,If you want to pause it, you can pause it.,If you want to keep going, if you want to change,the camera angle, you can do that,,and because of that, I can show you,that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.,It actually flies underneath Saturn.,Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,,Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up,and out of the solar system,,so if I just keep letting this go,,you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.,And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.,I'm going to go back to today, now,,and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.,Right there, above, way above the solar system,,way beyond our solar system. 
 And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.,Now you know why, and to me,,that's the point of this program.,You can manipulate it yourself.,You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself. 
 You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp.",Well, we're trying to give you,the solar system in your grasp — (Laughter) —,and we hope once it's there,,you'll be able to learn for yourself,what we've done out there, and what we're about to do.,And my personal dream is for kids to take this,and explore and see the wonders out there,and be inspired, as I was as a kid,,to pursue STEM education,and to pursue a dream in space exploration. 
 Thank you. (Applause)What you have here,is an electronic cigarette.,It's something that, since it wasninvented a year or two ago,,has given me untold happiness. 
 (Laughter) 
 A little bit of it,nI think, is the nicotine,,but there's somethingnmuch bigger than that;,which is, ever since, in the UK,nthey banned smoking in public places,,I've never enjoyedna drinks party ever again. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the reason, I only worked outnjust the other day,,which is: when you gonto a drinks party and you stand up,and hold a glass of red winenand you talk endlessly to people,,you don't actually want to spendnall the time talking.,It's really, really tiring.,Sometimes you just want to stand therensilently, alone with your thoughts.,Sometimes you just want to standnin the corner and stare out of the window.,Now the problem is, when you can't smoke,,if you stand and starenout of the window on your own,,you're an antisocial, friendless idiot. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you stand and stare out of the windownon your own with a cigarette,,you're a fucking philosopher. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So the power of reframing things,cannot be overstated.,What we have is exactlynthe same thing, the same activity,,but one of them makes you feel great,and the other one,nwith just a small change of posture,,makes you feel terrible.,And I think one of the problemsnwith classical economics is,,it's absolutely preoccupied with reality.,And reality isn't a particularly goodnguide to human happiness.,Why, for example,nare pensioners much happier,than the young unemployed?,Both of them, after all,nare in exactly the same stage of life.,You both have too much timenon your hands and not much money.,But pensioners are reportedlynvery, very happy,,whereas the unemployednare extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.,The reason, I think,nis that the pensioners believe,they've chosen to be pensioners,,whereas the young unemployednfeel it's been thrust upon them. 
 In England, the upper-middle classes havenactually solved this problem perfectly,,because they've re-branded unemployment.,If you're an upper-middle-classnEnglish person,,you call unemployment "a year off." 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's because having a sonnwho's unemployed in Manchester,is really quite embarrassing.,But having a sonnwho's unemployed in Thailand,is really viewednas quite an accomplishment. 
 (Laughter) 
 But actually, the powernto re-brand things --,to understand thatnour experiences, costs, things,don't actually much dependnon what they really are,,but on how we view them --,I genuinely think can't be overstated. 
 There's an experimentnI think Daniel Pink refers to,,where you put two dogs in a box,and the box has an electric floor.,Every now and then,nan electric shock is applied to the floor,,which pains the dogs.,The only difference is one of the dogsnhas a small button in its half of the box.,And when it nuzzles the button,nthe electric shock stops.,The other dog doesn't have the button.,It's exposed to exactly the same levelnof pain as the dog in the first box,,but it has no controlnover the circumstances.,Generally, the first dogncan be relatively content.,The second dog lapsesninto complete depression. 
 The circumstances of our livesnmay actually matter less to our happiness,than the sense of controlnwe feel over our lives.,It's an interesting question.,We ask the question -- the wholendebate in the Western world,is about the level of taxation.,But I think there's anotherndebate to be asked,,which is the level of controlnwe have over our tax money,,that what costs us 10 poundsnin one context can be a curse;,what costs us 10 pounds in a differentncontext, we may actually welcome.,You know, pay 20,000 poundsnin tax toward health,,and you're merely feeling a mug.,Pay 20,000 poundsnto endow a hospital ward,,and you're called a philanthropist.,I'm probably in the wrong countrynto talk about willingness to pay tax. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'll give you one in return:nhow you frame things really matters.,Do you call it "The bailout of Greece"?,Or "The bailout of a load of stupid banksnwhich lent to Greece"? 
 (Laughter) 
 Because they are actually the same thing.,What you call themnactually affects how you react to them,,viscerally and morally.,I think psychological value is great,nto be absolutely honest.,One of my great friends,na professor called Nick Chater,,who's the Professor of DecisionnSciences in London,,believes we should spend far less timenlooking into humanity's hidden depths,,and spend much more timenexploring the hidden shallows.,I think that's true, actually.,I think impressions have an insane effectnon what we think and what we do.,But what we don't have is a reallyngood model of human psychology --,at least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,,we didn't have a really good modelnof human psychology,to put alongside models of engineering,nof neoclassical economics. 
 So people who believed in psychologicalnsolutions didn't have a model.,We didn't have a framework.,This is what Warren Buffett'snbusiness partner Charlie Munger calls,"a latticework on whichnto hang your ideas.",Engineers, economists,nclassical economists,all had a very, very robustnexisting latticework,on which practicallynevery idea could be hung.,We merely have a collectionnof random individual insights,without an overall model.,And what that meansnis that, in looking at solutions,,we've probably given too much priority,to what I call technical engineeringnsolutions, Newtonian solutions,,and not nearly enoughnto the psychological ones. 
 You know my example of the Eurostar:,six million pounds spent,to reduce the journey timenbetween Paris and London,by about 40 minutes.,For 0.01 percent of this money,nyou could have put wi-fi on the trains,,which wouldn't have reducednthe duration of the journey,,but would have improved its enjoymentnand its usefulness far more.,For maybe 10 percent of the money,,you could have paid all of the world's topnmale and female supermodels,to walk up and down the trainnhanding out free Château Pétrus,to all the passengers. 
 (Laughter) 
 You'd still have five millionnpounds in change,,and people would asknfor the trains to be slowed down. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why were we not given the chancento solve that problem psychologically?,I think it's because there's an imbalance,,an asymmetry in the way we treat creative,nemotionally driven psychological ideas,versus the way we treat rational,nnumerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.,If you're a creative person,nI think, quite rightly,,you have to sharenall your ideas for approval,with people much more rational than you.,You have to go innand have a cost-benefit analysis,,a feasibility study,nan ROI study and so forth.,And I think that's probably right.,But this does not applynthe other way around.,People who have an existing framework --,an economic framework,nan engineering framework --,feel that, actually,nlogic is its own answer.,What they don't say is,n"Well, the numbers all seem to add up,,but before I present this idea,nI'll show it to some really crazy people,to see if they can come up withnsomething better.",And so we -- artificially,nI think -- prioritize,what I'd call mechanistic ideasnover psychological ideas. 
 An example of a great psychological idea:,the single best improvementnin passenger satisfaction,on the London Underground,,per pound spent,,came when they didn't addnany extra trains,,nor change the frequency of the trains;,they put dot matrix display boardsnon the platforms --,because the nature of a wait is not justndependent on its numerical quality,,its duration,,but on the level of uncertaintynyou experience during that wait.,Waiting seven minutes for a trainnwith a countdown clock,is less frustrating and irritating,than waiting four minutes,nknuckle biting, going,,"When's this trainngoing to damn well arrive?" 
 Here's a beautiful examplenof a psychological solution,deployed in Korea.,Red traffic lights have a countdown delay.,It's proven to reducenthe accident rate in experiments.,Why?,Because road rage, impatience and generalnirritation are massively reduced,when you can actually seenthe time you have to wait.,In China, not really understandingnthe principle behind this,,they applied the same principlento green traffic lights -- 
 (Laughter) 
 which isn't a great idea.,You're 200 yards away, you realizenyou've got five seconds to go,,you floor it. 
 (Laughter) 
 The Koreans, very assiduously,ndid test both.,The accident rate goes downnwhen you apply this to red traffic lights;,it goes up when you apply itnto green traffic lights. 
 This is all I'm asking for, really,nin human decision making,,is the considerationnof these three things.,I'm not asking for the complete primacynof one over the other.,I'm merely sayingnthat when you solve problems,,you should looknat all three of these equally,,and you should seek as far as possible,to find solutions which sitnin the sweet spot in the middle. 
 If you actually look at a great business,,you'll nearly always see all of thesenthree things coming into play.,Really successful businesses --,Google is a great, greatntechnological success,,but it's also basednon a very good psychological insight:,people believe somethingnthat only does one thing,is better at that thing than somethingnthat does that thing and something else.,It's an innate thingncalled "goal dilution.",Ayelet Fishbach has writtenna paper about this. 
 Everybody else at the timenof Google, more or less,,was trying to be a portal.,Yes, there's a search function,nbut you also have weather,,sports scores, bits of news.,Google understoodnthat if you're just a search engine,,people assume you're a very,nvery good search engine.,All of you know this, actually,nfrom when you go in to buy a television,,and in the shabbier endnof the row of flat-screen TVs,,you can see, are thesenrather despised things,called "combined TV and DVD players.",And we have no knowledge whatsoevernof the quality of those things,,but we look at a combinednTV and DVD player and we go, "Uck.,It's probably a bit of a crap tellynand a bit rubbish as a DVD player.",So we walk out of the shopsnwith one of each.,Google is as much a psychological successnas it is a technological one. 
 I propose that we can usenpsychology to solve problems,that we didn't even realizenwere problems at all.,This is my suggestion for getting peoplento finish their course of antibiotics.,Don't give them 24 white pills;,give them 18 white pills and six blue ones,and tell them to takenthe white pills first,,and then take the blue ones.,It's called "chunking.",The likelihood that people will getnto the end is much greater,when there is a milestonensomewhere in the middle. 
 One of the great mistakes,nI think, of economics,is it fails to understandnthat what something is --,whether it's retirement,nunemployment, cost --,is a function, not only of its amount,nbut also its meaning. 
 This is a toll crossing in Britain.,Quite often queues happen at the tolls.,Sometimes you get very,nvery severe queues.,You could applynthe same principle, actually,,to the security lanes in airports.,What would happen if you could actuallynpay twice as much money,to cross the bridge,,but go through a lanenthat's an express lane?,It's not an unreasonable thing to do;,it's an economicallynefficient thing to do.,Time means morento some people than others.,If you're waiting tryingnto get to a job interview,,you'd patently pay a couple of pounds morento go through the fast lane.,If you're on the waynto visit your mother-in-law,,you'd probably prefer -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you'd probably prefer to stay on the left. 
 The only problem is if you introducenthis economically efficient solution,,people hate it ...,because they think you're deliberatelyncreating delays at the bridge,in order to maximize your revenue,,and, "Why on earth should I paynto subsidize your incompetence?",On the other hand,nchange the frame slightly,and create charitable yield management,,so the extra money you getngoes not to the bridge company,,it goes to charity ...,and the mental willingnessnto pay completely changes.,You have a relativelyneconomically efficient solution,,but one that actually meetsnwith public approval,and even a small degree of affection,,rather than being seen as bastardy. 
 So where economistsnmake the fundamental mistake,is they think that money is money.,Actually, my pain experiencednin paying five pounds,is not just proportionate to the amount,,but where I think that money is going.,And I think understanding thatncould revolutionize tax policy.,It could revolutionizenthe public services.,It could actually change thingsnquite significantly. 
 [Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.] 
 Here's a guy you all need to study.,He's an Austrian School economist,who was first active in the first halfnof the 20th century in Vienna.,What was interestingnabout the Austrian School,is they actually grew up alongside Freud.,And so they're predominantlyninterested in psychology.,They believed that there wasna discipline called praxeology,,which is a prior disciplinento the study of economics.,Praxeology is the study of human choice,naction and decision-making.,I think they're right.,I think the dangernwe have in today's world,is we have the study of economics,considers itself to be a prior disciplinento the study of human psychology.,But as Charlie Munger says,n"If economics isn't behavioral,,I don't know what the hell is." 
 Von Mises, interestingly, believesneconomics is just a subset of psychology.,I think he just refers to economics,as "the study of human praxeologynunder conditions of scarcity.",But Von Mises, among many other things,,I think uses an analogy which is probablynthe best justification and explanation,for the value of marketing,nthe value of perceived value,and the fact that we should treat itnas being absolutely equivalent,to any other kind of value. 
 We tend to, all of us, even those of usnwho work in marketing,,think of value in two ways:,the real value, which is whennyou make something in a factory,or provide a service,,and then there's a dubious value,,which you create by changingnthe way people look at things.,Von Mises completely rejectednthis distinction.,And he used this following analogy:,he referred to strange economistsncalled the French physiocrats,,who believed that the only true valuenwas what you extracted from the land.,So if you're a shepherdnor a quarryman or a farmer,,you created true value.,If however, you boughtnsome wool from the shepherd,and charged a premiumnfor converting it into a hat,,you weren't actually creating value,,you were exploiting the shepherd. 
 Now, Von Mises said that modernneconomists make exactly the same mistake,with regard to advertising and marketing.,He says if you run a restaurant,,there is no healthy distinction to be made,between the value you createnby cooking the food,and the value you createnby sweeping the floor.,One of them creates, perhaps,nthe primary product --,the thing we think we're paying for --,the other one creates a contextnwithin which we can enjoy,and appreciate that product.,And the idea that one of themnshould have priority over the other,is fundamentally wrong. 
 Try this quick thought experiment:,imagine a restaurantnthat serves Michelin-starred food,,but where the restaurant smells of sewage,and there's human feces on the floor. 
 (Laughter) 
 The best thing you can do therento create value,is not actually to improventhe food still further,,it's to get rid of the smellnand clean up the floor.,And it's vital we understand this. 
 If that seems like a sortnof strange, abstruse thing --,in the UK, the post officenhad a 98 percent success rate,at delivering first-classnmail the next day.,They decided this wasn't good enough,,and they wanted to get it up to 99.,The effort to do thatnalmost broke the organization.,If, at the same time,nyou'd gone and asked people,,"What percentage of first-class mailnarrives the next day?",the average answer, or the modal answer,nwould have been "50 to 60 percent.",Now, if your perceptionnis much worse than your reality,,what on earth are you doingntrying to change the reality?,That's like trying to improve the foodnin a restaurant that stinks.,What you need to do is,nfirst of all, tell people,that 98 percent of first-class mailngets there the next day.,That's pretty good.,I would argue, in Britain,nthere's a much better frame of reference,,which is to tell people that morenfirst-class mail arrives the next day,in the UK than in Germany,nbecause generally, in Britain,,if you want to make us happynabout something,,just tell us we do itnbetter than the Germans. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Choose your frame of referencenand the perceived value,,and therefore, the actual valuenis completely transformed.,It has to be said of the Germans,that the Germans and the Frenchnare doing a brilliant job,of creating a united Europe.,The only thing they didn't expectnis they're uniting Europe,through a shared mild hatrednof the French and Germans.,But I'm British;nthat's the way we like it. 
 (Laughter) 
 What you'll also noticenis that, in any case,,our perception is leaky.,We can't tell the differencenbetween the quality of the food,and the environmentnin which we consume it.,All of you will have seen this phenomenon,if you have your car washed or valeted.,When you drive away,nyour car feels as if it drives better. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the reason for this --,unless my car valetnmysteriously is changing the oil,and performing work which I'm not payingnhim for and I'm unaware of --,is because perceptionnis, in any case, leaky. 
 Analgesics that are brandednare more effective at reducing pain,than analgesics that are not branded.,I don't just mean through reportednpain reduction --,actual measured pain reduction.,And so perceptionnactually is leaky in any case.,So if you do somethingnthat's perceptually bad in one respect,,you can damage the other. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)People are living longernand societies are getting grayer.,You hear about it all the time.,You read about it in your newspapers.,You hear about it on your television sets.,Sometimes, I'm concerned,that we hear about it so muchnthat we've come to accept longer lives,with a kind of a complacency, even ease.,But make no mistake, longer lives can --,and, I believe, will improvenquality of life at all ages. 
 Now to put this in perspective,nlet me just zoom out for a minute.,More years were added to averagenlife expectancy in the 20th century,than all years addednacross all prior millennia,of human evolution combined.,In the blink of an eye,,we nearly doubled the length of timenthat we're living.,So if you ever feel like you don't haventhis aging thing quite pegged,,don't kick yourself.,It's brand new. 
 And because fertility rates fellnacross that very same period,that life expectancy was going up,,that pyramid that has always representednthe distribution of age in the population,,with many young ones at the bottomnwinnowed to a tiny peak of older people,who make it and survive to old age,,is being reshaped into a rectangle. 
 And now, if you're the kind of person,who can get chillsnfrom population statistics, 
 (Laughter) 
 these are the ones that should do it.,Because what that means,is that for the first timenin the history of the species,,the majority of babies bornnin the developed world,are having the opportunity to grow old. 
 How did this happen?,Well, we're no genetically hardiernthan our ancestors were 10,000 years ago.,This increase in life expectancynis the remarkable product of culture --,the crucible that holdsnscience and technology,and wide-scale changes in behaviornthat improve health and well-being.,Through cultural changes, our ancestorsnlargely eliminated early death,so that people can nownlive out their full lives. 
 Now there are problemsnassociated with aging --,diseases, poverty, loss of social status.,It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.,But the more we learn about aging,,the clearer it becomesnthat a sweeping downward course,is grossly inaccurate.,Aging brings some rathernremarkable improvements --,increased knowledge, expertise --,and emotional aspects of life improve.,That's right, older people are happy.,They're happier than middle-aged people,nand younger people, certainly. 
 (Laughter) 
 Study after studynis coming to the same conclusion. 
 The CDC recently conducted a survey,where they asked respondentsnsimply to tell them,whether they experiencednsignificant psychological distress,in the previous week.,And fewer older peoplenanswered affirmatively to that question,than middle-aged people,nand younger people as well.,And a recent Gallup pollnasked participants,how much stress and worry and angernthey had experienced the previous day.,And stress, worry, anger,all decrease with age. 
 Now social scientists call thisnthe paradox of aging.,I mean, after all,naging is not a piece of cake.,So we've asked all sorts of questionsnto see if we could undo this finding.,We've asked whether it may be thatnthe current generations of older people,are and always have beennthe greatest generations.,That is that younger people todaynmay not typically experience,these improvements as they grow older.,We've asked,,well, maybe older peoplenare just trying to put a positive spin,on an otherwise depressing existence. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the more we've triednto disavow this finding,,the more evidence we find to support it. 
 Years ago, my colleaguesnand I embarked on a study,where we followed the same groupnof people over a 10-year period.,Originally, the sample was aged 18 to 94.,And we studied whether and howntheir emotional experiences changed,as they grew older.,Our participants would carrynelectronic pagers,for a week at a time,,and we'd page them throughout the daynand evenings at random times.,And every time we paged them,,we'd ask them to answernseveral questions --,"On a one to seven scale,nhow happy are you right now?","How sad are you right now?","How frustrated are you right now?" --,so that we could get a sense of the kindsnof emotions and feelings they were having,in their day-to-day lives. 
 And using this intense studynof individuals,,we find that it's notnone particular generation,that's doing better than the others,,but the same individuals over time,come to report relatively greaternpositive experience.,Now you see this slight downturnnat very advanced ages.,And there is a slight downturn.,But at no point does it returnnto the levels we see in early adulthood. 
 Now it's really too simplisticnto say that older people are "happy.",In our study, they are more positive.,But they're also more likelynthan younger people,to experience mixed emotions --,sadness at the same timenyou experience happiness;,you know, that tear in the eyenwhen you're smiling at a friend.,And other research has shown thatnolder people seem to engage with sadness,more comfortably.,They're more accepting of sadnessnthan younger people are.,And we suspectnthat this may help to explain,why older people are betternthan younger people,at solving hotly chargednemotional conflicts and debates.,Older people can view injusticenwith compassion,,but not despair. 
 And all things being equal,,older people direct their cognitivenresources, like attention and memory,,to positive informationnmore than negative.,If we show older, middle-aged,nyounger people images,,like the ones you see on the screen,,and we later ask themnto recall all the images that they can,,older people, but not younger people,,remember more positive imagesnthan negative images.,We've asked older and younger peoplento view faces in laboratory studies,,some frowning, some smiling.,Older people look toward the smiling facesnand away from the frowning, angry faces.,In day-to-day life, this translatesninto greater enjoyment and satisfaction. 
 But as social scientists, we continuento ask about possible alternatives.,We've said, well, maybe older peoplenreport more positive emotions,because they're cognitively impaired. 
 (Laughter) 
 We've said, could it be,that positive emotions are simply easiernto process than negative emotions,,and so you switchnto the positive emotions?,Maybe our neural centers in our brain,are degraded such that we're unablento process negative emotions anymore.,But that's not the case.,The most mentally sharp older adults,are the ones who shownthis positivity effect the most.,And under conditionsnwhere it really matters,,older people do processnthe negative information,just as well as the positive information. 
 So how can this be?,Well, in our research,,we've found that these changesnare grounded fundamentally,in the uniquely humannability to monitor time --,not just clock timenand calendar time, but lifetime.,And if there's a paradox of aging,,it's that recognizingnthat we won't live forever,changes our perspective on lifenin positive ways.,When time horizons are long and nebulous,nas they typically are in youth,,people are constantly preparing,,trying to soak up all the informationnthey possibly can,,taking risks, exploring.,We might spend time with peoplenwe don't even like,because it's somehow interesting.,We might learn something unexpected. 
 (Laughter) 
 We go on blind dates. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, after all,,if it doesn't work out,nthere's always tomorrow.,People over 50 don't go on blind dates. 
 (Laughter) 
 As we age, our time horizons grow shorternand our goals change.,When we recognize that we don't havenall the time in the world,,we see our priorities most clearly.,We take less notice of trivial matters.,We savor life.,We're more appreciative,,more open to reconciliation.,We invest in more emotionallynimportant parts of life,,and life gets better,,so we're happier day-to-day.,But that same shift in perspective,leads us to have less tolerancenthan ever for injustice. 
 By 2015,,there will be more peoplenin the United States,over the age of 60 than under 15.,What will happen to societiesnthat are top-heavy with older people?,The numbers won't determine the outcome.,Culture will.,If we invest in science and technology,and find solutions for the real problemsnthat older people face,and we capitalize on the very realnstrengths of older people,,then added years of life can dramaticallynimprove quality of life at all ages.,Societies with millions of talented,nemotionally stable citizens,who are healthier and better educatednthan any generations before them,,armed with knowledgenabout the practical matters of life,and motivated to solve the big issues,can be better societiesnthan we have ever known. 
 My father, who is 92, likes to say,,"Let's stop talkingnonly about how to save the old folks,and start talking aboutnhow to get them to save us all." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There have been many revolutionsnover the last century,,but perhaps none as significantnas the longevity revolution.,We are living on averagentoday 34 years longer,than our great-grandparents did --nthink about that.,That's an entire second adult lifetime,that's been added to our lifespan.,And yet, for the most part,,our culture has not come to termsnwith what this means.,We're still living with the old paradigm,of age as an arch.,That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.,You're born, you peak at midlife,and decline into decrepitude. 
 (Laughter) 
 Age as pathology. 
 But many people today -- philosophers,nartists, doctors, scientists --,are taking a new looknat what I call "the third act" --,the last three decades of life.,They realize that this is actuallyna developmental stage of life,with its own significance,,as different from midlifenas adolescence is from childhood.,And they are asking --nwe should all be asking:,How do we use this time?,How do we live it successfully?,What is the appropriatennew metaphor for aging? 
 I've spent the last year researchingnand writing about this subject.,And I have come to findnthat a more appropriate metaphor for aging,is a staircase --,the upward ascension of the human spirit,,bringing us into wisdom,nwholeness, and authenticity.,Age not at all as pathology.,Age as potential.,And guess what?,This potential is not for the lucky few.,It turns out, most people over 50,feel better, are less stressed,nless hostile, less anxious.,We tend to see commonalitiesnmore than differences.,Some of the studies even saynwe're happier. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is not what I expected, trust me.,I come from a long line of depressives.,As I was approaching my late 40s,,when I would wake up in the morning,,my first six thoughtsnwould all be negative.,And I got scared.,I thought, "Oh my gosh.nI'm going to become a crotchety old lady.",But now that I am actually smack-dabnin the middle of my own third act,,I realize I've never been happier.,I have such a powerfulnfeeling of well-being.,And I've discovered,that when you're inside oldness,,as opposed to lookingnat it from the outside,,fear subsides.,You realize you're still yourself --,maybe even more so.,Picasso once said, "It takesna long time to become young." 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't want to romanticize aging.,Obviously, there's no guarantee,that it can be a timenof fruition and growth.,Some of it is a matter of luck.,Some of it, obviously, is genetic.,One third of it, in fact, is genetic.,And there isn't much we can do about that.,But that means that two-thirdsnof how well we do in the third act,,we can do something about.,We're going to discuss what we can do,to make these added yearsnreally successful,,and use them to make a difference. 
 Now, let me say somethingnabout the staircase,,which may seem like an oddnmetaphor for seniors,,given the fact that many seniorsnare challenged by stairs. 
 (Laughter) 
 Myself included.,As you may know, the entire worldnoperates on a universal law:,entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.,Entropy means that everythingnin the world -- everything --,is in a state of decline and decay --,the arch.,There's only one exceptionnto this universal law,,and that is the human spirit,,which can continue to evolvenupwards, the staircase,,bringing us into wholeness,nauthenticity, and wisdom. 
 And here's an example of what I mean.,This upward ascension,can happen even in the facenof extreme physical challenges.,About three years ago,nI read an article in the New York Times.,It was about a man named Neil Selinger --,57 years old, a retired lawyer,,who had joined the writers'ngroup at Sarah Lawrence,,where he found his writer's voice.,Two years later,,he was diagnosed with ALS,ncommonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.,It's a terrible disease. It's fatal.,It wastes the body,nbut the mind remains intact.,In this article,nMr. Selinger wrote the following,to describe what was happening to him.,And I quote:,"As my muscles weakened,,my writing became stronger.,As I slowly lost my speech,,I gained my voice.,As I diminished, I grew.,As I lost so much,,I finally started to find myself.",Neil Selinger, to me,,is the embodimentnof mounting the staircase,in his third act. 
 Now we're all born with spirit, all of us,,but sometimes it gets tamped downnbeneath the challenges of life,,violence, abuse, neglect.,Perhaps our parentsnsuffered from depression.,Perhaps they weren't able to love usnbeyond how we performed in the world.,Perhaps we still suffernfrom a psychic pain, a wound.,Perhaps we feelnthat many of our relationships,have not had closure.,And so we can feel unfinished.,Perhaps the task of the third act,is to finish up the tasknof finishing ourselves. 
 For me, it began as I was approachingnmy third act, my 60th birthday.,How was I supposed to live it?,What was I supposed to accomplishnin this final act?,And I realized that,nin order to know where I was going,,I had to know where I'd been.,And so I went backnand I studied my first two acts,,trying to see who I was then,,who I really was, not who my parentsnor other people told me I was,,or treated me like I was.,But who was I?,Who were my parents --nnot as parents, but as people?,Who were my grandparents?,How did they treat my parents?,These kinds of things. 
 I discovered, a couple of years later,,that this process that I had gone through,is called by psychologistsn"doing a life review.",And they say it can give new significancenand clarity and meaning,to a person's life.,You may discover, as I did,,that a lot of thingsnthat you used to think were your fault,,a lot of things you usednto think about yourself,,really had nothing to do with you.,It wasn't your fault; you're just fine.,And you're able to go backnand forgive them.,And forgive yourself.,You're able to free yourself,from your past.,You can work to changenyour relationship to your past. 
 Now while I was writing about this,,I came upon a book calledn"Man's Search for Meaning",by Viktor Frankl.,Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist,who'd spent five yearsnin a Nazi concentration camp.,And he wrote that,nwhile he was in the camp,,he could tell, shouldnthey ever be released,,which of the people would be OK,nand which would not.,And he wrote this:,"Everything you have in lifencan be taken from you,except one thing:,your freedom to choosenhow you will respond to the situation.,This is what determinesnthe quality of the life we've lived --,not whether we've been rich or poor,,famous or unknown,,healthy or suffering.,What determines our quality of lifenis how we relate to these realities,,what kind of meaning we assign them,,what kind of attitudenwe cling to about them,,what state of mindnwe allow them to trigger." 
 Perhaps the central purposenof the third act,is to go back and to try, if appropriate,,to change our relationship to the past.,It turns out that cognitive research shows,when we are able to do this,,it manifests neurologically --,neural pathways are created in the brain.,You see, if you have, over time,,reacted negativelynto past events and people,,neural pathways are laid down,by chemical and electrical signalsnthat are sent through the brain.,And over time, these neural pathwaysnbecome hardwired.,They become the norm --neven if it's bad for us,,because it causes us stress and anxiety. 
 If, however,,we can go back and alter our relationship,,re-vision our relationshipnto past people and events,,neural pathways can change.,And if we can maintainnthe more positive feelings,about the past,,that becomes the new norm.,It's like resetting a thermostat.,It's not having experiences,that makes us wise.,It's reflecting on the experiencesnthat we've had that makes us wise,and that helps us become whole,,brings wisdom and authenticity.,It helps us becomenwhat we might have been. 
 Women start off whole, don't we?,I mean, as girls, we're feisty --n"Yeah? Who says?" 
 (Laughter) 
 We have agency.,We are the subjects of our own lives.,But very often,,many, if not most of us,nwhen we hit puberty,,we start worryingnabout fitting in and being popular.,And we become the subjectsnand objects of other people's lives.,But now, in our third acts,,it may be possible for usnto circle back to where we started,,and know it for the first time.,And if we can do that,,it will not just be for ourselves.,Older women are the largestndemographic in the world.,If we can go back and redefine ourselves,and become whole,,this will createna cultural shift in the world,,and it will give an examplento younger generations,so that they can reconceiventheir own lifespan. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option,,which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?,Now most people would answer grilled,,and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.,However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.,The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines --,specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine,,or PhIP --,(laughter),which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound. 
 A carcinogen is any substance or agent,that causes abnormal growth of cells,,which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.,They are also organic compounds,in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia,is replaced with a more complex group.,Studies show that antioxidants,are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.,However, no studies exist yet,that show how or why.,These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.,And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe,,which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. 
 Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.,And I was led to it through a series of events.,I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office --,(Laughter),which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine,and seven different fast food restaurants.,They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken,,but they were sued because of California's Proposition 65,,which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products,then the companies had to give a clear warning. 
 So I was very surprised about this.,And I was wondering why nobody knew more,about this dangerous grilled chicken,,which doesn't seem very harmful.,But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner,,and I noticed that the edges of the chicken,,which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.,And later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing,,which is where the proteins will change shape,and lose their ability to chemically function.,So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis,,saying that, could possibly,the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade,and could it be due to the differences in PH? 
 So my idea was born,,and I had the project set up and a hypothesis,,so what was my next step?,Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at,because I didn't have the equipment in my school.,I thought this would be easy,,but I emailed about 200 different people,within a five-hour radius of where I lived,,and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.,Most of the others either never responded back,,said they didn't have the time,or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.,So it was a big commitment,to drive to the lab to work multiple times.,However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab --,so I could finally start my project. 
 The first stage was completed at home,,which consisted of marinating the chicken,,grilling the chicken, amassing it,and preparing it to be transported to the lab.,The second stage was completed,at the Penn State University main campus lab,,which is where I extracted the chemicals,,changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment,and separated the compounds I needed,from the rest of the chicken.,The final stages, when I ran the samples,through a high-pressure,liquid chromatography mass spectrometer,,which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals,and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had,in my chicken. 
 So when I went through the data, I had very surprising results,,because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients,actually inhibited the carcinogen formation.,When compared with the unmarinated chicken,,which is what I used as my control,,I found that lemon juice worked by far the best,,which decreased the carcinogens,by about 98 percent.,The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade,also worked very well,,decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.,Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation,,but it was nearly negligible.,And the soy sauce results were inconclusive,because of the large data range,,but it seems like soy sauce,actually increased the potential carcinogens. 
 Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially,was the time cooked.,And I found that if you increase the time cooked,,the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.,So the best way to marinate chicken, based on this,,is to, not under-cook,,but definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken,,and marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater. 
 (Applause) 
 Based on these findings, I have a question for you.,Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet,that could potentially save your life?,Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated,,you're definitely going to catch cancer and die.,However, anything you can do,to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens,can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. 
 Is it worth it to you?,How will you cook your chicken now? 
 (Applause) 
 Shree Bose: Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose.,I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner,and then the grand prize winner.,And I want all of you,to imagine a little girl,holding a dead blue spinach plant.,And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you,that little kids will eat their vegetables,if they're different colors.,Sounds ridiculous, right.,But that was me years ago.,And that was my first science fair project.,It got a bit more complicated from there.,My older brother Panaki Bose,spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me,when I barely understood basic algebra.,My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects,,including a remote controlled garbage can. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then came the summer after my freshman year,,when my grandfather passed away due to cancer.,And I remember watching my family go through that,and thinking that I never wanted another family,to feel that kind of loss.,So, armed with all the wisdom,of freshman year biology,,I decided I wanted to do cancer research,at 15.,Good plan.,So I started emailing all of these professors in my area,asking to work under their supervision in a lab.,Got rejected by all except one.,And then went on, my next summer,,to work under Dr. Basu,at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.,And that is where the research began. 
 So ovarian cancer,is one of those cancers that most people don't know about,,or at least don't pay that much attention to.,But yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths,among women in the United States.,In fact, one in 70 women,will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.,One in 100,will die from it.,Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways,used to treat cancer today,,involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals,to try and kill off cancer cells. 
 Cisplatin is a relatively common,ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug --,a relatively simple molecule made in the lab,that messes with the DNA of cancer cells,and causes them to kill themselves.,Sounds great, right?,But here's the problem:,sometimes patients become resistant to the drug,,and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free,,they come back.,And this time, they no longer respond to the drug.,It's a huge problem.,In fact, it's one of the biggest problems,with chemotherapy today. 
 So we wanted to figure out,how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant,to this drug called Cisplatin.,And we wanted to figure this out,,because if we could figure that out,,then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.,So that's what we set out to do.,And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase,,an energy protein.,So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein,,and we saw this huge shift.,I mean, on the slide, you can see,that on our sensitive side,,these cells that are responding to the drug,,when we start blocking the protein,,the number of dying cells -- those colored dots --,they're going down.,But then on this side, with the same treatment,,they're going up -- interesting. 
 But those are dots on a screen for you;,what exactly does that mean?,Well basically that means,that this protein is changing,from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.,And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves,to make the cells resistant.,And that's huge.,In fact, it means that if a patient comes in,and they're resistant to this drug,,then if we give them a chemical to block this protein,,then we can treat them again,with the same drug.,And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness --,possibly for many different types of cancer.,So that was my work,,and it was my way of reimagining the future,for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does,,but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness --,so maybe all grandfathers with cancer,have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren. 
 But my work wasn't just about the research.,It was about finding my passion.,That's why being the grand prize winner,of the Google Global Science Fair --,cute picture, right --,it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.,And ever since then,,I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff --,from getting to meet the president,to getting to be on this stage,to talk to all of you guys. 
 But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research,,it was about finding my passion,,and it was about making my own opportunities,when I didn't even know what I was doing.,It was about inspiration,and determination,and never giving up on my interest,for science and learning and growing.,After all, my story begins,with a dried, withered spinach plant,and it's only getting better from there. 
 Thank you.

 Naomi Shah: Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah,,and today I'll be talking to you about my research,involving indoor air quality,and asthmatic patients.,1.6 million deaths worldwide.,One death every 20 seconds.,People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.,And the economic burden of asthma,exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined.,Now these statistics had a huge impact on me,,but what really sparked my interest in my research,was watching both my dad and my brother,suffer from chronic allergies year-round.,It confused me;,why did these allergy symptoms persist,well past the pollen season? 
 With this question in mind, I started researching,,and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.,As soon as I realized this,,I investigated the underlying relationship,between four prevalent air pollutants,and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.,At first, I just wanted to figure out,which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact,on the lung health of asthmatic patients.,But soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model,that essentially quantifies the effect,of these environmental pollutants,on the lung health of asthmatic patients.,And it surprises me,that no model currently exists,that quantifies the effect of environmental factors,on human lung health,,because that relationship seems so important. 
 So with that in mind,,I started researching more, I started investigating more,,and I became very passionate.,Because I realized,that if we could find a way to target remediation,,we could also find a way,to treat asthmatic patients more effectively.,For example, volatile organic compounds,are chemical pollutants,that are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.,They're everywhere.,These chemical pollutants,are currently not a criteria air pollutant,,as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.,Which is surprising to me,,because these chemical pollutants, through my research,,I show that they had a very large negative impact,on the lung health of asthmatic patients,and thus should be regulated. 
 So today I want to show you,my interactive software model that I created.,I'm going to show it to you on my laptop.,And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today,,Julie.,And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered,into my interactive software model.,And this can be used by anyone.,So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes,,or someone who's really close to you,who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.,So Julie's going to her doctor's office,to get treated for her asthma.,And the doctor has her sit down,,and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate --,which is essentially her exhalation rate,,or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath. 
 So that peak expiratory flow rate,,I've entered it up into the interactive software model.,I've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.,I've assumed that she lives in an average household,with average air pollutant levels.,So any user can come in here,and click on "lung function report",and it'll take them to this report that I created.,And this report really drives home the crux of my research. 
 So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner --,it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate,in the yellow bar.,This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.,In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph,,it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate,,what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be,based on her age, gender and height.,So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar,,and he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids,,medication and inhalers." 
 But I want everyone here to reimagine a world,where instead of prescribing steroids,,inhalers and medication,,the doctor turns to Julie and says,,"Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.,Clean out the air ducts in your home,,in your workplace, in your school.,Stop the use of incense and candles.,And if you're remodeling your house,,take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring.",Because these solutions are natural,,these solutions are sustainable,,and these solutions are long-term investments --,long-term investments that we're making,for our generation and for future generations.,Because these environmental solutions,that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school,are impacting everyone that lives around her. 
 So I'm very passionate about this research,and I really want to continue it,and expand it to more disorders besides asthma,,more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.,But before I end my talk today,,I want to leave you with one saying.,And that saying is that genetics loads the gun,,but the environment pulls the trigger.,And that made a huge impact on me,when I was doing this research.,Because what I feel, is a lot of us think,that the environment is at a macro level,,that we can't do anything to change our air quality,or to change the climate or anything. 
 But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home,,in our own school and in our own workplace,,we can make a huge difference in air quality.,Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.,And air quality and air pollutants,have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients,,anyone with a respiratory disorder,and really all of us in general. 
 So I want you to reimagine a world,with better air quality,,better quality of life,and better quality of living for everyone,including our future generations. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Lisa Ling: Right.,Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly?,Your Google Science Fair champions.,Your winners. 
 (Applause)My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan,about two years ago.,I was in the desert, under the starry skies,with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.,And we were in conversation,about how nothing had changed,since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata." 
 So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel,we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.,Now we do the same with airplanes.,Back then,,when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,,when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,,he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.,Now we do the same,with drills and machines. 
 The conclusion that we came to,was that magic had been replaced,by machinery.,And this made me really sad.,I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.,I was terrified by this idea,that I would lose the ability,to enjoy and appreciate the sunset,without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.,And it felt like technology,should enable magic, not kill it. 
 When I was a little girl,,my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.,And this piece of 50-year-old technology,became the most magical thing to me.,It became a gilded gateway,into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks,and images in my imagination.,So I felt like our cellphones,and our fancy watches and our cameras,had stopped us from dreaming.,They stopped us from being inspired.,And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,,to see how I could use it to enable magic,as opposed to kill it. 
 I've been illustrating books since I was 16.,And so when I saw the iPad,,I saw it as a storytelling device,that could connect readers all over the world.,It can know how we're holding it.,It can know where we are.,It brings together image and text,and animation and sound and touch.,Storytelling is becoming,more and more multi-sensorial.,But what are we doing with it? 
 So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,,an interactive app for the iPad.,So it says, "Place your fingers,upon each light.",And so --,(Music),It says, "This box belongs to ... ",And so I type in my name.,And actually I become a character in the book.,At various points, a little letter drops down to me --,and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --,which is actually addressed to me.,The child in me is really excited,by these kinds of possibilities. 
 Now I've been talking a lot about magic.,And I don't mean wizards and dragons,,I mean the kind of childhood magic,,those ideas that we all harbored as children.,This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,,was always really exciting to me.,And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,,take the fireflies out.,And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book. 
 Another idea that really fascinated me as a child,was that an entire galaxy could be contained,within a single marble.,And so over here,,each book and each world,becomes a little marble,that I drag in,to this magical device within the device.,And it opens up a map.,All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,,but these maps have been static.,This is a map that grows and glows,and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.,It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.,So I'm just going to enter in. 
 Another thing that's actually really important to me,is creating content that is Indian,and yet very contemporary.,Over here, these are the Apsaras.,So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,,but how many people outside of India,know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?,These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years,in an old and musty book.,And so we're bringing them back,in a contemporary story for children.,And a story that actually deals with new issues,like the environmental crisis.,(Music) 
 Speaking of the environmental crisis,,I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years,is that children have been locked inside their rooms,,glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.,But now with mobile technology,,we can actually take our children outside into the natural world,with their technology.,One of the interactions in the book,is that you're sent off on this quest,where you need to go outside,,take out your camera on the iPad,and collect pictures of different natural objects. 
 When I was a child, I had multiple collections,of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.,And somehow kids don't do that anymore.,So in bringing back this childhood ritual,,you need to go out,and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower,and then tag it.,In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark,and then tag that.,And what happens,is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs,that you can then put up online.,A child in London puts up a picture of a fox,and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today.",A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today.",And it creates this kind of social network,around a collection of digital photographs,that you've actually taken. 
 In the possibilities of linking together,magic, the earth and technology,,there are multiple possibilities.,In the next book, we plan on having an interaction,where you take your iPad out with the video on,and through augmented reality,,you see this layer of animated pixies,appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.,At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.,And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away,and read the rest of the book. 
 We're moving, we're all moving here,,to a world where the forces of nature,come closer together to technology,,and magic and technology can come closer together.,We're harnessing energy from the sun.,We're bringing our children and ourselves,closer to the natural world,and that magic and joy,and childhood love that we had,through the simple medium of a story. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,,for his storytelling,,but even more, I think,,for the beauty and precision of his prose.,And whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude",or the fantastical stream of consciousness,in "Autumn of the Patriarch,",where the words rush by,,page after page of unpunctuated imagery,sweeping the reader along,like some wild river,twisting through a primal South American jungle,,reading Márquez is a visceral experience.,Which struck me as particularly remarkable,during one session with the novel,when I realized that I was being swept along,on this remarkable, vivid journey,in translation. 
 Now I was a comparative literature major in college,,which is like an English major,,only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,,we got to read great literature in translation,from around the world.,And as great as these books were,,you could always tell,that you were getting close to the full effect.,But not so with Márquez,who once praised his translator's versions,as being better than his own,,which is an astonishing compliment. 
 So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,,had written his own book on the subject,,I couldn't wait to read it.,It's called apropos of the Italian adage,that I lifted from his forward,,"If This Be Treason.",And it's a charming read.,It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested,in the translator's art.,But the reason that I mention it,is that early on, Rabassa offers,this elegantly simple insight:,"Every act of communication,is an act of translation." 
 Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,,but for me,,as often as I'd encountered,that exact difficulty on a daily basis,,I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication,in so crystalline a light.,Ever since I can remember,thinking consciously about such things,,communication has been my central passion.,Even as a child,,I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life,was to be able to understand everything,and then to communicate it to everyone else.,So no ego problems.,It's funny, my wife, Daisy,,whose family is littered with schizophrenics --,and I mean littered with them --,once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God.,I don't need a husband who wants to be." 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, as I plunged through my 20s,ever more aware of how unobtainable,the first part of my childhood ambition was,,it was that second part,,being able to successfully communicate to others,whatever knowledge I was gaining,,where the futility of my quest really set in.,Time after time,,whenever I set out to share some great truth,with a soon-to-be grateful recipient,,it had the opposite effect.,Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is,,"Hey, listen up,,because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,",it's amazing how quickly you'll discover,both ice and the firing squad. 
 Finally, after about 10 years,of alienating friends and strangers alike,,I finally got it,,a new personal truth all my own,,that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people,the ideas that I was gaining,,I'd better find a different way of going about it.,And that's when I discovered comedy. 
 Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength,from other forms of language.,If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,,I'd say it falls somewhere,between poetry and lies.,And I'm not talking about all comedy here,,because, clearly, there's plenty of humor,that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.,What I want to talk about,is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has,at circumventing our ingrained perspectives --,comedy as the philosopher's stone.,It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom,and transforms it through ridicule,into a different way of seeing,and ultimately being in the world.,Because that's what I take,from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.,That it's about communication,that doesn't just produce greater understanding,within the individual,,but leads to real change.,Which in my experience means communication,that manages to speak to and expand,our concept of self-interest.,Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest,because we're all wired for that.,It's part of our survival package,,and that's why it's become so important for us,,and that's why we're always listening at that level.,And also because that's where,,in terms of our own self-interest,,we finally begin to grasp,our ability to respond, our responsibility,to the rest of the world. 
 Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,,I mean work that comes first and foremost,from a place of honesty and integrity.,Now if you think back,on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live,of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate,Sarah Palin,,they were devastating.,Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit,the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,,cementing an impression,that the majority of the American public still holds today.,And the key detail of this,is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her,and they weren't written by the SNL writers.,They were lifted verbatim,from Palin's own remarks.,(Laughter),Here was a Palin impersonator,quoting Palin word for word.,Now that's honesty and integrity,,and it's also why Fey's performances,left such a lasting impression. 
 On the other side of the political spectrum,,the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh,refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl,I knew that he'd made a direct hit.,Now it's not often that I'm going to associate,the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,,but it's really hard to argue with that punchline.,The description perfectly captured,Edwards' personal vanity.,And guess what?,That ended up being the exact personality trait,that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career. 
 Now The Daily Show with John Stewart,is by far the most --,(Applause),(Laughter),it's by far the most well-documented example,of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.,Survey after survey,,from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,,has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events,than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows. 
 (Applause) 
 Now whether this says more,about the conflict between integrity and profitability,of corporate journalism,than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,,the larger point remains,that Stewart's material,is always grounded in a commitment to the facts --,not because his intent is to inform. It's not.,His intent is to be funny.,It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny,doesn't work unless the facts are true.,And the result is great comedy,that's also an information delivery system,that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention,than the professional news media.,Now this is doubly ironic,when you consider that what gives comedy its edge,at reaching around people's walls,is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection. 
 A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,,where you think it's going over here,and then all of a sudden you're transported over here.,And there's this mental delight,that's followed by the physical response of laughter,,which, not coincidentally,,releases endorphins in the brain.,And just like that, you've been seduced,into a different way of looking at something,because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.,This is the exact opposite,of the way that anger and fear and panic,,all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.,Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin,,which throws our walls up sky-high.,And the comedy comes along,,dealing with a lot of the same areas,where our defenses are the strongest --,race, religion, politics, sexuality --,only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,,we get endorphins,and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,,revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view. 
 Now let me give you an example from my act.,I have some material,about the so-called radical gay agenda,,which starts off by asking,,how radical is the gay agenda?,Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most,are to join the military, get married and start a family.,(Laughter),Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life.,(Laughter),Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's followed by these lines,about gay adoption:,What is the problem with gay adoption?,Why is this remotely controversial?,If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,,you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.,(Laughter),You have given birth to an abomination.,Remove it from your household.,Now by taking the biblical epithet "abomination",and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,,this joke short circuits the emotional wiring,behind the debate,and it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,,to question its validity. 
 Misdirection isn't the only trick,that comedy has up its sleeve.,Economy of language,is another real strong suit of great comedy.,There are few phrases,that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol,than the perfect punchline.,Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work,,you should really Google him --,Hicks had a routine,about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,,where finally the other kid says to him,,"Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,",to which Hicks replies,,"Really? How soon?",(Laughter),That's an entire childhood,in three words.,(Laughter),Not to mention what it reveals,about the adult who's speaking them. 
 And one last powerful attribute,that comedy has as communication,is that it's inherently viral.,People can't wait,to pass along that new great joke.,And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.,Comedy has been crossing country,with remarkable speed,way before the Internet, social media,,even cable TV.,Back in 1980,when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire,during a freebasing accident,,I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened,and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.,And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts --,something about the Ignited Negro College Fund.,Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.,And my guess here -- and I have no research on this --,is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,,you'd find out that comedy,is the second oldest viral profession.,First there were drums,and then knock-knock jokes. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's when you put all of these elements together --,when you get the viral appeal of a great joke,with a powerful punchline,that's crafted from honesty and integrity,,it can have a real world impact,at changing a conversation.,Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett,,who's the editorial cartoonist,for the Lexington Herald-Leader.,And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.,I was visiting with Joel,the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened,in December of 2009.,And Joel was explaining to me,that, because USA Today,was one of America's four papers of record,,it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,,which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon,on Monday, the opening day of the conference,,it could get passed around,at the highest level among actual decision-makers. 
 So we started talking about climate change.,And it turned out that Joel and I,were both bothered by the same thing,,which was how so much of the debate,was still focused on the science,and how complete it was or wasn't,,which, to both of us,,seems somewhat intentionally off point.,Because first of all, there's this false premise,that such a thing as complete science exists.,Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas,was pushing this same line this past summer,at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign,for the Republican presidential nomination,,proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete,at the same time that 250,out of 254 counties in the state of Texas,were on fire.,And Perry's policy solution,was to ask the people of Texas,to pray for rain.,Personally, I was praying for four more fires,so we could finally complete the damn science. 
 (Laughter) 
 But back in 2009,,the question Joel and I kept turning over and over,was why this late in the game,so much energy was being spent talking about the science,when the policies necessary to address climate change,were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run,regardless of the science.,So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.,Cartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?",(Laughter),You've got to love that idea.,(Applause),How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?,Not for God, not for country, not for profit --,just as a basic metric for global decision-making. 
 And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.,Shortly after the conference was over,,Joel got a request for a signed copy,from the head of the EPA in Washington,whose wall it now hangs on.,And not long after that, he got another request for a copy,from the head of the EPA in California,who used it as part of her presentation,at an international conference on climate change,in Sacramento last year.,And it didn't stop there.,To date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,,in the United States, Canada and Europe.,And earlier this year,,he got a request from the Green Party in Australia,who used it in their campaign,where it became part of the debate,that resulted in the Australian parliament,adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime,of any country in the world.,(Applause),That is a lot of punch,for 14 words. 
 So my suggestion to those of you out here,who are seriously focused on creating a better world,is to take a little bit of time each day,and practice thinking funny,,because you might just find the question that you've been looking for. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Two years ago, after having served four years,in the United States Marine Corps,and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,,I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team,of veterans and medical professionals,in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,,three days after the earthquake.,We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,,the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,,we realized something. Military veterans,are very, very good at disaster response.,And coming home, my cofounder and I,,we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.,The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.,It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,,and it's not using the best people.,The second problem that we became aware of,was a very inadequate veteran reintegration,,and this is a topic that is front page news right now,as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,,and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.,And we sat here and we looked at these two problems,,and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.,These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that? 
 Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity,for service for the veterans coming home.,Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want,to continue their service when they take off their uniform.,And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.,Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,,we responded to the tsunami in Chile,,the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.,But it was earlier this year, when one of our,original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. 
 This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.,We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.,Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.,Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.,This was a tragedy, but it really forced us,to refocus what it is that we were doing.,You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened,in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself,because of what he lost when he came home.,He lost purpose. He lost his community.,And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth. 
 And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled,from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems --,in the initial iteration of our organization,,we were a disaster response organization that was using,veteran service. We had a lot of success,,and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.,But after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,,now moving forward, we see ourselves,as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.,Because we think that we can give that purpose,and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.,And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later,Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that. 
 Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy,who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.,He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.,They send him to Iraq.,Every day he leaves the wire with a mission.,That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.,It's to keep the men around him alive.,It's to pacify the village that he works in.,He's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,,maybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job,,but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.,You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri,after a tornado, he regains that. 
 Going back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school,in Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army,,the Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.,Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.,He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.,He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.,They've eaten together. They've bled together.,He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.,He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.,He doesn't have that community anymore.,But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,,they get that sense of community back. 
 Again, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates,high school in Kansas City.,He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.,They send him to Iraq.,They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.,He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones,in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.,He doesn't have that same self-worth.,But you send him to Joplin after a tornado,,and somebody once again is walking up to him,and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,,now they have self-worth again. 
 I think it's very important, because right now,somebody needs to step up,,and this generation of veterans has the opportunity,to do that if they are given the chance.,Thank you very much. (Applause)There's a poem written,by a very famous English poet,at the end of the 19th century.,It was said to echo in Churchill's brain,in the 1930s.,And the poem goes:,"On the idle hill of summer,,lazy with the flow of streams,,hark I hear a distant drummer,,drumming like a sound in dreams,,far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,,dear to friend and food to powder,,soldiers marching,,soon to die.",Those who are interested in poetry,,the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman. 
 But what Housman understood,,and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,,was that the long, hot, silvan summers,of stability of the 19th century,were coming to a close,,and that we were about to move,into one of those terrifying periods of history,when power changes.,And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,,accompanied by turbulence,,and all too often by blood. 
 And my message for you,is that I believe we are condemned, if you like,,to live at just one of those moments in history,when the gimbals upon which,the established order of power is beginning to change,and the new look of the world,,the new powers that exist in the world,,are beginning to take form.,And these are -- and we see it very clearly today --,nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,,and all too often very bloody times.,By the way, it happens about once every century. 
 You might argue that the last time it happened --,and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too --,was that when power passed from the old nations,,the old powers of Europe,,across the Atlantic to the new emerging power,of the United States of America --,the beginning of the American century.,And of course, into the vacuum,where the too-old European powers used to be,were played the two bloody catastrophes,of the last century --,the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.,Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,,and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them. 
 Well, ladies and gentlemen,,we live at one of those times.,But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.,And the first of these, the first two of these,,is about a shift in power.,And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,,which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.,But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.,And what is happening today,is, in one sense, frightening,because it's never happened before.,We have seen lateral shifts of power --,the power of Greece passed to Rome,and the power shifts that occurred,during the European civilizations --,but we are seeing something slightly different.,For power is not just moving laterally,from nation to nation.,It's also moving vertically. 
 What's happening today is that the power that was encased,,held to accountability, held to the rule of law,,within the institution of the nation state,has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.,The globalization of power --,we talk about the globalization of markets,,but actually it's the globalization of real power.,And where, at the nation state level,that power is held to accountability,subject to the rule of law,,on the international stage it is not.,The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:,the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,,the power of the money changers --,this vast money-go-round,that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary,for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance --,the money changers, if you like,,the financial speculators,that have brought us all to our knees quite recently,,the power of the multinational corporations,now developing budgets,often bigger than medium-sized countries.,These live in a global space,which is largely unregulated,,not subject to the rule of law,,and in which people may act free of constraint. 
 Now that suits the powerful,up to a moment.,It's always suitable for those who have the most power,to operate in spaces without constraint,,but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,,unregulated space --,space not subject to the rule of law --,becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted --,international trade, the Internet, etc. --,but also by the things you don't want --,international criminality, international terrorism.,The revelation of 9/11,is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,,nevertheless,,those who inhabit that space can attack you,even in your most iconic of cities,one bright September morning.,It's said that something like 60 percent,of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11,actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers,which 9/11 destroyed.,You see, our enemies also use this space --,the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters --,to be able to get around their poison,,which is about destroying our systems and our ways. 
 Sooner or later,,sooner or later,,the rule of history,is that where power goes,governance must follow.,And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,,that one of the phenomenon of our time,is the globalization of power,,then it follows that one of the challenges of our time,is to bring governance to the global space.,And I believe that the decades ahead of us now,will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent,the more or less we are able to achieve that aim:,to bring governance to the global space. 
 Now notice, I'm not talking about government.,I'm not talking about setting up,some global democratic institution.,My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,,is that this is unlikely to be done,by spawning more U.N. institutions.,If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.,The world needs an international forum.,It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.,But when it comes to governance of the global space,,my guess is this won't happen,through the creation of more U.N. institutions.,It will actually happen by the powerful coming together,and making treaty-based systems,,treaty-based agreements,,to govern that global space. 
 And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.,The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,,entirely treaty-based,,and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,,to account if necessary.,Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create,a treaty-based organization.,The G20:,we know now that we have to put together an institution,which is capable of bringing governance,to that financial space for financial speculation.,And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution. 
 Now there's a problem there,,and we'll come back to it in a minute,,which is that if you bring the most powerful together,to make the rules in treaty-based institutions,,to fill that governance space,,then what happens to the weak who are left out?,And that's a big problem,,and we'll return to it in just a second. 
 So there's my first message,,that if you are to pass through these turbulent times,more or less turbulently,,then our success in doing that,will in large measure depend on our capacity,to bring sensible governance,to the global space.,And watch that beginning to happen.,My second point is,,and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this,about such a thing,,but power is not just shifting vertically,,it's also shifting horizontally. 
 You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,,has been civilizations gathered around seas --,with the first ones around the Mediterranean,,the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.,Well it seems to me,that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,,away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard],to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.,Now that begins with economic power,,but that's the way it always begins.,You already begin to see the development of foreign policies,,the augmentation of military budgets,occurring in the other growing powers in the world.,I think actually,this is not so much a shift from the West to the East;,something different is happening. 
 My guess is, for what it's worth,,is that the United States will remain,the most powerful nation on earth,for the next 10 years, 15,,but the context in which she holds her power,has now radically altered; it has radically changed.,We are coming out of 50 years,,most unusual years, of history,in which we have had a totally mono-polar world,,in which every compass needle,for or against,has to be referenced by its position to Washington --,a world bestrode by a single colossus.,But that's not a usual case in history.,In fact, what's now emerging,is the much more normal case of history.,You're beginning to see the emergence,of a multi-polar world. 
 Up until now,,the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.,They will remain the most powerful nation,,but they will be the most powerful nation,in an increasingly multi-polar world.,And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up --,in China, of course,,though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.,It's going to be quite grumpy,as China begins to democratize her society,after liberalizing her economy.,But that's a subject of a different discussion.,You see India, you see Brazil.,You see increasingly,that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,,much more like Europe in the 19th century. 
 Europe in the 19th century:,a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,,used to describe it as the "European concert of powers.",There was a balance, a five-sided balance.,Britain always played to the balance.,If Paris got together with Berlin,,Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.,Now notice,,in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,,you have fixed alliances --,NATO, the Warsaw Pact.,A fixed polarity of power,means fixed alliances.,But a multiple polarity of power,means shifting and changing alliances.,And that's the world we're coming into,,in which we will increasingly see,that our alliances are not fixed.,Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said,,"Britain has a common interest,,but no common allies.",And we will see increasingly,that even we in the West,will reach out, have to reach out,,beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers,to make alliances with others,if we want to get things done in the world. 
 Note, that when we went into Libya,,it was not good enough for the West to do it alone;,we had to bring others in.,We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.,My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times,when the West has tried to do it themselves,,and we haven't succeeded.,My guess,is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years --,I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire --,of the hegemony of Western power,,Western institutions and Western values.,You know, up until now, if the West got its act together,,it could propose and dispose,in every corner of the world.,But that's no longer true.,Take the last financial crisis,after the Second World War.,The West got together --,the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund --,the problem solved.,Now we have to call in others.,Now we have to create the G20.,Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle,of our Western friends. 
 Let me make a prediction for you,,which is probably even more startling.,I suspect we are now reaching the end,of 400 years,when Western power was enough.,People say to me, "The Chinese, of course,,they'll never get themselves involved,in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world.",Oh yes? Why not?,How many Chinese troops,are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,,serving under the U.N. command in the world today?,3,700.,How many Americans? 11.,What is the largest naval contingent,tackling the issue of Somali pirates?,The Chinese naval contingent.,Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.,They want to keep the sea lanes open.,Increasingly, we are going to have to do business,with people with whom we do not share values,,but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.,It's a whole new different way,of looking at the world that is now emerging. 
 And here's the third factor,,which is totally different.,Today in our modern world,,because of the Internet,,because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,,everything is connected to everything.,We are now interdependent.,We are now interlocked,,as nations, as individuals,,in a way which has never been the case before,,never been the case before.,The interrelationship of nations,,well it's always existed.,Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.,But now we are intimately locked together.,You get swine flu in Mexico,,it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport,24 hours later.,Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.,There are fires in the steppes of Russia,,food riots in Africa. 
 We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.,And what that means,is the idea of a nation state acting alone,,not connected with others,,not working with others,,is no longer a viable proposition.,Because the actions of a nation state,are neither confined to itself,,nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself,to control its own territory,,because the effects outside the nation state,are now beginning to affect what happens inside them. 
 I was a young soldier,in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.,At that time, the defense of my country,was about one thing and one thing only:,how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,,how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.,That was when the enemy was outside the walls.,Now the enemy is inside the walls.,Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,,I have to speak to the Minister of Health,because pandemic disease is a threat to my security,,I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture,because food security is a threat to my security,,I have to speak to the Minister of Industry,because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure,is now a point of attack for our enemies --,as we see from cyber warfare --,I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs,because who has entered my country,,who lives in that terraced house in that inner city,has a direct effect on what happens in my country --,as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.,It's no longer the case that the security of a country,is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.,It's its capacity to lock together its institutions. 
 And this tells you something very important.,It tells you that, in fact,,our governments, vertically constructed,,constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution --,vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks,,command structures --,have got the wrong structures completely.,You in business know,that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,,is the network.,It's your capacity to network that matters,,both within your governments and externally. 
 So here is Ashdown's third law.,By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law,because I haven't invented those yet;,it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?,Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age,,where everything is connected to everything,,the most important thing about what you can do,is what you can do with others.,The most important bit about your structure --,whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,,whether you're a business --,is your docking points, your interconnectors,,your capacity to network with others.,You understand that in industry;,governments don't. 
 But now one final thing.,If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is --,that we are now locked together,in a way that has never been quite the same before,,then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.,Suddenly and for the very first time,,collective defense, the thing that has dominated us,as the concept of securing our nations,,is no longer enough.,It used to be the case,that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;,if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;,my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.,It is no longer the case.,The advent of the interconnectedness,and of the weapons of mass destruction,means that, increasingly,,I share a destiny with my enemy. 
 When I was a diplomat,negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union,in Geneva in the 1970s,,we succeeded because we understood,we shared a destiny with them.,Collective security is not enough.,Peace has come to Northern Ireland,because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.,They shared a destiny with their enemies.,One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East,is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,,do not understand,that they share a collective destiny.,And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen,,what has been the proposition,of visionaries and poets down the ages,becomes something we have to take seriously,as a matter of public policy. 
 I started with a poem, I'll end with one.,The great poem of John Donne's.,"Send not for whom the bell tolls.",The poem is called "No Man is an Island.",And it goes:,"Every man's death affected me,,for I am involved in mankind,,send not to ask,for whom the bell tolls,,it tolls for thee.",For John Donne, a recommendation of morality.,For us, I think,,part of the equation for our survival. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)
