The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated,to presenting great American lives,,amazing people.,And that's what it's about.,We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.,And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.,I'm going to talk about a program I started there,,which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did. 
 I started to worry about the fact,that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,,and they're amazing people,,and we want to deliver them to future generations.,So, how do we do that?,And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.,And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically,my being a brush in the hand,of amazing people who would come and I would interview. 
 And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you,the great hits of that program,,as to give you this whole notion,of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,,what you try to find out about them,,and when people deliver and when they don't and why. 
 Now, I had two preconditions.,One was that they be American.,That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,,it's created to look at American lives.,That was easy, but then I made the decision,,maybe arbitrary,,that they needed to be people of a certain age,,which at that point, when I created this program,,seemed really old.,Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.,For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me. 
 And why did I do that?,Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.,And I thought really what we need is an elders program,to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.,But the second part of it -- and the older I get,,the more convinced I am that that's true.,It's amazing what people will say when they know,how the story turned out.,That's the one advantage that older people have.,Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,,but they also have some disadvantages,,but the one thing they or we have is that,we've reached the point in life,where we know how the story turned out.,So, we can then go back in our lives,,if we've got an interviewer who gets that,,and begin to reflect on how we got there.,All of those accidents that wound up,creating the life narrative that we inherited. 
 So, I thought okay, now,,what is it going to take to make this work?,There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.,There are the journalist interviews,,which are the interrogation that is expected.,This is somewhat against resistance,and caginess on the part of the interviewee.,Then there's the celebrity interview,,where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.,That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.,That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important,as Nixon in that process.,Fair enough. 
 But I wanted interviews that were different.,I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,,which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say,and to be an agent of their self-revelation.,By the way, this was always done in public.,This was not an oral history program.,This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,,and having me be the brush in their self-portrait. 
 Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.,I didn't know it coming into it.,And the only reason I really know that,is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,,and that was six months after he'd had a stroke.,And he had never appeared in public since that point.,This was not a devastating stroke,,but it did affect his speaking and so forth.,And I thought it was worth a chance,,he thought it was worth a chance,,and so we got up on the stage,,and we had an hour conversation about his life,,and after that a woman rushed up to me,,essentially did,,and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?" 
 And I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that." 
 And she said, "Well, something very weird was happening.,When he started a sentence, particularly,in the early parts of the interview,,and paused, you gave him the word,,the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,,and by the end of it,,he was speaking complete sentences on his own.",I didn't know what was going on,,but I was so part of the process of getting that out. 
 So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,,or empathy, at any rate,,is what's critical to this kind of interview.,But then I began to think of other things.,Who makes a great interview in this context?,It had nothing to do with their intellect,,the quality of their intellect.,Some of them were very brilliant,,some of them were,,you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,,but it was never about that.,It was about their energy.,It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews,and extraordinary lives.,I'm convinced of it.,And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.,These were people through their 90s. 
 In fact, the first person I interviewed,was George Abbott, who was 97,,and Abbott was filled with the life force --,I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.,And so he filled the room,,and we had an extraordinary conversation.,He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do,because he was famous for being silent,,for never ever saying anything,except maybe a word or two.,And, in fact, he did wind up opening up --,by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.,He subsequently got married again at 102,,so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him. 
 But after the interview, I got a call,,very gruff voice, from a woman.,I didn't know who she was,,and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?" 
 And I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did." 
 And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,,and I could never do it.",And then she made me go up with the tape of it,and prove that George Abbott actually could talk. 
 So, you know, you want energy,,you want the life force,,but you really want them also to think,that they have a story worth sharing.,The worst interviews that you can ever have,are with people who are modest.,Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,,because all of these people have been assembled,to listen to them, and they sit there and they say,,"Aw, shucks, it was an accident.",There's nothing that ever happens that justifies,people taking good hours of the day to be with them. 
 The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.,The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.",This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,,and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.,Didn't matter." Whatever.,Awful.,I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.,They have to think that they did something,and that they want to share it with you. 
 But it comes down, in the end,,to how do you get through all the barriers we have.,All of us are public and private beings,,and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,,there's no point in it.,It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,,and we all have infomercials about our lives.,We know the great lines, we know the great moments,,we know what we're not going to share,,and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.,This wasn't -- and some of you will remember,Mike Wallace's old interviews --,tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place. 
 I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,,to break out of their own cocoon of the public self,,and the more public they had been,,the more entrenched that person, that outer person was.,And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment,that happened in this interview series.,It all has to do with that shell that most of us have,,and particularly certain people. 
 There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.,It'll be your generational determinant,as to whether her name means much to you.,She did so much. She was a playwright.,She did an extraordinary play called "The Women.",She was a congresswoman,when there weren't very many congresswomen.,She was editor of Vanity Fair,,one of the great phenomenal women of her day.,And, incidentally, I call her,the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.,She was sort of adored on the Right,the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.,And, in fact, when we did the interview --,I did the living self-portrait with her --,there were three former directors of the CIA,basically sitting at her feet,,just enjoying her presence. 
 And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,,because I always have preliminary talks with these people,for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.,We never talk before that because if you talk before,,you don't get it on the stage.,So she and I had a delightful conversation. 
 We were on the stage and then --,by the way, spectacular.,It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.,She was in a great evening gown.,She was 80, almost that day of the interview,,and there she was and there I was,,and I just proceeded into the questions.,And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.,Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,,and I was basically up there -- any of you,in the moderate-to-full entertainment world,know what it is to die onstage.,And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing. 
 And I began to wonder what was going on,,and you think while you talk,,and basically, I thought, I got it.,When we were alone, I was her audience.,Now I'm her competitor for the audience.,That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,,and so then I asked her a question --,I didn't know how I was going to get out of it --,I asked her a question about her days as a playwright,,and again, characteristically,,instead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,",she said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.,Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.",But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,,and she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.,It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,,and I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage." 
 And then she turned to me and said,,"And you know what those young actors did?,They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?",Just withering in her contempt. 
 And I said, "I'm learning." 
 (Laughter) 
 And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,,and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account,of what her life really was like. 
 I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.,Again, a remarkable person.,I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,,I'm attracted to her.,And the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.,That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,,and very few of us were invited to a dinner party. 
 And she was in horrible pain.,We all knew that.,She stayed in her room.,Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes.,The usual sort of thing.,Then at a certain moment, the door opened,and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.,The public self, the beauty, the intellect,,and she walked around and talked to every person there,and then went back into the room and was never seen again.,She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly. 
 Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,,and this is just a brief reference.,It wasn't this arm-wrestle,,but it was a little surprising for the person involved.,I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.,And we were sitting there,,and almost toward the beginning of the interview,,I turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,,it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.,Was yours unhappy?" 
 And he looked at me, you know, as if to say,,"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?",And then he turned to me, not stupidly,,and he said, "What was your childhood like?" 
 And I said -- these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate --,and I said, "My father was loving and supportive,,which is why I'm not funny." 
 (Laughter) 
 And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.,His father was an SOB,,and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,,but then we were off and running.,So the question is:,What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed? 
 Now, these are arm wrestle questions,,but I want to tell you about questions,that are more related to empathy,and that really, very often, are the questions,that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.,And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints. 
 One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.,Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.,He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,,spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,,and by the way, at one point I asked him,,"Would you like to have met him?" 
 And he said, "Well, of course,,but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,,because I got to read all of his letters.",So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years. 
 And I asked him one question.,I said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?" 
 And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson,and connecting with him,,and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.,Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.,But he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so.",He said, "You know, I've read everything,,and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit." 
 And he basically was saying that this was a man,who lied more than he wished he had,,because he saw the letters.,He said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that.",He said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,,so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation." 
 And he said, "Now, John Adams was too honest.",And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,,and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,,and he and she had exactly the relationship,of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.,She was the New Englander and abrasive,,and he was this courtly fellow. 
 But really the most important question I ever asked,,and most of the times when I talk about it,,people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,,but I promise you it was the right question.,This was to Agnes de Mille.,Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.,She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,",transforming the American theater.,An amazing woman. 
 At the time that I proposed to her that --,by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --,but proposed to her that she come on.,She said, "Come to my apartment.",She lived in New York.,"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,,and then we'll decide whether we proceed." 
 And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,,and she called out to me, and she was in bed.,I had known that she had had a stroke,,and that was some 10 years before.,And so she spent almost all of her life in bed,,but -- I speak of the life force --,her hair was askew.,She wasn't about to make up for this occasion. 
 And she was sitting there surrounded by books,,and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment,was her will, which she had by her side.,She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.,She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,,and I change it all the time,just because I want to.",And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.,I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series. 
 She agreed.,She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.,Half of her body was stricken, the other half not.,She was, of course, done up for the occasion,,but this was a woman in great physical distress.,And we had a conversation,,and then I asked her this unthinkable question.,I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?" 
 And the audience just -- you know,,they're always on the side of the interviewee,,and they felt that this was a kind of assault,,but this was the question she had,wanted somebody to ask her whole life.,And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,,and she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --,and she turned to the audience and,described herself as the fair demoiselle,with her red hair and her light steps and so forth,,and then she said, "And then puberty hit." 
 And she began to talk about things that had happened,to her body and her face,,and how she could no longer count on her beauty,,and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one,for whom all the ballet lessons were given.,And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,,and in that process, she made a number of decisions.,First of all, was that dance, even though,it hadn't been offered to her, was her life.,And secondly, she had better be,,although she did dance for a while, a choreographer,because then her looks didn't matter.,But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life. 
 It was an amazing privilege to do this series.,There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.,The key point was empathy,because everybody in their lives,is really waiting for people to ask them questions,,so that they can be truthful about who they are,and how they became what they are,,and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.,Just be that way with your friends,and particularly the older members of your family. 
 Thank you very much.The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.,That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old,and I got a B+. (Laughter),What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.,And I'm gonna try and do that within,the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,,and to follow the TED commandments:,that is, actually, something that creates,a near-death experience,,but near-death is good for creativity.,(Laughter) OK. 
 So, I also want to explain,,because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me,if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.,And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.,When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;,I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain,and the one that's in between that is the censor,and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.,And I'm going do that also by looking at,what I think is part of my creative process,,which includes a number of things that happened, actually --,the nothing started even earlier than the moment,in which I'm creating something new.,And that includes nature, and nurture,,and what I refer to as nightmares. 
 Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not,we are innately equipped with something, perhaps,in our brains, some abnormal chromosome,that causes this muse-like effect.,And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.,And others, like my mother,,would say that I get my material from past lives.,Some people would also say that creativity,may be a function of some other neurological quirk --,van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.,I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently,that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,,that he might have had temporal lobe seizures,,and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't --,I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.,And I will mention that I actually developed,temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,,but it was during the time I was writing my last book,,and some people say that book is quite different. 
 I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:,you know, who am I, why am I this particular person,,why am I not black like everybody else?,And sometimes you're equipped with skills,,but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.,I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.,And I had a miniature poodle.,And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.,Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.,And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.,And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,,and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,,but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make,my living out of the artful arrangement of words. 
 Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.,And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,,and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.,That figure right there, by the way,,figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,,and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.,I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,,this was supposed to be my side occupation,,and it led to a sense of failure. 
 But actually, there was something quite real in my life,that happened when I was about 14.,And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,,six months later, had brain tumors.,And my mother believed that something had gone wrong,,and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.,My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,,and that God's will would take care of that.,But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.,And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses,-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe,why this would have happened.,Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.,There was a reason for everything.,And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,,who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.,And so, I had this notion of death all around me,,because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.,And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,,you begin to think very much about everything.,You become very creative, in a survival sense. 
 And this, then, led to my big questions.,And they're the same ones that I have today.,And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?,And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?,It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.,Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,,you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,,in what order they happen. What are the influences?,How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?,And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.,It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,,as the creator of that universe. 
 And you see, there's a lot of back and forth,in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out,-- years and years, oftentimes.,So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability,to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.,And I got a lot of them during what's been going on,throughout this conference,,almost everything that's been going on. 
 And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:,quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,,but I'm still gonna use it as the process,for explaining how it is the metaphor.,So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.,And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.,There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.,But when you make those associations,,you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,,and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.,And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning. 
 There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,,as I understand it. (Laughter),And this happens constantly in the writing.,And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,,in which you're looking for something, and,you know, things are happening simultaneously,,and you're looking at it in a different way,,and you're trying to really look for the about-ness,,or what is this story about. And if you try too hard,,then you will only write the about.,You won't discover anything.,And what you were supposed to find,,what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,,is no longer there.,Now, I don't want to ignore,the other side of what happens in our universe,,like many of our scientists have.,And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,,and just say that creative people are multidimensional,,and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.,(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time. 
 There is also a big question of ambiguity.,And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.,And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.,And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable,in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.,It is constantly there. And, just as an example,,this is one that recently came to me.,It was something I read in an editorial by a woman,who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,,"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life.",A very famous Chinese saying, she said.,And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there,until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.,So, there was another one that I came across,,and it's "saving fish from drowning.",And it's what Buddhist fishermen say,,because they're not supposed to kill anything.,And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.,So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,,and unfortunately, in the process the fish die. 
 Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors,-- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,,and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:,"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life.",And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business,,or you're going to get stuck.,OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.,But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning,,or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions. 
 And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.,And then we have intentions.,There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,,and then we do something.,And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.,Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?,What are we supposed to do?,Do we stay in for life,,or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,,and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?,That is the ambiguity in my life,that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called,"Saving Fish From Drowning." 
 I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.,I got these hints everywhere.,And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.,And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,,and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.,And what I need, in effect, is a focus.,And when I have the question, it is a focus.,And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through,that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.,And it seems like it's happening all the time.,You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,,in which you're getting all this help from the universe.,And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.,And you are noticing it more often. 
 But you apply this.,You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.,Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?,Why or why not?,It may be something that is perhaps more serious,-- as I said, human rights in Burma.,I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show,that I approved of the military regime there.,And then, after a while, I had to ask myself,,"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions,that other people have given us?",And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,,and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,,who was a Baptist minister.,So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,,and still didn't know that if I went there,,what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book --,and I just would have to face that later, when the time came. 
 We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.,We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?,Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,,so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?,Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,,and we talked about today, is genocide.,This leads to this question.,When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,,and I consider what my intentions should be,,I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child,-- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,,and what is my place in the universe? 
 It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.,We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,,and yet it is also absolutely necessary.,In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.,Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.,My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,,because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.,Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,,from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,,I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,,and that actually was the way it happened.,And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother. 
 There are also things, quite uncanny,,which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.,In this case, I was writing a story,that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.,And I needed to find something historically that would match that.,And I took down this book, and I --,first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,,and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion,,happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,,and a character who thought he was the son of God. 
 You wonder, are these things random chance?,Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?,What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?,And that goes into the story, too.,These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.,Especially when good things happen,,and, in particular, when bad things happen.,But I do think there's a kind of serendipity,,and I do want to know what those elements are,,so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.,Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen. 
 Another chance encounter is when I went to a place,-- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,,and we ended up in this non-tourist location,,a beautiful village, pristine.,And we walked three valleys beyond,,and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,,a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.,And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.,For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.,And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.,I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,,that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,,walking along the beach, I came across this.,And it was a man, a Chinese man,,and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.,And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?",And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance.",And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.,I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,,and I cannot explain it.,Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence,in writing about these things?,Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant? 
 A big thing that I also think about is accidents.,And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.,What is the nature of accidents?,And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,,outside of a court of law?,I was able to see that in a firsthand way,,when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.,And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.,And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me,if I wanted to write anything about China.,And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.,And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,,there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,,and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.,60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.,Responsibility was assigned to the family.,The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.,And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.,It's the son, not the father." 
 When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.,It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.,And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.,And I began to sense something different about the history,,and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,,and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links,with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.,I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,,a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men,-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.,Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,,would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,,and seeing the amazing things that happened,,you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,,determining how things happen. 
 So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,,the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me,-- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,,and that is where I'm gonna find the answers,to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.,Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,,as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.,The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.,It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.,But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?,And how do I create my own life? 
 And I think it is by questioning,,and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.,I believe in specifics, the specifics of story,,and the past, the specifics of that past,,and what is happening in the story at that point.,I also believe that in thinking about things --,my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,,God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces --,I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.,I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,,and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?,And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined --,and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.,And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.,And they have to be in all possibilities,,including those I never considered before. 
 So, there are never complete answers.,Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind,myself that there is uncertainty in everything,,and that is good, because then I will discover something new.,And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,,it is to simply imagine.,And to imagine is to put myself in that story,,until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating. 
 And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story,-- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think,,to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.,Because for everything,,in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.,I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.,We've come to the end of the talk,,and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse,,and it is the things that transform in our lives,,that are wonderful and stay with us.,There she is.,Thank you very much!,(Applause)Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.,Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.,Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,,make education seem like a bright idea.,(Laughter) 
 Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation,,or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.,Great creativity can make politicians electable,,or parties unelectable.,It can make war seem like tragedy or farce. 
 Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts,and phrases on our lips.,It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road,through an impenetrable moral maze.,Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,,more magical. And now we need that magic.,This is a time of need. 
 Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.,And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:,to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.,To tempt us to act differently,with delightful creative scraps.,Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in,using creativity to inspire people to be greener. 
 (Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk. 
 Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.,Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.,A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.,A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.,And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.,The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields,and broken his heart.,Sure, she had aged a little.,In fact, she had aged a lot.,But he felt all his old passion for her return.,"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.,"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,,for that was his name.,"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.,Let's go there and make love. In the tent.",Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.,Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically,while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.,The earth moved for both of them.,And they lived together happily ever after.,And all because he decided to walk that day.,(Applause) 
 Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.,The moral imperative is on the table.,Great creativity is needed to take it all,,make it simple and sharp.,To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.,So this is a call, a plea,,to the incredibly talented TED community.,Let's get creative against climate change.,And let's do it soon. Thank you.,(Applause)Probably a lot of you knownthe story of the two salesmen,who went down to Africa in the 1900s.,They were sent down to findnif there was any opportunity,for selling shoes,,and they wrote telegramsnback to Manchester.,And one of them wrote,,"Situation hopeless. Stop.nThey don't wear shoes.",And the other one wrote,,"Glorious opportunity.nThey don't have any shoes yet." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, there's a similar situationnin the classical music world,,because there are some people who thinknthat classical music is dying.,And there are some of usnwho think you ain't seen nothing yet.,And rather than goninto statistics and trends,,and tell you about all the orchestrasnthat are closing,,and the record companies that are folding,,I thought we should donan experiment tonight.,Actually, it's not really an experiment,nbecause I know the outcome. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's like an experiment.,Now, before we start -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Before we start, I need to do two things.,One is I want to remind younof what a seven-year-old child,sounds like when he plays the piano.,Maybe you have this child at home.,He sounds something like this. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 I see some of you recognize this child.,Now, if he practices for a yearnand takes lessons, he's now eight,and he sounds like this. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 He practices for another yearnand takes lessons -- he's nine. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 Then he practices for another yearnand takes lessons -- now he's 10. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 At that point, they usually give up. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, if you'd waited for one more year,nyou would have heard this. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 Now, what happened was notnmaybe what you thought,,which is, he suddenlynbecame passionate, engaged,,involved, got a new teacher,nhe hit puberty, or whatever it is.,What actually happenednwas the impulses were reduced.,You see, the first time, he was playingnwith an impulse on every note. 
 (Music) 
 And the second,nwith an impulse every other note. 
 (Music) 
 You can see it by looking at my head. 
 (Laughter) 
 The nine-year-old putnan impulse on every four notes. 
 (Music) 
 The 10-year-old, on every eight notes. 
 (Music) 
 And the 11-year-old,none impulse on the whole phrase. 
 (Music) 
 I don't know hownwe got into this position. 
 (Laughter) 
 I didn't say, "I'm going to movenmy shoulder over, move my body.",No, the music pushed me over,,which is why I call itnone-buttock playing. 
 (Music) 
 It can be the other buttock. 
 (Music) 
 You know, a gentleman was oncenwatching a presentation I was doing,,when I was working with a young pianist.,He was the presidentnof a corporation in Ohio.,I was working withnthis young pianist, and said,,"The trouble with younis you're a two-buttock player.,You should be a one-buttock player.",I moved his body while he was playing.,And suddenly, the music took off.nIt took flight.,The audience gaspednwhen they heard the difference.,Then I got a letter from this gentleman.,He said, "I was so moved.,I went back and I transformednmy entire company,into a one-buttock company." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the other thing I wantednto do is to tell you about you.,There are 1,600 people, I believe.,My estimation is that probably 45 of you,are absolutely passionatenabout classical music.,You adore classical music.nYour FM is always on that classical dial.,You have CDs in your car,nand you go to the symphony,,your children are playing instruments.,You can't imagine your lifenwithout classical music.,That's the first group, quite small.,Then there's another bigger group.,The people who don't mind classical music. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, you've come homenfrom a long day,,and you take a glass of wine,nand you put your feet up.,A little Vivaldi in the backgroundndoesn't do any harm.,That's the second group.,Now comes the third group:,people who never listennto classical music.,It's just simply not part of your life.,You might hear it like second-handnsmoke at the airport ... 
 (Laughter) 
 -- and maybe a little bitnof a march from "Aida",when you come into the hall.,But otherwise, you never hear it.,That's probably the largest group. 
 And then there's a very small group.,These are the peoplenwho think they're tone-deaf.,Amazing number of people thinknthey're tone-deaf.,Actually, I hear a lot,n"My husband is tone-deaf." 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.,Nobody is tone-deaf.,If you were tone-deaf,nyou couldn't change the gears,on your car, in a stick shift car.,You couldn't tell the difference between,somebody from Texasnand somebody from Rome.,And the telephone. The telephone.,If your mother calls,on the miserable telephone,nshe calls and says, "Hello,",you not only know who it is,nyou know what mood she's in.,You have a fantastic ear.nEverybody has a fantastic ear.,So nobody is tone-deaf. 
 But I tell you what.,It doesn't work for mento go on with this thing,,with such a wide gulfnbetween those who understand,,love and are passionatenabout classical music,,and those who havenno relationship to it at all.,The tone-deaf people,nthey're no longer here.,But even between those three categories,,it's too wide a gulf.,So I'm not going to go onnuntil every single person in this room,,downstairs and in Aspen,nand everybody else looking,,will come to lovenand understand classical music.,So that's what we're going to do. 
 Now, you notice that there is notnthe slightest doubt in my mind,that this is going to work,nif you look at my face, right?,It's one of the characteristicsnof a leader that he not doubt,for one moment the capacitynof the people he's leading,to realize whatever he's dreaming.,Imagine if Martin Luther Kingnhad said, "I have a dream.,Of course, I'm not surenthey'll be up to it." 
 (Laughter) 
 All right. So I'm goingnto take a piece of Chopin.,This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.,Some of you will know it. 
 (Music) 
 Do you know what I thinknprobably happened here?,When I started, you thought,n"How beautiful that sounds." 
 (Music) 
 "I don't think we shouldngo to the same place,for our summer holidays next year." 
 (Laughter) 
 It's funny, isn't it?,It's funny how those thoughtsnkind of waft into your head.,And of course -- 
 (Applause) 
 Of course, if the piece is longnand you've had a long day,,you might actually drift off.,Then your companionnwill dig you in the ribs,and say, "Wake up! It's culture!"nAnd then you feel even worse. 
 (Laughter) 
 But has it ever occurred to younthat the reason you feel sleepy,in classical music is notnbecause of you, but because of us?,Did anybody think while I was playing,,"Why is he using so many impulses?",If I'd done this with my head youncertainly would have thought it. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 And for the rest of your life,nevery time you hear classical music,,you'll always be able to knownif you hear those impulses. 
 So let's see what's really going on here.,We have a B. This is a B.,The next note is a C.,And the job of the C is to make the B sad.,And it does, doesn't it? 
 (Laughter) 
 Composers know that.,If they want sad music,nthey just play those two notes. 
 (Music) 
 But basically, it's just a B,nwith four sads. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, it goes down to A.,Now to G.,And then to F.,So we have B, A, G, F.,And if we have B, A, G, F,,what do we expect next? 
 (Music) 
 That might have been a fluke.,Let's try it again. 
 (Music) 
 Oh, the TED choir. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?,Nobody is.,You know, every village in Bangladesh,and every hamlet in Chinan-- everybody knows:,da, da, da, da -- da.,Everybody knows, who's expecting that E. 
 Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,,because what will have happened?,It will be over, like Hamlet.nDo you remember?,Act One, scene three,,he finds out his uncle killed his father.,He keeps on going upnto his uncle and almost killing him.,And then he backs away,nhe goes up to him again, almost kills him.,The critics sitting in the back row there,,they have to have an opinion,nso they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator.",Or they say, "Hamlet hasnan Oedipus complex.",No, otherwise the playnwould be over, stupid. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's why Shakespeare putsnall that stuff in Hamlet --,Ophelia going mad,nthe play within the play,,and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.,That's in order to delay --,until Act Five, he can kill him. 
 It's the same with the Chopin.,He's just about to reach the E,,and he says, "Oops, betterngo back up and do it again.",So he does it again.,Now, he gets excited. 
 (Music) 
 That's excitement, don't worry about it.,Now, he gets to F-sharp,nand finally he goes down to E,,but it's the wrong chord --,because the chordnhe's looking for is this one,,and instead he does ...,Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,,because it deceives us.,I tell my students,n"If you have a deceptive cadence,,raise your eyebrows,nand everybody will know." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Right.,He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.,Now, he tries E again.,That chord doesn't work.,Now, he tries the E again.nThat chord doesn't work.,Now, he tries E again,nand that doesn't work.,And then finally ...,There was a gentlemannin the front row who went, "Mmm." 
 (Laughter) 
 It's the same gesturenhe makes when he comes home,after a long day, turns offnthe key in his car and says,,"Aah, I'm home.",Because we all know where home is. 
 So this is a piece which goesnfrom away to home.,I'm going to play it all the way throughnand you're going to follow.,B, C, B, C, B, C, B --,down to A, down to G, down to F.,Almost goes to E, but otherwisenthe play would be over.,He goes back up to B,nhe gets very excited.,Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.,It's the wrong chord.nIt's the wrong chord.,And finally goes to E, and it's home.,And what you're going to seenis one-buttock playing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because for me, to join the B to the E,,I have to stop thinkingnabout every single note along the way,,and start thinking about the long,nlong line from B to E. 
 You know, we were just in South Africa,nand you can't go to South Africa,without thinking of Mandelanin jail for 27 years.,What was he thinking about? Lunch?,No, he was thinkingnabout the vision for South Africa,and for human beings.,This is about vision.nThis is about the long line.,Like the bird who flies over the field,and doesn't care about the fencesnunderneath, all right?,So now, you're going to follownthe line all the way from B to E.,And I've one last request before I playnthis piece all the way through.,Would you think of somebody who you adore,,who's no longer there?,A beloved grandmother, a lover --,somebody in your lifenwho you love with all your heart,,but that person is no longer with you.,Bring that person into your mind,,and at the same time,,follow the line all the way from B to E,,and you'll hear everythingnthat Chopin had to say. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, you may be wondering -- 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 You may be wondering why I'm clapping.,Well, I did this at a school in Boston,with about 70 seventhngraders, 12-year-olds.,I did exactly what I did with you,,and I explained the whole thing.,At the end, they went crazy, clapping.,I was clapping. They were clapping.,Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?",And one of them said,n"Because we were listening." 
 (Laughter) 
 Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,,involved in all sorts of different things,,listening, understanding and being moved,by a piece by Chopin.,Now, that is something.,Am I sure that every singlenperson followed that,,understood it, was moved by it?,Of course, I can't be sure. 
 But I'll tell you what happenednto me in Ireland,during the Troubles, 10 years ago,,and I was working with some Catholicnand Protestant kids,on conflict resolution.,And I did this with them --,a risky thing to do,nbecause they were street kids.,And one of them came to menthe next morning,and he said,,"You know, I've never listenednto classical music in my life,,but when you playednthat shopping piece ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "My brother was shot last yearnand I didn't cry for him.,But last night,nwhen you played that piece,,he was the one I was thinking about.,And I felt the tearsnstreaming down my face.,And it felt reallyngood to cry for my brother.",So I made up my mind at that moment,that classical music is for everybody.,Everybody. 
 Now, how would you walk --,my profession, the music professionndoesn't see it that way.,They say three percent of the populationnlikes classical music.,If only we could move it to four percent,nour problems would be over. 
 (Laughter) 
 How would you walk?nHow would you talk? How would you be?,If you thought, "Three percentnof the population likes classical music,,if only we could move it to four percent.",How would you walk or talk?nHow would you be?,If you thought, "Everybodynloves classical music --,they just haven't found out about it yet.",See, these are totally different worlds. 
 Now, I had an amazing experience.,I was 45 years old,,I'd been conducting for 20 years,,and I suddenly had a realization.,The conductor of an orchestrandoesn't make a sound.,My picture appearsnon the front of the CD -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But the conductor doesn't make a sound.,He depends, for his power,,on his ability to makenother people powerful.,And that changed everything for me.,It was totally life-changing.,People in my orchestra said,,"Ben, what happened?"nThat's what happened.,I realized my job was to awakennpossibility in other people.,And of course, I wanted to knownwhether I was doing that.,How do you find out?,You look at their eyes.,If their eyes are shining,nyou know you're doing it.,You could light up a villagenwith this guy's eyes. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right. So if the eyes are shining,nyou know you're doing it.,If the eyes are not shining,nyou get to ask a question.,And this is the question:,who am I being,that my players' eyes are not shining?,We can do that with our children, too.,Who am I being,,that my children's eyes are not shining?,That's a totally different world. 
 Now, we're all about to endnthis magical, on-the-mountain week,,we're going back into the world.,And I say, it's appropriatenfor us to ask the question,,who are we being as we go backnout into the world?,And you know, I havena definition of success.,For me, it's very simple.,It's not about wealth and fame and power.,It's about how many shining eyesnI have around me. 
 So now, I have one last thought,,which is that it really makesna difference what we say --,the words that come out of our mouth.,I learned this from a womannwho survived Auschwitz,,one of the rare survivors.,She went to Auschwitznwhen she was 15 years old.,And ...,And her brother was eight,,and the parents were lost.,And she told me this, she said,,"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,,and I looked down and sawnmy brother's shoes were missing.,I said, 'Why are you so stupid,ncan't you keep your things together,for goodness' sake?'",The way an elder sister might speaknto a younger brother.,Unfortunately, it was the lastnthing she ever said to him,,because she never saw him again.,He did not survive.,And so when she came outnof Auschwitz, she made a vow.,She told me this.,She said, "I walked outnof Auschwitz into life,and I made a vow.,And the vow was,,"I will never say anything that couldn'tnstand as the last thing I ever say.",Now, can we do that? No.,And we'll make ourselves wrongnand others wrong.,But it is a possibility to live into. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Shining eyes. 
 (Applause) 
 Shining eyes. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, thank you.Hello everyone.,And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.,And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.,And this is the piece of paper it will be made from,,and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.,And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation,on his custom, five-string electric cello,,and it's very exciting to listen to him.,Are you ready to go? OK.,Just to make it a little bit more exciting. 
 All right. Take it away, Rufus. 
 (Music) 
 All right. There you go.,(Laughter),(Applause)My search is always to find ways to chronicle,,to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.,Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,,but that are never sentimental,,that never look away from the darkest things about us.,Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful,than when we're most ugly.,Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.,As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria,with a whole generation -- in the '80s --,of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.,So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us. 
 But what I've come to learn,is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,,but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,,everyday acts of compassion.,In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.,Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,,the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect,my humanity back at me.,But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.,I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it,until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.,Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.,It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic,at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee,and send emails and make notes.,So what Ubuntu really says,is that there is no way for us to be human without other people.,It's really very simple, but really very complicated. 
 So, I thought I should start with some stories.,I should tell you some stories about remarkable people,,so I thought I'd start with my mother.,(Laughter),And she was dark, too.,My mother was English.,My parents met in Oxford in the '50s,,and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.,She was five foot two, very feisty and very English.,This is how English my mother is -- or was, she just passed.,She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,,and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.,(Laughter),And then we went to a fish restaurant,,and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,,and he came up and my mother said,,"Do you have any specials, young man?",And Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,,that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.,It's totally rad.",And my mother turned to me and said,,"What language is he speaking?",(Laughter),I said, "English, mum.",And she shook her head and said,,"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,,why don't they use it?",(Laughter) 
 So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England,to Catholicism when she married my father --,and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --,decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,,particularly among Igbo women,,the Billings ovulation method,,which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.,But her Igbo wasn't too good.,So she took me along to translate.,I was seven.,(Laughter),So, here are these women,,who never discuss their period with their husbands,,and here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?",(Laughter),And, "Do you notice any discharges?",(Laughter),And, "How swollen is your vulva?",(Laughter),She never would have thought of herself as a feminist,,my mother, but she always used to say,,"Anything a man can do, I can fix.",(Applause),And when my father complained about this situation,,where she's taking a seven-year-old boy,to teach this birth control, you know,,he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into --,you're teaching him how to be a woman.",My mother said, "Someone has to.",(Laughter) 
 This woman -- during the Biafran war,,we were caught in the war.,It was my mother with five little children.,It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,,to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.,At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers,who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,,and make him a boy soldier.,Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman,,standing up to men with guns who want to kill us?,All through that one year,,my mother never cried one time, not once.,But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,,about to fly to England,,this woman saw my mother wearing this dress,,which had been washed so many times it was basically see through,,with five really hungry-looking kids,,came over and asked her what had happened.,And she told this woman.,And so this woman emptied out her suitcase,and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,,and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --,(Laughter) --,that was the only time she cried.,And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,,and I asked her, "Why did you cry then?",And she said, "You know, you can steel your heart,against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.,But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger,will unstitch you." 
 The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,,memorized the names of every dead person,,and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.,Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.,And they would sing them only when they planted the rice,,as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead,into the rice.,But when it came for harvest time,,they would sing these joyful songs,,that were made up of the names of every child,who had been born that year.,And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,,they would remove as many names of the dead,that equaled as many people that were born.,And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,,beautiful transformation. 
 Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,,the word for rape and the word for marriage,was the same one?,But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.,Did you also know that after apartheid,,when the new government went into the parliament houses,,there were no female toilets in the building?,Which would seem to suggest that apartheid,was entirely the business of men.,All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,,women are never really counted.,Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us. 
 When I was growing up in Nigeria --,and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,,but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --,there were always rites of passage for young men.,Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,,that's essentially what it is.,And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,,progressing along, so when I turned 13 --,and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,,somebody had to kill the animals,,there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --,so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.,And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,,but I had to do it.,And I was supposed to do this alone.,But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,,who was significantly older than me,,who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,,decided to come with me.,Which sort of made me feel good,,because he'd seen a lot of things.,Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me,stories about how he used to bayonet people,,and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.,So, this guy comes with me.,And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --,they sound like human beings,,that's why we call tragedies "a song of a goat.",My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human,until we started keeping goats.,Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.,So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,,Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,,covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,,while I kill the goat.,It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,,and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed,such a quotidian experience,,still found it in himself to try to protect me.,I was a wimp.,I cried for a very long time.,And afterwards, he didn't say a word.,He just sat there watching me cry for an hour.,And then afterwards he said to me,,"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,,you will die of heartbreak.,Just know that it is enough sometimes,to know that it is difficult.",Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,,and not in good ways.,(Laughter) 
 So, I was born two days after Christmas.,So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,,but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.,So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,,and we had the Catholic priest over,,my mother was entertaining him with tea.,And my uncle suddenly says, "Where are Chris' presents?",And my mother said, "Don't talk about that in front of guests.",But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,,so he summoned me up, and he said,,"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.,Take anything you want out of the suitcase.,It's your birthday present.",I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,,but I found an inflatable sheep.,(Laughter),So, I blew it up and ran into the living room,,my finger where it shouldn't have been,,I was waving this buzzing sheep around,,and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.,(Laughter),And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,,just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,,"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish.",(Laughter),(Applause) 
 My last days in prison, the last 18 months,,my cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --,my cellmate was 14 years old.,The name was John James,,and in those days, if a family member committed a crime,,the military would hold you as ransom,till your family turned themselves in.,So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.,And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.,There were some really bad people there.,And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --,"Spiderman" and "X-Men.",He was obsessed.,And when he got tired of reading them,,he started to teach the men in death row how to read,,with these comic books.,And so, I remember night after night,,you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,,huddled around John James, reciting, "Take that, Spidey!",(Laughter),It's incredible.,I was really worried.,He didn't know what death row meant.,I'd been there twice,,and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.,And he would always laugh, and say,,"Come on, man, we'll make it out.",Then I'd say, "How do you know?",And he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine.",They killed him.,They handcuffed him to a chair,,and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,,then left him there to bleed to death.,That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.,All around us, everywhere, there are people like this. 
 The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.,They would come together as a community,,and they would express a wish.,And their wish would then be brought to a priest,,who would find a ritual object,,and the appropriate sacrifices would be made,,and the shrine would be built for the god.,But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,,the Igbos would destroy the god.,They would knock down the shrine,,and they would stop saying the god's name.,This is how they came to reclaim their humanity.,Every day, all of us here,,we're building gods that have gone rampant,,and it's time we started knocking them down,and forgetting their names.,It doesn't require a tremendous thing.,All it requires is to recognize among us, every day --,the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people,like the ones I've told you. 
 There are some of you in this room, amazing people,,who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.,I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.,The poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusi,who is in the audience here somewhere.,"Libation,,North Carolina, 1999.,I offer to this ground, this gin.,I imagine an old man crying here,,out of the sight of the overseer.,He pushes his tongue through a hole,where his tooth would be, if he were whole.,It aches in that space where his tooth would be,,where his land would be,,his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.,He wipes sorrow from his face,,and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,,and tastes the salt.,I call a name that could be his.,This is for you, old man.,This gin, this salty earth.",Thank you.,(Applause)My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,,on a collective level.,And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors,that we're in denial about,,and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.,And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.,It's like when you're mean to your wife,because you're mad at somebody else.,Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.,Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.,And when we do these kind of things,,when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,,then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence,that nobody wants, and no one intended.,And that's what I look at with my photographic work. 
 This is an image I just recently completed, that is --,when you stand back at a distance,,it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image,of a factory spewing out pollution.,And as you get a little bit closer,,it starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,,or a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.,And as you get all the way up close,,you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.,And in fact, this is one million plastic cups,,which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights,in the United States every six hours.,We use four million cups a day on airline flights,,and virtually none of them are reused or recycled.,They just don't do that in that industry. 
 Now, that number is dwarfed,by the number of paper cups we use every day,,and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,,most of which is coffee.,I couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,,but I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.,That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.,And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,,that's the size it would be.,And there's an hour's worth of our cups.,And there's a day's worth of our cups.,You can still see the little people way down there.,That's as high as a 42-story building,,and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference. 
 Speaking of justice, there's another phenomenon going on in our culture,that I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,,has the largest percentage of its population in prison,of any country on Earth.,One out of four people, one out of four humans in prison,are Americans, imprisoned in our country.,And I wanted to show the number.,The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.,And that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.,So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,,and in the actual print of this piece,,each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.,They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,,and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas,that was larger than any printer in the world would print.,And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels,that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.,This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York --,those are my parents looking at the piece.,(Laughter),Every time I look at this piece,,I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,,"He finally folded his laundry.",(Laughter) 
 I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.,And this particular one is about cigarette addiction.,I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans,who die from cigarette smoking.,More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year,from smoking cigarettes.,And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.,And, as you slowly step back,,you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette.",It's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,,when that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.,And do you remember the response?,It reverberated around the world,,and will continue to reverberate through time.,It will be something that we talk about in 100 years.,And yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.,And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.,And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.,And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.,And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it.,The tobacco lobby, it's too strong.,We just dismiss it out of our consciousness.,And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,,we continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,,to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.,And this is what the next piece is about. 
 This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes,,which is equal to the number of teenagers,who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.,More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under,begin smoking every year. 
 One more strange epidemic in the United States,that I want to acquaint you with,is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.,This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.,Well, actually, I only had one Vicodin,that I scanned lots and lots of times.,(Laughter),And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,,which is the number of hospital emergency room visits,yearly in the United States,,attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers,and anti-anxiety medications.,One-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. --,and that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything --,one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.,A strange phenomenon. 
 This is a piece that I just recently completed,about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,,this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.,384,000 women, American women, last year,went in for elective breast augmentation surgery.,It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,,given to young girls who are about to go off to college.,So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,,and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,,and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,,which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries,that are performed in the U.S. each month.,The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.,And strangely enough, the only plastic surgery,that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,,and most of that is being done by men. 
 Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples.,I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.,They're just examples.,And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear,that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.,There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.,We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief,about what's going on in our culture right now,,what's going on in our country,,the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.,They've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.,Our cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.,And one of the causes of this, I think,,is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,,this holoptical worldview, this holographic image,that we're all trying to create in our mind,of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints,1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;,the social consequences 10,000 miles away,of the daily decisions that we make as consumers. 
 As we try to build this view,,and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,,the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:,numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,,in the billions and now in the trillions.,Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers,that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.,We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.,And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,,is to take these numbers, these statistics,from the raw language of data, and to translate them,into a more universal visual language, that can be felt.,Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues,,if we can feel these things more deeply,,then they'll matter to us more than they do now.,And if we can find that,,then we'll be able to find, within each one of us,,what it is that we need to find to face the big question,,which is: how do we change?,That, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:,how do we change? How do we change as a culture,,and how do we each individually take responsibility,for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,,and that is our own behavior? 
 My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad,to look at these issues.,I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.,I'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.,And if there are things that we see,that we don't like about our culture,,then we have a choice.,The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,,to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,,as we show up for the question of how do we change --,it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,,and it will continue to do that, on into the future.,And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life,of the billions of people,who are going to inherit the results of our decisions.,I'm not speaking abstractly about this,,I'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room,,right now, in this moment. 
 Thank you and good afternoon.,(Applause)Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.,This is an icon of National Geographic,,an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.,But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out,with a parody of National Geographic,,and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.,Oh, the wrath of Photoshop. 
 This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.,He mounted a camera on the tail.,A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.,Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.,I love this photograph because it reminds me,of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.,A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.,Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth --,they're not very good swimmers --,and we know what's happening to the ice.,These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,,photographed by Chris Johns.,Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.,This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,,a great portraitist.,And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,,photographed by Nick Nichols.,This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.,And David said that there was lot of weird stuff,happening on the dance floor.,But, hey, at least it's hygienic.,(Laughter),These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,,by David Doubilet.,And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.,And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,,photographed by Emory Kristof.,Photography carries a power that holds up,under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,,because photographs emulate the way,that our mind freezes a significant moment. 
 Here's an example.,Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son,,and he was learning how to swim,in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.,But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide,and started to be pulled out towards the jetty.,I can stand here right now and see,,as I go tearing into the water after him,,the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.,I can see the rocks are over here.,There's a wave about to crash onto him.,I can see his hands reaching out,,and I can see his face in terror,,looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad.",I got him. The wave broke over us.,We got back on shore; he was fine.,We were a little bit rattled.,But this flashbulb memory, as it's called,,is when all the elements came together to define,not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.,And this is what a photograph taps into,when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer. 
 Now I have to tell you,,I was talking to Kyle last week about this,,that I was going to tell this story.,And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!,I remember my image of you,was that you were up on the shore yelling at me.",(Laughter),I thought I was a hero.,(Laughter) 
 So,,this represents -- this is a cross-sample of,some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,,working at the very top of their craft --,except one.,This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason,in New Zealand last year,,and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.,Last year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,",where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.,And it has become a wild success,,tapping into the enthusiast photography community.,The quality of these amateur photographs,can, at times, be amazing.,And seeing this reinforces, for me,,that every one of us has at least one or two,great photographs in them. 
 But to be a great photojournalist,,you have to have more than just one or two,great photographs in you.,You've got to be able to make them all the time.,But even more importantly,,you need to know how to create a visual narrative.,You need to know how to tell a story.,So I'm going to share with you some coverages,that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography. 
 Photographer Nick Nichols went to document,a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary,in Chad, called Zakouma.,The original intent was to travel there,and bring back a classic story of diverse species,,of an exotic locale.,And that is what Nick did, up to a point.,This is a serval cat.,He's actually taking his own picture,,shot with what's called a camera trap.,There's an infrared beam that's going across,,and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.,These are baboons at a watering hole.,Nick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera,took thousands of pictures of this.,And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures,of the rear ends of baboons.,(Laughter),A lion having a late night snack --,notice he's got a broken tooth.,And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.,I love this little bit of water,that comes off the back of his tail. 
 But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.,It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.,Here's a photograph shot in moonlight,,something that digital photography has made a big difference for.,It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.,Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,,collared the matriarch of the herd.,They named her Annie,,and they began tracking her movements.,The herd was safe within the confines of the park,,because of this dedicated group of park rangers.,But once the annual rains began,,the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park. 
 And that's when they ran into trouble.,For outside the safety of the park were poachers,,who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.,The matriarch that they were radio tracking,,after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,,came to a halt outside the park.,Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.,And they only came for the ivory.,This is actually one of the rangers.,They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,,because they couldn't leave it there,,because it's still valuable.,But what Nick did was he brought back,a story that went beyond the old-school method,of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?",And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.,Instead of just knowledge of this park,,he created an understanding and an empathy,for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues,surrounding human-wildlife conflicts. 
 Now let's go over to India.,Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.,We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman,touches upon in his new world population project.,For the first time in history,,more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.,And most of that growth is not in the cities,,but in the slums that surround them.,Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,,came to me and said,,"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.,Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.",And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.",So instead, what we did was,we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result,in what we'd consider sort of a survey story --,where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --,we put Jonas into Dharavi,,which is part of Mumbai, India,,and let him stay there, and really get into,the heart and soul of this really major part of the city.,What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look,at the awful conditions that exist in such places.,He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part,of how the entire urban area functioned.,By staying tightly focused in one place,,Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit,that underlies this community.,And he did it in a beautiful way. 
 Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.,We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry,and photojournalist Randy Olson,to document the depletion of the world's fisheries.,We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,,but the photographs that Brian and Randy created,are among the best to capture both the human,and natural devastation of overfishing.,Here, in a photo by Brian,,a seemingly crucified shark is caught up,in a gill net off of Baja.,I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,,the animals accidentally scooped up,while fishing for a specific species.,But here, Brian captured a unique view,by positioning himself underneath the boat,when they threw the waste overboard.,And Brian then went on to even greater risk,to get this never-before-made photograph,of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom. 
 Back on land, Randy Olson photographed,a makeshift fish market in Africa,,where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,,the main parts having already been sent to Europe.,And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.,As prime food sources are depleted,,the harvest goes deeper into the oceans,and brings in more such sources of protein.,This is called fishing down the food chain. 
 But there are also glimmers of hope,,and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,,we don't really want to go,and just look at all the problems.,We also want to look for solutions.,Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,,where commercial fishing had been banned --,the result being that the overfished species have been restored,,and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries. 
 Photography can also compel us to confront,issues that are potentially distressing and controversial.,James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,,took a look at the sweep of the medical system,that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.,It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end,and exits back home, on the other.,Jim started in the battlefield.,Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier,on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.,Here is in the field hospital.,The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter,tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.,From here, the more severely wounded are transported,back to Germany, where they meet up with their families,for the first time.,And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,,such as here in Walter Reed.,And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,,they exit the medical system and attempt,to regain their pre-war lives.,Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story,and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply. 
 Now, these stories are great examples,of how photography can be used,to address some of our most important topics.,But there are also times when photographers,simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,,just plain fun.,Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica,to shoot a story on leopard seals.,They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered,one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.,In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been,grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.,So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant,about getting into the water.,Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.,You know of "The March of the Penguins.",This is sort of the munch of the penguins.,(Laughter),Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out,to see if the coast is clear.,And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out. 
 But then Paul got in the water.,And he said he was never really afraid of this.,Well, this one female came up to him.,She's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,,but she's 12 feet long.,So, she is pretty significant in size.,And Paul said he was never really afraid,,because she was more curious about him than threatened.,This mouthing behavior, on the right,,was really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!",Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have.",(Laughter),Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.,To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water,that for some reason didn't seem to be interested,in chasing penguins.,So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,,alive, and put them in front of him.,She dropped them off, and then they would swim away.,She'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?",Go back and get them, and then bring them back,and drop them in front of him.,And she did this over the course of a couple of days,,until the point where she got so frustrated with him,that she started putting them directly on top of his head.,(Laughter),Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.,(Laughter),Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured,that he was never going to survive.,This is her just puffing out, you know,,snorting out in disgust.,(Laughter),And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best. 
 Paul set out to photograph a relatively,mysterious and unknown creature,,and came back with not just a collection of photographs,,but an amazing experience and a great story.,It is these kinds of stories,,ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial,that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.,I believe that photography can make a real connection to people,,and can be employed as a positive agent,for understanding the challenges and opportunities,facing our world today.,Thank you.,(Applause)I had a fire nine days ago.,My archive:,175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,,all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.,I'd collected --,I was a collector, major, big-time.,It's gone.,I just looked at it,,and I didn't know what to do.,I mean, this was --,was I my things?,I always live in the present -- I love the present. 
 I cherish the future.,And I was taught some strange thing as a kid,,like, you've got to make something good out of something bad.,You've got to make something good out of something bad.,This was bad! Man, I was --,I cough. I was sick.,That's my camera lens. The first one --,the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.,That's my feature film. "King, Murray",won Cannes Film Festival 1970 --,the only print I had.,That's my papers. 
 That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.,Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.,"You've got to make something good out of something bad,",I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.,By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.,"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.,These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,,which opens in New York in two weeks,downtown.,I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig.",That's me at my desk.,That was a desk took 40-some years to build.,You know -- all the stuff.,That's my daughter, Jean.,She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco. 
 "Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.,I want pieces. Bits and pieces.",I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,,which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.,That's my sister. She took care of pictures,,because I was a big collector of snapshot photography,that I believed said a lot.,And those are some of the pictures that --,something was good about the burnt pictures.,I didn't know. I looked at that --,I said, "Wow, is that better than the --",That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.,It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.,Idea about women. 
 So I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!,You could cry about this." I really didn't.,I just instead said,,"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... ",And I appreciate this moment,to come up on this stage with so many people,who've already given me so much solace,,and just say to TEDsters:,I'm proud of me. That I take something bad,,I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,,all these pieces.,That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.,I was a big record collector --,the records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,,film burns. Film burns.,I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.,The negatives are gone. 
 That's my father's letter to me, telling me to,marry the woman I first married when I was 20.,That's my daughter and me.,She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.,That's my house.,My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.,That's my wife, Heidi,,who didn't take it as well as I did.,My children, Davey and Henry.,My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago. 
 So, my message to you folks,,from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance,to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.,I came to live it, and I am living it.,That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,,just 35 miles from here.,Thank you everybody. 
 (Applause)So, indeed, I have spent my life,looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.,Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,,thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.,But when I try and think about what I've learned,about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back,to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard,with the great psychologist Erik Erikson. 
 He taught us that the richest and fullest lives,attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:,work, love and play.,And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,,is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.,Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,,is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,,but with serenity. 
 So since I tell stories, let me look back,on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point --,Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.,As for that first sphere of work,,I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests,is that fierce ambition is a good thing.,He had a huge ambition.,But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame --,what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life,so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it. 
 Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.,He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm,from which he was born.,No schooling was possible for him,,except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.,But he read books in every spare moment he could find.,It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible,or "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.,He couldn't eat.,The great poet Emily Dickinson once said,,"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away.",How true for Lincoln. 
 Though he never would travel to Europe,,he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,,he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.,Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.,But there were so many losses in his early life,that he was haunted by death.,His mother died when he was only nine years old;,his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;,and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.,Moreover, when his mother lay dying,,she did not hold out for him the hope,that they would meet in an afterworld.,She simply said to him,,"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return.",As a result he became obsessed with the thought,that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust. 
 But only as he grew older did he develop,a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion --,but followed by other cultures as well --,that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,,you could live on in the memory of others.,Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.,And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.,It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered,when he was in his early 30s. 
 Three things had combined to lay him low.,He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,,not certain he was ready to marry her,,but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.,His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois,to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.,And his political career in the state legislature,was on a downward slide.,He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.,They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.,And his great friend Speed went to his side and said,,"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die.",He said that, "I would just as soon die right now,,but I've not yet done anything to make any human being,remember that I have lived." 
 So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.,He eventually won a seat in Congress.,He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.,"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,,"but some people are stronger in the broken places.",So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory,for the presidency over three far more experienced,,far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.,And then when he won the general election,,he stunned the nation even more,by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.,It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,,"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people.",They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?",He said, "Look, these are the strongest,and most able men in the country.,The country is in peril. I need them by my side.",But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson,might have put it in less noble fashion:,"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,,than outside the tent pissing in.",(Laughter) 
 But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln,would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.,For each of them soon came to understand,that he possessed an unparalleled array of,emotional strengths and political skills,that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.,For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability,to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.,He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated,into permanent hostility.,He shared credit with ease,,assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,,constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.,These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.,(Applause),He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.,He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.,And he expressed his unshakeable convictions,in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.,And with a beauty of language -- almost as if,the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child,had worked their way into his very soul. 
 In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,,he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,,and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.,And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,,"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized.",But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation,his own hand was numb and shaking,because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.,So he put the pen down.,He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.,But if I sign with a shaking hand,,posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'",So he waited until he could take up the pen,and sign with a bold and clear hand.,But even in his wildest dreams,,Lincoln could never have imagined,how far his reputation would reach. 
 I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,,Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.,And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made,to a very remote area of the Caucasus,,where there were only wild barbarians,,who had never left this part of Russia.,Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,,they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.,So he said, "I told them about Napoleon,and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great,and Julius Caesar, and they loved it.,But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,,'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.,We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,,who laughed like the sunrise,,who came from that place called America, which is so far from here,,that if a young man should travel there,,he would be an old man when he arrived.,Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'",He was stunned.,He told them everything he could about Lincoln.,And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?,Not as great a general as Napoleon,,not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great.",But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,,in the integrity of his character,and the moral fiber of his being. 
 So in the end that powerful ambition,that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.,That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,,to go through that string of political failures,and the darkest days of the war.,His story would be told.,So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love --,encompassing family, friends and colleagues --,it, too, takes work and commitment.,The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,,when I helped him on his memoirs,,was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of,work, power and individual success,,that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left,to get him through the days,once the presidency was gone. 
 My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.,I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.,We had a big dance at the White House.,President Johnson did dance with me that night.,Not that peculiar --,there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.,But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me,to work directly for him in the White House.,But it was not to be that simple.,For in the months leading up to my selection,,like many young people, I'd been active,in the anti-Vietnam War movement,,and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,,which unfortunately came out in The New Republic,two days after the dance in the White House.,(Laugher),And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.,(Laughter),So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.,But instead, surprisingly, he said,,"Oh, bring her down here for a year,,and if I can't win her over, no one can.",So I did end up working for him in the White House.,Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,,never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with. 
 I like to believe it was because I was a good listener.,He was a great storyteller.,Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.,There was a problem with these stories, however,,which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.,But they were great, nonetheless.,(Laughter),So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.,But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.,And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.,So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,,even when I didn't have any at all. 
 Everything was working perfectly,,until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.,Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,,conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.,And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth --,all the romantic trappings.,And he started out,,"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... ",And my heart sank.,And then he said,,"You remind me of my mother.",(Laughter) 
 It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.,But I must say, the older I've gotten,,the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was,to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.,A victor in a thousand contests,,three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.,And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.,And because he was so sad and so vulnerable,,he opened up to me in ways he never would have,had I known him at the height of his power --,sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.,And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me,the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,,that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then. 
 But it also brought home to me the lessons,which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us,about the importance of finding balance in life.,For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had,everything in the world to feel good about in those last years,,in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;,he had all the money he needed to pursue,any leisure activity he wanted;,he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,,sailboats, speedboats.,He had servants to answer any whim,,and he had a family who loved him deeply. 
 And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success,meant that in his retirement he could find no solace,in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.,It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large,that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.,As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated,until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.,In those last years, he said he was so sad,watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.,He spoke with immense sadness in his voice,,saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,,and their children in turn.,But it was too late.,Despite all that power, all that wealth,,he was alone when he finally died --,his ultimate terror realized. 
 So as for that third sphere of play,,which he never had learned to enjoy,,I've learned over the years,that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy --,enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,,or art, or literature, or any form of recreation,,can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.,So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,,that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,,even during those dark days of the war.,He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,,for a few precious hours he could imagine himself,back in Prince Hal's time. 
 But an even more important form of relaxation for him,,that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,,was a love of -- somehow -- humor,,and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce,as a sidelight to the sadness.,He once said that he laughed so he did not cry,,that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.,His storytelling powers had first been recognized,when he was on the circuit in Illinois.,The lawyers and the judges would travel,from one county courthouse to the other,,and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,,they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.,He would stand with his back against a fire,and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.,And all these stories became part of his memory bank,,so he could call on them whenever he needed to.,And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument. 
 One of his favorite stories, for example,,had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.,And as Lincoln told the story,,Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.,And the British people were still upset,about losing the Revolution,,so they decided to embarrass him a little bit,by putting a huge picture of General Washington,in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.,They figured he'd be upset about the indignity,of George Washington being in an outhouse.,But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.,And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?","Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him.","What do you mean?" they said.,"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit,faster than the sight of General George Washington.",(Laughter),(Applause) 
 So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting --,and he had hundreds of these stories --,you would have to relax.,So between his nightly treks to the theater,,his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor,and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,,he found that form of play which carried him through his days.,In my own life, I shall always be grateful,for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.,Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training,to the end of the fall,,to have something to occupy my mind and heart,other than my work. 
 It all began when I was only six years old,,and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score,while listening to baseball games --,so that when he went to work in New York during the day,,I could record for him the history of that afternoon's,Brooklyn Dodgers game.,Now, when you're only six years old,,and your father comes home every single night,and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,,recounted every single play of every inning,of the game that had just taken place that afternoon.,But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.,It makes you think there's something magic about history,to keep your father's attention. 
 In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art,from those nightly sessions with my father.,Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,,"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!",Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.,(Laughter),So I finally learned you had to tell a story,from beginning to middle to end.,I must say, so fervent was my love,of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days,that I had to confess in my first confession,two sins that related to baseball. 
 The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,,came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,,just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.,And I was so excited --,first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.,But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.,When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think,that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,,you'll be struck dead at the threshold.,So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?",He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.,We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.,It's not a sin.",But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow,I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul,for this one night with Roy Campanella.,(Laughter),And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.,So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.,I told the priest right away.,He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service.",But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?" 
 And then came my second sin.,I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,,wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.,And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?",And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players,would break arms, legs and ankles --,(Laughter),-- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.,He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?",And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.,(Laughter),So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.,I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,,but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.,You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen.","Oh yes," I said.,But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!,(Laughter) 
 Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack,when I was still in my 20s,,before I had gotten married and had my three sons,,I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.,Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,,I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston,and became an irrational Red Socks fan.,And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons,with our season tickets,,I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun,and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,,watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:,Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider. 
 I must say there is magic in these moments.,When I open my eyes and I see my sons,in the place where my father once sat,,I feel an invisible loyalty and love,linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,,but whose heart and soul they have come to know,through all the stories I have told.,Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,,allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.,Allowing me to learn from these large figures,about the struggle for meaning for life.,Allowing me to believe that the private people,we have loved and lost in our families,,and the public figures we have respected in our history,,just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,,really can live on, so long as we pledge,to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.,Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.,(Applause),Thank you.Whoa, dude. 
 (Laughter) 
 Check out those killer equations. Sweet.,Actually, for the next 18 minutesnI'm going to do the best I can,to describe the beautynof particle physics without equations.,It turns out there's a lotnwe can learn from coral.,A coral is a very beautifulnand unusual animal.,Each coral head consistsnof thousands of individual polyps.,These polyps are continuallynbudding and branching,into genetically identical neighbors.,If we imagine thisnto be a hyperintelligent coral,,we can single out an individualnand ask him a reasonable question.,We can ask how exactlynhe got to be in this particular location,compared to his neighbors --,if it was just chance,nor destiny, or what? 
 Now, after admonishing usnfor turning the temperature up too high,,he would tell us that our questionnwas completely stupid.,These corals can be kind of mean, you see,,and I have surfing scars to prove that.,But this polyp would continue and tell us,that his neighbors werenquite clearly identical copies of him.,That he was in allnthese other locations as well,,but experiencing themnas separate individuals.,For a coral, branchingninto different copies,is the most natural thing in the world. 
 Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral,would be uniquely preparednto understand quantum mechanics.,The mathematics of quantum mechanics,very accurately describesnhow our universe works.,And it tells us our reality is continuallynbranching into different possibilities,,just like a coral.,It's a weird thing for us humansnto wrap our minds around,,since we only ever getnto experience one possibility.,This quantum weirdness was first described,by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.,The cat likes this version better. 
 (Laughter) 
 In this setup, Schrödinger is in a boxnwith a radioactive sample,that, by the laws of quantum mechanics,nbranches into a state,in which it is radiatednand a state in which it is not. 
 (Laughter) 
 In the branch in whichnthe sample radiates,,it sets off a trigger that releases poisonnand Schrödinger is dead.,But in the other branch of reality,nhe remains alive.,These realities are experiencednseparately by each individual.,As far as either can tell,nthe other one doesn't exist. 
 This seems weird to us,,because each of usnonly experiences an individual existence,,and we don't get to see other branches.,It's as if each of us,nlike Schrödinger here,,are a kind of coralnbranching into different possibilities.,The mathematicsnof quantum mechanics tells us,this is how the worldnworks at tiny scales.,It can be summed up in a single sentence:,Everything that can happen, does.,That's quantum mechanics.,But this does not mean everything happens.,The rest of physics is about describingnwhat can happen and what can't.,What physics tells usnis that everything comes down to geometry,and the interactionsnof elementary particles.,And things can happen only ifnthese interactions are perfectly balanced. 
 Now I'll go ahead and describenhow we know about these particles,,what they are and how this balance works.,In this machine,na beam of protons and antiprotons,are accelerated to near the speed of light,and brought together in a collision,nproducing a burst of pure energy.,This energy is immediately convertedninto a spray of subatomic particles,,with detectors and computersnused to figure out their properties.,This enormous machine --,the Large Hadron Collidernat CERN in Geneva --,has a circumference of 17 milesnand, when it's operating,,draws five times as much powernas the city of Monterey.,We can't predict specifically,what particles will be producednin any individual collision.,Quantum mechanics tells usnall possibilities are realized.,But physics does tell usnwhat particles can be produced.,These particles must havenjust as much mass and energy,as is carried innby the proton and antiproton.,Any particles more massiventhan this energy limit aren't produced,,and remain invisible to us.,This is why this newnparticle accelerator is so exciting.,It's going to pushnthis energy limit seven times,beyond what's ever been done before,,so we're going to get to seensome new particles very soon. 
 But before talkingnabout what we might see,,let me describe the particlesnwe already know of.,There's a whole zoonof subatomic particles.,Most of us are familiar with electrons.,A lot of people in this roomnmake a good living pushing them around. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the electron also hasna neutral partner called the neutrino,,with no electric chargenand a very tiny mass.,In contrast, the up and down quarksnhave very large masses,,and combine in threes to makenthe protons and neutrons inside atoms.,All of these matter particlesncome in left- and right-handed varieties,,and have antiparticle partnersnthat carry opposite charges.,These familiar particles,also have less familiarnsecond and third generations,,which have the same charges as the firstnbut have much higher masses.,These matter particles all interactnwith the various force particles.,The electromagnetic forceninteracts with electrically charged matter,via particles called photons.,There is also a very weak force,called, rather unimaginatively,nthe weak force ... 
 (Laughter) 
 that interactsnonly with left-handed matter.,The strong force acts between quarks,which carry a different kind of charge,ncalled color charge,,and come in three different varieties:nred, green and blue.,You can blame Murray Gell-Mannnfor these names -- they're his fault.,Finally, there's the force of gravity,,which interacts with matternvia its mass and spin. 
 The most important thingnto understand here,is that there's a different kind of chargenassociated with each of these forces.,These four different forcesninteract with matter,according to the corresponding chargesnthat each particle has.,A particle that hasn't been seen yet,nbut we're pretty sure exists,,is the Higgs particle, which gives massesnto all these other particles.,The main purposenof the Large Hadron Collider,is to see this Higgs particle,nand we're almost certain it will.,But the greatest mysterynis what else we might see.,And I'm going to show younone beautiful possibility,towards the end of this talk. 
 Now, if we count upnall these different particles,using their various spins and charges,,there are 226.,That's a lot of particlesnto keep track of.,And it seems strange,that nature would havenso many elementary particles.,But if we plot them outnaccording to their charges,,some beautiful patterns emerge.,The most familiar chargenis electric charge.,Electrons have an electric charge,,a negative one,,and quarks havenelectric charges in thirds.,So when two up quarks and a down quarknare combined to make a proton,,it has a totalnelectric charge of plus one.,These particles also have antiparticles,nwhich have opposite charges.,Now, it turns out the electric charge,is actually a combinationnof two other charges:,hypercharge and weak charge.,If we spread outnthe hypercharge and weak charge,and plot the charges of particlesnin this two-dimensional charge space,,the electric chargenis where these particles sit,along the vertical direction.,The electromagneticnand weak forces interact with matter,according to their hyperchargenand weak charge,,which make this pattern.,This is callednthe unified electroweak model,,and it was put together back in 1967. 
 The reason most of usnare only familiar with electric charge,and not both of thesenis because of the Higgs particle.,The Higgs, over here on the left,nhas a large mass,and breaks the symmetrynof this electroweak pattern.,It makes the weak force very weaknby giving the weak particles a large mass.,Since this massive Higgs sits alongnthe horizontal direction in this diagram,,the photons of electromagnetismnremain massless,and interact with electric chargenalong the vertical direction,in this charge space.,So the electromagnetic and weak forces,are described by this patternnof particle charges,in two-dimensional space.,We can include the strong forcenby spreading out its two charge directions,and plotting the chargesnof the force particles in quarks,along these directions.,The charges of all known particles,can be plotted inna four-dimensional charge space,,and projected down to two dimensionsnlike this so we can see them. 
 Whenever particles interact,nnature keeps things in a perfect balance,along all four of these charge directions.,If a particle and an antiparticle collide,,it creates a burst of energynand a total charge of zero,in all four charge directions.,At this point, anything can be created,as long as it has the same energynand maintains a total charge of zero.,For example, this weak force particlenand its antiparticle,can be created in a collision.,In further interactions,nthe charges must always balance.,One of the weak particles could decayninto an electron and an antineutrino,,and these threenstill add to zero total charge.,Nature always keeps a perfect balance.,So these patterns of chargesnare not just pretty.,They tell us what interactionsnare allowed to happen.,And we can rotate this charge spacenin four dimensions,to get a better looknat the strong interaction,,which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.,In a strong interaction,na strong force particle,,such as this one,,interacts with a colored quark,nsuch as this green one,,to give a quark with a differentncolor charge -- this red one.,And strong interactionsnare happening millions of times,each second in every atom of our bodies,,holding the atomic nuclei together. 
 But these four chargesncorresponding to three forces,are not the end of the story.,We can also include two more chargesncorresponding to the gravitational force.,When we include these,,each matter particlenhas two different spin charges,,spin-up and spin-down.,So they all split and give a nice patternnin six-dimensional charge space.,We can rotate this patternnin six dimensions,and see that it's quite pretty.,Right now, this patternnmatches our best current knowledge,of how nature is built at the tiny scalesnof these elementary particles.,This is what we know for certain.,Some of these particlesnare at the very limit,of what we've been able to reachnwith experiments.,From this pattern,we already know the particle physicsnof these tiny scales --,the way the universe worksnat these tiny scales is very beautiful. 
 But now I'm going to discussnsome new and old ideas,about things we don't know yet.,We want to expand this patternnusing mathematics alone,,and see if we can get our handsnon the whole enchilada.,We want to findnall the particles and forces,that make a complete picturenof our universe.,And we want to use this picturento predict new particles,that we'll see when experimentsnreach higher energies. 
 So there's an old idea in particle physics,that this known pattern of charges,,which is not very symmetric,,could emerge from a more perfect patternnthat gets broken --,similar to how the Higgs particlenbreaks the electroweak pattern,to give electromagnetism.,In order to do this,nwe need to introduce new forces,with new charge directions.,When we introduce a new direction,,we get to guess what chargesnthe particles have along this direction,,and then we can rotate itnin with the others.,If we guess wisely,nwe can construct the standard charges,in six charge dimensionsnas a broken symmetry,of this more perfect patternnin seven charge dimensions. 
 This particular choicencorresponds to a grand unified theory,introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.,When we look at this new unified pattern,,we can see a couple of gapsnwhere particles seem to be missing.,This is the wayntheories of unification work.,A physicist looks for larger,nmore symmetric patterns,that include the establishednpattern as a subset.,The larger pattern allows usnto predict the existence of particles,that have never been seen.,This unification modelnpredicts the existence,of these two new force particles,,which should act a lotnlike the weak force, only weaker. 
 Now, we can rotate this setnof charges in seven dimensions,and consider an odd factnabout the matter particles:,the second and third generations of matter,have exactly the same chargesnin six-dimensional charge space,as the first generation.,These particles are notnuniquely identified by their six charges.,They sit on top of one anothernin the standard charge space.,However, if we worknin eight-dimensional charge space,,then we can assignnunique new charges to each particle.,Then we can spin these in eight dimensions,and see what the whole pattern looks like.,Here we can see the secondnand third generations of matter now,,related to the first generationnby a symmetry called "triality." 
 This particular patternnof charges in eight dimensions,is actually part of the most beautifulngeometric structure in mathematics.,It's a pattern of the largestnexceptional Lie group, E8.,This Lie group is a smooth,ncurved shape with 248 dimensions.,Each point in this patternncorresponds to a symmetry,of this very complex and beautiful shape.,One small part of this E8 shapencan be used to describe,the curved space-timenof Einstein's general relativity,,explaining gravity.,Together with quantum mechanics,,the geometry of this shapencould describe everything,about how the universe worksnat the tiniest scales.,The pattern of this shape livingnin eight-dimensional charge space,is exquisitely beautiful,,and it summarizes thousandsnof possible interactions,between these elementary particles,,each of which is just a facetnof this complicated shape. 
 As we spin it, we can seenmany of the other intricate patterns,contained in this one.,And with a particular rotation,,we can look down through this patternnin eight dimensions along a symmetry axis,and see all the particles at once.,It's a very beautiful object,,and as with any unification,,we can see some holes where new particlesnare required by this pattern.,There are 20 gapsnwhere new particles should be,,two of which have been fillednby the Pati-Salam particles.,From their location in this pattern,nwe know that these new particles,should be scalar fieldsnlike the Higgs particle,,but have color chargenand interact with the strong force.,Filling in these new particlesncompletes this pattern,,giving us the full E8. 
 This E8 pattern hasnvery deep mathematical roots.,It's considered by many to be the mostnbeautiful structure in mathematics.,It's a fantastic prospect that this objectnof great mathematical beauty,could describe the truthnof particle interactions,at the smallest scales imaginable.,And this idea that nature is describednby mathematics is not at all new.,In 1623, Galileo wrote this:,"Nature's grand book,nwhich stands continually open to our gaze,,is written in the language of mathematics.,Its characters are triangles,ncircles and other geometrical figures,,without which it is humanly impossiblento understand a single word of it;,without these, one is wandering aroundnin a dark labyrinth." 
 I believe this to be true,,and I've triednto follow Galileo's guidance,in describing the mathematicsnof particle physics,using only triangles, circlesnand other geometrical figures.,Of course, when other physicistsnand I actually work on this stuff,,the mathematicsncan resemble a dark labyrinth.,But it's reassuring that at the heartnof this mathematics,is pure, beautiful geometry.,Joined with quantum mechanics,,this mathematics describes our universenas a growing E8 coral,,with particles interactingnat every location in all possible ways,according to a beautiful pattern.,And as more of the patternncomes into view using new machines,like the Large Hadron Collider,,we may be able to see whether naturenuses this E8 pattern or a different one. 
 This process of discovery isna wonderful adventure to be involved in.,If the LHC finds particlesnthat fit this E8 pattern,,that will be very, very cool.,If the LHC finds new particles,nbut they don't fit this pattern --,well, that will be very interesting,nbut bad for this E8 theory.,And, of course, bad for me personally. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, how bad would that be?,Well, pretty bad. 
 (Laughter) 
 But predicting how nature worksnis a very risky game.,This theory and others like itnare long shots.,One does a lot of hard worknknowing that most of these ideas,probably won't end upnbeing true about nature.,That's what doingntheoretical physics is like:,there are a lot of wipeouts.,In this regard, new physics theoriesnare a lot like start-up companies.,As with any large investment,,it can be emotionally difficultnto abandon a line of research,when it isn't working out.,But in science,nif something isn't working,,you have to toss it outnand try something else. 
 Now, the only way to maintain sanity,and achieve happinessnin the midst of this uncertainty,is to keep balancenand perspective in life.,I've tried the best I cannto live a balanced life. 
 (Laughter) 
 I try to balance my life equallynbetween physics, love and surfing --,my own three charge directions. 
 (Laughter) 
 This way, even if the physicsnI work on comes to nothing,,I still know I've lived a good life.,And I try to live in beautiful places.,For most of the past ten yearsnI've lived on the island of Maui,,a very beautiful place.,Now, it's one of the greatest mysteriesnin the universe to my parents,how I managed to survive all that time,without engaging in anythingnresembling full-time employment. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm going to let you in on that secret.,This was a viewnfrom my home office on Maui.,And this is another,,and another.,And you may have noticednthat these beautiful views are similar,,but in slightly different places.,That's because this used to benmy home and office on Maui. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've chosen a very unusual life.,But not worrying about rent,allowed me to spend my timendoing what I love.,Living a nomadic existencenhas been hard at times,,but it's allowed mento live in beautiful places,and keep a balance in my lifenthat I've been happy with.,It allows me to spend a lot of my timenhanging out with hyperintelligent coral.,But I also greatly enjoynthe company of hyperintelligent people.,So I'm very happynto have been invited here to TED. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Stay here one second. 
 (Applause) 
 I probably understood two percent of that,,but I still absolutely loved it.,So I'm going to sound dumb.,Your theory of everything -- 
 Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral. 
 CA: That's right.,The reason it's gotna few people at least excited,is because, if you're right, it bringsngravity and quantum theory together.,So are you saying that we shouldnthink of the universe, at its heart --,that the smallest things that there are,,are somehow an E8 object of possibility?,I mean, is there a scale to it,nat the smallest scale, or ...? 
 GL: Well, right nownthe pattern I showed you,that corresponds to what we knownabout elementary particle physics --,that already correspondsnto a very beautiful shape.,And that's the onenthat I said we knew for certain.,And that shapenhas remarkable similarities --,and the way it fits into this E8 pattern,nwhich could be the rest of the picture.,And these patterns of pointsnthat I've shown for you,actually represent symmetriesnof this high-dimensional object,that would be warpingnand moving and dancing,over the space-time that we experience.,And that would be what explains all thesenelementary particles that we see. 
 CA: But a string theorist,nas I understand it,,explains electrons in termsnof much smaller strings vibrating --,I know, you don't like string theory --nvibrating inside it.,How should we thinknof an electron in relation to E8? 
 GL: Well, it would be onenof the symmetries of this E8 shape.,So what's happening is, as the shapenis moving over space-time, it's twisting.,And the direction it's twistingnas it moves is what particle we see.,So it would be -- 
 CA: The size of the E8 shape,nhow does that relate to the electron?,I feel like I need that for my picture.nIs it bigger? Is it smaller? 
 GL: As far as we know,nelectrons are point particles,,so this would be going downnto the smallest possible scales.,So the way these things are explainednin quantum field theory is,,all possibilities are expandingnand developing at once.,And this is whynI use the analogy to coral.,And --,in this way, the way that E8 comes in,is it will be as a shape that's attachednat each point in the space-time.,And, as I said,nthe way the shape twists --,the directional along which waynthe shape is twisting,as it moves over this curved surface --,is what the elementary particlesnare, themselves.,So through quantum field theory,,they manifest themselves as pointsnand interact that way.,I don't know if I'll be ablento make this any clearer. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: It doesn't really matter.,It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,,and I certainlynwant to understand more of this. 
 But thank you so much for coming.nThat was absolutely fascinating. 
 (Applause)Unless we do something to prevent it,,over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic,of neurologic diseases on a global scale.,A cheery thought.,On this map, every country that’s colored blue,has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.,This is the world we live in.,And this is the world your children will live in.,For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population,has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.,It’s already flattening out.,By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.,This is why it’s happening.,The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840,,and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.,And this is why that’s not entirely a good thing:,because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer’s,or Parkinson’s disease will increase exponentially.,By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United States,over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it,,half of them will have Alzheimer’s disease,and three million more will have Parkinson’s disease.,Right now, those and other neurologic diseases --,for which we have no cure or prevention --,cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.,It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.,Alzheimer’s disease starts when a protein,that should be folded up properly,misfolds into a kind of demented origami.,So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs,that function like molecular Scotch tape,,to hold the protein into its proper shape.,That would keep it from forming the tangles,that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.,Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases,which affect very different parts of the brain,also show tangles of misfolded protein,,which suggests that the approach might be a general one,,and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases,,not just Alzheimer’s disease.,There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here,,because people with neurologic diseases,have a very low incidence of most cancers.,And this is a connection that most people aren’t pursuing right now,,but which we’re fascinated by.,Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area,is being funded by private philanthropies.,And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here,,because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I’m afraid.,In the meantime, while we’re waiting for all these things to happen,,here’s what you can do for yourself.,If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson’s disease,,caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why.,Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson’s disease.,And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.,As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease,,well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect,of reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.,You should also keep your blood pressure down,,because chronic high blood pressure,is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.,It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma,,which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye.,And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects,,"use it or lose it" applies,,so you want to stay mentally stimulated.,But hey, you’re listening to me.,So you’ve got that covered.,And one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay?,Because the clock is ticking for all of us.,Thank you.I and my colleagues Art Aronnand Lucy Brown and others,,have put 37 people who are madly in loveninto a functional MRI brain scanner.,17 who were happily in love,n15 who had just been dumped,,and we're just startingnour third experiment:,studying people who reportnthat they're still in love,after 10 to 25 years of marriage.,So, this is the short storynof that research. 
 In the jungles of Guatemala,nin Tikal, stands a temple.,It was built by the grandest Sun King,nof the grandest city-state,,of the grandest civilizationnof the Americas, the Mayas.,His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.,He stood over six feet tall.,He lived into his 80s,,and he was buried beneathnthis monument in 720 AD.,And Mayan inscriptions proclaimnthat he was deeply in love with his wife.,So, he built a templenin her honor, facing his.,And every spring and autumn,nexactly at the equinox,,the sun rises behind his temple,,and perfectly bathes her templenwith his shadow.,And as the sun setsnbehind her temple in the afternoon,,it perfectly bathesnhis temple with her shadow.,After 1,300 years, these two loversnstill touch and kiss from their tomb. 
 Around the world, people love.,They sing for love, they dance for love,,they compose poems and stories about love.,They tell myths and legends about love.,They pine for love, they live for love,nthey kill for love, and they die for love.,As Walt Whitman once said,n"O I would stake all for you.",Anthropologists have found evidencenof romantic love in 170 societies.,They've never found a societynthat did not have it. 
 But love isn't always a happy experience.,In one study of college students,nthey asked a lot of questions about love,,but the two that stood outnto me the most were:,"Have you ever been rejectednby somebody who you really loved?",And the second question was:,"Have you ever dumped somebodynwho really loved you?",And almost 95 percent of both mennand women said yes to both.,Almost nobody gets out of love alive. 
 So, before I start telling younabout the brain,,I want to read for you,what I think is the most powerfulnlove poem on Earth.,There's other love poems that are,nof course, just as good,,but I don't think this onencan be surpassed.,It was told by an anonymousnKwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska,to a missionary in 1896.,And here it is.,I've never had the opportunitynto say it before.,"Fire runs through my bodynwith the pain of loving you.,Pain runs through my bodynwith the fires of my love for you.,Pain like a boil about to burstnwith my love for you,,consumed by fire with my love for you.,I remember what you said to me.,I am thinking of your love for me.,I am torn by your love for me.,Pain and more pain --,where are you going with my love?,I am told you will go from here.,I am told you will leave me here.,My body is numb with grief.,Remember what I said, my love.,Goodbye, my love, goodbye.",Emily Dickinson once wrote,n"Parting is all we need to know of hell.",How many people have suffered,in all the millions of yearsnof human evolution?,How many people around the world,are dancing with elationnat this very minute?,Romantic love is one of the most powerfulnsensations on Earth. 
 So, several years ago,nI decided to look into the brain,and study this madness.,Our first study of peoplenwho were happily in love,has been widely publicized,,so I'm only going to saynvery little about it.,We found activity in a tiny,nlittle factory near the base of the brain,called the ventral tegmental area.,We found activity in some cellsncalled the A10 cells,,cells that actually makendopamine, a natural stimulant,,and spray it to many brain regions.,Indeed, this part, the VTA,nis part of the brain's reward system.,It's way below your cognitiventhinking process.,It's below your emotions.,It's part of what we callnthe reptilian core of the brain,,associated with wanting, with motivation,nwith focus and with craving.,In fact, the same brain regionnwhere we found activity,becomes active alsonwhen you feel the rush of cocaine. 
 But romantic love is much morenthan a cocaine high --,at least you come down from cocaine.,Romantic love is an obsession,nit possesses you.,You lose your sense of self.,You can't stop thinkingnabout another human being.,Somebody is camping in your head.,As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,n"My longing had no time when it ceases.",Wild is love.,And the obsession can get worsenwhen you've been rejected. 
 So, right now, Lucy Brown and I,nthe neuroscientists on our project,,are looking at the data of the people,who were put into the machinenafter they had just been dumped.,It was very difficult actually,nputting these people in the machine,,because they were in such bad shape. 
 (Laughter) 
 So anyway, we found activitynin three brain regions.,We found activity in the brain region,,in exactly the same brain regionnassociated with intense romantic love.,What a bad deal.,You know, when you've been dumped,,the one thing you love to donis just forget about this human being,,and then go on with your life --nbut no, you just love them harder.,As the poet Terence,nthe Roman poet once said,,he said, "The less my hope,nthe hotter my love.",And indeed, we now know why.,Two thousand years later,nwe can explain this in the brain.,That brain system -- the reward system,for wanting, for motivation,nfor craving, for focus --,becomes more activenwhen you can't get what you want.,In this case, life's greatest prize:nan appropriate mating partner. 
 We found activitynin other brain regions also --,in a brain region associatednwith calculating gains and losses.,You're lying there,nyou're looking at the picture,,and you're in this machine,,and you're calculating what went wrong.,What have I lost?,As a matter of fact, Lucy and Inhave a little joke about this.,It comes from a David Mamet play,,and there's two con artists in the play,,and the woman is conning the man,,and the man looks at the woman and says,,"Oh, you're a bad pony,nI'm not going to bet on you.",And indeed, it's this part of the brain,,the core of the nucleus accumbens,,that is becoming activenas you're measuring your gains and losses.,It's also the brain regionnthat becomes active,when you're willing to take enormous risksnfor huge gains and huge losses. 
 Last but not least,nwe found activity in a brain region,associated with deep attachmentnto another individual.,No wonder people suffer around the world,nand we have so many crimes of passion.,When you've been rejected in love,,not only are you engulfednwith feelings of romantic love,,but you're feeling deepnattachment to this individual.,Moreover, this brain circuitnfor reward is working,,and you're feeling intense energy,nintense focus, intense motivation,and the willingness to risk it all,nto win life's greatest prize. 
 So, what have I learnednfrom this experiment,that I would like to tell the world?,Foremost, I have come to think,that romantic love is a drive,na basic mating drive.,Not the sex drive --,the sex drive gets you lookingnfor a whole range of partners.,Romantic love enables younto focus your mating energy,on just one at a time,nconserve your mating energy,,and start the mating processnwith this single individual.,I think of all the poetrynthat I've read about romantic love,,what sums it up bestnis something that is said by Plato,over 2,000 years ago.,He said, "The god of lovenlives in a state of need.,It is a need, it is an urge,nit is a homeostatic imbalance.,Like hunger and thirst,nit's almost impossible to stamp out.",I've also come to believenthat romantic love is an addiction:,a perfectly wonderful addictionnwhen it's going well,,and a perfectly horrible addictionnwhen it's going poorly. 
 And indeed, it has allnof the characteristics of addiction.,You focus on the person,nyou obsessively think about them,,you crave them, you distort reality,,your willingness to take enormousnrisks to win this person.,And it's got the three mainncharacteristics of addiction:,tolerance, you need to see themnmore, and more, and more;,withdrawals;,and last: relapse.,I've got a girlfriend who's justngetting over a terrible love affair.,It's been about eight months,nshe's beginning to feel better.,And she was driving alongnin her car the other day,,and suddenly she heard a songnon the car radio,that reminded her of this man.,Not only did the instantncraving come back,,but she had to pull overnfrom the side of the road and cry.,So, one thing I would likenthe medical community,,and the legal community,nand even the college community,,to see if they can understand,nthat indeed, romantic love,is one of the most addictivensubstances on Earth. 
 I would also like to tell the worldnthat animals love.,There's not an animal on this planet,that will copulate with anythingnthat comes along.,Too old, too young, too scruffy,ntoo stupid, and they won't do it.,Unless you're stucknin a laboratory cage --,and you know, if you spendnyour entire life in a little box,,you're not going to be as pickynabout who you have sex with,,but I've looked in a hundred species,,and everywhere in the wild,nanimals have favorites.,As a matter of fact,nethologists know this.,There are over eight wordsnfor what they call "animal favoritism:",selective proceptivity, mate choice,nfemale choice, sexual choice.,And indeed, there are nownthree academic articles,in which they've lookednat this attraction,,which may only last for a second,,but it's a definite attraction,,and either this same brain region,nthis reward system,,or the chemicals of that rewardnsystem are involved.,In fact, I think animal attractionncan be instant --,you can see an elephantninstantly go for another elephant.,And I think that this is really the origin,of what you and I calln"love at first sight." 
 People have often asked me,whether what I know about lovenhas spoiled it for me.,And I just simply say, "Hardly.",You can know every single ingredientnin a piece of chocolate cake,,and then when you sit downnand eat that cake,,you can still feel that joy.,And certainly, I make all the samenmistakes that everybody else does too,,but it's really deepened my understanding,and compassion, really,nfor all human life.,As a matter of fact, in New York,nI often catch myself,looking in baby carriagesnand feeling a little sorry for the tot.,And in fact, sometimesnI feel a little sorry,for the chicken on my dinner plate,,when I think of how intensenthis brain system is.,Our newest experiment has been hatched,by my colleague, Art Aron --,putting people who are reportingnthat they are still in love,,in a long-term relationship,ninto the functional MRI.,We've put five people in so far,,and indeed, we found exactlynthe same thing.,They're not lying.,The brain areas associatednwith intense romantic love,still become active, 25 years later. 
 There are still many questionsnto be answered,and asked about romantic love.,The question that I'm working onnright this minute --,and I'm only going to say itnfor a second, and then end --,is, why do you fall in lovenwith one person, rather than another?,I never would haveneven thought to think of this,,but Match.com, the Internet dating site,,came to me three years agonand asked me that question.,And I said, I don't know.,I know what happens in the brain,nwhen you do become in love,,but I don't know why you fall in lovenwith one person rather than another.,And so, I've spentnthe last three years on this.,And there are many reasonsnthat you fall in love with one person,rather than another,nthat psychologists can tell you.,And we tend to fall in love with somebodynfrom the same socioeconomic background,,the same general level of intelligence,nof good looks, the same religious values.,Your childhood certainly plays a role,nbut nobody knows how.,And that's about it, that's all they know.,No, they've never found,the way two personalitiesnfit together to make a good relationship. 
 So, it began to occur to me,that maybe your biology pulls yountowards some people rather than another.,And I have concocted a questionnairento see to what degree,you express dopamine, serotonin,nestrogen and testosterone.,I think we've evolved fournvery broad personality types,associated with the ratiosnof these four chemicals in the brain.,And on this dating sitenthat I have created, called Chemistry.com,,I ask you first a series of questions,to see to what degreenyou express these chemicals,,and I'm watching who chooses who to love.,And 3.7 million people have takennthe questionnaire in America.,About 600,000 people have taken itnin 33 other countries.,I'm putting the data together now,,and at some point --nthere will always be magic to love,,but I think I will come closernto understanding,why it is you can walk into a roomnand everybody is from your background,,your same general levelnof intelligence, good looks,,and you don't feelnpulled towards all of them.,I think there's biology to that.,I think we're going to end up,nin the next few years,,to understand all kindsnof brain mechanisms,that pull us to one personnrather than another. 
 So, I will close with this.,These are my older people.,Faulkner said, "The past is not dead,nit's not even past.",Indeed, we carry a lot of luggagenfrom our yesteryear in the human brain.,And so, there's one thing that makes menpursue my understanding of human nature,,and this reminds me of it.,These are two women.,Women tend to get intimacyndifferently than men do.,Women get intimacynfrom face-to-face talking.,We swivel towards each other,,we do what we callnthe "anchoring gaze" and we talk.,This is intimacy to women.,I think it comes from millions of years,of holding that babynin front of your face,,cajoling it, reprimanding it,neducating it with words.,Men tend to get intimacynfrom side-by-side doing.,As soon as one guy looks up,nthe other guy will look away. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think it comes from millions of yearsnsitting behind the bush,,looking straight ahead, trying to hitnthat buffalo on the head with a rock.,I think, for millions of years,nmen faced their enemies,,they sat side-by-side with friends.,So my final statement is: love is in us.,It's deeply embedded in the brain.,Our challenge is to understand each other. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have, like, a thing about sleeping.,I don't sleep that much,,and I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping much,as being a great virtue, after years of kind of,battling it as being a terrible detriment, or something.,And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.,But for years I've been sitting up,and I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.,I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly.,Sometimes I used to walk more at night.,I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.,(Laughter) 
 And sometimes -- actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post,,that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,,but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on.,And so I was following this guy.,And I took a picture of his shoes,,and we thanked each other and just went on our way.,But I do that all the time.,As a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideas,come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.,Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,,so many clothes out there.,And the only ones that look interesting to me,are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,,or very, very surprising.,And often, I'm driving in a taxi,and I see a hole in a shirt, or something,that looks very interesting or pretty or functional,in some way that I'd never seen happen before.,And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk,,and see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye,,it was a shadow, you know.,Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn,,there was actually someone thought of that thought already.,Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore. 
 I don't know where inspiration comes from.,It does not come for me from research.,I don't get necessarily inspired by research.,As a matter of fact, one of the most fun things,I've ever, ever done in my whole life,,was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.,I read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard.,And I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.,And I saw this really smart critic who I love.,This woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine,,and she came backstage and she said,,oh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinism,and talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia.,And I said, how do I know about Stalinism?,I know about a wolf and a bird and, you know,,he ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know,,you hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know? 
 So I don't really know that. I don't really --,actually I do my own kind of research, you know.,If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,,I will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,,not because it's what I'm supposed to do.,I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.,The color of movies and the way light makes the colors,,light from behind the projection,,or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.,And anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.,I sit up at night and I watch movies,and I watch women in movies a lot.,And I think about, you know, their roles,,and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.,Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.,Whether they're kind of glorified in this way,,or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,,or whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated. 
 I go back to color all the time.,Color is something that motivates me a lot.,It's rarely color that I find in nature,,although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,,natural color is so beautiful.,So that's what I do. I study color a lot.,But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything,that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?,How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?,I mean, that's just not possible, you know.,And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.,I want to show you -- I'm also like a big --,I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,,and that's another thing that motivates me a lot.,People say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.,So I do it.,(Laughter) 
 When I was about 21, an astrologer told me,that I was going to meet the man of my dreams,,and that his name was going to be Eric, right?,So, you know, for years I would go to bars,and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric,I was humping immediately, or something.,(Laughter),And there were times when I was actually so desperate,I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!",And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.,(Laughter),And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.,The last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny,was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane,and you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?,I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing,where I do a cabaret act.,So actually, check this out.,Very embarrassing.,(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask. 
 The name of the show is based on this story,that I have to tell you about my mother.,It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.,I was dating this guy, right?,And this has to do with being happy, I swear.,I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.,And we were getting serious,,so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.,And we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.,My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,,who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.,You know, homosexuality, right?,So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,,"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.,They eat out, they see shows.",They eat out, they see shows.,(Laughter),That's the name of the show, they eat out, they --,that's on my tombstone when I die.,"He ate out, he saw shows," right? 
 So in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity,to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.,So you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something.,Because it's mortifying, and yet it feels ...,I don't know how to put this.,I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.,And at least, you know, in my case,,because if I just do one thing all the time,,I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.,And you know, I don't say that I do everything well,,I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.,And I kind of try not to look back, you know.,Except, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about.,Like, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know.,But I guess that's okay. Right?,Because if you do many things,you get to feel lousy about everything,,and not just one, you know.,You don't master feeling lousy about one thing.,Yeah, exactly. 
 I will show you this next thing,,speaking of costumes for operas.,I do work with different choreographers.,I work with Twyla Tharp a lot,,and I work with Mark Morris a lot,,who is one of my best friends.,And I designed three operas with him,,and the most recent one, "King Arthur.",I'd been very ingrained in the dance world,since I was a teenager.,I went to performing arts high school,,where I was an actor.,And many of my friends were ballet dancers.,Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.,I don't know where it comes from.,I started making puppets when I was a kid.,Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right.,And then performing arts high school.,There I was in high school,,meeting dancers and acting. 
 And somehow, from there, I got interested in design.,I went to Parsons School of Design,and then I began my career as a designer.,I don't really think of myself as a designer,,I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.,And frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.,I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as.,It's just that.,(Laughter),But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time,,that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.,You always have to be slightly bored with everything.,And if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.,(Laughter) 
 But I am really a little bored with everything.,I always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything --,she books everything and she makes everything happen.,And she makes all the deals.,And I always tell her that I find myself,with a lot of time on the computer bridge program.,Too much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that's,so ... somehow, like, about ten years ago,I thought that the most unboring place in the world,would be like a T.V. studio,,like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show.,Because it's all of these things that I love,all kind of in one place.,And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing,,and do another thing and talk about it, right? 
 And so I had this T.V. show.,And that was a very, very, very big part of my process.,Actually, could you roll the clip, please?,This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie. 
 (Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set.,Hi there. 
 Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben. 
 IM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back. 
 Man: Her grandmother says, "Delish!" 
 IM: Ah, wow, delish. All right. So now where should I position myself?,I want to stay out of the way.,I don't want to be -- okay. Here we go.,Do you get nervous, Ashleigh? 
 Ashleigh: Doing what?,ROD: Cutting hair. 
 A: Cutting hair? Never, never.,I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous.,IM: You look so cute already, by the way.,ROD: You like it? All right.,IM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute. 
 ROD: Of course I want to look cute.,IM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know,,aggressively ugly. 
 ROD: No, not me, no. 
 IM: You read about all these people who have a lot of money,and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like,,really messed up, you know what I mean?,And there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.,Because just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous,,does that mean you shouldn't have kids,,because you know they're going to end up getting messed up? 
 ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be,their well-being first, I think.,But you have to make the decision for yourself.,My kids are seven, who the hell knows.,They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.,And they're going to be playing this clip:,"I'm such a good mother.",My God, this is the shortest I've ever had. 
 IM: It looks good, yeah? 
 A: I was going to ask you, has your hair ever been -- 
 ROD: No! It's all right -- go crazy. 
 IM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here. 
 A: Oh no, we're just staging, 
 ROD: We're just staging it. 
 IM: Are you freaking out? You look so cute. 
 ROD: No, I love it. It's the new me. 
 IM: Oh, it's so fabulous! 
 ROD: Flock of Rosie. Wooo! 
 IM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right.,I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.,That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.,Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was,,"Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die.",Right? And then I realized, that was on my website,,and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me,and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.,I forgot that I said that. But it's really true. 
 I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.,I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook.,And I often look at things as though they're food.,Like I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken?,Then how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something.,How could you show a beat up old dress?,I always relate things to kitchen-ry.,And so I think that's what it all boils down to.,Everything boils down to that. 
 So check this out.,This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.,It's, like, this website.,It's got a lot of different things on it.,It's a polymathematical website.,We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments.,And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.,And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows?,And again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right?,And here is the last bit. 
 (Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time. 
 Chef: Do you? 
 IM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever. 
 Chef: Oh. 
 IM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk. 
 Chef: You can't?,IM: It's always low-fat buttermilk. 
 Chef: No, but that's all it is.,IM: Is that all it is? 
 Chef: Oh, you don't know? Let me tell you something.,Let me tell you something interesting. 
 IM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny.,Just because I don't know that whole -- that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.,Sorry, what? 
 Chef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal.,In the old days when they used to make butter,,you know how you make butter? 
 IM: Churns? 
 Chef: For cream? 
 IM: Yeah, exactly. 
 Chef: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream,,and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.,The liquid is actually that clear liquid.,If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream,,it's actually buttermilk.,And that's what it was in the early days.,And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.,Now, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk. 
 IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right? 
 Chef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious. 
 IM: Yeah, it is, exactly.,So who would think that it was low-fat? 
 Well, that's it. Thank you very much.,Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.,Thanks. Bye.(Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you for being here.,And I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years.,And the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,,on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.,And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.,And I said, "Thank you for being here.",My mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,,"Hallelujah, Johnny’s talking!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years,and your mother was out in the audience, say.,My dad said to me, "That’s one" --,I’ll explain that.,But I turned around because I didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from.,I hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years,,so I turned around and I looked and I said,,"God, who's saying what I’m thinking?",And then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.,And I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy.",Well, I want to take you on this journey.,And the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.,Even though this one is kind of unusual,,I want you to think about your own journey. 
 My journey began in 1971,when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,,and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.,It disturbed me so much,that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.,That’s a big thing in California.,And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station,in Inverness, California, because there were only,about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in '71 now.,And so when I came in and I started walking around, people --,they just knew what was going on.,And people would drive up next to me,and say, "John, what are you doing?",And I’d say, "Well, I’m walking for the environment.",And they said, "No, you’re walking to make us look bad, right?,You’re walking to make us feel bad.",And maybe there was some truth to that,,because I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.,Because of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.,And so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.,I called my parents up.,I said, "I’ve given up riding and driving in cars.",My dad said, "Why didn’t you do that when you were 16?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I didn’t know about the environment then.,They’re back in Philadelphia.,And so I told my mother, "I’m happy though, I’m really happy.",She said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn’t have to say it.",Mothers are like that. 
 And so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much,and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking,for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest.,And so I did.,I got up in the morning and I didn’t say a word.,And I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,,because for the first time, I began listening -- in a long time.,And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.,Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,,was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say,and think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say,,and so I stopped listening.,And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead,and thought of what I was going to say back,,while they were still finishing up.,And then I would launch in.,Well, that just ended communication. 
 So on this first day I actually listened.,And it was very sad for me,,because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.,I was 27. I thought I knew everything.,I didn’t.,And so I decided I’d better do this for another day,,and another day, and another day until finally,,I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet,because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.,So for a year I said I would keep quiet,,and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned,and maybe I would talk again.,Well, that lasted 17 years. 
 Now during that time -- those 17 years -- I walked and I played the banjo,and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and,I tried to study the environment by reading books.,And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.,I walked up to Ashland, Oregon,,where they were offering an environmental studies degree.,It’s only 500 miles.,And I went into the Registrar’s office and --,"What, what, what?",I had a newspaper clipping.,"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?,You don’t …?,We have a special program for you." They did.,And in those two years, I graduated with my first degree -- a bachelor’s degree.,And my father came out, he was so proud.,He said, "Listen, we’re really proud of you son,,but what are you going to do with a bachelor’s degree?,You don’t ride in cars, you don’t talk --,you’re going to have to do those things." 
 (Laughter) 
 I hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again,and I started walking.,I walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,,rode it across Puget Sound,and walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.,I had written the University of Montana two years earlier,and said I'd like to go to school there.,I said I'd be there in about two years. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was there. I showed up in two years and they --,I tell this story because they really helped me.,There are two stories in Montana.,The first story is I didn’t have any money -- that’s a sign I used a lot.,And they said,"Don't worry about that.",The director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow.",He gave me 150 dollars,,and he said, "Register for one credit.,You’re going to go to South America, aren’t you?",And I said --,Rivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.,So I did that.,He came back; he said to me,,"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,,you can have a key to an office, you can matriculate --,you’re matriculating, so you can use the library.,And what we’re going to do,is, we’re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.,They’re going to save your grade,,and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,,then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade.",Wow, they don’t do that in graduate schools, I don’t think.,But I use that story because they really wanted to help me.,They saw that I was really interested in the environment,,and they really wanted to help me along the way. 
 And during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking.,I had 13 students when I first walked into the class.,I explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,,that I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,,I didn’t talk and this was the last time,this person’s going to be here interpreting for me.,All the students sat around and they went ... 
 (Laughter) 
 I could see they were looking for the schedule,,to see when they could get out.,They had to take that class with me.,Two weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class. 
 And I learned in that class -- because I would do things like this ...,and they were all gathered around, going, "What's he trying to say?","I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting.","No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that’s -- he's using a handsaw.","Well, you can’t clearcut with a ...","Yes, you can clear cut ...","No, I think he’s talking about selective forestry.",Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.,I just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.,But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign,and they said things that I absolutely did not mean,,but I should have.,And so what came to me is, if you were a teacher,and you were teaching, if you weren’t learning,you probably weren’t teaching very well.,And so I went on. 
 My dad came out to see me graduate,and, you know, I did the deal,,and my father said, "We’re really proud of you son, but ... ",You know what went on,,he said, "You’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.,What are you going to do with a master’s degree?",I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack,and I went on to the University of Wisconsin. 
 I spent two years there writing on oil spills.,No one was interested in oil spills.,But something happened --,Exxon Valdez.,And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.,My dad came out again.,He said, "I don't know how you do this, son --,I mean, you don't ride in cars, you don’t talk.,My sister said maybe I should leave you alone,,because you seem to be doing a lot better,when you’re not saying anything." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I put on my backpack again.,I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,,put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean --,it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States. 
 And on Earth Day, 1990 --,the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak.,And that’s why I said, "Thank you for being here.",Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;,and if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?,And I’m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family,because they had come to hear me speak.,And that’s communication.,And they also taught me about listening -- that they listened to me.,And it’s one of those things that came out of the silence,,the listening to each other.,Really, very important --,we need to listen to each other.,Well, my journey kept going on.,My dad said, "That’s one,",and I still didn’t let that go. 
 I worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.,I wrote regulations for the United States --,I mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.,20 years ago, if someone had said to me,,"John, do you really want to make a difference?","Yeah, I want to make a difference.",He said, "You just start walking east;,get out of your car and just start walking east.",And as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, "Yeah, and shut up, too." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You’re going to make a difference, buddy.",How could that be, how could that be?,How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking,make a difference? 
 Well, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.,And after that -- I only worked one year --,I said, "That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that.",I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,,and walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.,And you know, I forgot the most important thing,,which is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.,I started talking because I had studied environment.,I’d studied environment at this formal level,,but there was this informal level.,And the informal level --,I learned about people, and what we do and how we are.,And environment changed from just being about trees and birds,and endangered species to being about how we treated each other.,Because if we are the environment,,then all we need to do is look around us,and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.,And so that’s the message that I had.,And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message.",And I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean --,it wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat --,got to Venezuela and I started walking. 
 This is the last part of this story, because it’s how I got here,,because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.,I was walking through El Dorado -- it's a prison town, famous prison,,or infamous prison -- in Venezuela, and I don’t know what possessed me,,because this was not like me.,There I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,,"Pasaporte, pasaporte," and with an M16 pointed at me.,And I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?,I don't need to show you my passport. It’s in the back of my pack.,I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world.",And I started walking off.,What possessed me to say this thing?,The road turned into the jungle.,I didn’t get shot.,And I got to -- I start saying, "Free at last --,thank God Almighty, I’m free at last.","What was that about," I’m saying. What was that about? 
 It took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me,,I had become a prisoner.,I was a prisoner and I needed to escape.,The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive,or use motorized vehicles.,Now how could that be?,Because when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me,not to use motorized vehicles.,But the thing that was different,was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,,but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.,I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.,I had no idea I would have a Ph.D. 
 And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me,,and that I was going to have to change.,You know, we can do it.,I was going to have to change.,And I was afraid to change,,because I was so used to the guy who only just walked.,I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop.,I didn’t know who I would be if I changed.,But I know I needed to.,I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way,that I could be here today.,And I know that a lot of times,we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to,,but there’s another place for us to go.,And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we’ve become,,and go to the place of who we are becoming.,And so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,,to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,,as comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.,We have to change now.,As our former Vice President said,,we have to become activists.,So if my voice can touch you,,if my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,,please let it be.,And I know that all of you have touched me,while I’ve been here. 
 So, let’s go out into the world,and take this caring, this love, this respect,that we’ve shown each other right here at TED,,and take this out into the world.,Because we are the environment,,and how we treat each other,is really how we’re going to treat the environment.,So I want to thank you for being here,and I want to end this in five seconds of silence. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You all know this story.,In the summer of 1950,,Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist,and atomic-pile builder,,went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory,and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:,"Where is everybody?",This confused his colleagues, obviously,,because they were sitting right there with him.,And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.,He was talking about the space aliens. 
 You see, this was only a few years after,the supposed flying saucer crash,at Roswell, New Mexico.,And even though that turned out to be nothing,,nothing at all --,(Laughter) --,merely a downed weather balloon,piloted by small hairless men,with slits for mouths ...,Still, America had gone saucer-mad,,even famous scientists,who were eating lunch.,Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,,is that the universe is so vast,that it stands to reason,,there should be other intelligent life out there.,And the universe is so old,that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,,we should have some evidence of their existence by now.,And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone. 
 "Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,,and his colleagues had no answer.,Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic,to disprove fairies,,Sasquatch, God,,the possibility of love --,and thereafter, as you know,,Enrico Fermi ate alone.,(Laughter),Now,,I am not a scientist.,I have never built an atomic pile.,Although, I might argue that, technically,,every pile is atomic. 
 (Laughter) 
 However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities,that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.,One is that the aliens might be,very far away.,Perhaps, I dare say,,even on other planets.,The other possibility --,(Laughter) --,is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself,was an alien. 
 (Laughter) 
 Think about it.,Isn't it a little convenient,that in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,,suddenly an Italian scientist showed up,with an amazing new technology,that would transform everything in the world,and darken the history of the human species forever after?,And isn't it a little strange,that he required no payment for this?,That he asked for only one thing --,a gift of two healthy sperm whales?,That's -- that's not true.,But it is strange. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,,wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince,his fellow scientists,that the space aliens are not already here?,For it is given in certain UFO-ology,or UFOlogy circles,,that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;,that they have walked among us in disguise,,observing us, guiding our evolution,from ape to man --,if you believe in that sort of thing --,and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers,and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a difficult theory to discount,,I think you'll agree. 
 (Laughter) 
 For even in my own life,,there are memories I have,that are difficult to explain --,happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,,that it is difficult to imagine,they were not the result,of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.,For how else will you explain,the amazing and absolutely true,close encounters that I had,and will describe to you now?,Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.,This was the summer when the special edition of,"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.,And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.,Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,,just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I spent the rest of the vacation,largely sitting outside our little rental house at night,,the sidewalk still warm from the sun,,watching the skies for UFOs.,What did I see? Stars, satellites,,blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk.,Occasionally, kids would come and,join me and watch,,but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk,to play video games and mingle with humans.,I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,,so I stayed alone with the cosmos. 
 And that's when it happened.,An elderly couple came walking down the street.,I would say they were in their late seventies,,and I would say that they were on a date,,because he was wearing a very neat little suit,with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.,And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night,and a chill was coming in off the ocean.,I remember, for some reason,,that they were exactly the same height.,And then they stopped, and the man turned to me,and said,,"What are you looking for,,flying saucers?" 
 (Laughter) 
 You have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work,for an old man on a date.,But what was stranger still --,and even I realized it at the time,,as a nine-year-old child --,was that they stopped at all.,That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll,with his sweetheart with the precise reason,of making fun of a child.,"Oh," he said,,"little green men.",And then his girlfriend joined in, too.,"There's no such thing as space men," she said.,"There's no such thing.",And then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha.",I looked around.,The street was entirely empty.,I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.,It was as though time had stopped.,I did not know why they were teasing me.,I looked into their strangely angry faces,,and I remember wondering,,are they wearing rubber masks? 
 (Laughter) 
 And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?,Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?,Slits for mouths?,The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,,and then he made laser sounds.,"Kew, kew, kew --,watch out.",And they turned at once and walked away.,The old man reached out,his knobbly claw,for the woman's hand,,and found it, and left me alone.,Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --,a strange encounter among humans.,Maybe it was swamp gas, but --,(Laughter) --,I know what I saw. 
 Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.,I went to see the movie "Dune,",and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face --,(Laughter) --,this is impossible on its face, I realize --,but it is absolutely true.,It was opening night, naturally.,I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.,On my right was the girl in question.,She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.,I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,,an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.,She was very tall, I would say.,I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,,but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.,I didn't know her name, and I never will.,She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,,and they were talking about the novel, "Dune.",They were both big fans, mother and daughter --,very unusual.,They were talking about how their favorite characters,were the giant sandworms.,And then it got stranger.,That's when she turned to me and said,,"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?" 
 (Laughter) 
 First of all, I was embarrassed,because I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.,I was merely a connoisseur of movies,featuring desert planets, as I still am. 
 (Laughter),But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:,apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,,as though she just wanted to talk to me.,I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes.",I did not even turn my head.,The movie began.,I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,",in which all of the characters,were sexy and deformed at the same time. 
 (Laughter) 
 There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,,which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature,that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist,of psychedelic spice,swirling around him,,allowing him to bend space and time.,He could never leave the tank,or interact with the outside world.,He had become, in his isolation,,so deformed and so sexy,,that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio,to the outside world, and could never touch them.,I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.,The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?,Please. 
 When the movie ended,,everyone seemed very happy,to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.,Except for the girl.,As I walked out, her pace slowed.,Perhaps it was the crutches,,but it seemed --,(Laughter) --,it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.,When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,,but I can only come to the conclusion,that it was what, in the alien abductee community,,they call a "screen memory":,a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain,to cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnapped,and flown off to a sex pyramid. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I sure am glad,I did not slow down to talk to her.,I sure am glad I never saw her again. 
 Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,,1989.,In the mid-to-late '80s,,the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,",in which he described his own lifelong experiences,being abducted by aliens.,And he also described the phenomenon known in this community,as "lost time,",where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware,that he could not remember the previous ten minutes,,or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.,And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens,were taking him and giving him rectal probes. 
 (Laughter) 
 This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.,This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,,and was his, sort of, police sketch,of what the creatures looked like,that Whitley Strieber had described to him.,And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.,And in 1989, the way I remember it,,I was in Philadelphia,visiting my girlfriend, and we decided,,apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.,And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.,One: Whitley Strieber,was played by Christopher Walken.,Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet. 
 (Laughter) 
 Three: there was a surprisingly long,sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet,gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.,Four: this was being shown,in a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.,Five: all of which is to say,,they made a movie out of the book, "Communion,",and it starred Christopher Walken.,Does something seem strange about this to you?,Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?,Think about it. Yes. The answer is:,I had a girlfriend. What? 
 (Laughter) 
 How did this happen? When did this happen?,I remember walking out of the theater,and becoming suddenly aware of this fact,,as we walked hand in hand,,and pondering these very same questions.,And to this day, I have no answer for you.,Close encounter four: the Algarve,,Portugal, 1991.,Some years later, I and this woman --,we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" --,(Laughter) --,went traveling through the south of Portugal together.,We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,,in tiny little hotels,,and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde,and watch the sun set and play checkers.,What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?,We went to some topless beaches.,Excuse me? No, not in my life.,For what it's worth, we went to Sagres,,which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.,And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,,and the lead dog bit me on the ass,,requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic,and receive an ass shot.,Make of that what you will. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our last day in Portugal,,we were in the district capital of Faro,,and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach,one last time.,Now, Faro is a bustling little city,,and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take,a bus and then a boat.,And did I want to come with?,But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No.",I remember what she looked like before she left.,The freckles had grown,and multiplied on her face and shoulders,,clustering into a kind of a tan.,A tan, we were both tan --,is this true?,Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.,She was smiling.,She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,,not even speaking the language,,to travel alone by bus and boat,to go to a beach she did not know,or had never seen.,I loved her, and then she went out,into that strange, alien land. 
 It took me some time to come to my senses.,I had my own "lost time" moment,,where I woke up and suddenly realized,it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,,and she had not come back.,Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.,Now, I did not speak Portuguese.,I did not know where the beach was.,I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,,and the aliens had not given us that technology yet. 
 (Laughter) 
 I realized that the day would only have,two possible outcomes:,either Catherine would come back to the hotel,,or she would never come back to the hotel.,And so I sat down to wait.,I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street,where the buses and cars and pedestrians,and little scooters were moving along.,And I watched those constellations shift,,hoping that they would part and I would see her face.,It was at that moment,,in that very small town of 30,000 or so,,that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe,and the searching we might do in it.,And that's when the Liberians came along.,Five young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,,coming back to this hotel where they were staying. 
 One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me,what was I doing, and I explained.,And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.,But he did not seem so very sure,,for he sat down to wait with me.,And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:,taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,,telling me jokes, distracting me.,Two hours, they gave me a message.,We are not alone. 
 And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,,I turned and looked down the street.,The stars aligned, and she came back.,She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.,Neither did the Liberians,,although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter,as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room,and left us alone in the street, holding hands.,An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,,much like a piece of alien technology,that has been inserted into your buttocks,by a "Portuguese doctor." 
 (Laughter) 
 And even now, a decade and a half later,,even now that we are married,,I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.,And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable,that during the time she was away,,she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,,I love her and wait for her still. 
 Thank you for your kind attention. 
 (Applause)Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of,praise, admiration and thank you,,and having it be specific and genuine. 
 And the way I got interested in this was,,I noticed in myself, when I was growing up,,and until about a few years ago,,that I would want to say thank you to someone,,I would want to praise them,,I would want to take in their praise of me,and I'd just stop it.,And I asked myself, why?,I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.,And then my question became,,am I the only one who does this?,So, I decided to investigate. 
 I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility,,so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.,And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as,,their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.,But then, they hear from all the family and friends,that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him,,but he never told the son.,It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. 
 So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?,I know a gentleman, married for 25 years,,who's longing to hear his wife say,,"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,",but won't ask.,I know a woman who's good at this.,She, once a week, meets with her husband and says,,"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids.",And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great.",And praise really does have to be genuine,,but she takes responsibility for that.,And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten,,she thanks her children for doing their chores.,And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?" 
 So, the question is, why was I blocking it?,Why were other people blocking it?,Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare,,I need size six shoes," but I won't say,,"Would you praise me this way?",And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.,I'm telling you where I'm insecure.,I'm telling you where I need your help.,And I'm treating you, my inner circle,,like you're the enemy.,Because what can you do with that data?,You could neglect me.,You could abuse it.,Or you could actually meet my need. 
 And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this --,same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.,The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels,,it's going to make the bike so much better.",I get the same bike back,,and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels,I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.,So, I'm going to challenge all of you.,I want you to true your wheels:,be honest about the praise that you need to hear.,What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife --,go ask her, what does she need?,Go home to your husband -- what does he need?,Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you. 
 And it's simple.,And why should we care about this?,We talk about world peace.,How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?,I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.,So, let's make it right in our own backyard.,And I want to thank all of you in the audience,for being great husbands, great mothers,,friends, daughters, sons.,And maybe somebody's never said that to you,,but you've done a really, really good job.,And thank you for being here, just showing up,and changing the world with your ideas. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Who are we?,That is the big question.,And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained,,super-intelligent ape.,This could be us.,We belong to the family called the Hominidae.,We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens,,and it's important to remember that,,in terms of our place in the world today,and our future on planet Earth. 
 We are one species,of about five and a half thousand mammalian species,that exist on planet Earth today.,And that's just a tiny fraction of all species,that have ever lived on the planet in past times.,We're one species out of approximately,,or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes,that have existed over the past six to eight million years.,But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape,that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos. 
 And it's important to remember that,,because the bonobos are so human,,and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.,And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.,It's important to remember that we evolved.,Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people,,but we evolved from common ancestors,with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.,We have a common past, and we have a common future.,And it is important to remember that all of these great apes,have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey,as we ourselves have today.,And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,,and it's this journey that has been the focus,of the past three generations of my family,,as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains,of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past. 
 And this is how we look for them.,A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly,out across vast areas of Africa,,looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.,And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across,the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.,I doubt many of you in the audience can see,the fossil that's in this picture,,but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,,of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape,as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.,(Laughter),It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive,and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,,to begin to piece together our past.,We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it. 
 When we find a fossil, we mark it.,Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.,We mark it with a GPS fix,,and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,,so we could essentially put it back on the surface,,exactly where we found it.,And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.,When we then find something very important,,like the bones of a human ancestor,,we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,,using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.,And all the sediment is then put through these screens,,and where we go again through it very carefully,,looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed. 
 And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,,or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.,And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself,were digging up some remains of human ancestors.,And it is one of the most special things,to ever do with your mother.,(Laughter),Not many people can say that. 
 But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.,I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,,it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.,Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.,It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,,or runs down to Lake Malawi.,And the Rift Valley is a depression.,It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,,carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there. 
 If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere,where your bones will be rapidly buried.,You then hope that the earth moves in such a way,as to bring the bones back up to the surface.,And then you hope that one of us lot,will walk around and find small pieces of you.,(Laughter),OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much,as we do know today about our ancestors,,because it's incredibly difficult,,A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,,and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.,And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,,and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story. 
 So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin,in the very north of our country, Kenya.,And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake,that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains,of the animals that lived there.,Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,,which represents some 20,000 square miles.,That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.,Two million years ago at Lake Turkana,,Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors,,actually lived in this region.,You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working,in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,,Homo erectus, up in the far right corner,,lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.,And here is a skull of a Homo erectus,,which I just pulled off the shelf there.,(Laughter) 
 But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.,In fact, if you go back in time,,it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids,or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.,Where did these things come from?,That's what we're still trying to find answers to,,and it is important to realize that there is diversity,in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.,Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils,that have been found from Lake Turkana. 
 But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,,essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana,in search of human remains.,And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,,fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.,And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.,But when I was 12, as I was in this picture,,a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,,when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus. 
 I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,,because I was the same age that he was when he died.,And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.,His brothers certainly were able to run long distances,chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.,He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.,And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,,actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.,He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after,quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,,members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.,Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp,and couldn't get out.,Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried,and beautifully preserved. 
 And he remained there until 1.6 million years later,,when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,,walked along a small hillside,and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface,amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.,It's actually this little piece up here on the top.,Well, an excavation was begun immediately,,and more and more little bits of skull,started to be extracted from the sediment.,And what was so fun about it was this:,the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,,and fairly recently the tree had grown up,,but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,,and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,,holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.,We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,,the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,,things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.,It was truly exciting.,He had a body very similar to our own,,and he was on the threshold of becoming human. 
 Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species,started to move northwards out of Africa,,and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus,in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.,So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa,and begin its spread across the globe.,Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,,from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.,But also, surprising finds,recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,,where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,,and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.,But they lived only 18,000 years ago,,and that is truly extraordinary to think about. 
 Just to put this in terms of generations,,because people do find it hard to think of time,,Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.,We evolved essentially from an African stock.,Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.,And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.,And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes,shared the planet Earth. 
 The question now is, well, who are we?,We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,,with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.,(Laughter),For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.,We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.,Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us,to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth? 
 And what is it that really makes us us?,I think it's our collective intelligence.,It's our ability to write things down,,our language and our consciousness.,From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,,we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use,has really reached unprecedented levels:,we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;,and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter. 
 And we've also managed to communicate with people,all over the world, from extraordinary places.,Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya,,we can talk to people about what we're doing.,As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,,we have reached extraordinary numbers,of people on this planet.,Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,,if you look at the fossil record,,for about, on average, a million years at a time.,We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,,yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people. 
 And last year, our population grew by 80 million.,I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.,You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.,But what's happened is our technology,has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.,We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important,as anything else that's being done in the world today.,But we have to control our numbers,,because we can't really hold it together as a species. 
 My father so appropriately put it,,that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices,that are bad for our survival as a species.",Can we hold it together?,It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.,We all have an African origin.,We have a common past and we share a common future.,Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.,We're sitting on the edge of a precipice,,and we have the tools and the technology at our hands,to communicate what needs to be done,to hold it together today.,We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.,But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course? 
 Well, to end on a very positive note,,I think evolutionarily speaking,,this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.,I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.,(Applause)♫ Feminists don't have a sense of humor. ♫

 Good dog! 
 Thank you.As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles,and how they interact on the most fundamental level.,For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,,such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,,to study things on the smallest scale.,But more recently, I've been turning my attention,to the universe on the largest scale.,Because, as I'll explain to you,,the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.,So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,,what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are --,at least some of the big questions. 
 So, recently, we have realized,that the ordinary matter in the universe --,and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me,,the planets, the stars, the galaxies --,the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent,of the content of the universe.,Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter,of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.,By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.,It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.,It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum,,which is what we use to detect things.,It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?,We know it's there by its gravitational effects.,In fact, this dark matter dominates,the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale,,and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that. 
 What about the rest of the pie?,The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.,More about that later, OK.,So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.,In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,,most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.,This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.,So we have these stars going around in circles like this.,As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --,that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed,than those that are further out here, OK. 
 So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,,that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.,In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --,this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --,we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases,from the center of the galaxy.,When those measurements are made,,instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,,as a function of distance.,If it's constant, that means that the stars out here,are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.,In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy,appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.,And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,,and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.,So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter,that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy. 
 Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;,they tend to cluster.,And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.,And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.,They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.,So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,,we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.,But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.,They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.,So all of these galaxies are moving.,We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,,and figure out how much mass is in this cluster. 
 And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there,than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.,Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,,we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.,But that cannot account for the mass either.,In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here,in the form of this invisible or dark matter,as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.,It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.,I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,,to try to remind you that it's there.,Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can. 
 And so let me lead you through how we can do this.,So here's an observer:,it could be an eye; it could be a telescope.,And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.,How do we see that galaxy?,A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe,for perhaps billions of years,before it enters the telescope or your eye.,Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?,Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling,as it enters our eye, right?,We say, the ray of light came this way;,the galaxy must be there, OK.,Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --,and don't forget the dark matter, OK.,Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,,we now need to take into account,what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.,And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,,will deflect not only the trajectory of particles,,but will deflect light itself. 
 So this light ray will not continue in a straight line,,but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.,Where will this observer see the galaxy?,You can respond. Up, right?,We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.,Is there any other ray of light,that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?,Yes, great. I see people going down like this.,So a ray of light could go down, be bent,up into the observer's eye,,and the observer sees a ray of light here. 
 Now, take into account the fact that we live in,a three-dimensional universe, OK,,a three-dimensional space.,Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?,Yes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.,So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --,that will all be bent by that cluster,and make it into the observer's eye.,If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?,A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.,Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector,and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.,If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image. 
 Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,,to figure out what that image will look like.,Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,,that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.,We call this gravitational lensing.,And so, this is your instrument, OK.,(Laughter).,But ignore the top part.,It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.,So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,,I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.,We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.,So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.,And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment,is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter),So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.,And now put the lens over the galaxy,,and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.,Now, move the base off to the side,,and the ring will split up into arcs, OK.,And you can put it on top of any image.,On the graph paper, you can see,how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.,And again, this is a kind of an accurate model,of what happens with the gravitational lensing. 
 OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?,Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?,And the answer is yes.,And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.,Many of the images you are seeing,are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.,Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --,those are the galaxies in the cluster.,They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter,that are causing the bending of the light,to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,,of the background galaxies.,So the streaks that you see, all these streaks,,are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away. 
 So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion,we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass,there must be in this cluster.,And it's an enormous amount of mass.,And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,,that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.,They are centered on some more spread out structure,,and that is the dark matter,in which the cluster is embedded, OK.,So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing,at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye. 
 OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.,So the evidence that we have,that a quarter of the universe is dark matter --,this gravitationally attracting stuff --,is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies,is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.,The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;,it must be embedded in dark matter.,And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions,that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter. 
 OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.,So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something,that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.,And that is the fact that space itself is expanding.,So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --,and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --,and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,,so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,,horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.,If you could do this, what you would find,that with each passing day, each passing year,,each passing billions of years, OK,,the distance between galaxies is getting greater.,And it's not because galaxies are moving,away from each other through space.,They're not necessarily moving through space.,They're moving away from each other,because space itself is getting bigger, OK.,That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.,So they're moving further apart. 
 Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,,is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.,But because gravitationally attracting matter,is embedded in this space,,it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.,So the expansion slows down with time.,So, in the last century, OK, people debated,about whether this expansion of space would continue forever;,whether it would slow down, you know,,will be slowing down, but continue forever;,slow down and stop, asymptotically stop;,or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.,So a little over a decade ago,,two groups of physicists and astronomers,set out to measure the rate at which,the expansion of space was slowing down, OK.,By how much less is it expanding today,,compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago? 
 The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,,was that space is expanding at a faster rate today,than it was a few billion years ago, OK.,So the expansion of space is actually speeding up.,This was a completely surprising result.,There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.,No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.,It was the opposite of what was expected.,So we need something to be able to explain that.,Now it turns out, in the mathematics,,you can put it in as a term that's an energy,,but it's a completely different type of energy,from anything we've ever seen before.,We call it dark energy,,and it has this effect of causing space to expand.,But we don't have a good motivation,for putting it in there at this point, OK.,So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in. 
 Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,,is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy,are completely different things, OK.,There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,,and they have very different effects.,Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,,it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.,So clusters of galaxies will tend to form,,because of all this gravitational attraction.,Dark energy, on the other hand,,is putting more and more space between the galaxies,,makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,,and so it impedes the growth of structure.,So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,,and how they -- their number density,,how many there are as a function of time --,we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy,compete against each other in structure forming. 
 In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,,you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.,Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.,We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.,Now, what do I mean by well motivated?,I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories,that were actually introduced,to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,,things that I haven't even talked about,,that each predict the existence,of a very weakly interacting, new particle. 
 So, this is exactly what you want in physics:,where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory,that was actually developed for something else.,But we don't know if either of those,are actually the dark matter candidate, OK.,One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.,Now, we look for these dark matter particles,because, after all, they are here in the room, OK,,and they didn't come in the door.,They just pass through anything.,They can come through the building, through the Earth --,they're so non-interacting. 
 So one way to look for them is to build detectors,that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.,So a crystal that will ring if that happens.,So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators,have built such a detector.,And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,,OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days,announced the most sensitive results so far.,They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass,and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.,There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year,and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,,to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating,and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.,The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,,that we'll be turning on later this year.,It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced,at the Large Hadron Collider. 
 Now, because they are so non-interactive,,they will actually escape the detector,,so their signature will be missing energy, OK.,Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics,whose signature could be missing energy,,so it will be hard to tell the difference.,And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed,specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --,ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes,that are in competition right now,to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.,So in terms of the big questions:,what is dark matter? What is dark energy?,The big questions facing physics.,And I'm sure you have lots of questions,,which I very much look forward to addressing,over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.,(Applause)So, people argue vigorously about the definition of life.,They ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.,And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.,I will say that life involves computation.,So this is a computer program.,Booted up in a cell, the program would execute,,and it could result in this person;,or with a small change, it could result in this person;,or another small change, this person;,or with a larger change, this dog,,or this tree, or this whale. 
 So now, if you take this metaphor,[of] genome as program seriously,,you have to consider that Chris Anderson,is a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson,,Craig Venter, as are all of us.,And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true,,there are lots of similarities between genetic programs,and computer programs that could help to convince you.,But one, to me, that's most compelling,is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes,that can make large changes in biological development -- the output.,A small mutation can take a two-wing fly,and make it a four-wing fly.,Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.,Or if you're familiar with "The Princess Bride,",it could create a six-fingered man. 
 Now, a hallmark of computer programs,is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.,If your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit,,you could end up with a thousand dollars.,So these small changes are things that I think,that -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation,in development is underlying these amplified, large changes. 
 So now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology,,and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does.,And what I want to do is write molecular programs,,potentially to build technology.,And there are a lot of people doing this,,a lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.,And they concentrate on using cells.,They're cell-oriented.,So my friends, molecular programmers, and I,have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.,We're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein,,and building new languages for building things from the bottom up,,using biomolecules,,potentially having nothing to do with biology.,So, these are all the machines in a cell.,There's a camera.,There's the solar panels of the cell,,some switches that turn your genes on and off,,the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.,My little group of molecular programmers,are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.,We're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest,,easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.,And as other things become easier to use --,maybe protein -- we'll work with those. 
 If we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?,You're going to sit in front of your computer.,You're going to design something like a cell phone,,and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.,Then you're going to have a compiler,that's going to take that description,and it's going to turn it into actual molecules,that can be sent to a synthesizer,and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.,And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately,,is it will do a developmental computation,,a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.,And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already,,I think that life has been about molecular computers,building electrochemical computers,,building electronic computers,,which together with electrochemical computers,will build new molecular computers,,which will build new electronic computers, and so forth. 
 And if you buy all of this,,and you think life is about computation, as I do,,then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.,So one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?,And for molecular programming,,the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing?,(Laughter),Or how does a computer program know when to stop running?,Or more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop?,There are other questions like this, too.,One of them is Craig Venter's question.,Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.,He asked, how big is the minimal genome,that will give me a functioning microorganism?,How few genes can I use?,This is exactly analogous to the question,,what's the smallest program I can write,that will act exactly like Microsoft Word?,(Laughter),And just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller,,he's writing genomes that will work,,we could write smaller programs,that would do what Microsoft Word does. 
 But for molecular programming, our question is,,how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone?,What's the smallest number we can get away with?,Now, these are big questions in computer science.,These are all complexity questions,,and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions.,Almost -- many of them are impossible.,But for some tasks, we can start to answer them.,So, I'm going to start asking those questions,for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.,So, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA.,It's double-stranded, it's a double helix,,has the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.,And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes,,just so I don't scare you.,We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.,When we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded,,so we can take the blue strand in one tube,and make an orange strand in the other tube,,and they're floppy when they're single-stranded.,You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.,Now for the last 25 years,,Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants,have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures,using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.,But a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.,They can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design. 
 So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago,I call DNA origami,that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen,and design the stuff on a laptop.,But to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA,,which is technically very difficult to get.,So, you can go to a natural source.,You can look in this computer-fabricated artifact,,and he's got a double-stranded genome -- that's no good.,You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria.,They're no good either.,Double strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus,that has a nice, long, single-stranded genome,that we can fold like a piece of paper.,And here's how we do it. 
 This is part of that genome.,We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.,Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place,,and a right half that binds it in a different place,,and brings the long strand together like this.,The net action of many of these on that long strand,is to fold it into something like a rectangle. 
 Now, we can't actually take a movie of this process,,but Shawn Douglas at Harvard,has made a nice visualization for us,that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it.,And what happens is that we mix these strands together.,We heat them up, we add a little bit of salt,,we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down,,and as we cool them down,,the short strands bind the long strands,and start to form structure.,And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.,When you look at DNA origami,,you can see that what it really is,,even though you think it's complicated,,is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other,,and they're held together,by places where short strands go along one helix,and then jump to another one.,So there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds --,it jumps to another helix and comes back.,That holds the long strand like this. 
 Now, to show that we could make any shape or pattern,that we wanted, I tried to make this shape.,I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye,,down the nose, up the nose, around the forehead,,back down and end in a little loop like this.,And so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work.,So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.,I ordered them; they came by FedEx.,I mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down,,and I got 50 billion little smiley faces,floating around in a single drop of water.,And each one of these is just,one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK? 
 So, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them,,you have to get them on a surface where they stick.,So, you pour them out onto a surface,and they start to stick to that surface,,and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.,It's got a needle, like a record needle,,that goes back and forth over the surface,,bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.,It feels the DNA origami.,There's the atomic-force microscope working,and you can see that the landing's a little rough.,When you zoom in, they've got, you know,,weak jaws that flip over their heads,and some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.,You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop,,this little nano-goatee. 
 Now, what's great about this is anybody can do this.,And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.,Anyone know what this is? What is it?,It's China, right?,So, what happened is, a graduate student in China,,Lulu Qian, did a great job.,She wrote all her own software,to design and built this DNA origami,,a beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan,,and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?,(Laughter),So, this works really well,and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?,And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA. 
 And what's really neat about it --,well, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork,,but it turns out that nano-artwork,is just what you need to make nano-circuits.,So, you can put circuit components on the staples,,like a light bulb and a light switch.,Let the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.,And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.,So, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did.,They took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes,,made a little switch, you see here, wired it up,,tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.,Now, this is just a single switch,and you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go.,But this is very promising,because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size,of those in a normal computer.,So it's very promising for making small computers. 
 Now, I want to get back to that compiler.,The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works.,So, you start with something in the computer.,You get a high-level description of the computer program,,a high-level description of the origami.,You can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer,,and it actually works.,And it turns out that a company has made a nice program,that's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly,,and will allow us to do this in a nice,,visual, computer-aided design way. 
 So, now you can say, all right,,why isn't DNA origami the end of the story?,You have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.,The fact is that it does not scale.,So if you want to build a human from DNA origami,,the problem is, you need a long strand,that's 10 trillion trillion bases long.,That's three light years' worth of DNA,,so we're not going to do this.,We're going to turn to another technology,,called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.,It was started by Erik Winfree,,and what it does,,it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.,You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands,and they have little single-stranded bits on them,that can bind to other tiles, if they match.,And we like to draw these tiles as little squares.,And if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits,,you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.,So, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard.,And the point of this, if you didn't catch that,,is that tiles are a kind of molecular program,and they can output patterns.,And a really amazing part of this is,that any computer program can be translated,into one of these tile programs -- specifically, counting.,So, you can come up with a set of tiles,that when they come together, form a little binary counter,rather than a checkerboard.,So you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven. 
 And in order to get these kinds of computations started right,,you need some kind of input, a kind of seed.,You can use DNA origami for that.,You can encode the number 32,in the right-hand side of a DNA origami,,and when you add those tiles that count,,they will start to count -- they will read that 32,and they'll stop at 32.,So, what we've done is we've figured out a way,to have a molecular program know when to stop going.,It knows when to stop growing because it can count.,It knows how big it is.,So, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.,It doesn't tell us how babies do it, however. 
 So now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things,than DNA origami could otherwise.,Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do,is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami,,and we can now use our watering can,and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that,and create a square.,The counter serves as a template,to fill in a square in the middle of this thing.,So, what we've done is we've succeeded,in making something much bigger than a DNA origami,by combining DNA origami with tiles.,And the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.,You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation,and you'll get 96 rather than 32.,And if you do that, the origami's the same size,,but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger. 
 So, this sort of recapitulates,what I was telling you about development.,You have a very sensitive computer program,where small changes -- single, tiny, little mutations --,can take something that made one size square,and make something very much bigger.,Now, this -- using counting to compute,and build these kinds of things,by this kind of developmental process,is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.,So, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required,to build a square of a given size?,If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000,,if we used DNA origami alone,,we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square,of the size of that square;,so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.,That's really not affordable.,But if we use a little computation --,we use origami, plus some tiles that count --,then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands.,And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use,,if we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation.,And so computation is some very powerful way,to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something,,to reduce the size of the genome that you're building. 
 And finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea,about computers building computers.,If you look at the square that you build with the origami,and some counters growing off it,,the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need,to make a memory.,So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles --,rather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles --,then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits,,the demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.,So you can actually make a complicated circuit,using a little bit of computation.,It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.,Now, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path?,Experimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.,Here is a DNA origami rectangle,,and here are some tiles growing from it.,And you can see how they count.,One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.,So it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.,(Laughter) 
 So, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago,,and that's about the time constant for how long it takes,to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.,We've got ideas about how to fix these errors.,And I think in the next five or 10 years,,we'll make the kind of squares that I described,and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits. 
 So now, what do I want you to take away from this talk?,I want you to remember that,to create life's very diverse and complex forms,,life uses computation to do that.,And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations,,and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it,,as Feynman said, you know,,we need to build something to understand it.,And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing,,rebuild everything from the bottom up,,using DNA in ways that nature never intended,,using DNA origami,,and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly. 
 You know, so this is all very cool,,but what I'd like you to take from the talk,,hopefully from some of those big questions,,is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.,It's not just making about --,it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.,What it's really about is taking computer science,and looking at big questions in a new light,,asking new versions of those big questions,and trying to understand how biology,can make such amazing things. Thank you.,(Applause)Those of you who know me know how passionate I am,about opening the space frontier.,So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity,the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.,And I want to tell you that story.,I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.,It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,,for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.,We have something called the Genome 100 --,100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.,Craig Venter chairs that event. 
 And I met Professor Hawking,,and he said his dream was to travel into space.,And I said, "I can't take you there,,but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.,And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes.",Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth,is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.,You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.,Come back down, you weigh twice as much.,You do it again and again.,You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --,how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.,We set out to do this.,It took us 11 years to become operational.,And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.,We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,,you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he wanted to go.,We worked hard to get all the permissions.,And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.,We had a press conference,,we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,,give him 25 seconds of zero-g.,And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.,Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.,And what he said, for me, was very moving.,He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk,of being wiped out by disaster ...,I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.,I therefore want to encourage public interest in space.",We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,,up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane. 
 We had about 20 people who made donations --,we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --,who flew with us.,A few TEDsters here.,We set up a whole ER.,We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.,We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.,We had everything all set in case of an emergency;,God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.,We took off from the shuttle landing facility,,where the shuttle takes off and lands. 
 And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I,carefully suspended him into zero-g.,Once he was there, [we] let him go,to experience what weightlessness was truly like.,And after that first parabola, you know,,the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.,So we did a second parabola. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And a third. 
 (Applause) 
 We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton,because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge,that Isaac Newton did.,And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth. 
 (Laughter) 
 And a seventh and an eighth.,And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man. 
 (Laughter) 
 He was so happy.,We are living on a precious jewel,,and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.,Please join us in this epic adventure.,Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)Philosophers, dramatists, theologians,have grappled withnthis question for centuries:,what makes people go wrong?,Interestingly, I asked this questionnwhen I was a little kid.,I grew up in the South Bronx,ninner-city ghetto in New York,,and I was surrounded by evil,,as all kids are who grew upnin an inner city.,And I had friendsnwho were really good kids,,who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hydenscenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.,That is, they took drugs,ngot in trouble, went to jail.,Some got killed, and some did itnwithout drug assistance. 
 So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,nthat wasn't fiction.,The only question is,nwhat was in the juice?,And more importantly, that linenbetween good and evil --,which privileged people like to thinknis fixed and impermeable,,with them on the good side,nthe others on the bad side --,I knew that line was movable,nand it was permeable.,Good people could benseduced across that line,,and under good and some rarencircumstances, bad kids could recover,with help, with reform,nwith rehabilitation. 
 So I want to beginnwith this wonderful illusion,by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.,If you look at it and focus on the white,nwhat you see is a world full of angels.,But let's look more deeply, and as we do,,what appears is the demons,nthe devils in the world.,That tells us several things. 
 One, the world is, was, will alwaysnbe filled with good and evil,,because good and evil is the yin and yangnof the human condition.,It tells me something else.,If you remember,nGod's favorite angel was Lucifer.,Apparently, Lucifer means "the light.",It also means "the morning star,"nin some scripture.,And apparently, he disobeyed God,,and that's the ultimatendisobedience to authority.,And when he did, Michael, the archangel,nwas sent to kick him out of heaven,along with the other fallen angels.,And so Lucifer descends into hell,nbecomes Satan,,becomes the devil, and the forcenof evil in the universe begins. 
 Paradoxically, it was Godnwho created hell as a place to store evil.,He didn't do a good jobnof keeping it there though.,So, this arc of the cosmic transformationnof God's favorite angel into the Devil,,for me, sets the contextnfor understanding human beings,who are transformed from good,nordinary people into perpetrators of evil. 
 So the Lucifer effect,nalthough it focuses on the negatives --,the negatives that people can become,,not the negatives that people are --,leads me to a psychological definition.,Evil is the exercise of power.,And that's the key: it's about power.,To intentionally harmnpeople psychologically,,to hurt people physically,nto destroy people mortally, or ideas,,and to commit crimes against humanity.,If you Google "evil," a word that shouldnsurely have withered by now,,you come up with 136 million hitsnin a third of a second. 
 A few years ago -- I am surenall of you were shocked, as I was,,with the revelation of American soldiersnabusing prisoners in a strange place,in a controversial war,nAbu Ghraib in Iraq.,And these were men and women,who were putting prisonersnthrough unbelievable humiliation.,I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,,because I had seennthose same visual parallels,when I was the prison superintendentnof the Stanford Prison Study. 
 Immediately the Bushnadministration military said what?,What all administrations saynwhen there's a scandal:,"Don't blame us. It's not the system.,It's the few bad apples,nthe few rogue soldiers.",My hypothesis is,nAmerican soldiers are good, usually.,Maybe it was the barrel that was bad.,But how am I going to dealnwith that hypothesis? 
 I became an expert witnessnfor one of the guards,,Sergeant Chip Frederick,nand in that position,,I had access to the dozenninvestigative reports.,I had access to him.,I could study him, have him comento my home, get to know him,,do psychological analysis to see,nwas he a good apple or bad apple.,And thirdly, I had accessnto all of the 1,000 pictures,that these soldiers took.,These pictures arenof a violent or sexual nature.,All of them come from the camerasnof American soldiers.,Because everybody hasna digital camera or cell phone camera,,they took pictures of everything,nmore than 1,000. 
 And what I've done is I organized themninto various categories.,But these are by United Statesnmilitary police, army reservists.,They are not soldiers preparednfor this mission at all.,And it all happened in a single place,nTier 1-A, on the night shift.,Why?,Tier 1-A was the centernfor military intelligence.,It was the interrogation hold.,The CIA was there.,Interrogators fromnTitan Corporation, all there,,and they're getting no informationnabout the insurgency.,So they're going to put pressurenon these soldiers,,military police, to cross the line,,give them permission to breaknthe will of the enemy,,to prepare them for interrogation,nto soften them up,,to take the gloves off.,Those are the euphemisms,nand this is how it was interpreted.,Let's go down to that dungeon.

 So, pretty horrific.,That's one of the visualnillustrations of evil.,And it should not have escaped you,that the reason I pairednthe prisoner with his arms out,with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity,is that that prisoner was mentally ill.,That prisoner covered himselfnwith shit every day,,they had to roll him in dirtnso he wouldn't stink.,But the guards ended upncalling him "Shit Boy.",What was he doing in that prisonnrather than in some mental institution? 
 In any event, here's formernSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld.,He comes down and says,n"I want to know, who is responsible?,Who are the bad apples?",Well, that's a bad question.,You have to reframe it and ask,n"What is responsible?","What" could be the who of people,,but it could also benthe what of the situation,,and obviously that's wrongheaded. 
 How do psychologists try to understandnsuch transformations of human character,,if you believenthat they were good soldiers,before they went down to that dungeon?,There are three ways.nThe main way is called dispositional.,We look at what's insidenof the person, the bad apples. 
 This is the foundationnof all of social science,,the foundation of religion,nthe foundation of war.,Social psychologists like mencome along and say,,"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,,but you'll have to be awarenof the situation.,Who are the cast of characters?nWhat's the costume?,Is there a stage director?",And so we're interested innwhat are the external factors,around the individual -- the bad barrel?,Social scientists stop therenand they miss the big point,that I discovered when I becamenan expert witness for Abu Ghraib.,The power is in the system.,The system creates the situationnthat corrupts the individuals,,and the system is the legal, political,neconomic, cultural background.,And this is where the powernis of the bad-barrel makers. 
 If you want to change a person,nchange the situation.,And to change it, you've got to knownwhere the power is, in the system.,So the Lucifer effectninvolves understanding,human character transformationsnwith these three factors.,And it's a dynamic interplay.,What do the people bringninto the situation?,What does the situation bring out of them?,And what is the systemnthat creates and maintains that situation? 
 My recent book,n"The Lucifer Effect," is about,,how do you understandnhow good people turn evil?,And it has a lot of detailnabout what I'm going to talk about today.,So Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect,"nalthough it focuses on evil,,really is a celebration of the humannmind's infinite capacity,to make any of us kind or cruel,,caring or indifferent,ncreative or destructive,,and it makes some of us villains.,And the good news that I'm goingnto hopefully come to at the end,is that it makes some of us heroes.,This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorkernsummarizes my whole talk:,"I'm neither a good copnnor a bad cop, Jerome.,Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam,of positive and negativenpersonality traits,that emerge or not, dependingnon the circumstances." 
 (Laughter) 
 There's a study some of younthink you know about,,but very few peoplenhave ever read the story.,You watched the movie.,This is Stanley Milgram,nlittle Jewish kid from the Bronx,,and he asked the question,n"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?",People say, "No, that's Nazi Germany,nHitler, you know, that's 1939.",He said, "Yeah, but supposenHitler asked you,,'Would you electrocute a stranger?'n'No way, I'm a good person.'",He said, "Why don'tnwe put you in a situation,and give you a chancento see what you would do?" 
 And so what he did was he testedn1,000 ordinary people.,500 New Haven, Connecticut,n500 Bridgeport.,And the ad said, "Psychologistsnwant to understand memory.,We want to improve people's memory,nbecause it is the key to success.",OK?,"We're going to give you five bucks --nfour dollars for your time.,We don't want college students.nWe want men between 20 and 50.",In the later studies, they ran women.,Ordinary people: barbers,nclerks, white-collar people. 
 So, you go down,,one of you will be a learner,none will be a teacher.,The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.,He gets tied up to the shocknapparatus in another room.,The learner could be middle-aged,ncould be as young as 20.,And one of you is told by the authority,nthe guy in the lab coat,,"Your job as teacher is to give himnmaterial to learn.,Gets it right, reward.,Gets it wrong, you pressna button on the shock box.,The first button is 15 volts.nHe doesn't even feel it.",That's the key.,All evil starts with 15 volts.,And then the next stepnis another 15 volts.,The problem is, at the endnof the line, it's 450 volts.,And as you go along, the guy is screaming,,"I've got a heart condition!nI'm out of here!" 
 You're a good person. You complain.,"Sir, who will be responsiblenif something happens to him?",The experimenter says,n"Don't worry, I will be responsible.,Continue, teacher.",And the question is, who would gonall the way to 450 volts?,You should notice here,nwhen it gets up to 375,,it says, "Danger. Severe Shock.",When it gets up to here, there's "XXX" --nthe pornography of power. 
 So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,,"What percent of American citizensnwould go to the end?",They said only one percent.,Because that's sadistic behavior,nand we know, psychiatry knows,,only one percentnof Americans are sadistic.,OK.,Here's the data.nThey could not be more wrong.,Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts.,This was just one study.,Milgram did more than 16 studies.,And look at this.,In study 16, where you seensomebody like you go all the way,,90 percent go all the way.,In study five, if you see people rebel,,90 percent rebel.,What about women?nStudy 13 -- no different than men.,So Milgram is quantifying evilnas the willingness of people,to blindly obey authority,nto go all the way to 450 volts.,And it's like a dial on human nature.,A dial in a sense that you can makenalmost everybody totally obedient,,down to the majority, down to none. 
 What are the external parallels?nFor all research is artificial.,What's the validity in the real world?,912 American citizensncommitted suicide or were murdered,by family and friendsnin Guyana jungle in 1978,,because they were blindly obedientnto this guy, their pastor --,not their priest -- their pastor,nReverend Jim Jones.,He persuaded them to commit mass suicide.,And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,,a man of God who becomesnthe Angel of Death.,Milgram's study is all about individualnauthority to control people.,Most of the time, we are in institutions,,so the Stanford Prison Studynis a study of the power of institutions,to influence individual behavior.,Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and Inwere in the same high school class,in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954. 
 I did this studynwith my graduate students,,especially Craig Haney --nand it also began work with an ad.,We had a cheap, little ad,,but we wanted college studentsnfor a study of prison life.,75 people volunteered,ntook personality tests.,We did interviews.,Picked two dozen: the most normal,nthe most healthy.,Randomly assigned themnto be prisoner and guard.,So on day one, we knew we had good apples.,I'm going to put them in a bad situation. 
 And secondly, we knownthere's no difference,between the boys who will be guardsnand those who will be prisoners.,To the prisoners, we said,,"Wait at home. The studynwill begin Sunday.",We didn't tell them,that the city police were goingnto come and do realistic arrests. 
 (Video) (Music) 
 [Day 1] 
 Student: A police car pulls up in front,nand a cop comes to the front door,,and knocks, and says he's looking for me.,So they, right there, you know,nthey took me out the door,,they put my hands against the car.,It was a real cop car,nit was a real policeman,,and there were realnneighbors in the street,,who didn't knownthat this was an experiment.,And there was camerasnall around and neighbors all around.,They put me in the car,nthen they drove me around Palo Alto.,They took me to the basementnof the police station.,Then they put me in a cell.,I was the first one to be picked up,nso they put me in a cell,,which was just like a roomnwith a door with bars on it.,You could tell it wasn't a real jail.,They locked me in there,nin this degrading little outfit.,They were takingnthis experiment too seriously. 
 Here are the prisoners, who are goingnto be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.,Here are the guardsnwith the symbols of power and anonymity.,Guards get prisoners to clean the toiletnbowls out with their bare hands,,to do other humiliating tasks.,They strip them naked.nThey sexually taunt them.,They begin to do degrading activities,nlike having them simulate sodomy.,You saw simulating fellationin soldiers in Abu Ghraib.,My guards did it in five days.,The stress reaction was so extreme,that normal kids we pickednbecause they were healthy,had breakdowns within 36 hours.,The study ended after six days,nbecause it was out of control.,Five kids had emotional breakdowns. 
 Does it make a difference,if warriors go to battlenchanging their appearance or not?,If they're anonymous,nhow do they treat their victims?,In some cultures, they go to warnwithout changing their appearance.,In others, they paint themselvesnlike "Lord of the Flies.",In some, they wear masks.,In many, soldiersnare anonymous in uniform.,So this anthropologist, John Watson, foundn23 cultures that had two bits of data.,Do they change their appearance? 15.,Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.,If they don't change their appearance,,only one of eight kills,ntortures or mutilates.,The key is in the red zone.,If they change their appearance,,12 of 13 -- that's 90 percent --nkill, torture, mutilate.,And that's the power of anonymity. 
 So what are the seven social processes,that grease the slippery slope of evil?,Mindlessly taking the first small step.,Dehumanization of others.nDe-individuation of self.,Diffusion of personal responsibility.,Blind obedience to authority.,Uncritical conformity to group norms.,Passive tolerance of evilnthrough inaction, or indifference. 
 And it happens when you'renin a new or unfamiliar situation.,Your habitual responsenpatterns don't work.,Your personalitynand morality are disengaged.,"Nothing is easiernthan to denounce the evildoer;,nothing more difficultnthan understanding him," Dostoyevsky.,Understanding is not excusing.nPsychology is not excuse-ology. 
 So social and psychologicalnresearch reveals,how ordinary, good people can bentransformed without the drugs.,You don't need it. You just neednthe social-psychological processes.,Real world parallels?,Compare this with this.,James Schlesinger --nI'm going to end with this -- says,,"Psychologists have attemptednto understand how and why,individuals and groupsnwho usually act humanely,can sometimes act otherwisenin certain circumstances.",That's the Lucifer effect.,And he goes on to say,n"The landmark Stanford study,provides a cautionary talenfor all military operations.",If you give people powernwithout oversight,,it's a prescription for abuse.,They knew that, and let that happen. 
 So another report, an investigativenreport by General Fay,,says the system is guilty.,In this report, he says it wasnthe environment that created Abu Ghraib,,by leadership failures that contributednto the occurrence of such abuse,,and because it remained undiscovered,by higher authoritiesnfor a long period of time.,Those abuses went on for three months.,Who was watching the store?,The answer is nobody, I think on purpose.,He gave the guards permissionnto do those things,,and they knew nobody was ever goingnto come down to that dungeon. 
 So you need a paradigm shiftnin all of these areas.,The shift is away from the medical modelnthat focuses only on the individual.,The shift is toward a public health model,that recognizes situationalnand systemic vectors of disease.,Bullying is a disease.nPrejudice is a disease.,Violence is a disease.,Since the Inquisition, we've been dealingnwith problems at the individual level.,It doesn't work.,Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says,n"The line between good and evil,cuts through the heartnof every human being.",That means that line is not out there.,That's a decision that you havento make, a personal thing. 
 So I want to end very quicklynon a positive note.,Heroism as the antidote to evil,,by promoting the heroic imagination,,especially in our kids,nin our educational system.,We want kids to think,n"I'm a hero in waiting,,waiting for the rightnsituation to come along,,and I will act heroically.,My whole life, I'm now goingnto focus away from evil --,that I've been in since I was a kidn-- to understanding heroes. 
 Banality of heroism.,It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.,It's the counterpointnto Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil.",Our traditional societal heroes are wrong,nbecause they are the exceptions.,They organize their life around this.nThat's why we know their names.,Our kids' heroesnare also wrong models for them,,because they have supernatural talents.,We want our kids to realizenmost heroes are everyday people,,and the heroic act is unusual.,This is Joe Darby.,He was the one that stoppednthose abuses you saw,,because when he saw those images,,he turned them overnto a senior investigating officer.,He was a low-level private,nand that stopped it.,Was he a hero? No.,They had to put him in hiding,nbecause people wanted to kill him,,and then his mother and his wife.,For three years, they were in hiding. 
 This is the woman who stoppednthe Stanford Prison Study.,When I said it got out of control,nI was the prison superintendent.,I didn't know it was out of control.nI was totally indifferent.,She saw that madhouse and said,,"You know what, it's terriblenwhat you're doing to those boys.,They're not prisoners nor guards,nthey're boys, and you are responsible.",And I ended the study the next day.,The good newsnis I married her the next year. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I just came to my senses, obviously. 
 So situations have the powernto do [three things].,But the point is,nthis is the same situation,that can inflame the hostilenimagination in some of us,,that makes us perpetrators of evil,,can inspire the heroicnimagination in others.,It's the same situationnand you're on one side or the other.,Most people are guiltynof the evil of inaction,,because your mother said, "Don't getninvolved. Mind your own business.",And you have to say,n"Mama, humanity is my business." 
 So the psychology of heroism is --nwe're going to end in a moment --,how do we encourage childrennin new hero courses,,that I'm working on with Matt Langdon --nhe has a hero workshop --,to develop this heroic imagination,nthis self-labeling,,"I am a hero in waiting,"nand teach them skills.,To be a hero, you havento learn to be a deviant,,because you're always goingnagainst the conformity of the group.,Heroes are ordinary people whose socialnactions are extraordinary. Who act. 
 The key to heroism is two things.,You have to actnwhen other people are passive.,B: You have to act socio-centrically,nnot egocentrically.,And I want to end with a known storynabout Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.,Fifty-year-old African-Americannconstruction worker standing on a subway.,A white guy falls on the tracks.,The subway train is coming.nThere's 75 people there.,You know what? They freeze.,He's got a reason not to get involved.,He's black, the guy's white,nand he's got two kids.,Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger,,jumps on the tracks,nputs the guy between the tracks,,lays on him, the subway goes over him.,Wesley and the guy --n20 and a half inches height.,The train clearance is 21 inches.,A half an inchnwould have taken his head off.,And he said, "I did what anyone could do,"nno big deal to jump on the tracks. 
 And the moral imperativenis "I did what everyone should do.",And so one day,nyou will be in a new situation.,Take path one, you're goingnto be a perpetrator of evil.,Evil, meaning you're going to benArthur Andersen.,You're going to cheat,nor you're going to allow bullying.,Path two, you become guiltynof the evil of passive inaction.,Path three, you become a hero.,The point is, are we ready to takenthe path to celebrating ordinary heroes,,waiting for the rightnsituation to come along,to put heroic imagination into action?,Because it may only happennonce in your life,,and when you pass it by,nyou'll always know,,I could have been a heronand I let it pass me by.,So the point is thinking itnand then doing it. 
 So I want to thank you. Thank you.,Let's oppose the power of evil systemsnat home and abroad,,and let's focus on the positive.,Advocate for respect of personal dignity,nfor justice and peace,,which sadly our administrationnhas not been doing. 
 Thanks so much. 
 (Applause)The north coast of California has rainforests --,temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.,This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.,Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens.,Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.,The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.,That's 38 stories tall.,These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.,Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are,because nobody has ever drilled into any of them,to count their annual growth rings, and, in any case,,the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.,But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods,are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon --,although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees,that are older than that. 
 You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.,The largest individuals of this species,,the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California,,where the rain is really intense.,In recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest,was cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging,,clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s.,Even so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact,,wild and now protected -- entirely protected --,in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls,along the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park.,But curiously, Redwood rainforests, the fragments that we have left,,to this day remain under-explored.,Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through,,and even today, individual trees are being discovered,that have never been seen before, including, in the summer of 2006,,Hyperion, the world's tallest tree. 
 I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment.,I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism.,And, Chris, if I could have you up here? I have a tape measure.,It's a kind loaner from TED.,And Chris, if you could take the end of that tape measure?,We're going to show you what the diameter,at breast height of a big Redwood is.,Unfortunately, this tape isn't long enough -- it's only a 25-foot tape.,Chris, could you extend your arm out that way? There we go. OK.,And maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood.,Now, let your imagination go upward into space.,Think about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet,,32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms,upward into space over long periods of time. 
 The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time:,not human time, but what we might call Redwood time.,Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.,To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still,,and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion,,moving upward into space, articulating themselves,and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.,Plant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this:,the Lost Monarch.,It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast,,and was discovered in 1998.,And yet, when you look at the base of a Redwood tree,,you're not seeing the organism.,You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant,,and most of the organism is overhead, unseen. 
 I became very interested, and I wrote about a couple.,Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers,of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world-class athletes,,and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.,Steve Sillett, when he was a 19-year-old college student,at Reed College, had heard that the Redwood forest canopy,is considered to be a so-called Redwood desert.,That is to say, at that time it was believed,that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.,And with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood,without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there.,He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood,,and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands,,and ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze.,And then, from there, he climbed directly up the bark,until he got to the top of the tree. 
 His friend, a guy named Marwood Harris, was following behind.,Neither one of them had noticed that there was,a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball,hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.,And when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps,stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go.,He would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.,But they made it to the top, and what they found,was not a Redwood desert, but a lost world --,a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life.,Now, I had been working on other topics:,the emergence of infectious diseases,,which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth,,make a trans-species jump, and get into humans. 
 After three books on this, it got to be a bit much, in a way.,My wife and I adore our children.,And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them,,using the so-called arborist climbing technique,,with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.,Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees.,That's my son, Oliver.,They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do. 
 (Laughter) 
 If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, then children,are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest.,Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of,that are afraid of heights.,All other primates, when they're scared,,they run up a tree, where they feel safe.,We camped overnight in the trees, in tree boats.,This is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat.,She's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall.,Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong,coming in three dimensions around us.,We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels,,who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are,because they've never seen them in the canopy before.,And we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking,,where you can move from tree to tree through space,,rather like Spiderman.,It became a writing project. 
 When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood, he fires an arrow,,which trails a fishing line, which gets over a branch in the tree,,and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.,You ascend 30 stories.,There are two people climbing this tree, Gaya,,which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are.,They are only one-seventh of the way up that tree.,You do feel a sense of exposure.,There is a small person right down there on the ground.,You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood.,But then you enter the Redwood canopy,,and it's like coming through a layer of clouds.,And all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground,,and you also lose sight of the sky,,and you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air,filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil,,which is populated with all kinds of small organisms. 
 There are epiphytes, plants that grow on trees.,These are huckleberry bushes.,Many species of mosses, and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree.,When you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall --,in fact, it's difficult to move.,You're worming your way through branches which are crowded,with living things that don't occur near the ground.,It's like scuba diving into a coral reef,,except you're going upward instead of downward.,And then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.,Maria's sitting on one of them.,These limbs could be five to six hundred years old.,Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops.,They also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes,that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees,that are technically known as huckleberry afros,,and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting. 
 Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space,because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.,A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs,,the limbs burst into small trees, copies of the Redwood.,Now, here we see a reiteration in Chronos, one of the older Redwoods.,This reiteration is a huge flying buttress,that comes out the tree itself.,This buttress is less than halfway up the tree.,And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.,This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base,and extends upward for 150 feet.,It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River,,and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos. 
 This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar,,made by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.,What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development,of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal,,of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks.,I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.,There's the person, right there. The person is waving to us.,I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert,a synthetic chromosome into a human,so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.,And if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand,would be people who looked like us,,and they would have people on their hands and so on.,And if we had Redwood-like biology,,we would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were.,And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone,and have all our reiterations wave at the same time. 
 (Laughter) 
 To reiterate the point, let's go closer into Iluvatar.,We're looking at that yellow box.,And this hallucinatory drawing shows you --,everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.,These are millennial structures -- portions of the tree,that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.,There are four humans in this shot -- one, two, three, four.,And there's also something that I want to show you.,This is a flying buttress.,Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space,,and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk,,going back into the main trunk and fusing with it.,Flying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree,and help the tree exist longer through time.,The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees.,They've wired them like patients in an ICU. 
 They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air,and down into their trunks,,possibly all the way into their root systems.,They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.,If a portion of a Redwood is rotting,,the Redwood will send roots into its own form,and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.,If we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm,then we could just, you know,,extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.,Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep,,hundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil,that have, as yet, no names. 
 This is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean.,These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans,,and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales.,What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil,hundreds of feet above the ocean, or how they got there,,is completely unknown.,There are some interesting theories,that, if I had time, I would tell you about.,But as you go and you look closer at a tree,,what you see is, you see increasing complexity.,We're looking at the very top of Gaya, which is thought to be the oldest Redwood.,Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old,,no one really knows, but its top has broken off,and it's been rotting back now. 
 This little Japanese garden-like creation probably took 700 years,to form in its complexity that we see right now.,As you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.,I have to show you something unfortunately very sad,at the conclusion of this talk.,The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East.,And we're moving in a full circle now.,In the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia,,called the Hemlock woolly adelgid.,It made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia,,where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia.,When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree,,it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it.,The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways,the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River. 
 I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east,,but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park,it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.,And in the last two to three summers, these invasive organisms,,this kind of Ebola of the trees, as it were,,has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east,,and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer.,This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park,,and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see.,And what we're seeing is not just the potential death,of the Eastern Hemlock species --,that is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite --,but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem,for which these trees are merely the substrate,for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns. 
 It's absolutely heartbreaking to see.,One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it --,is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all,,and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.,What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves?,Well, I think they can tell us something about human time.,The flickering, transitory quality of human time,and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love.,But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us,something about ourselves in the differences that we have.,We are human, and we have the capacity to love,,we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of,boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness,that so suits us as primates, I think. 
 And at least for me, personally, the trees have taught me,an entirely new way of loving my children.,Exploring with them the forest canopy,has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.,And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that,with my children I've been able to introduce them,into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough,,or possibly stupid enough, to still climb trees.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED,,I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that,because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older,,on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species,that are not found anywhere on the Earth,except on that one tree. Is that correct? 
 Richard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.,And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.,And while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted,an unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk.,Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees, curiously enough,,and we wondered whether this ant, this species of ant,,was only endemic to that one tree, or possibly to that grove.,And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again,,and so no specimens have ever been collected.,We don't know what it is -- we just know it's there. 
 CA: So, you have to wonder when, you know,,if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth,,you know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.,You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening,,and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.,It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me,,and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is. 
 RP: It is fragile, and you know, I think about emerging human diseases --,parasites that move into the human species.,But that's just a very small facet,of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide,,all through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself -- 
 CA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently. 
 RP: Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans.,You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace,,and the continents are rooms in the palace,,and the islands are small rooms.,But lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open,,and the walls are coming down. 
 CA: Richard Preston, thank you very much, I think. 
 RP: Thank you.This means, "I'm smiling.",So does that.,This means "mouse.","Cat.",Here we have a story.,The start of the story, where this means guy,,and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.,Here's where it happens.,These are when.,This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.,She wears it every day.,It's not considered vintage --,she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.,Look at her posture; it's remarkable.,That's because she dances.,Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,,"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And he could say, "Oh my God!",or "I heart you!","I'm laughing out loud.","I want to give you a hug.",But he comes up with that, you know.,He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug." 
 (Laughter) 
 Put a crab inside it.,Add some water.,Seven different salts.,He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,,but just panhandle at the ocean.,He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz.",And the girl goes, "Wha'?",So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.,I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.,At least, that's how it seems.,I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --,for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes. 
 Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.,I'm a monkey --,(Laughter) --,blowing kisses,at a butterfly.,But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.,First, soon, and then a lot.,I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,,but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.,Hell, ponytail alone.,I don't know what else to tell you.,I got a pencil you can borrow.,You can put it in your phone.",But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.,She just says, "No thank you.",You know?,[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ] 
 (Applause)My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes.",And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,,but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,,you'll see a little bit of a relation.,It ties to origami. So let me start.,What is origami?,Most people think they know what origami is. It's this:,flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.,And that is what origami used to be.,But it's become something else.,It's become an art form, a form of sculpture. 
 The common theme -- what makes it origami --,is folding is how we create the form.,You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.,It shows these women playing with these toys.,If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.,Every Japanese kid,learns how to fold that crane.,So this art has been around for hundreds of years,,and you would think something,that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --,everything that could be done has been done a long time ago.,And that might have been the case. 
 But in the twentieth century,,a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,,and he created tens of thousands of new designs.,But even more importantly, he created a language,,a way we could communicate,,a code of dots, dashes and arrows.,Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,,we now have a means of transmitting information,with heredity and selection,,and we know where that leads.,And where it has led in origami,is to things like this.,This is an origami figure --,one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.,This, too, is origami,,and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.,Naturalism. Detail.,You can get horns, antlers --,even, if you look close, cloven hooves. 
 And it raises a question: what changed?,And what changed is something,you might not have expected in an art,,which is math.,That is, people applied mathematical principles,to the art,,to discover the underlying laws.,And that leads to a very powerful tool.,The secret to productivity in so many fields --,and in origami --,is letting dead people do your work for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because what you can do is,take your problem,,and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,,and use their solutions.,And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.,Origami revolves around crease patterns.,The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint,for an origami figure.,And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.,They have to obey four simple laws.,And they're very simple, easy to understand.,The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern,with just two colors without ever having,the same color meeting.,The directions of the folds at any vertex --,the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --,always differs by two. Two more or two less.,Nothing else.,If you look at the angles around the fold,,you find that if you number the angles in a circle,,all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,,all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.,And if you look at how the layers stack,,you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,,a sheet can never,penetrate a fold.,So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.,All of origami comes from that. 
 And you'd think, "Can four simple laws,give rise to that kind of complexity?",But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics,can be written down on a napkin,,and yet they govern all of chemistry,,all of life, all of history.,If we obey these laws,,we can do amazing things.,So in origami, to obey these laws,,we can take simple patterns --,like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --,and by itself it's nothing.,But if we follow the laws of origami,,we can put these patterns into another fold,that itself might be something very, very simple,,but when we put it together,,we get something a little different.,This fish, 400 scales --,again, it is one uncut square, only folding.,And if you don't want to fold 400 scales,,you can back off and just do a few things,,and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.,Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars,on a flag, with 13 stripes.,And if you want to go really crazy,,1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.,And this guy's on display downstairs,,so take a look if you get a chance. 
 The most powerful tools in origami,have related to how we get parts of creatures.,And I can put it in this simple equation.,We take an idea,,combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure. 
 (Laughter) 
 What matters is what we mean by those symbols.,And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?,I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,,it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?",And yeah, you really can.,So how do we do that? Well, we break it down,into a few smaller steps.,So let me stretch out that equation.,I start with my idea. I abstract it.,What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.,And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape,that has a part for every bit of the subject,,a flap for every leg.,And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,,you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,,you can turn it into the finished shape. 
 Now the first step, pretty easy.,Take an idea, draw a stick figure.,The last step is not so hard, but that middle step --,going from the abstract description to the folded shape --,that's hard.,But that's the place where the mathematical ideas,can get us over the hump.,And I'm going to show you all how to do that,so you can go out of here and fold something.,But we're going to start small.,This base has a lot of flaps in it.,We're going to learn how to make one flap.,How would you make a single flap?,Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,,until it gets long and narrow,,and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.,I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that. 
 What paper went into that flap?,Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,,you can see that the upper left corner of that shape,is the paper that went into the flap.,So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.,I can use it for something else.,Well, there are other ways of making a flap.,There are other dimensions for flaps.,If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.,If I make the flap as skinny as possible,,I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.,And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.,There's other ways of making flaps.,If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.,And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.,So, no matter how I make a flap,,it needs some part,of a circular region of paper.,So now we're ready to scale up.,What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?,What do I need? I need a lot of circles. 
 And in the 1990s,,origami artists discovered these principles,and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures,just by packing circles.,And here's where the dead people start to help us out,,because lots of people have studied,the problem of packing circles.,I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists,looking at disc packings and arrangements.,And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.,So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,,you decorate the patterns of circles with lines,according to more rules. That gives you the folds.,Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base.,You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.,And it's so simple. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's so simple that a computer could do it.,And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?",But computers -- you need to be able to describe things,in very basic terms, and with this, we could.,So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago,called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.,It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you just draw a stick figure,,and it calculates the crease pattern.,It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,,and if you use that stick figure that I just showed --,which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --,you'll get this crease pattern.,And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,,you'll get a base that you can then shape,into a deer,,with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.,And if you want a different deer,,not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,,you change the packing,,and you can do an elk.,Or you could do a moose.,Or, really, any other kind of deer.,These techniques revolutionized this art.,We found we could do insects,,spiders, which are close,,things with legs, things with legs and wings,,things with legs and antennae.,And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square,wasn't interesting enough,,then you could do two praying mantises,from a single uncut square.,She's eating him.,I call it "Snack Time." 
 And you can do more than just insects.,This -- you can put details,,toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.,This tree frog has toes.,Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.,Toes have become an origami meme,,because everyone's doing it.,You can make multiple subjects.,So these are a couple of instrumentalists.,The guitar player from a single square,,the bass player from a single square.,And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass --,that's not so hot.,Do a little more complicated instrument.",Well, then you could do an organ. 
 (Laughter) 
 And what this has allowed is the creation,of origami-on-demand.,So now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,",and you can go out and fold it.,And sometimes you create high art,,and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.,But I want to show you some examples.,Everything you'll see here,,except the car, is origami. 
 (Video) 
 (Applause) 
 Just to show you, this really was folded paper.,Computers made things move,,but these were all real, folded objects that we made.,And we can use this not just for visuals,,but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.,Surprisingly, origami,and the structures that we've developed in origami,turn out to have applications in medicine, in science,,in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more. 
 And I want to show you some of these examples.,One of the earliest was this pattern,,this folded pattern,,studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.,He studied a folding pattern, and realized,this could fold down into an extremely compact package,that had a very simple opening and closing structure.,And he used it to design this solar array.,It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope,in 1995.,Now, there is actually a little origami,in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.,The telescope, going up in space,,it unfolds in two places.,It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --,you wouldn't even call that origami.,They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists. 
 But if you want to go higher and go larger than this,,then you might need some origami.,Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab,had an idea for a telescope much larger.,They called it the Eyeglass.,The design called for geosynchronous orbit,25,000 miles up,,100-meter diameter lens.,So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.,There were two groups of people who were interested in this:,planetary scientists, who want to look up,,and then other people, who wanted to look down.,Whether you look up or look down,,how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.,And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.,How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?,Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.,So you have to do something like this.,This was a small model. 
 Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.,But this pattern's not going to work,to get something 100 meters down to a few meters.,So the Livermore engineers,,wanting to make use of the work of dead people,,or perhaps live origamists, said,,"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.",So they looked into the origami community,,we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.,And we developed a pattern together,that scales to arbitrarily large size,,but that allows any flat ring or disc,to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.,And they adopted that for their first generation,,which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.,But this is a five-meter telescope --,has about a quarter-mile focal length.,And it works perfectly on its test range,,and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle. 
 Now, there is other origami in space.,Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,,and you can see here that the sail expands out,,and you can still see the fold lines.,The problem that's being solved here is,something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,,but needs to be small for the journey.,And that works whether you're going into space,,or whether you're just going into a body.,And this example is the latter.,This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You,at Oxford University.,It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,,but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,,through your blood vessels.,And this stent folds down using an origami pattern,,based on a model called the water bomb base. 
 Airbag designers also have the problem,of getting flat sheets,into a small space.,And they want to do their design by simulation.,So they need to figure out how, in a computer,,to flatten an airbag.,And the algorithms that we developed,to do insects,turned out to be the solution for airbags,to do their simulation.,And so they can do a simulation like this.,Those are the origami creases forming,,and now you can see the airbag inflate,and find out, does it work?,And that leads,to a really interesting idea. 
 You know, where did these things come from?,Well, the heart stent,came from that little blow-up box,that you might have learned in elementary school.,It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.,The airbag-flattening algorithm,came from all the developments,of circle packing and the mathematical theory,that was really developed,just to create insects -- things with legs.,The thing is, that this often happens,in math and science.,When you get math involved, problems that you solve,for aesthetic value only,,or to create something beautiful,,turn around and turn out,to have an application in the real world.,And as weird and surprising as it may sound,,origami may someday even save a life.,Thanks. 
 (Applause)I spent the better part of a decade,looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.,And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment,that to me sums up what there is to know,about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity. 
 And that moment came on April 21, 1994.,So 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide,,in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated,by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.,On April 21, in the New York Times,,the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people,had already been killed in the genocide.,It was in the paper -- not on the front page.,It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage,,it was buried in the paper.,Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy,,and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy. 
 But on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred.,And that was that an American congresswoman,named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado,met with a group of journalists.,And one of the journalists said to her, what's up?,What's going on in the U.S. government?,Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated,in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.,It's two weeks into the genocide at that time,,but of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last.,And the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?,Why no hearings, no denunciations,,no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy,or in front of the White House? What's the deal?,And she said -- she was so honest -- she said, "It's a great question.,All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado,and my office in Washington,,we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls,about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,,but nobody is calling about the people.,The phones just aren't ringing about the people." 
 And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.,And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,,that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements,,we didn't have an endangered people's movement.,We had Holocaust education in the schools.,Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,,but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.,There's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,,right next to Lincoln and Jefferson.,I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,,appropriately, interestingly.,And yet the politicization of Never Again,,the operationalization of Never Again,,had never occurred in the 20th century. 
 And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows:,that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities,,we have to make it such.,There has to be a role --,there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs,in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.,So that was the 20th century. 
 Now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon --,there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,,and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being,an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency,,and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.,It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.,It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters,on college campuses around the country.,It's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.,There are something like 500 high school chapters,devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.,Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.,"Hotel Rwanda" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement. 
 To call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.,It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.,It's got all the ups and the downs of movements.,But it has been amazingly successful in one regard,,in that it has become,,it has congealed into this endangered people's movement,that was missing in the 20th century.,It sees itself, such as it is, the it,,as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,,there will be a political price to be paid,,for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,,for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander. 
 Now because it's student-driven,,there's some amazing things that the movement has done.,They have launched a divestment campaign,that has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states,to divest their holdings of stocks,with regard to companies doing business in Sudan.,They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number --,this is going to sound very kitsch,,but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,,but interested in doing something about genocide,,you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,,and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.,It will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,,to your governor where divestment legislation is pending.,They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.,I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently,are genocide grades.,And it takes students to introduce genocide grades.,So what you now have when a Congress is in session,is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds,and saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide;,what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.,And the students and the others,who are part of this incredibly energized base,are there to answer that, and there's always something to do. 
 Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration,from the United States,,at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic --,a whole series of commitments to Darfur,that no other country in the world is making.,For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur,to the International Criminal Court,,which the Bush administration doesn't like.,The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,,basically, the people who've been displaced from their homes,by the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,,to keep those people alive,until something more durable can be achieved.,And recently, or now not that recently,,about six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force,of 26,000 that will go. 
 And that's all the Bush administration's leadership,,and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure,and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing,from the beginning of this crisis.,The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,,is that evil lives on.,The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides,by so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback,with spears and Kalashnikovs.,Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid,in order to feed their families -- humanitarian aid,,the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible --,are themselves subjected to rape,,which is a tool of the genocide that is being used.,And the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized,,but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization,to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way. 
 So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century,,and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding,as we sit here, as we speak.,Why the limits to the movement?,Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,,been necessary but not sufficient to the crime?,I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons --,but a couple just to focus on briefly. 
 The first is that the movement, such as it is,,stops at America's borders. nIt is not a global movement.,It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves,are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.,And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country,makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,,want to bring Never Again to life.,The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,,that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,,created a space in our society for a consensus,that Rwanda was bad and wrong,and we wish we had done more, and that is something,that the movement has taken advantage of.,European governments, for the most part,,haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of,to push back and up against. 
 So this movement, if it's to be durable and global,,will have to cross borders, and you will have to see,other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption,that their government would do something in the face of genocide,,but actually making it such.,Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude,naturally or eagerly.,As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports,or reigning in loose nukes.,Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself,towards distant suffering?,So one reason is it hasn't gone global. 
 The second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history,,we have a credibility problem,,a legitimacy problem in international institutions.,It is structurally really, really hard to do,,as the Bush administration rightly does,,which is to denounce genocide on a Monday,and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer,and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.,Now, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.,Let me be clear.,They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.,But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,,of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.,The recovery's going to take some time. 
 We have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward,as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places,,the world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers,that could come home to roost sometime in the future?,The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man,that many of you may not have ever heard of,,and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,,as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.,He was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.,It's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003,,even after the U.S. invasion, where,,apart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq. 
 Now, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.,In addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me,before I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between,James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.,And in the U.N., you don't get that many people,who actually manage to merge those qualities.,He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.,He was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,,he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.,He was successful with women.,He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell,if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist,or an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered,about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way. 
 What he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving,,of troubleshooting in the world's worst places,and in the world's most broken places.,In failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,,precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist,on the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places,where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated.,These are the places he was drawn to.,He moved with the headlines.,He was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.,Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s,were wars of independence and decolonization.,He was there in Bangladesh,dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees --,the largest refugee flow in history up to that point.,He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.,He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.,He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.,He was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon -- the U.N. base was used --,Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base.,Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base. 
 Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit,by the first-ever suicide attack against the United States.,People date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983,,with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks --,which Sergio witnessed -- those are, in fact, in some ways,,the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.,From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.,The issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.,He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.,Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room,with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.,He negotiates with the Serbs.,He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil,and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail,that he earns the nickname -- not Sergio but Serbio,while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations. 
 He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide,,and he's the guy who has to decide -- huh, OK, the genocide is over;,800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing,into neighboring countries -- into Congo, into Tanzania.,I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those --,well, I don't want to feed the killers,but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go,,we're going to set up camps,,and we're going to supply humanitarian aid.,But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.,Well, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.,Let me go door-to-door to the international community,and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.,And their response, of course, was no more than we wanted,to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that,,nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps. 
 So then you have to make the decision.,Do you turn off the international spigot of life support,and risk two million civilian lives?,Or do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires,are in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?,What do you do?,It's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places. 
 Late '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour.,He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer,of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.,He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency,,on border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.,He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.,He's been up to that point in 14 war zones,so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps,,than people who have never done that kind of work.,But nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation,with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in,,again, the world's worst places. 
 And then after Timor, 9/11 has happened,,he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,,and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out,,what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations,is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions,,bowing out of international law? Do you denounce?,Well, if you denounce,,you're probably never going to get back in the room.,Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush --,and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself,,unfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq --,the one that resulted in his death. 
 One note on his death, which is so devastating,,is that despite predicating the war on Iraq,on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11,,believe it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders,did no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.,So Sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil,and how to deal with brokenness,,lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.,Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.,Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N. 
 If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.,You're un-owned.,And what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind,was able to muster for his rescue,,believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers,went into the shaft. Building was shaking.,One of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th,,and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.,But all they had was a woman's handbag --,literally one of those basket handbags --,and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters,,and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building,in the interests of rescuing this person,,the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd,,at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance. 
 And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.,The good news, for what it's worth,,is after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.,,the military created a search and rescue unit,that had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes,,the things that you would have needed to do the rescue.,But it was too late for Sergio. 
 I want to wrap up, but I want to close,with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life,on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing,,which is how I would have framed the question.,Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start,thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,,we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away? 
 First, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.,He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.,He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.,I think that was his greatest quality.,He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,,he would charge up to people who were violating international law,,and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.,Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?,And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states,,the power of any military or police.,He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.,And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82,,he said to himself and to everybody else,,I will never use the word "unacceptable" again.,I will never use it. I will try to make it such,,but I will never use that word again.,But he lunged in the opposite direction.,He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,,to not denounce, and became almost obsequious,when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,,and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge,would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room. 
 But by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance,that we as a country can learn from.,Be in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries,,but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.,Don't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.,And I think that's something that we have to be in the room,,whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy,or Reagan and Gorbachev.,All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries,has come by going into the room.,And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.,You can actually do far more to build an international coalition,against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room,and showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,,is the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem. 
 Second take-away from Sergio's life, briefly.,What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,,he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity,that was really, really unusual.,At a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.,He saw them.,At a macro level, he thought, you know,,we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes,that's an affront to people's dignity.,We put people on humanitarian aid,and we boast about it because we've spent three billion.,It's incredibly important,,those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,,hadn't spent that money in Darfur,,but it's not a way to live.,If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens,and as individuals with relation to the people around us,,and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity,into our dealings with other countries,,it would be something of a revolution. 
 Third point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.,And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.,There are so many genuine threats in the world.,But what Sergio was talking about is,,let's calibrate our relationship to the threat.,Let's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.,We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.,We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured,loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.,Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,,but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.,In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say,is, fear is a bad advisor.,We lunge towards the extremes,when we aren't operating and trying to, again,,calibrate our relationship to the world around us. 
 Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working,in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils,,had a humility, of course,,and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.,I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.,How Sisyphean this task was of mending,,and yet aware of that complexity,,humbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.,And we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,,the crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,,I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say,,ah, Katrina, Iraq -- we don't know what we're doing.,We can't afford to pull back from the world.,It's a question of how to be in the world. 
 And the lesson, I think,,of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,,that is a partial success but by no means,has it achieved what it has set out to do --,it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens --,but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.,We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work,of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own,without us creating a space for that to happen,,for having respect for dignity,,and for bringing that combination of humility,and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility,to our dealings with the rest of the world.,So will evil prevail? Is that the question?,I think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)I was here about four years ago,,talking about the relationship of design and happiness.,At the very end of it, I showed a list under that title.,I learned very few things in addition since,(Laughter) --,but made a whole number of them into projects since.,These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland:,"Everybody always thinks they are right.",They were combined in the media.,"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on.",We're doing changing media.,This is a projection that can see the viewer,as the viewer walks by.,You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart.,All of these things are pieces of graphic design.,We do them for our clients.,They are commissioned.,I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment,or pay for all the billboards or the production of these,,so there's always a client attached to them.,These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street,that's lined with fashion stores.,"Worrying solves nothing.","Money does not make me happy",appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine.,The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.,When the magazine -- actually, when I got the subscription --,it was 12 following pages.,It said, "Money does does make me happy.",And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me,that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz,into letting us wrap his building.,So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.,It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street,,it says, "does not make me happy.",We had a show that just came down last week in New York.,We steamed up the windows permanently,,and every hour we had a different designer come in,and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.,Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser,,Massimo Vignelli.,Singapore was quite in discussion.,This is a little spot that we filmed there,that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore.,And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart,,because all of these sentiments --,some banal, some a bit more profound --,all originally had come out of my diary.,And I do go often into the diary,and check if I wanted to change something about the situation.,If it's -- see it for a long enough time,,I actually do something about it.,And the very last one is a billboard.,This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.,This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.,We let that lie around in the sun.,As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.,After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off,,shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot,,so on day one the billboard said,,"Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.",Three days later it faded, and a week later,,no more complaining anywhere.,(Laughter),Thank you so much.,(Applause)You know, culture was born of the imagination,,and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it --,came into being when our species descended,from our progenitor, Homo erectus,,and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it,to every corner of the habitable world.,For a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,,who clearly had some spark of awareness,,but -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,,or the development of language,,or some other evolutionary catalyst --,we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.,By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,,27,000 years ago,,our direct ancestors had already,,and for 5,000 years,,been crawling into the belly of the earth,,where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles,,they had brought into being,the great art of the Upper Paleolithic. 
 And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France,with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse.",And you could look at this art and you could, of course,,see the complex social organization,of the people who brought it into being.,But more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning,,something far more sophisticated than hunting magic.,And the way Clayton put it was this way.,He said, "You know, clearly at some point,,we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't.",And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt,,through ritual, to rekindle a connection,that had been irrevocably lost.,So, he saw this art not as,hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.,And viewed in that light,,it takes on a whole other resonance. 
 And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art,is that as an aesthetic expression,,it lasted for almost 20,000 years.,If these were postcards of nostalgia,,ours was a very long farewell indeed.,And it was also the beginning of our discontent,,because if you wanted to distill all of our experience,since the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:,how and why.,And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.,Now, all people share the same,raw, adaptive imperatives.,We all have children.,We all have to deal with the mystery of death,,the world that waits beyond death,,the elders who fall away into their elderly years.,All of this is part of our common experience,,and this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,,biologists have finally proven it to be true,,something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.,And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.,We are all cut from the same genetic cloth.,All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people,who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago. 
 But the corollary of that is that,,if we all are brothers and sisters,and share the same genetic material,,all human populations share the same raw human genius,,the same intellectual acuity.,And so whether that genius is placed,into -- technological wizardry,has been the great achievement of the West --,or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads,of memory inherent in a myth,,is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.,There is no progression of affairs,in human experience.,There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid,that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex,and descends down the flanks,to the so-called primitives of the world.,All peoples are simply cultural options,,different visions of life itself.,But what do I mean by different visions of life,making for completely different,possibilities for existence? 
 Well, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere,ever brought into being by the imagination,,that of Polynesia.,10,000 square kilometers,,tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.,I recently sailed on the Hokulea,,named after the sacred star of Hawaii,,throughout the South Pacific to make a film,about the navigators.,These are men and women who, even today, can name,250 stars in the night sky.,These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls,of islands beyond the visible horizon,,simply by watching the reverberation of waves,across the hull of their vessel, knowing full well,that every island group in the Pacific,has its unique refractive pattern,that can be read with the same perspicacity,with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.,These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,,can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells,moving through the canoe at any one point in time,,distinguishing local wave disturbances,from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,,that can be followed with the same ease,that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.,Indeed, if you took all of the genius,that allowed us to put a man on the moon,and applied it to an understanding of the ocean,,what you would get is Polynesia. 
 And if we slip from the realm of the sea,into the realm of the spirit of the imagination,,you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.,And I recently made a film called "The Buddhist Science of the Mind.",Why did we use that word, science?,What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?,What is Buddhism but 2,500 years,of empirical observation,as to the nature of mind?,I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,,and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us,here once at TED,,"Western science is a major response to minor needs.",We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100,without losing our teeth.,The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence. 
 Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.,Their billboards are manuals,,prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.,And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage,to a curious destination,,accompanied by a great doctor.,And the destination was a single room in a nunnery,,where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat,55 years before.,And en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,,and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,,the essence of the Buddhist path.,All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.,It means things happen.,The cause of suffering is ignorance.,By that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;,he meant clinging to the illusion,that life is static and predictable.,The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.,And the fourth and most important, of course,,was the delineation of a contemplative practice,that not only had the possibility,of a transformation of the human heart,,but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence,that such a transformation was a certainty. 
 And so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman,who had not been out of that room in 55 years,,you did not see a mad woman.,You saw a woman who was more clear,than a pool of water in a mountain stream.,And of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.,They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe,you went to the moon, but you did.,You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment,in one lifetime, but we do.,And if we move from the realm of the spirit,to the realm of the physical,,to the sacred geography of Peru --,I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people,that literally believe that the Earth is alive,,responsive to all of their aspirations,,all of their needs.,And, of course, the human population,has its own reciprocal obligations. 
 I spent 30 years living amongst,the people of Chinchero,and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.,Once each year, the fastest young boy,in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.,And for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister,and he becomes a transvestite,,a waylaka. And for that day,,he leads all able-bodied men on a run,,but it's not your ordinary run.,You start off at 11,500 feet.,You run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.,You run up to 15,000 feet,,descend 3,000 feet.,Climb again over the course of 24 hours.,And of course, the waylakama spin,,the trajectory of the route,,is marked by holy mounds of Earth,,where coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,,the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.,And the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,,but through exhaustion, through sacrifice,,you emerge as a community that has once again,reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.,And at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,,only one to finish it.,I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day,than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant. 
 But these localized rituals become pan-Andean,,and these fantastic festivals,,like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs,when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.,It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:,60,000 Indians on pilgrimage,to the end of a dirt road,that leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,,which is dominated by three tongues,of the great glacier.,The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,,in this wonderful fusion of Christian,and pre-Columbian ideas.,You place the cross into the ice,,in the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,,or sacred mountains of the Inca.,And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses. 
 Now, these ideas and these events,allow us even to deconstruct iconic places,that many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.,Machu Picchu was never a lost city.,On the contrary, it was completely linked in,to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads,the Inca made in less than a century.,But more importantly, it was linked in,to the Andean notions of sacred geography.,The intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,,is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light,that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,,which is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.,If you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.,Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.,Take a direct north-south bearing,,you find to your astonishment,that it bisects the intiwatana stone,,goes to the skyline,,hits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains,of the Incan empire.,And then beyond Salcantay, of course,,when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,,directly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.,But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?,The sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,,which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,,but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked,at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.,And where does the river rise?,Right on the slopes of the Koariti. 
 So, 500 years after Columbus,,these ancient rhythms of landscape,are played out in ritual.,Now, when I was here at the first TED,,I showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,,the descendants, survivors of El Dorado.,These, of course, are the descendants,of the ancient Tairona civilization.,If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned,that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,,but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.,Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness,for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen,to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.,All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,,as they are taught the values of their society.,Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers,,and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.,Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does,,but the quality of its aspirations. 
 And I always wanted to go back into these mountains,,to see if this could possibly be true,,as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,,Reichel-Dolmatoff.,So, literally two weeks ago,,I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers,on what was clearly the most,extraordinary trip of my life.,These really are a people who live and breathe,the realm of the sacred,,a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.,They consume more coca leaves than any human population,,half a pound per man, per day.,The gourd you see here is --,everything in their lives is symbolic.,Their central metaphor is a loom.,They say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life.",They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient,as "threads.",When they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,,spinning their thoughts into the heavens. 
 You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.,The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.,You put the stick in the powder,to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes,,they're burnt limestone --,to empower the coca leaf, to change,the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption,of cocaine hydrochloride.,But if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,,because every stroke of that stick,that has built up that calcium,,the measure of a man's life,,has a thought behind it.,Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way,,that the one side of the field,is planted like that by the women.,The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,,you turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.,And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,,the greatest goldsmiths of South America,,who in the wake of the conquest,,retreated into this isolated volcanic massif,that soars to 20,000 feet,above the Caribbean coastal plain. 
 There are four societies:,the Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.,I traveled with the Arhuacos,,and the wonderful thing about this story,was that this man, Danilo Villafane --,if we just jump back here for a second.,When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,,I couldn't help but say, "You know,,you look a lot like an old friend of mine.",Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,,from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.,And I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this,,but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,,up and down the mountains.",And because of that, Danilo invited us,to go to the very heart of the world,,a place where no journalist had ever been permitted.,Not simply to the flanks of the mountains,,but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims. 
 And this man sitting cross-legged,is now a grown-up Eugenio,,a man who I've known since 1974.,And this is one of those initiates.,No, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,,but they are kept within the confines,of the ceremonial men's circle,for 18 years.,This little boy will never step outside,of the sacred fields,that surround the men's hut for all that time,,until he begins his journey of initiation.,For that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,,as he is taught the values of society,,including this notion that their prayers alone,maintain the cosmic balance.,Before we could begin our journey,,we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.,And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.,And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet --,there must be nothing between the feet,and the Earth for a mamo.,And this is actually the place where the Great Mother,sent the spindle into the world,that elevated the mountains and created the homeland,that they call the heart of the world. 
 We traveled high into the paramo,,and as we crested the hills,,we realized that the men were interpreting,every single bump on the landscape,in terms of their own intense religiosity.,And then of course, as we reached our final destination,,a place called Mamancana,,we were in for a surprise,,because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.,And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,,hidden away until the darkness.,And then, abandoning all our gear,,we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,,in a quite dramatic scene.,It's going to look like a John Ford Western.,And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.,It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating,is that the minute there was a sense of dangers,,the mamos went into a circle of divination. 
 And of course, this is a photograph,literally taken the night we were in hiding,,as they divine their route,to take us out of the mountains.,We were able to, because we had trained,people in filmmaking,,continue with our work,,and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers,to the final sacred lakes,to get the last shots for the film,,and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,,taking the elements from the highlands to the sea.,And here you see how their sacred landscape,has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,,and yet, still they pray.,And it's an amazing thing to think,that this close to Miami,,two hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people,praying every day for your well-being.,They call themselves the Elder Brothers.,They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world,as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand,why it is that we do what we do to the Earth. 
 Now, if we slip to another end of the world,,I was up in the high Arctic,to tell a story about global warming,,inspired in part by,the former Vice President's wonderful book.,And what struck me so extraordinary,was to be again with the Inuit --,a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.,A people who,find a way, with their imagination,,to carve life out of that very frozen.,A people for whom blood on ice,is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.,And yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,,you find to your astonishment,that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September,and stay till July,,in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland,,it literally comes in now in November,and stays until March.,So, their entire year has been cut in half. 
 Now, I want to stress that none of these peoples,that I've been quickly talking about here,are disappearing worlds.,These are not dying peoples.,On the contrary, you know,,if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,,you discover that the world is not flat.,The world remains a rich tapestry.,It remains a rich topography of the spirit.,These myriad voices of humanity,are not failed attempts at being new,,failed attempts at being modern.,They're unique facets of the human imagination.,They're unique answers to a fundamental question:,what does it mean to be human and alive?,And when asked that question, they respond,with 6,000 different voices.,And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire,for dealing with the challenges that will confront us,in the ensuing millennia. 
 Our industrial society is scarcely,300 years old.,That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone,that we have all of the answers,for all of the questions that will confront us,in the ensuing millennia.,The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.,They are unique answers to that fundamental question:,what does it mean to be human and alive?,And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,,taking with it not only plants and animals,,but the legacy of humanity's brilliance. 
 Right now, as we sit here in this room,,of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,,fully half aren't being taught to children.,So, you're living through a time,when virtually half of humanity's intellectual,,social and spiritual legacy,is being allowed to slip away.,This does not have to happen.,These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern --,quaint and colorful and destined to fade away,as if by natural law. 
 In every case, these are dynamic, living peoples,being driven out of existence by identifiable forces.,That's actually an optimistic observation,,because it suggests that if human beings,are the agents of cultural destruction,,we can also be, and must be,,the facilitators of cultural survival. 
 Thank you very much.I grew up to study the brain,because I have a brothernwho has been diagnosed,with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.,And as a sister and later, as a scientist,,I wanted to understand,nwhy is it that I can take my dreams,,I can connect them to my reality,,and I can make my dreams come true?,What is it about my brother's brainnand his schizophrenia,that he cannot connect his dreamsnto a common and shared reality,,so they instead become delusion? 
 So I dedicated my career to researchninto the severe mental illnesses.,And I moved from my home statenof Indiana to Boston,,where I was working in the labnof Dr. Francine Benes,,in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.,And in the lab,nwe were asking the question,,"What are the biological differences,between the brains of individualsnwho would be diagnosed as normal control,,as compared with the brains of individuals,diagnosed with schizophrenia,nschizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" 
 So we were essentiallynmapping the microcircuitry of the brain:,which cells are communicatingnwith which cells,,with which chemicals,,and then in what quantitiesnof those chemicals?,So there was a lot of meaning in my life,because I was performingnthis type of research during the day,,but then in the eveningsnand on the weekends,,I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,nthe National Alliance on Mental Illness. 
 But on the morning of December 10, 1996,,I woke up to discover that I hadna brain disorder of my own.,A blood vessel explodednin the left half of my brain.,And in the course of four hours,,I watched my brain completely deteriorate,in its ability to process all information.,On the morning of the hemorrhage,,I could not walk, talk, read,nwrite or recall any of my life.,I essentially becamenan infant in a woman's body. 
 If you've ever seen a human brain,,it's obvious that the two hemispheresnare completely separate from one another.,And I have brought for youna real human brain. 
 (Groaning, laughter) 
 So this is a real human brain.,This is the front of the brain,,the back of brainnwith the spinal cord hanging down,,and this is how it would benpositioned inside of my head.,And when you look at the brain,,it's obvious thatnthe two cerebral cortices,are completely separate from one another. 
 For those of you who understand computers,,our right hemisphere functionsnlike a parallel processor,,while our left hemisphere functionsnlike a serial processor.,The two hemispheresndo communicate with one another,through the corpus callosum,,which is made up of somen300 million axonal fibers.,But other than that,,the two hemispheresnare completely separate.,Because they processninformation differently,,each of our hemispheresnthink about different things,,they care about different things,nand, dare I say,,they have very different personalities.,Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. 
 Assistant: It has been. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our right human hemispherenis all about this present moment.,It's all about "right here, right now.",Our right hemisphere,nit thinks in pictures,and it learns kinestheticallynthrough the movement of our bodies.,Information, in the form of energy,nstreams in simultaneously,through all of our sensory systems,and then it explodesninto this enormous collage,of what this present moment looks like,,what this present momentnsmells like and tastes like,,what it feels likenand what it sounds like.,I am an energy-being connectednto the energy all around me,through the consciousnessnof my right hemisphere.,We are energy-beingsnconnected to one another,through the consciousnessnof our right hemispheres,as one human family.,And right here, right now, we are brothersnand sisters on this planet,,here to make the world a better place.,And in this moment we are perfect,nwe are whole and we are beautiful. 
 My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,nis a very different place.,Our left hemispherenthinks linearly and methodically.,Our left hemisphere is all about the pastnand it's all about the future.,Our left hemisphere is designed to take,that enormous collagenof the present moment,and start picking out details,nand more details about those details.,It then categorizes and organizesnall that information,,associates it with everythingnin the past we've ever learned,,and projects into the futurenall of our possibilities.,And our left hemispherenthinks in language.,It's that ongoing brain chatternthat connects me and my internal world,to my external world.,It's that little voice that says to me,,"Hey, you've got to remembernto pick up bananas on your way home.,I need them in the morning.",It's that calculating intelligence,that reminds menwhen I have to do my laundry.,But perhaps most important,nit's that little voice that says to me,,"I am. I am." 
 And as soon as my left hemispherensays to me "I am,",I become separate.,I become a single solid individual,,separate from the energy flow around me,and separate from you.,And this was the portion of my brainnthat I lost on the morning of my stroke. 
 On the morning of the stroke,,I woke up to a poundingnpain behind my left eye.,And it was the kind of caustic painnthat you get when you bite into ice cream.,And it just gripped me --,and then it released me.,And then it just gripped me --,and then it released me.,And it was very unusual for mento ever experience any kind of pain,,so I thought, "OK, I'll just startnmy normal routine." 
 So I got up and I jumpednonto my cardio glider,,which is a full-body,nfull-exercise machine.,And I'm jamming away on this thing,,and I'm realizing that my handsnlook like primitive claws,grasping onto the bar.,And I thought, "That's very peculiar.",And I looked down at my body,and I thought,n"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing.",And it was as though my consciousnessnhad shifted away,from my normal perception of reality,,where I'm the person on the machinenhaving the experience,,to some esoteric space,where I'm witnessing myselfnhaving this experience. 
 And it was all very peculiar,nand my headache was just getting worse.,So I get off the machine,,and I'm walkingnacross my living room floor,,and I realize that everythingninside of my body has slowed way down.,And every step is very rigidnand very deliberate.,There's no fluidity to my pace,,and there's this constrictionnin my area of perception,,so I'm just focused on internal systems.,And I'm standing in my bathroom,getting ready to step into the shower,,and I could actually hearnthe dialogue inside of my body.,I heard a little voice saying, "OK.nYou muscles, you've got to contract.,You muscles, you relax." 
 And then I lost my balance,nand I'm propped up against the wall.,And I look down at my arm,and I realize that I can no longer definenthe boundaries of my body.,I can't define where I beginnand where I end,,because the atomsnand the molecules of my arm,blended with the atomsnand molecules of the wall.,And all I could detectnwas this energy -- energy. 
 And I'm asking myself,n"What is wrong with me?,What is going on?",And in that moment, my left hemispherenbrain chatter went totally silent.,Just like someone took a remote controlnand pushed the mute button.,Total silence.,And at first I was shocked to find myselfninside of a silent mind.,But then I was immediately captivated,by the magnificencenof the energy around me.,And because I could no longernidentify the boundaries of my body,,I felt enormous and expansive.,I felt at one withnall the energy that was,,and it was beautiful there. 
 Then all of a suddennmy left hemisphere comes back online,and it says to me,n"Hey! We've got a problem!,We've got to get some help.",And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" 
 (Laughter) 
 So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem.",But then I immediately driftednright back out into the consciousness --,and I affectionatelynrefer to this space as La La Land.,But it was beautiful there.,Imagine what it would be like to bentotally disconnected,from your brain chatter that connects younto the external world. 
 So here I am in this space,,and my job, and any stressnrelated to my job -- it was gone.,And I felt lighter in my body.,And imagine all of the relationshipsnin the external world,and any stressors relatednto any of those -- they were gone.,And I felt this sense of peacefulness.,And imaginenwhat it would feel like to lose,37 years of emotional baggage!,(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --,euphoria.,It was beautiful. 
 And again, my left hemispherencomes online and it says,,"Hey! You've got to pay attention.,We've got to get help.",And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.nI've got to focus.",So I get out of the showernand I mechanically dress,and I'm walking around my apartment,,and I'm thinking,n"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" 
 And in that moment,,my right arm went totallynparalyzed by my side.,Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!nI'm having a stroke!",And the next thing my brain says to me is,,Wow! This is so cool! 
 (Laughter) 
 This is so cool!,How many brain scientistsnhave the opportunity,to study their own brainnfrom the inside out?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And then it crosses my mind,n"But I'm a very busy woman!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "I don't have time for a stroke!",So I'm like, "OK, I can't stopnthe stroke from happening,,so I'll do this for a week or two,nand then I'll get back to my routine. OK.,So I've got to call help.nI've got to call work.",I couldn't remember the number at work,,so I remembered, in my officenI had a business card with my number.,So I go into my business room, I pullnout a three-inch stack of business cards.,And I'm looking at the card on top,and even though I could see clearlynin my mind's eye,what my business card looked like,,I couldn't tell if thisnwas my card or not,,because all I could see were pixels.,And the pixels of the wordsnblended with the pixels of the background,and the pixels of the symbols,nand I just couldn't tell.,And then I would waitnfor what I call a wave of clarity.,And in that moment, I would be ablento reattach to normal reality,and I could tell that's not the card...nthat's not the card.,It took me 45 minutes to get one inchndown inside of that stack of cards.,In the meantime, for 45 minutes,,the hemorrhage is getting biggernin my left hemisphere.,I do not understand numbers,nI do not understand the telephone,,but it's the only plan I have. 
 So I take the phone padnand I put it right here.,I take the business card,nI put it right here,,and I'm matching the shapenof the squiggles on the card,to the shape of the squigglesnon the phone pad.,But then I would drift back outninto La La Land,,and not remember when I came backnif I'd already dialed those numbers.,So I had to wieldnmy paralyzed arm like a stump,and cover the numbersnas I went along and pushed them,,so that as I would come backnto normal reality,,I'd be able to tell, "Yes,nI've already dialed that number." 
 Eventually, the whole number gets dialednand I'm listening to the phone,,and my colleague picks up the phonenand he says to me,,"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think to myself,,"Oh my gosh, he soundsnlike a Golden Retriever!" 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I say to him --nclear in my mind, I say to him:,"This is Jill! I need help!",And what comes out of my voice is,n"Woo woo woo woo woo.",I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,nI sound like a Golden Retriever.",So I couldn't know -- I didn't know,that I couldn't speak or understandnlanguage until I tried.,So he recognizes that I need helpnand he gets me help. 
 And a little while later,nI am riding in an ambulance,from one hospital across Bostonnto [Massachusetts] General Hospital.,And I curl up into a little fetal ball.,And just like a balloonnwith the last bit of air,,just right out of the balloon,,I just felt my energy liftnand just I felt my spirit surrender. 
 And in that moment, I knew that I wasnno longer the choreographer of my life.,And either the doctors rescue my bodynand give me a second chance at life,,or this was perhapsnmy moment of transition. 
 When I woke later that afternoon,,I was shocked to discovernthat I was still alive.,When I felt my spirit surrender,nI said goodbye to my life.,And my mind was now suspended,between two very oppositenplanes of reality.,Stimulation coming innthrough my sensory systems,felt like pure pain.,Light burned my brain like wildfire,,and sounds were so loud and chaotic,that I could not pick a voice outnfrom the background noise,,and I just wanted to escape.,Because I could not identify the positionnof my body in space,,I felt enormous and expansive,,like a genie just liberatednfrom her bottle.,And my spirit soared free,,like a great whale glidingnthrough the sea of silent euphoria.,Nirvana.,I found Nirvana.,And I remember thinking,,there's no way I would ever be ablento squeeze the enormousness of myself,back inside this tiny little body. 
 But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!,I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.,And if I have found Nirvananand I'm still alive,,then everyone who is alivencan find Nirvana.",And I pictured a world,filled with beautiful, peaceful,ncompassionate, loving people,who knew that they could comento this space at any time.,And that they could purposely choose,to step to the rightnof their left hemispheres --,and find this peace.,And then I realized,what a tremendous giftnthis experience could be,,what a stroke of insight this could bento how we live our lives.,And it motivated me to recover. 
 Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,nthe surgeons went in,,and they removed a blood clotnthe size of a golf ball,that was pushing on my language centers.,Here I am with my mama,,who is a true angel in my life.,It took me eight yearsnto completely recover. 
 So who are we?,We are the life-force powernof the universe,,with manual dexteritynand two cognitive minds.,And we have the powernto choose, moment by moment,,who and how we want to be in the world.,Right here, right now,,I can step into the consciousnessnof my right hemisphere, where we are.,I am the life-force power of the universe.,I am the life-force power,of the 50 trillion beautifulnmolecular geniuses that make up my form,,at one with all that is.,Or, I can choose to step intonthe consciousness of my left hemisphere,,where I becomena single individual, a solid.,Separate from the flow, separate from you.,I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:,intellectual, neuroanatomist.,These are the "we" inside of me.,Which would you choose?,Which do you choose?,And when?,I believe that the more time we spend,choosing to run the deepninner-peace circuitry,of our right hemispheres,,the more peace we will projectninto the world,,and the more peaceful our planet will be.,And I thought that was an ideanworth spreading. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I want to start out with,this beautiful picture from my childhood.,I love the science fiction movies.,Here it is: "This Island Earth.",And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.,Two-and-a-half years in the making.,(Laughter),I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,,but Hollywood goes to the chase.,And in this movie, we see what we think is out there:,flying saucers and aliens.,Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,,and they move about with great speed. Aliens. 
 Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point,where we got tired of turning on the TV,and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,,and tried to write a counter-argument to it,,and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,,for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place,where you could probably get not just life, but complexity,,which requires a huge amount of evolution,,and therefore constancy of conditions.,So, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,,let's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?,If you go back two billion years,,you're not on an Earth-like planet any more.,What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time. 
 Well, "Rare Earth" actually,taught me an awful lot about meeting the public.,Right after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,,and with all great earnestness walked in.,David Brin was going to debate me on this,,and as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.,I had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil.",You cannot take people's aliens away from them,and expect to be anybody's friends.,Well, the second part of that, soon after --,and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,,and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth.",And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,,and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist.",It was, "It burns! It burns!",Because SETI doesn't want to hear this.,SETI wants there to be stuff out there.,I really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.,And I really do think we have to start thinking,about what's a good planet and what isn't. 
 Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that,,even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?,Because this was a slide that was passed,between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC --,and it can't even get the letters right --,(Laughter),-- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?,And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,,and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,,and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?,I mean, there we are. 
 Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.,Mars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there,and to live on its surface if we're protected.,But Venus is a very bad -- the worst -- planet.,Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history,it may very well have harbored Earth-like life,,it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse --,that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface --,because of rampant carbon dioxide. 
 Well, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict,what's going to happen to our particular planet.,We are right now in the beautiful Oreo,of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth --,following the first horrible microbial age.,In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,,complexity arose,,and from what we can tell, we're halfway through.,We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet,as they have been here now,,till we hit the second microbial age.,And that will happen, paradoxically --,everything you hear about global warming --,when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,,we are no longer going to have to have plants,that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.,So, after that we probably have seven billion years.,The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,,and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,,the Earth is consumed by a large Sun,,and this is what's left.,So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,,and we are in its golden summer age right now. 
 But there's two fates to everything, isn't there?,Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age,,but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.,And that's the fate of a planet, too.,Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,,or gets blasted by some supernova nearby,in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.,But what about accidental death?,Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years,have been charting death. It's strange --,extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about,until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.,He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,,and he said, Aha! It's extinct.,And very soon after, the fossil record started yielding,a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been,since complex life really began to leave,a very interesting fossil record.,In that complex record of fossils,,there were times when lots of stuff,seemed to be dying out very quickly,,and the father/mother geologists,called these "mass extinctions." 
 All along it was thought to be either an act of God,or perhaps long, slow climate change,,and that really changed in 1980,,in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,,where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out,what was the time difference between these white rocks,,which held creatures of the Cretaceous period,,and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.,How long did it take to go from one system to the next?,And what they found was something unexpected.,They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,,and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here --,is filled with iridium.,And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,,and it's filled with quartz grains,that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz. 
 Now, in this slide the white is chalk,,and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.,The chalk itself's composed by plankton,which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,,so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,,and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,,and then you have black rock.,And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom,in the absence of plankton.,And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,,because that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.,A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.,The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,,and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,,the death of these beautiful ammonites,,Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,,and so much else. 
 I mean, it must be true,,because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,,and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,,totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.,Prior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:,the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,,there are present-day processes that will explain it.,But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,,so this is a type of neo-catastrophism,,and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment,to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;,and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction. 
 Well, there are five major mass extinctions,over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.,They range from 450 million years ago,to the last, the K-T, number four,,but the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,,sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.,And every one of these has been subsequently blamed,on large-body impact.,But is this true? 
 The most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact,because of this beautiful structure on the right.,This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.,Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes,of my late beloved '60s,,they're called "buckyballs.",This evidence was used to suggest,that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.,And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,,and it captures bits of the comet.,Helium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space. 
 But is this true?,In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,,I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year,in the great Karoo desert.,I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa,into the new South Africa as I went year by year.,And I worked on this Permian extinction,,camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.,And the fossils are extraordinary.,You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.,These are mammal-like reptiles.,They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.,This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.,That's an 18-inch long skull of an animal,that was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,,probably had a head like a lion.,This is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.,But there's lots of stuff.,This is my poor son, Patrick.,(Laughter),This is called paleontological child abuse.,Hold still, you're the scale.,(Laughter) 
 There was big stuff back then.,Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.,The age of mammals had well and truly started,250 million years ago ...,... and then a catastrophe happened.,And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.,It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.,Now, luckily,,this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:,this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture --,there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny --,this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.,You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.,If that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.,Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;,there are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through. 
 Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?,Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.,The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction.,But we've got survivors and things that get through,,and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.,Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.,The survivors that do get through,produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.,There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,,swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.,And there they would hide for 160 million years,,until liberated by that K-T asteroid. 
 So, if not impact, what?,And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,,to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,,and the microbes are still out there.,They hate we animals.,They really want their world back.,And they've tried over and over and over again.,This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions,because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.,This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself --,anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles,believing in the Gaia theory? No. 
 So, I really suspect there's an alternative,,and that life does actually try to do itself in --,not consciously, but just because it does.,And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.,There are microbes which, through their metabolism,,produce hydrogen sulfide,,and they do so in large amounts.,Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.,As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.,You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes --,and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.,It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes,which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,,and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them --,but we can also detect their presence in the past. 
 And the last three years have seen,an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.,I am almost extinct --,I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.,But the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students --,collect biomarkers.,They take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it,,and from that they can produce compounds,which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.,It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment,and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,,and be extracted and tell us who was there. 
 And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian,,at many of these mass extinction boundaries,,this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.,It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,,and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide --,enough, for instance, to come out of solution.,This led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,,to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:,many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,,by high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:,hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans. 
 Well, what's the source of this?,In this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.,This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.,And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;,actually, the effects are even worse.,This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,,spreads out over the surface of the planet.,Well, it's not the lava that kills anything,,it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.,This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.,But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide. 
 So, these are new data Rob Berner and I -- from Yale -- put together,,and what we try to do now is,track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record --,and we can do this from a variety of means --,and put all the red lines here,,when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.,And there's two things that are really evident here to me,,is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.,But the second thing that's not shown on here:,the Earth has never had any ice on it,when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.,We are at 380 and climbing.,We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,,but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.,So, there goes the ice caps,,and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.,I live in a view house now;,I'm going to have waterfront. 
 All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.,And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long,to take place on planet Earth.,We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.,They stop complex life from existing.,We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.,And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago --,and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.,It's been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years.,This is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,,if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,,this is off the Great Barrier Reef.,And as we speak now,,these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us. 
 But the thing about this is that every once in a while,we divers can run into trouble,,so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.,This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.,We pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.,So, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.,I'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?,Well now, I die.,Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:,I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:,80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.,I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower,and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.,And the reason I could do that is because we mammals,have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,,and our bodies have adapted.,And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough. 
 This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.,Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.,He bleeds out pigs.,He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide --,the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions --,and he turns a mammal into a reptile.,"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles,having undergone a series of exposures to H2S.",I got this email from him two years ago;,he said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions.",So, he now has taken mice down,for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,,and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.,On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through --,the dotted line, the temperatures.,So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,,and down it goes, down it goes.,Six hours later, up goes the temperature.,Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide,in this solid graph,,and look what happens to its temperature.,Its temperature drops.,It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,,and comes out of this perfectly fine. 
 Here is a way we can get people to critical care.,Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.,Now, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?,And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.,You're in an accident. You've got two choices:,you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide,and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.,What are you going to do?,Do we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?,This is coming towards us,,and I think this is going to be a revolution.,We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it. 
 The new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit,,and, yes, we have to think about the long term,,because we will get hit again.,But there's a far worse danger confronting us.,We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.,Give us a few millennia --,and we humans should last those few millennia --,will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.,How many of us flew here?,How many of us have gone through,our entire Kyoto quota,just for flying this year?,How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.,We have a huge problem facing us as a species.,We have to beat this.,I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter.,Am I understanding you right, that what you're saying here,is that we have in our own bodies,a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide,that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions,due to climate change? 
 Peter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us,can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.,This is what Roth has found out.,So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?,Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant?,And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect,how many of these have happened in the past. 
 CA: It's simultaneously,an incredible medical technique, but also a terrifying ... 
 PW: Blessing and curse.Roy Gould: Less than a year from now,,the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,,which marks the 400th anniversary,of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.,In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate,the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,,which I think is going to have as profound an impact,on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.,It's called the WorldWide Telescope,,and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.,And I want to urge you, when you get a chance,,to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs. 
 The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images,from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space,,and has woven them seamlessly,to produce a holistic view of the universe.,It's going to change the way we do astronomy,,it's going to change the way we teach astronomy,and I think most importantly,it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe. 
 If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day,,that might not be so big a claim.,In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink;,if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote;,and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night,,what you saw was thought to be the entire universe.,In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then,gave a great debate in which he argued,that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe. 
 Harvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter),Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.,We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe,,all the way back in time,,almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.,We can see across the entire spectrum of light,,revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.,We see these magnificent star nurseries,,where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers,and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.,We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems --,300 now, and still counting --,and they're not like us.,We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy,,in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe,,where time itself seems to stand still.,But until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented,,and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us,have fallen through the cracks. And that's changing. 
 I want to just briefly mention three reasons,why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education,,are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope,and why we think it's truly transformative.,First, it enables you to experience the universe:,the WorldWide Telescope, for me, is a kind of magic carpet,that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.,Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.,And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing,,but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe,,who can share their enthusiasm,and can make the universe a welcoming place.,And third, you can create your own tours --,you can share them with friends, you can create them with friends --,and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about,because I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.,And in telling stories,,each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.,We're going to have a personal universe.,I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge. 
 Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope,,I just want to leave you with this brief thought:,when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?",they often say, "Oh, tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant.",Well, our gaze fills the universe.,And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope,,we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.,I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you,that we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.,Thank you.,(Applause) 
 I can't tell you what a privilege it is,to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause) 
 Curtis Wong: Thank you, Roy.,So, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation,,but it's one of the tours.,And actually this tour is one that was created earlier.,And the tours are all totally interactive,,so that if I were to go somewhere ...,you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way,,pull up other information --,there are lots of Web and information sources,about places you might want to go --,you can zoom in, you can pull back out.,The whole resources are there available for you. 
 So, Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray,,who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did,is really what makes this project possible.,It's a labor of love for us and our small team,,and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.,So basically, kids of all ages, like us. 
 And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.,It'll be a free download -- thank you, Craig Mundie --,and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org,,which is something new.,And so, what you've seen today,is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here,,and in the TED Lab, we have a tour,that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin,that will knock your socks off. (Laughter),So we'll see you there. Thank you.,(Applause)There is nothing biggernor older than the universe.,The questionsnI would like to talk about are:,one, where did we come from?,How did the universe come into being?,Are we alone in the universe?,Is there alien life out there?,What is the future of the human race? 
 Up until the 1920s,,everyone thought the universenwas essentially static,and unchanging in time.,Then it was discoverednthat the universe was expanding.,Distant galaxies were moving away from us.,This meant they must have beenncloser together in the past.,If we extrapolate back,,we find we must havenall been on top of each other,about 15 billion years ago.,This was the Big Bang,nthe beginning of the universe. 
 But was there anythingnbefore the Big Bang?,If not, what created the universe?,Why did the universe emergenfrom the Big Bang the way it did?,We used to thinknthat the theory of the universe,could be divided into two parts.,First, there were the laws,like Maxwell's equationsnand general relativity,that determined the evolutionnof the universe,,given its statenover all of space at one time.,And second, there was no questionnof the initial state of the universe. 
 We have made good progressnon the first part,,and now have the knowledgenof the laws of evolution,in all but the most extreme conditions.,But until recently,nwe have had little idea,about the initial conditionsnfor the universe.,However, this division into lawsnof evolution and initial conditions,depends on time and spacenbeing separate and distinct.,Under extreme conditions,ngeneral relativity and quantum theory,allow time to behavenlike another dimension of space.,This removes the distinctionnbetween time and space,,and means the laws of evolutionncan also determine the initial state.,The universe can spontaneouslyncreate itself out of nothing. 
 Moreover, we can calculatena probability that the universe,was created in different states.,These predictionsnare in excellent agreement,with observations by the WMAP satellitenof the cosmic microwave background,,which is an imprintnof the very early universe.,We think we have solvednthe mystery of creation.,Maybe we should patent the universe,and charge everyone royaltiesnfor their existence. 
 I now turn to the second big question:,are we alone, or is therenother life in the universe?,We believe that life arosenspontaneously on the Earth,,so it must be possible for lifento appear on other suitable planets,,of which there seem to bena large number in the galaxy. 
 But we don't know how life first appeared.,We have two piecesnof observational evidence,on the probability of life appearing.,The first is that we have fossils of algaenfrom 3.5 billion years ago.,The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago,and was probably too hotnfor about the first half billion years.,So life appeared on Earth,within half a billion yearsnof it being possible,,which is short comparednto the 10-billion-year lifetime,of a planet of Earth type.,This suggests that the probabilitynof life appearing is reasonably high.,If it was very low,none would have expected it,to take mostnof the ten billion years available. 
 On the other hand, we don't seemnto have been visited by aliens.,I am discounting the reports of UFOs.,Why would they appearnonly to cranks and weirdos?,If there is a government conspiracynto suppress the reports,and keep for itself the scientificnknowledge the aliens bring,,it seems to have been a singularlynineffective policy so far.,Furthermore, despite an extensive searchnby the SETI project,,we haven't heard any alienntelevision quiz shows.,This probably indicatesnthat there are no alien civilizations,at our stage of development,within a radiusnof a few hundred light years.,Issuing an insurance policy,against abduction by aliensnseems a pretty safe bet. 
 This brings me to the lastnof the big questions:,the future of the human race.,If we are the only intelligentnbeings in the galaxy,,we should make surenwe survive and continue.,But we are entering an increasinglyndangerous period of our history.,Our population and our usenof the finite resources of planet Earth,are growing exponentially,,along with our technical abilitynto change the environment for good or ill.,But our genetic code,still carries the selfishnand aggressive instincts,that were of survivalnadvantage in the past.,It will be difficult enoughnto avoid disaster,in the next hundred years,,let alone the next thousand or million. 
 Our only chance of long-term survival,is not to remain inward-lookingnon planet Earth,,but to spread out into space.,The answers to these big questions,show that we have made remarkable progressnin the last hundred years.,But if we want to continuenbeyond the next hundred years,,our future is in space.,That is why I am in favor of manned --,or should I say, npersonned -- space flight. 
 All of my life I have soughtnto understand the universe,and find answers to these questions.,I have been very lucky,that my disability has not beenna serious handicap.,Indeed, it has probably given menmore time than most people,to pursue the quest for knowledge.,The ultimate goal is a completentheory of the universe,,and we are making good progress.,Thank you for listening. 
 Chris Anderson: Professor,nif you had to guess either way,,do you now believenthat it is more likely than not,that we are alone in the Milky Way,,as a civilization of our levelnof intelligence or higher?,This answer took seven minutes,nand really gave me an insight,into the incredible act of generositynthis whole talk was for TED. 
 Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likelynthat we are the only civilization,within several hundred light years;,otherwise we would have heard radio waves.,The alternative is that civilizationsndon't last very long,,but destroy themselves. 
 CA: Professor Hawking,nthank you for that answer.,We will take itnas a salutary warning, I think,,for the rest of our conference this week.,Professor, we really thank younfor the extraordinary effort you made,to share your questions with us today.,Thank you very much indeed. 
 (Applause)You know, I've talked about some of these projects before --,about the human genome and what that might mean,,and discovering new sets of genes.,We're actually starting at a new point:,we've been digitizing biology,,and now we're trying to go from that digital code,into a new phase of biology,with designing and synthesizing life. 
 So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.,"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists,have been trying to understand,at various levels.,We've tried various approaches,,paring it down to minimal components.,We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;,when we sequenced the human genome,,it was going from the analog world of biology,into the digital world of the computer.,Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life,or can we create new life,out of this digital universe?" 
 This is the map of a small organism,,Mycoplasma genitalium,,that has the smallest genome for a species,that can self-replicate in the laboratory,,and we've been trying to just see if,we can come up with an even smaller genome.,We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes,out of the 500 or so that are here.,When we look at its metabolic map,,it's relatively simple,compared to ours --,trust me, this is simple --,but when we look at all the genes,that we can knock out one at a time,,it's very unlikely that this would yield,a living cell.,So we decided the only way forward,was to actually synthesize this chromosome,so we could vary the components,to ask some of these most fundamental questions.,And so we started down the road of:,can we synthesize a chromosome?,Can chemistry permit making,these really large molecules,where we've never been before?,And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?,A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.,So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing,at an exponential pace. 
 Our ability to write the genetic code,has been moving pretty slowly,but has been increasing,,and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.,We started this over 15 years ago.,It took several stages, in fact,,starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.,But it turns out synthesizing DNA,is very difficult.,There are tens of thousands of machines around the world,that make small pieces of DNA --,30 to 50 letters in length --,and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,,the more errors there are.,So we had to create a new method,for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors. 
 And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information,of the genome of phi X174.,It's a small virus that kills bacteria.,We designed the pieces, went through our error correction,and had a DNA molecule,of about 5,000 letters.,The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical,and put it in the bacteria,,and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,,made the viral particles.,The viral particles then were released from the cells,and came back and killed the E. coli.,I was talking to the oil industry recently,and I said they clearly understood that model. 
 (Laughter) 
 They laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter) 
 And so, we think this is a situation,where the software can actually build its own hardware,in a biological system.,But we wanted to go much larger:,we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --,it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --,so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses,so we could actually vary the cassettes,to understand,what the actual components of a living cell are.,Design is critical,,and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,,that digital information has to be really accurate.,When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,,the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.,We actually found, on resequencing it,,30 errors; had we used that original sequence,,it never would have been able to be booted up.,Part of the design is designing pieces,that are 50 letters long,that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces,to build smaller subunits,we have to design so they can go together.,We design unique elements into this. 
 You may have read that we put watermarks in.,Think of this:,we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.,Triplets of those letters,code for roughly 20 amino acids,,such that there's a single letter designation,for each of the amino acids.,So we can use the genetic code to write out words,,sentences, thoughts.,Initially, all we did was autograph it.,Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.,We designed these pieces so,we can just chew back with enzymes;,there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.,And we started making pieces,,starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,,put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,,then put sets of those going up to 72,000. 
 At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance,so we could sequence them,because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust,that you can see in a minute.,We're trying to get to the point of automation.,So, this looks like a basketball playoff.,When we get into these really large pieces,over 100,000 base pairs,,they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli --,it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology --,and so we turned to other mechanisms.,We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination,that biology uses to repair DNA,that can put pieces together.,Here's an example of it:,there's an organism called,Deinococcus radiodurans,that can take three millions rads of radiation. 
 You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.,Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it,back together exactly as it was before.,We have thousands of organisms that can do this.,These organisms can be totally desiccated;,they can live in a vacuum.,I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,,move around, find a new aqueous environment.,In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there. 
 Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built,using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms,with the right design of the pieces we put them in;,yeast puts them together automatically.,This is not an electron micrograph;,this is just a regular photomicrograph.,It's such a large molecule,we can see it with a light microscope.,These are pictures over about a six-second period. 
 So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.,This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;,it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.,It's over 300 million molecular weight.,If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,,it takes 142 pages,just to print this genetic code.,Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?,Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;,it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.,It's also simpler when you go,into eukaryotes like ourselves:,you can just pop out the nucleus,and pop in another one,,and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.,With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,,but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant,of a chromosome from one cell to another,and activate it.,We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --,roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice --,we added a few extra genes,so we could select for this chromosome,,we digested it with enzymes,to kill all the proteins,,and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell --,and you'll appreciate,our very sophisticated graphics here.,The new chromosome went into the cell.,In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,,but we tried to design the process a little bit further. 
 This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.,We find all kinds of species,that have taken up a second chromosome,or a third one from somewhere,,adding thousands of new traits,in a second to that species.,So, people who think of evolution,as just one gene changing at a time,have missed much of biology. 
 There are enzymes called restriction enzymes,that actually digest DNA.,The chromosome that was in the cell,doesn't have one;,the chromosome we put in does.,It got expressed and it recognized,the other chromosome as foreign material,,chewed it up, and so we ended up,just with a cell with the new chromosome.,It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.,And with a very short period of time,,all the characteristics of one species were lost,and it converted totally into the new species,based on the new software that we put in the cell.,All the proteins changed,,the membranes changed;,when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in. 
 So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,,but we can, by moving the software of DNA around,,change things quite dramatically.,Now I've argued, this is not genesis;,this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.,And I've argued that we're about to perhaps,create a new version of the Cambrian explosion,,where there's massive new speciation,based on this digital design. 
 Why do this?,I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.,We're about to go from six and a half,to nine billion people over the next 40 years.,To put it in context for myself:,I was born in 1946.,There are now three people on the planet,for every one of us that existed in 1946;,within 40 years, there'll be four.,We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,,medicines, fuel,for the six and a half billion.,It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.,We use over five billion tons of coal,,30 billion-plus barrels of oil --,that's a hundred million barrels a day.,When we try to think of biological processes,or any process to replace that,,it's going to be a huge challenge.,Then of course, there's all that,CO2 from this material,that ends up in the atmosphere. 
 We now, from our discovery around the world,,have a database with about 20 million genes,,and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.,The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,,and look at the diversity that came out of that.,We're limited here primarily,by a biological reality,and our imagination.,We now have techniques,,because of these rapid methods of synthesis,,to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.,We have the ability now to build a large robot,that can make a million chromosomes a day.,When you think of processing these 20 million different genes,or trying to optimize processes,to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,,new vaccines,,we can just with a small team,,do more molecular biology,than the last 20 years of all science.,And it's just standard selection:,we can select for viability,,chemical or fuel production,,vaccine production, etc. 
 This is a screen snapshot,of some true design software,that we're working on to actually be able to sit down,and design species in the computer.,You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like:,we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.,We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.,You've seen recently, corn to ethanol,is just a bad experiment.,We have second- and third-generation fuels,that will be coming out relatively soon,that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels,like octane or different types of butanol. 
 But the only way we think that biology,can have a major impact without,further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability,is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,,and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.,And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels,in about 18 months.,Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...,(Applause),but in our discovery around the world,,we have all kinds of other methods. 
 This is an organism we described in 1996.,It lives in the deep ocean,,about a mile and a half deep,,almost at boiling-water temperatures.,It takes CO2 to methane,using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.,We're looking to see if we can take,captured CO2,,which can easily be piped to sites,,convert that CO2 back into fuel,to drive this process. 
 So, in a short period of time,,we think that we might be able to increase,what the basic question is of "What is life?",We truly, you know,,have modest goals,of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry -- 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? -- 
 (Laughter) 
 become a major source of energy ...,But also, we're now working on using these same tools,to come up with instant sets of vaccines.,You've seen this year with flu;,we're always a year behind and a dollar short,when it comes to the right vaccine.,I think that can be changed,by building combinatorial vaccines in advance.,Here's what the future may begin to look like,with changing, now, the evolutionary tree,,speeding up evolution,with synthetic bacteria, Archaea,and, eventually, eukaryotes.,We're a ways away from improving people:,our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance,to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.,I cannot believe I'm here.,I have not slept in weeks.,Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept,in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous --,and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter),So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization,called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk,about how we all might join in and do similar things. 
 Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,,I was trying to finish my first book,,I was wandering around dazed every day,because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.,So I would walk around in a daze during the day.,I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.,In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,,there are a lot of writers --,it's like a very high per capita ratio,of writers to normal people.,Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.,My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher,and after college so many of my friends went into teaching.,And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives,and how inspiring they were,,and they were really sort of the most hard-working,and constantly inspiring people I knew. 
 But I knew so many of the things they were up against,,so many of the struggles they were dealing with.,And one of them was that so many of my friends,that were teaching in city schools were having trouble,with their students keeping up at grade level,,in their reading and writing in particular.,Now, so many of these students had come from households,where English isn't spoken in the home,,where a lot of them have different special needs,,learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools,which sometimes and very often are under-funded.,And so they would talk to me about this and say,,"You know, what we really need is just more people,,more bodies, more one-on-one attention,,more hours, more expertise from people,that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one." 
 Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?",And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.,This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.,How can we possibly give each student,even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?",You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.,And so we started talking about this.,And at the same time,,I thought about this massive group of people I knew:,writers, editors, journalists, graduate students,,assistant professors, you name it.,All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours,and an interest in the English word --,I hope to have an interest in the English language,,but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter),I'm trying. That clock has got me.,But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word,in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.,And so they had, you know, their time,and their interest, but at the same time,there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community,to bring these two communities together. 
 So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.,And the idea was to put McSweeney's --,McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,,and a few other magazines --,we were going to move it into an office for the first time.,It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.,We were going to move it into an office,,and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.,So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody --,sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway,,why don't we just open up,the front of the building for students to come in there after school,,get extra help on their written homework,,so you have basically no border between these two communities?",So the idea was that we would be,working on whatever we're working on,,at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,,or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.,You give those hours in the afternoon,to the students in the neighborhood. 
 So, we had this place, we rented it,,the landlord was all for it. We did this mural,,that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history,of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time,to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.,So we rented this space.,And everything was great except the landlord said,,"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.,You've gotta sell something.,You can't just have a tutoring center.",So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!",And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,,but we did all the necessary research.,It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,,acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.,We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,,whitewashed beams and it had the look --,while we were renovating this place, somebody said,,"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship.",And we looked around and somebody else said,,"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter) 
 And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,,and we said, "There's a point to that.,Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.,You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.,A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,,we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.,Here you see planks sold by the foot,and we have supplies to combat scurvy.,We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.,Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display,,which is the black column there for everyday use,for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel,and other colors for stepping out at night --,special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever. 
 So we opened this place. And this is a vat,that we fill with treasures that students dig in.,This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.,These are some signs that we have all over the place:,"Practical Joking with Pirates.",While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter,and eight mop heads drop on your head.,That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.,It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,,which is just a saltwater tank with three seats,,and then right behind it we set up this space,,which was the tutoring center.,So right there is the tutoring center,,and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,,where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that. 
 The kids would come in --,or we thought they would come in. I should back up.,We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months,renovating this place.,We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.,I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto,and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.,Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.,It was started with about 12 of my friends,,people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.,And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk,and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related,and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free.",And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,,they're gonna love it." And they didn't.,And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.,And everybody was becoming very discouraged,because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in. 
 And then somebody alerted us to the fact,that maybe there was a trust gap,,because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter),We never put it together, you know?,And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,,a longtime San Francisco educator --,she was teaching in Mexico City,,she had all the experience necessary,,knew everything about education,,was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood --,I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.,She took over as executive director.,Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachers,and the parents and the students and everything,,and so suddenly it was actually full every day. 
 And what we were trying to offer every day,was one-on-one attention.,The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.,You know, it's been proven,that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,,a student can get one grade level higher.,And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.,They come there, many times their parents --,you can't see it, but there's a church pew,that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there --,the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.,So that was the basis of it,,was one-on-one attention.,And we found ourselves full every day with kids.,If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,,2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,,by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space, 
 which is very strange, because it's school, in a way.,But there was something psychological happening there,that was just a little bit different.,And the other thing was, there was no stigma.,Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,",or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.,First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.,And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.,And so our interns were actually working,at the same tables very often,,and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students. 
 And so it became a tutoring center --,publishing center, is what we called it --,and a writing center.,They go in, and they might be working with a high school student,actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.,So there's no stigma.,They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.,They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.,These adults, they're working in their field.,They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults,and it all sort of feeds on each other.,There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,,especially for the adults working at McSweeney's,who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,,was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter),With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem. 
 But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework,in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention --,they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.,They don't do their homework in front of the TV.,They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,,enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.,And that makes a happy family.,A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.,A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.,So the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause),There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention. 
 So we started off with about 12 volunteers,,and then we had about 50,,and then a couple hundred.,And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.,And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.,The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,,those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,,next to one student, concentrated attention,,shining this beam of light on their work,,on their thoughts and their self-expression,,is going to be absolutely transformative,,because so many of the students have not had that ever before.,So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,,it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough.",So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast. 
 Then we said, "Well, what are we,going to do with the space during the day,,because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?",So we started bringing in classes during the day.,So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book --,you can see it being typed up above.,This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.,You just point a camera at a class,,and it always looks like this.,So this is one of the books that they do.,Notice the title of the book,,"The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic.",And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy,that was about the Titanic.",So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,,taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind. 
 So then we still had more tutors to use.,This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.,The teachers that we work with --,and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.,We went in there thinking,,"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.,The neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.,The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful." 
 So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?,Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you,,necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,,or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,,"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.,Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say,,"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.,We're working on our college essays. Send them in.",So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.,Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.,The teacher tells them what to do,,how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.,They work under the teacher's guide,,and it's all in one big room.,And that's actually the brunt of what we do is,,people going straight from their workplace, straight from home,,straight into the classroom and,working directly with the students.,So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.,Then another school said, "Well, what if we,just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?" 
 So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room,,where we decorated it in buccaneer style.,It's right off the library. And there we serve,all 529 kids in this middle school.,This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,",that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom,in both languages -- English and Spanish.,So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,,"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?,I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world.",And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,,which is a school that we had worked with on some other things,,and we gave that assignment to the students.,And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.,She's going to publish them in a book.,She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.,It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area,and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it.",So these kids worked harder,than they've ever worked on anything in their lives,,because there was that outside audience,,there was Isabel Allende on the other end.,I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them,and so this worked out incredibly well.,We had a big party at the end.,This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.,You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,,"I Might Get Somewhere.",And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books. 
 Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.,The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life,if they know it's going to be permanent,,know it's going to be on a shelf,,know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said,,that we've honored their words, honored their thoughts,with hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts --,all this attention that we give to their thoughts.,And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,,they can never go back.,It's absolutely transformative.,And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.,We sell all the student books.,Where else would you put them, right?,So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening,with the stores. The store, actually --,even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.,So it was paying the rent.,And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing --,I don't know, I don't want to judge.,But people would come in --,and this was before the pirate movies and everything!,It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,,but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.,There's the ocean maps you can see on the left. 
 And it became a gateway to the community.,People would come in and say, "What the --?,What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter),Is that a rule? I don't know.,They would say, "What is this?",And people would come in and learn more about it.,And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there --,right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.,This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,,and they might be more likely to buy some lard,,or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,,or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.,So the store actually did really well.,But it brought in so many people --,teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody --,because it was street level. It was open to the public.,It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor,of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood,that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.,So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident. 
 So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,,"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?",And a lot of them had been former educators,or would-be educators, so they combined,with a lot of local designers, local writers,,and they just took the idea independently,and they did their own thing.,They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.,They didn't think that that was going to work there.,So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,,they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.,This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.,And this was to make it look sort of like one of those,keysmith's shops that has to have every service,they've ever offered, you know, all over there.,So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco,for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.,These are all handmade.,These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.,All the packaging is done by Sam Potts. 
 So then you have the villain containment unit,,where kids put their parents. You have the office.,This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there,,it goes up an electric lift,and then the guy behind the counter tells you,that you have to recite the vow of heroism,,which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.,Personally, I think it's a problem.,Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.,These are some of the products. These are all handmade.,This is a secret identity kit.,If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,,one American female marketing executive,from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier,on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.,So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,,and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps,and then we turn on three hydraulic fans,from every side and then you can see the cape in action.,There's nothing worse than, you know,,getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.,So then, the secret door --,this is one of the shelves you don't see,when you walk in, but it slowly opens.,You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.,It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause),So you can see the full effect! 
 But this is -- I just want to emphasize --,locally funded, locally built.,All the designers, all of the builders,,everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.,I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,",or whatever. That was it. You can see the time,in all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause),So this is the space during tutoring hours.,It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,,complete devotion to the students' work,and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility,of creativity and ideas.,And this switch is flicked in their heads,when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?,So it's school, but it's not school.,It's clearly not school, even though,they're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever. 
 This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.,You can read this quote.,Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.,Came in. Got this concentrated attention.,And he couldn't escape it.,So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early --,got really addicted to finishing his homework early.,It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,,and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve,the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.,So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.,He's now been published in five books.,He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes,called "Super-Has-Beens.",He wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,",which is a fighting -- a boxing -- penguin.,And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,,at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.,He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.,There's four family members that come in every day. 
 So, I'll go through really quickly.,This is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:,"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter),This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.,So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.,Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:,"Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday." (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.,These are spaces that are only affiliated with us,,doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;,Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,,which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;,Austin Bat Cave in Austin;,Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,,this will be open in April.,Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay? 
 All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish:,I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual,and organization you know -- will find a way,to directly engage with a public school in your area,and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,,so that within a year we have a thousand examples --,a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships.,Profound leaps forward!,And these can be things that maybe you're already doing.,I know that so many people in this room,are already doing really interesting things.,I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website. 
 We created a website.,I'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:,We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in,a new era of participation in our public schools.,We hope that you will take the lead,in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise,with that of innovative educators in your community.,Always let the teachers lead the way.,They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.,There are a million ways.,You can walk up to your local school,and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.,So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,,they did this phenomenal job.,This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,,a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,",which is a great title, I think.,This site will document every story, every project that comes,out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,,you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by,and then you add your own projects once you get started.,Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.,If you have any questions, you can ask this guy,,who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.,You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.,And he'll get you inspired and get you going,and guide you through the process so that you can affect change. 
 And it can be fun! That's the point of this talk --,it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.,You can do and use the skills that you have.,The schools need you. The teachers need you.,Students and parents need you. They need your actual person:,your physical personhood and your open minds,and open ears and boundless compassion,,sitting next to them, listening and nodding,and asking questions for hours at a time.,Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:,how smart and how much they have to say.,You can tell them. You can shine that light on them,,one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.,Thank you so much.So, as researchers, somethingnthat we often do is use immense resources,to achieve certain capabilities,nor achieve certain goals.,And this is essentialnto the progress of science,,or exploration of what is possible.,But it creates this unfortunate situation,where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world,can actually participatenin this exploration,or can benefit from that technology.,Something that motivates me,,and gets me really excitednabout my research,,is when I see simple opportunities,to drastically change that distributionnand make the technology accessible,to a much wider percentagenof the population. 
 I'm going to show you two videosnthat have gotten a lot of attention,that I think embody this philosophy.,And they actually usenthe Nintendo Wii Remote.,For those of you who aren'tnfamiliar with this device,,it's a $40 video game controller.,And it's mostly advertisednfor its motion-sensing capabilities:,so you can swing a tennis racket,nor hit a baseball bat.,But what actually interests me a lot more,is the fact that in the tipnof each controller,is a relatively high-performingninfrared camera.,And I'm going to show yountwo demos of why this is useful. 
 So here, I have my computernset up with the projector,,and I have a Wii Remotensitting on top of it.,And, for example, if you're in a schoolnthat doesn't have a lot money,,probably a lot of schools,,or if you're in an office environment,nand you want an interactive whiteboard,,normally these costnabout two to three thousand dollars.,So I'm going to show younhow to create one with a Wii Remote.,Now, this requiresnanother piece of hardware,,which is this infrared pen.,You can probably makenthis yourself for about five dollars,with a quick trip to the Radio Shack.,It's got a battery,na button and an infrared LED --,you guys can't see it --,but it turns onnwhenever I push the button.,Now, what this means isnthat if I run this piece of software,,the camera sees the infrared dot,,and I can register the locationnof the camera pixels,to the projector pixels.,And now this is likenan interactive whiteboard surface. 
 (Applause) 
 So for about $50 of hardware,nyou can have your own whiteboard.,This is Adobe Photoshop. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Laughter) 
 The software for thisnI've actually put on my website,and have let people download it for free.,In the three monthsnthis project has been public,,it's been downloadednover half a million times.,So teachers and studentsnall around the world,are already using this. 
 (Applause) 
 Although it does do it for 50 dollars,,there are some limitationsnof this approach.,You get about 80 percent of the way there,nfor one percent of the cost.,Another nice thing is that a camerancan see multiple dots,,so this is actually a multi-touch,ninteractive whiteboard system as well. 
 (Applause) 
 For the second demo,,I have this Wii Remotenthat's actually next to the TV.,So it's pointing away from the display,nrather than pointing at the display.,And why this is interesting,is that if you put on, say,na pair of safety glasses,,that have two infrared dots in them,,they are going to give the computernan approximation of your head location.,And why this is interesting,is I have this sort of applicationnrunning on the computer monitor,,which has a 3D room,nwith some targets floating in it.,And you can see that itnlooks like a 3D room.,kind of like a video game,nit sort of looks 3D,,but for the most part,nthe image looks pretty flat,,and bound to the surface of the screen.,But if we turn on head tracking --,the computer can changenthe image that's on the screen,and make it respond to the head movements.,So let's switch back to that. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So this has actuallynbeen a little bit startling,to the game-development community. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because this is about 10 dollarsnof additional hardware,if you already have a Nintendo Wii.,So I'm looking forwardnto seeing some games,,and actually Louis Castle,nthat's him down there,,last week announced that Electronic Arts,none of the largest game publishers,,is releasing a game in Maynthat has a little Easter egg feature,for supporting this type of head tracking.,And that's from less than five months,from a prototype in my labnto a major commercial product. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 But actually, to me,nwhat's almost more interesting,than either of these two projects,is how people actuallynfound out about them.,YouTube has really changed the way,nor changed the speed,,in which a single individual,can actually spreadnan idea around the world.,I'm doing some researchnin my lab with a video camera,,and within the first week,na million people had seen this work,,and literally within days,nengineers, teachers and students,from around the world were alreadynposting their own YouTube videos,of them using my systemnor derivatives of this work.,So I hope to see morenof that in the future,,and hope online video distributionnto be embraced by the research community. 
 So thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be,in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.,And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. 
 And I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life,the last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion.,After I left my convent, I'd finished with religion, frankly.,I thought that was it.,And for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor.,And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly.,But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes,,one after the other, and finally found myself in television. (Laughter),I said that to Bill Moyers, and he said, "Oh, we take anybody." (Laughter) 
 And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs.,This went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular.,And so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream.,But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity.,And there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions:,Judaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity.,And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all --,despite my own intensely religious background,,I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity,,and I knew nothing about Islam at all. 
 But in that city, that tortured city,,where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together,,you also become aware of the profound connection between them.,And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back,to a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me,to look at my own faith in a different light. 
 And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study,that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion,,I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.,These doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.,And to my astonishment, when I began seriously studying other traditions,,I began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today --,is only a very recent religious enthusiasm,that surfaced only in the West, in about the 17th century.,The word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.,In the 17th century, it narrowed its focus,,for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment,,to include -- to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.,"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith.",It meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself.",Indeed, some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy.,In the Quran, religious opinion -- religious orthodoxy -- is dismissed as "zanna:",self-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other,,but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. (Laughter) 
 So if religion is not about believing things, what is it about?,What I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.,Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something.,You behave in a committed way,,and then you begin to understand the truths of religion.,And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action;,you only understand them when you put them into practice. 
 Now, pride of place in this practice is given to compassion.,And it is an arresting fact that right across the board,,in every single one of the major world faiths, compassion --,the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening --,is not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us,into the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine.",It is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana.,Why? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other,,we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put,another person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine. 
 And in particular, every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said --,and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule.,First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ:,"Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you.",That, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching,and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.,And it was -- the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren,",human-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself. 
 And this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms, too.,There's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus.,A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could,recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg.,Hillel stood on one leg and said, "That which is hateful to you,,do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary.,Go and study it." (Laughter) 
 And "go and study it" was what he meant.,He said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear,that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule.",The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which,led to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people --,any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate. 
 Saint Augustine made exactly the same point.,Scripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave,an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it.",And this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts,is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life. (Applause) 
 But now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is --,where religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.,Where instead of taking Jesus' words, "Love your enemies.,Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people,,endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people,,putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others,,and this is because of human ego, human greed.,We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things. 
 So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point, I think --,that you could not and must not confine your compassion,to your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists,,your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai":,concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.,We formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another. 
 And this, again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion --,abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains.,Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who,,when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion,has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.,The causes of our present woes are political. 
 But, make no mistake about it, religion is a kind of fault line,,and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region, religion can get sucked in,and become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent.,Between 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict.,And so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime,,now causes riots where people even die.,And it's not surprising that religion, too, has been affected by this violent ethos. 
 There's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around.,People seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things.,As though that -- we call religious people often believers,,as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals,get pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule.,Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes -- when I'm speaking to,congregations about compassion, I sometimes see,a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because,a lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter) 
 Now -- but that's not the whole story.,Since September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me,into public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world,,and finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change.,I've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures,,because they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice.,And especially the young people were coming. And were asking me --,the young people were saying, "What can we do? What can we do to change things?",And my hosts in Pakistan said, "Look, don't be too polite to us.,Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing." 
 Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious,at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding,and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.,And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States,,people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown --,but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism,,which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned. 
 But people want to be religious, and religion should be made,to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be --,because of the Golden Rule.,"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you":,an ethos that should now be applied globally.,We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves. 
 And these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter, it's a spiritual matter.,It's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all.,And as I say, there is a hunger for change out there.,Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.,And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th,,coming together locally to create networks of understanding.,With the mosque, with the synagogue, saying, "We must start to speak to one another.",I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other. 
 I'd -- there's one story I'd just like to mention.,This comes from "The Iliad." But it tells you what this spirituality should be.,You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.,In one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war,,and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle,,his beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed -- and killed in single combat,by one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge,,and he mutilates the body. He kills Hector, he mutilates his body,and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family,,which means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost.,And then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man,,comes into the Greek camp incognito, makes his way to Achilles' tent,to ask for the body of his son.,And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.,And Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep.,And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons,,and he, too, starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house.,The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.,And then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father,,and the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine. 
 That is the ethos found, too, in all the religions.,It's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies,,and beginning to appreciate the other.,It's of great importance that the word for "holy" in Hebrew, applied to God, is "Kadosh": separate, other.,And it is often, perhaps, the very otherness of our enemies which can,give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God. 
 And now, here's my wish:,I wish that you would help with the creation,,launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion,,crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from,the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,,and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule.,We need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels --,you probably meet, too -- who want to join up, in some way,,and reclaim their faith, which they feel, as I say, has been hijacked.,We need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos,,and to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document.,I'd like to see it -- to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures,,these texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine,said about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity.,Let's get back to that. And the idea, too, of Jews, Christians and Muslims --,these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to,create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least,,of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world. 
 And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar.,Despite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me,-- I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very --,you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody,,everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks,,and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example,,is very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City.,Also, I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations.,I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations,,which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism,,and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism. 
 And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.,The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried,,because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body --,but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality,,so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming,,as it were, from the United Nations, from the world --,who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this. 
 And so I do urge you to join me in making -- in this charter --,to building this charter, launching it and propagating it so that it becomes --,I'd like to see it in every college, every church, every mosque, every synagogue in the world,,so that people can look at their tradition, reclaim it, and make religion a source of peace in the world,,which it can and should be. Thank you very much. (Applause)It was an incredible surprise to me,to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.,Because, basically,,I work as a theoretical physicist.,I develop and test models of the Big Bang,,using observational data.,And I've been moonlighting for the last five years,helping with a project in Africa.,And, I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge.,People wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on.,And so it was simply astonishing to me,to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides. 
 So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself,and why I lead this schizophrenic life.,Well, I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned,for resisting the racist regime.,When they were released, we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania.,Both were very young countries then,,and full of hope for the future. 
 We had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money,,but we were outdoors most of the time.,We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world,,like Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge.,Well, then we moved to London for high school.,And after that -- there's nothing much to say about that.,It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa,at the age of 17, as a volunteer teacher,to Lesotho, which is a tiny country,,surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa. 
 Well, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho,worked in the mines over the border,,in brutal conditions.,Nevertheless, I -- as I'm sure -- as a rather irritating young, white man,coming into their village, I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth.,But the kids were the best part.,The kids were amazing: extremely eager and often very bright.,And I'm just going to tell you one story,,which got through to me. 
 I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible,,to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.,And they weren't used to that.,But I took them outside one day and I said,,"I want you to estimate the height of the building.",And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall,,size it up with a finger, and make an estimate of the height.,But there was one little boy, very small for his age.,He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.,And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement.,And so, I said -- I was annoyed -- I said, "What are you doing?,I want you to estimate the height of the building.",He said, "OK. I measured the height of a brick.,I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying.",Well -- (Laughter) -- I hadn't thought of that one. 
 And many experiences like this happened to me.,Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.,Sitting next to him one day, he said, "There's only one thing that I really loved at school.,And you know what it was? Shakespeare." And he recited some to me.,And these and many similar experiences convinced me,that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa,-- inventive kids, intellectual kids --,and starved of opportunity.,And if Africa is going to get fixed, it's by them, not by us.,Well, after -- (Applause) -- that's the truth. 
 Well, after Lesotho, I traveled across Africa,before returning to England,-- so gray and depressing, in comparison.,And I went to Cambridge. And there, I fell for theoretical physics.,Well, I'm not going to explain this equation,,but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.,We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.,And, admittedly, it's in a very shorthand notation.,And it contains 18 free parameters,,OK, which we have to fit to the data. 
 So it's not the final story,,but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know,about nature at the most basic level.,And apart from a few very important loose ends, which you've heard about here --,like dark energy and dark matter --,this equation describes,,seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it. 
 But there's one big puzzle remaining,,and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in,Tanzania, who's a wonderful Scottish lady,who I still stay in touch with.,And she's now in her 80s.,And when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said,,"Neil, there's only one question that really matters.,What banged?" (Laughter),"Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?" 
 And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding.,The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence,,full of a strange kind of energy,-- inflationary energy -- which blew it up.,But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state,is completely unsolved.,Now, I worked on that theory for a while, with Stephen Hawking and others.,But then I began to explore another alternative.,The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning.,Perhaps the universe existed before the bang,,and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe. 
 Well, this possibility is actually suggested,by the latest theories, the unified theories,,which try to explain all those 18 free parameters,in a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them.,And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here.,It's all I can convey. According to these theories,,there are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we're familiar with,,but at every point in the room there are more dimensions.,And in particular, there's one rather strange one,,in the most elegant unified theories we have.,The strange one looks likes this:,that we live in a three-dimensional world.,We live in one of these worlds, and I can only show it as a sheet,,but it's really three-dimensional. 
 And a tiny distance away, there's another sheet,,also three-dimensional, and they're separated by a gap.,The gap is very tiny, and I've blown it up so you can see it.,But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.,I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this,,but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know.,Well, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.,Which is, what happens if these two, three-dimensional worlds,should actually collide?,And if they collide, it would look a lot like the Big Bang.,But it's slightly different than in the conventional picture.,The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point.,Everything comes out of a point;,you have infinite density. And all the equations break down.,No hope of describing that. 
 In this picture, you'll notice,,the bang is extended. It's not a point.,The density of matter is finite, and we have a chance,of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process.,So, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative.,We've shown that it can fit,all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies,,the fluctuations in the microwave background.,Furthermore, there's an experimental way,to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.,It involves gravitational waves. 
 And in this scenario, not only was the Big Bang not the beginning,,as you can see from the picture,,it can happen over and over again.,It may be that we live in an endless universe,,both in space and in time.,And there've been bangs in the past, and there will be bangs in the future.,And maybe we live in an endless universe.,Well, making and testing models of the universe,is, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe.,We need to make the best mathematical models we can,,the most consistent ones.,And then we scrutinize them, logically and with data.,And we try to convince ourselves --,we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong.,That's progress: when we prove things wrong.,And gradually, we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world. 
 As I pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me.,What about Africa?,What about those kids I'd left behind?,Instead of developing, as we'd all hoped in the '60s,,things had gotten worse.,Africa was gripped by poverty, disease and war.,This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project.,And so the idea is to represent each country,on a map, but scale the area according to some quantity. 
 So here's just the standard area map of the world.,By the way, Africa is very large.,And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in 1960,,around the time of independence for many African states.,Now, this is 1990, and then 2002. And here's a projection for 2015.,Big changes are happening in the world,,but they're not helping Africa. 
 What about Africa's population? The population isn't out of proportion to its area,,but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes:,malnutrition, simple infections and birth complications.,Then there's HIV/AIDS. And then there are deaths from war.,OK, currently there are 45,000 people a month dying in the Congo,,as a consequence of the war,there over coltan and diamonds and other things.,It's still going on. 
 What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems?,Well, here's the number of physicians in Africa.,Here's the number of people in higher education.,And here -- most shocking to me --,the number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa.,It just doesn't exist scientifically.,And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa:,that all of the aid that's been given,has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet. 
 Well, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994,was literally a dream come true for many of us.,My parents were both elected to the first parliament,,alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple.,And in 2001, I took a research leave to visit them.,And while I was busy working -- I was working on these colliding worlds, in the day.,But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills,,especially mathematical skills, in industry, in government, in education. 
 The ability to make and test models has become essential,,not only to every single area of science today,,but also to modern society itself.,And if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age.,So I had an idea. And the idea was very simple.,The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, or AIMS.,And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa,,bring them together with lecturers from all over the world,,and we'll try to give them a fantastic education. 
 Well, as a Cambridge professor, I had many contacts.,And to my astonishment, they backed me 100 percent.,They said, "Go and do it,,and we'll come and lecture.",And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students,from these countries -- where they don't have any opportunities -- together,with the best lecturers in the world --,who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa --,and put them together and just let the sparks fly.,So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.,It's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.,The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.,It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it,and then put out the word:,we're going to start the best math institute in Africa,in this hotel. 
 Well, the new South Africa is a very exciting country.,And those of you who haven't been there, you should go.,It's very, very interesting what's happening.,And we recruited wonderful staff,,highly motivated staff.,The other thing that's happened, which was good for us, is the Internet.,Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa,,there are Internet cafes everywhere.,And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community,,to be successful -- and they're very ambitious.,They want to be the next Einstein. 
 And so when word came out that AIMS was opening,,it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website.,And we got lots of applicants.,Well, we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment,,and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning.,You have to rethink, what is the university for?,And that's really exciting.,So we designed it to have interactive teaching.,No droning on at the chalkboard.,We emphasize problem-solving, working in groups,,every student discovering and maximizing their own potential,and not chasing grades. 
 Everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students --,and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m.,The students don't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.,And then they're up again at eight in the morning.,Lectures, problem-solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place.,We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development,,because, in those areas, scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage.,They'll publish, be invited to conferences.,They'll do well. They'll have successful careers. 
 And AIMS has done extremely well.,Here is a list of last year's graduates, graduated in June,,and what they're currently doing -- 48 of them.,And where they are is indicated over here.,And where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students.,And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places.,Five students can be educated at AIMS,for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe.,But more important, the pan-African student body,is a continual source of strength, pride and commitment to Africa.,We illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa. 
 So here you can see behind this list.,When a county is colored yellow, we've received an application;,orange, we've accepted an application; and green,,a student has graduated.,So here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004.,And we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green.,So there's 2005, -6, -7, -8.,(Applause),We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal. 
 We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS.,And I'll just show you one.,Tendai Mugwagwa: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa.,I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree.,I will be attending AIMS.,My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot.,You know, from physics to medicine,,in particular, epidemiology and also mathematical modeling.,Neil Turok: So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well.,And I'll let her take it from there. 
 TM: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa,and I was a student at AIMS in 2003 and 2004.,After leaving AIMS, I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics,at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.,After that, I came to the Netherlands,where I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology. 
 Professor: Tendai is working very independently.,She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital.,So all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa.,So I'm happy she's here. 
 NT: Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu.,And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher.,And then entering university in northern Nigeria.,And after AIMS, Shehu wanted to do high-energy physics,,and he came to Cambridge.,He's about to finish his Ph.D.,,and he was filmed recently with someone you all know. 
 Shehu: And from there we will be able to,,hopefully, make better predictions and then we compare it,to the graph and also make some predictions. 
 Stephen Hawking: That is nice. 
 NT: Here are the current students at AIMS. There are 53 of them,from 20 different countries, including 20 women.,So now I'm going to get to my TED business.,Well, we had a party. This is Africa --,we have good parties in Africa. And last month, they threw a surprise party for me.,Here's somebody you've seen already.,(Applause),I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture.,So, we were having a party,,as you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point.,This is Ezra. She's from Darfur.,She's a physicist, and somehow stays smiling,,in spite of everything going on back home.,But she wants to continue in physics, and she's doing extremely well.,This is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman,to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic.,And she's now at AIMS. (Applause) 
 So now let me get to our TED wish.,Well, it's not my TED wish; it's our wish, as you've already gathered.,And our wish has two parts:,one is a dream and the other's a plan. OK.,Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African. (Applause),In striving for the heights of creative genius,,we want to give thousands of people the motivation,,the encouragement and the courage,to obtain the high-level skills they need to help Africa.,Among them will be not only brilliant scientists --,I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS --,they'll also be the African Gates, Brins and Pages of the future. 
 Well, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple.,AIMS is now a proven model.,And what we need to do is to replicate it.,We want to roll out 15 AIMS centers in the next five years, all over Africa.,Each will have a pan-African student body,,but specialize in a different area of science.,We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers,,as it does at AIMS.,And we want to add elements to the curriculum.,We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills. 
 The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution,,and its graduates will form a powerful network,,working together for peace and progress across the continent.,Over the last year,,we've been visiting sites in Africa,,looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers.,And here are the ones we've selected.,And each of these centers has a strong local team,,each is in a beautiful place, an interesting place,,which international lecturers will be happy to visit.,And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this.,Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country. 
 And last November,,the conference of all the African ministers of science and technology,,held in Mombasa, called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS.,So we have political support right across the continent.,It won't be easy.,At every site there will be huge challenges.,Local scientists must play leading roles,and governments must be persuaded to buy in.,Conditions are very difficult,,but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work. 
 And we summarize them this way:,the institutes have got to be relevant, innovative,,cost-effective and high quality. Why?,Because we want Africa to be rich.,Easy to remember the basic rules we need.,So, just in ending, let me say the only people who can fix Africa,are talented young Africans.,By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential,,we can create a step change in Africa's future.,Over time, they will contribute to African development,and to science in ways we can only imagine.,Thank you.,(Applause)Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,,just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.,You can mimic what you can see.,You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.,Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,,control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.,I'm going to tell you about that technology. 
 People have wanted to look inside the human mind,,the human brain, for thousands of years.,Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.,People envision this as being very difficult.,You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.,It was terribly dangerous. (Laughter),You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.,But now, we have a real technology to do this. 
 We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.,We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.,We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.,We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body --,but more importantly, we can look into his mind.,When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there,is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.,Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,,that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.,What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.,We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,,and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.,He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.,If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it. 
 There have been three ways to try to impact the brain:,the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.,This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.,We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.,Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.,But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,,it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.,If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,,we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,,and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.,So put your arms back up and flex your bicep. 
 Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain,and select brain areas to do that same thing.,What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.,This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.,They're watching their own brain activation,,and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.,They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.,As they do it, in the upper left is a display,that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.,When they control their brain, they can control their pain.,This is an investigational technology,,but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients. 
 This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.,I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.,When you do, what do you want to control?,You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.,These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.,But I want to leave with you the big question.,We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into,,using this technology, the human mind and brain.,Where will we take it?So, a big question that we're facing now,and have been for quite a number of years now:,are we at risk of a nuclear attack?,Now, there's a bigger question,that's probably actually more important than that,,is the notion of permanently eliminating,the possibility of a nuclear attack,,eliminating the threat altogether.,And I would like to make a case to you that,over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,,until this very moment,,we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world,that's characterized by two phases,,which I'm going to go through with you right now. 
 First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.,The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons,through the Manhattan Project,,and the idea was very straightforward:,we would use the power of the atom,to end the atrocities and the horror,of this unending World War II,that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.,And in 1945,,we were the only nuclear power.,We had a few nuclear weapons,,two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,,a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,,killing about 250,000 people between those two. 
 And for a few years,,we were the only nuclear power on Earth.,But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided,it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,,and they began to match what the United States had developed.,And from 1949 to 1985,was an extraordinary time,of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal,that no one could possibly have imagined,back in the 1940s.,So by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here,is equivalent of a thousands warheads --,the world had,65,000 nuclear warheads,,and seven members of something,that came to be known as the "nuclear club." 
 And it was an extraordinary time,,and I am going to go through some of the mentality,that we -- that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.,But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent,of the nuclear weapons at any particular time,since 1985 -- going forward, of course --,were part of the arsenals,of the United States and the Soviet Union.,After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,,we began to disarm,from a nuclear point of view.,We began to counter-proliferate,,and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world,to about a total of 21,000.,It's a very difficult number to deal with,,because what we've done is,we've quote unquote "decommissioned" some of the warheads.,They're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned,",but the way they count things, which is very complicated,,we think we have about a third,of the nuclear weapons we had before.,But we also, in that period of time,,added two more members to the nuclear club:,Pakistan and North Korea. 
 So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal,among many countries around the world,,but a very different set of circumstances.,So I'm going to talk about,a nuclear threat story in two chapters.,Chapter one is 1949 to 1991,,when the Soviet Union broke up,,and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,,was a superpowers' nuclear arms race.,It was characterized by,a nation-versus-nation,,very fragile standoff.,And basically,,we lived for all those years,,and some might argue that we still do,,in a situation of,being on the brink, literally,,of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.,It's incredible that we actually lived through all that. 
 We were totally dependent during those years,on this amazing acronym, which is MAD.,It stands for mutually assured destruction.,So it meant,if you attacked us, we would attack you,virtually simultaneously,,and the end result would be a destruction,of your country and mine.,So the threat of my own destruction,kept me from launching,a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.,And the danger of that, of course, is that,a misreading of a radar screen,could actually cause a counter-launch,,even though the first country had not actually launched anything.,During this chapter one,,there was a high level of public awareness,about the potential of nuclear catastrophe,,and an indelible image was implanted,in our collective minds,that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust,would be absolutely globally destructive,and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.,So this was chapter one. 
 Now the odd thing is that even though,we knew that there would be,that kind of civilization obliteration,,we engaged in America in a series --,and in fact, in the Soviet Union --,in a series of response planning.,It was absolutely incredible.,So premise one is we'd be destroying the world,,and then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?,So what,we offered ourselves,was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things,,just to jog your memories.,If you're born after 1950, this is just --,consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane. 
 This was Bert the Turtle. (Video),This was basically an attempt,to teach our schoolchildren,that if we did get engaged,in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,,then we wanted our school children,to kind of basically duck and cover.,That was the principle. You --,there would be a nuclear conflagration,about to hit us, and if you get under your desk,,things would be OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 I didn't do all that well,in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,,and I think this was seriously delusional. 
 (Laughter) 
 Secondly, we told people,to go down in their basements,and build a fallout shelter.,Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,,or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,,a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.,And actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.,Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter,that you could simply bury in the ground.,Now, the bomb shelters at that point --,let's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars,,maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.,Yet, what percentage of Americans,do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?,What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter? 
 Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent,of the population, as far as anyone knows,,did anything,,either making a space in their basement,or actually building a bomb shelter.,Many buildings, public buildings, around the country --,this is New York City -- had these little civil defense signs,,and the idea was that you would,run into one of these shelters and be safe,from the nuclear weaponry.,And one of the greatest governmental delusions,of all time was something that happened,in the early days of,the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,,and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.,Here is their first big public,announcement.,They would propose --,actually there were about six volumes written on this --,a crisis relocation plan,that was dependent upon,the United States having three to four days warning,that the Soviets were going to attack us.,So the goal was to evacuate the target cities.,We would move people out of the target cities,into the countryside. 
 And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate,about the absolute ludicrous idea,that we would actually evacuate,,and actually have three or four days' warning.,It was just completely off the wall.,Turns out that they had another idea,behind it, even though this was --,they were telling the public it was to save us.,The idea was that we would force the Soviets,to re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive --,and potentially double their arsenal,,to not only take out the original site,,but take out sites where people were going.,This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.,It was just really, really frightening. 
 The main point here is we were dealing with,a complete disconnect from reality.,The civil defense programs were disconnected,from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.,So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,,around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.,They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,,and they'd say, "Here's a map of your city.,Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.",So no possibility of medical response to,,or meaningful preparedness for,all-out nuclear war.,So we had to prevent nuclear war,if we expected to survive.,This disconnect was never actually resolved.,And what happened was --,when we get in to chapter two,of the nuclear threat era,,which started back in 1945. 
 Chapter two starts in 1991.,When the Soviet Union broke up,,we effectively lost that adversary,as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.,It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.,But from 1991,through the present time,,emphasized by the attacks of 2001,,the idea of an all-out nuclear war,has diminished and the idea of a single event,,act of nuclear terrorism,is what we have instead.,Although the scenario has changed,very considerably, the fact is,that we haven't changed our mental image,of what a nuclear war means.,So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.,So, what is a nuclear terror threat?,And there's four key ingredients to describing that. 
 First thing is that the global nuclear weapons,,in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,,happen to be not uniformly secure.,And it's particularly not secure,in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.,There are many, many sites where warheads are stored,and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,,like highly enriched uranium and plutonium,,are absolutely not safe.,They're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.,They're acquirable, let me put it that way.,From 1993 through 2006,,the International Atomic Energy Agency,documented 175 cases of nuclear theft,,18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,,the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.,The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium,is about 1,300, at the low end,,to about 2,100 metric tons.,More than 100 megatons of this,is stored in particularly insecure,Russian facilities.,How much of that do you think it would take,to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?,Well, you need about 75 pounds of it. 
 So, what I'd like to show you,is,what it would take to hold 75 pounds,of highly enriched uranium.,This is not a product placement. It's just --,in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this --,(Laughter),-- but,basically, this is it. 
 This is what you would need to steal or buy,out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile,that's relatively insecure,to create the type of bomb,that was used in Hiroshima.,Now you might want to look at plutonium,as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.,That -- you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.,Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:,this. This is enough plutonium,to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.,Now this situation, already I --,you know, I don't really like thinking about this,,although somehow I got myself a job,where I have to think about it. So,the point is that we're very, very insecure,in terms of developing this material.,The second thing is, what about the know-how? 
 And there's a lot of controversy about,whether terror organizations have the know-how,to actually make a nuclear weapon.,Well, there's a lot of know-how out there.,There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.,There's detailed information on how to assemble,a nuclear weapon from parts.,There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.,There are plans for how to create a terror farm,where you could actually manufacture and develop,all the components and assemble it.,All of this information is relatively available.,If you have an undergraduate degree in physics,,I would suggest --,although I don't, so maybe it's not even true --,but something close to that would allow you,,with the information that's currently available,,to actually build a nuclear weapon. 
 The third element of the nuclear terror threat,is that, who would actually do such a thing?,Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism,that involves individuals who are highly organized.,They are very dedicated and committed.,They are stateless.,Somebody once said, Al Qaeda,does not have a return address,,so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,,what's the response, and to whom is the response?,And they're retaliation-proof.,Since there is no real retribution possible,that would make any difference,,since there are people willing to actually give up their lives,in order to do a lot of damage to us,,it becomes apparent,that the whole notion,of this mutually assured destruction would not work. 
 Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith,,and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden.,He wrote many, many times statements to this effect:,"we have the right to kill four million Americans,,two million of whom should be children.",And we don't have to go overseas,to find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons.,McVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack,in the 1990s,was a good example of homegrown terrorists.,What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon?,The fourth element,is that the high-value U.S. targets,are accessible, soft and plentiful. 
 This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness,that the United States has achieved,since 9/11 of '01,is unbelievably inadequate.,What you saw after Katrina,is a very good indicator,of how little prepared the United States is,for any kind of major attack.,Seven million ship cargo containers,come into the United States every year.,Five to seven percent only are inspected --,five to seven percent. 
 This is Alexander Lebed,,who was a general that worked with Yeltsin,,who talked about, and presented to Congress,,this idea that the Russians had developed --,these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield --,0.1 to one kiloton,,Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons --,but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage.,And Lebed came to the United States,and told us that many, many --,more than 80 of the suitcase bombs,were actually not accountable.,And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements.,You put the elements into a suitcase.,It becomes very portable.,The suitcase can be conveniently dropped,in your trunk of your car.,You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it. 
 You don't want to build a suitcase bomb,,and you happen to get one of those insecure,nuclear warheads that exist.,This is the size of,the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.,It was 9.8 feet long,,weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to,your local rent-a-truck,and for 50 bucks or so,,you rent a truck that's got the right capacity,,and you take your bomb,,you put it in the truck and you're ready to go.,It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive?,You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability,,but what I'm trying to say is that,we have all the elements of that happening.,Anybody who dismisses the thought,of a nuclear weapon,being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves. 
 I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community --,a lot of people who deal with this work in general,think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things,to really try to defuse the risk,,like better interdiction, better prevention,,better fixing, you know, better screening,of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.,There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.,At this particular moment,,we actually could end up,seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities.,I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war,any time soon, although even that is not completely off the table.,There's still enough nuclear weapons,in the arsenals of the superpowers,to destroy the Earth many, many times over.,There are flash points in India and Pakistan,,in the Middle East, in North Korea,,other places where the use of nuclear weapons,,while initially locally,,could very rapidly,go into a situation,where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war.,It's very unsettling. 
 Here we go. OK.,I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.,We're coming down,,and we bring that truck,that you just saw,somewhere in here, in the Financial District.,This is a 10-kiloton bomb,,slightly smaller than was used,in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this,by just giving you some information. I think --,"news you could use" kind of concept here.,So, first of all, this would be horrific,beyond anything we can possibly imagine.,This is the ultimate.,And if you're in the half-mile radius,of where this bomb went off,,you have a 90 percent chance of not making it.,If you're right where the bomb went off,,you will be vaporized. And that's --,I'm just telling you, this is not good. 
 (Laughter) 
 You assume that.,Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance,of being killed,,and up to about eight miles away --,now I'm talking about killed instantly --,somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent,chance of getting killed.,The thing about this is that,the experience of the nuclear detonation is --,first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit,at the core here, where it goes off,,and an extraordinary amount of energy,in the form of heat, acute radiation,and blast effects.,An enormous hurricane-like wind,,and destruction of buildings almost totally,,within this yellow circle here.,And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here,,is that, what happens to you,if you're in here?,Well, if we're talking about the old days,of an all-out nuclear attack,,you, up here,,are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.,My point now, though, is that there is a lot,that we could do for you who are in here,,if you've survived the initial blast.,You have, when the blast goes off --,and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you look at it, you're going to be blind,,either temporarily or permanently.,So if there's any way that you can avoid,,like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.,If you find yourself alive, but,you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon,,you have -- that's gone off --,you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size,and exactly where it went off,,to get out of the way before,a lethal amount of radiation,comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.,In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do --,and I mean this seriously --,is go about a mile,away from the blast.,And what happens is -- this is --,I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes,,it comes straight down. Within 24 hours,,lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds,,and it's mostly in this particular direction --,it's going northeast. 
 And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away.,So you're feeling the wind --,and there's tremendous wind now,that you're going to be feeling -- and you want to go,perpendicular to the wind,[not upwind or downwind].,if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you.,You've got to get out of there.,If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed,to lethal radiation in very short order.,If you can't get out of there,,we want you to go into a shelter and stay there.,Now, in a shelter in an urban area means,you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible,,or you have to be on a floor -- on a high floor --,if it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be,,higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher,,or in the basement.,But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible.,And if you do that,,you actually can survive a nuclear blast. 
 Over the next few days to a week,,there will be a radiation cloud,,again, going with the wind, and settling down,for another 15 or 20 miles out --,in this case, over Long Island.,And if you're in the direct fallout zone here,,you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there,,and that's clear. But if you are sheltered,,you can actually survive.,The difference between knowing information,of what you're going to do personally,,and not knowing information, can save your life,,and it could mean the difference between,150,000 to 200,000 fatalities,from something like this,and half a million to 700,000 fatalities. 
 So, response planning in the twenty-first century,is both possible and is essential.,But in 2008, there isn't one single American city,that has done effective plans,to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.,Part of the problem is that,the emergency planners themselves, personally,,are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought,of nuclear catastrophe.,They are paralyzed.,You say "nuclear" to them, and they're thinking,,"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile.",And we're trying to tell them, "It's not futile.,We can change the survival rates,by doing some commonsensical things." 
 So the goal here is to minimize fatalities.,And I just want to leave you with the personal points,that I think you might be interested in.,The key to surviving a nuclear blast,is getting out,,and not going into harm's way.,That's basically all we're going to be talking about here.,And the farther you are away in distance,,the longer it is in time,from the initial blast;,and the more separation between you,and the outside atmosphere, the better.,So separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete,,or being in a basement --,distance and time is what will save you. 
 So here's what you do. First of all,,as I said, don't stare at the light flash,,if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.,But let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.,You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums,don't burst from the pressures.,If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,,like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.,And you want to get under something so that you're not injured,or killed by objects, if that's at all possible.,You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,,I said, in just a few minutes.,And shelter and place. You want to move [only],crosswind for 1.2 miles. 
 You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed,and down in that direction,,less destroyed here,,then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,,as long as you're going crosswise to the wind.,Once you're out and evacuating,,you want to keep as much of your skin,,your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering,doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.,And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.,And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,,you're going to get showered down some place,and remove the radiation that would be --,the radioactive material that might be on you.,And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,,but you're going to wait hopefully -- you'll have your little wind-up,,battery-less radio,,and you'll be waiting for people to tell you,when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do. 
 In conclusion,,nuclear war is less likely than before,,but by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.,Nuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable --,but is survivable.,And this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes,of the U.S. public health community.,And Jack said the only way to deal,with nuclear anything,,whether it's war or terrorism,,is abolition of nuclear weapons.,And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,,I urge you to think about the fact that,we have to do something about this,unacceptable, inhumane,reality of nuclear weapons,in our world. 
 Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I --,(Laughter),-- I don't want to be indelicate, but,this --,he's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK.,This was sent to me by somebody,who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures,,but the fact of the matter is that,America's gone through a very hard time.,We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do,,and now we're facing the potential of,bad, hell on Earth.,Thank you.These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,,and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.,This is an example of a real meteorite,,and you can see all the melting of the iron,from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,,and just how much of it survives and melts.,From a meteorite from space,,we’re over here with an original Sputnik.,This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.,This is not a copy.,The space age began 50 years ago in October,,and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like. 
 And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space age,without seeing a flag that was carried,to the moon and back, on Apollo 11.,The astronauts each got to carry,about ten silk flags in their personal kits.,They would bring them back and mount them.,So this has actually been carried to the moon,and back.,So that’s for fun. 
 The dawn of books is, of course, important.,And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books,without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.,You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg,in 1455.,But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,,is not the book.,You see, the book was not driven by reading.,In 1455, nobody could read.,So why did the printing press succeed?,This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.,So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books,using movable type in the history of man,,550 years ago.,We are living at the age here at the end of the book,,where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it. 
 But why is this so interesting? Here’s the quick story.,It turns out that in the 1450s,,the Catholic Church needed money,,and so they,actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,,which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.,They traveled all around Europe,and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.,They got you out of purgatory faster.,And when the printing press was invented,what they found was they could print indulgences,,which was the equivalent of printing money. 
 And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 --,to print out thousands,,and then hundreds of thousands,,and then ultimately millions,of single, small pieces of paper,that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.,That is why the printing press succeeded,,and that is why Martin Luther,nailed his 90 theses to the door:,because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok,in printing out indulgences and selling them,in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe. 
 So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,,was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses,and had nothing to do with reading.,More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library,for those of you that have asked for pictures.,We’re going to have some tomorrow.,(Applause) 
 Instead of showing an object from the stage,I’m going to do something special for the first time.,We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?,So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.,You’re going to find out why in a minute,,because when I went to see Eileen,,this is what I said I wanted to build. 
 This is the Library of Human Imagination.,The room itself is three stories tall.,In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination,that are computer controlled.,The room is a theatre. It changes colors.,And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.,It’s designed like an Escher print.,Here is some of the lower level of the library,,where the exhibits constantly change.,You can walk through. You can touch.,You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.,There’s my very own Saturn V.,Everybody should have one, OK? (Laughter),So you can see here in the lower level of the library,the books and the objects.,In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.,There is a glass bridge that you walk across,that’s suspended in space.,So it’s a leap of imagination. 
 How do we create?,Part of the question that I have answered is,,is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:,with human achievement, with history,,with the things that drive us and make us human --,the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,,the maps of space that we’ve experienced,,and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination. 
 So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show,one or two more objects from the stage,,but for today I just wanted to say thank you,for all the people that came and talked to us about it.,And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home,and share it with the TED community.,(Applause),TED is all about patterns in the clouds.,It’s all about connections.,It’s all about seeing things,that everybody else has seen before,but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.,And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about. 
 For example, we can look,at a DNA molecule model here.,None of us really have ever seen one,,but we know it exists because we’ve been taught,to understand this molecule.,But we can also look at an Enigma machine,from the Nazis in World War II,that was a coding and decoding machine.,Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?,Well, this is the code for life,,and this is a code for death.,These two molecules,code and decode.,And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.,But once you’ve seen them in a new way,,you realize that both of these things really are connected.,And they’re connected primarily because of this here. 
 You see, this is a human brain model, OK?,And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.,We get to see a skull. But there it is.,All of imagination -- everything that we think,,we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.,And once we create new patterns in this brain,,once we shape the brain in a new way,,it never returns to its original shape. 
 And I’ll give you a quick example.,We think about the Internet;,we think about information that goes across the Internet.,And we never think about the hidden connection.,But I brought along here a lump of coal --,right here, one lump of coal.,And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?,You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal,to move one megabyte of information across the net.,So every time you download a file,,each megabyte is a lump of coal.,What that means is, a 200-megabyte file,looks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?,So the next time you download a gigabyte,,or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?,The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,,and to make everything we think possible, possible.,Thanks, Chris.,(Applause)But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it’s perfect.

 (Applause)The first question is this.,Our country has two exploration programs.,One is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond,,to explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky.,And you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn,,and we have other manifestations of space exploration.,Well, there's also another program,,in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration.,It's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.,And my question is this: "why are we ignoring the oceans?",Here's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question.,If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens,,that one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget,to explore the oceans for 1,600 years.,Why? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven?,And hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue?,Why are people afraid of the ocean?,Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place,that has nothing to offer? 
 I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up.,OK. And what we're going to do,is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.,And what I'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points.,I'm going to make it right now in case I forget.,Everything I'm going to present to you,was not in my textbooks when I went to school.,And most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks.,I'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student --,I had to give the wrong answer to get an A.,We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at.,We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap.,In today's context, it was a bunch of crap,,but it was the law of geology, vertical tectonics.,All the things we're going to walk through,in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans,were mostly discoveries made by accident.,Mostly discoveries made by accident.,We were looking for something and found something else.,And everything we're going to talk about,represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen. 
 I have a characterization.,This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.,It gives you the false impression it's a map.,It is not a map.,In fact, I have another version at my office,and I ask people, "Why are there mountains here, on this area here,,but there are none over here?" And they go, "Well, gee,,I don't know," saying,,"Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?",No, no, that's the only place a ship's been.,Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored.,We had more exploration ships down there,during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing.,All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves,in the 72 percent of the planet because, you know,,it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny,put all the resources on the continents. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, it's just ludicrous.,We are always, constantly playing the zero sum game.,You know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else.,I believe in just enriching the economy.,And we're leaving so much on the table, 72 percent of the planet.,And as I will point out later in the presentation,,50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.,50 percent of our country that we own, have all legal jurisdiction,,have all rights to do whatever we want, lies beneath the sea,and we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent.,Why? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way.,Back then -- actually my first expedition,was when I was 17 years old. It was 49 years ago.,Do the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship,and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave,,and I was too young to be -- you know, I thought it was great!,I was a body surfer and I thought, "Wow, that was an incredible wave!",And we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured,with mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years,,I've done about 120, 121 -- I keep doing them -- expeditions. 
 But in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom,was to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine,,and go down to the bottom.,I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles.,Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana,,and all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight.,In fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings,at the average depth of the Earth --,maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going.,And so it's very difficult to get there, if you do it physically.,But I was enraptured, and in my graduate years,was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized,that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea. 
 The mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball.,This is on a Mercator projection.,But if you were to put it on an equal area projection,,you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent,of the Earth's total surface area.,Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range,and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong,and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon.,So we went to the moon, played golf up there,,before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.,And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days,,was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet,,but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.,Because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge,where the great crustal plates are separating.,And like a living organism, you tear it open,,it bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound,from the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally. 
 But no one had actually gone down,into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it --,into the Rift Valley -- until a group of seven of us,crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974,and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.,We went down into the Rift Valley.,This is all accurate except for one thing -- it's pitch black.,It's absolutely pitch black, because,photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean,,which is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet.,Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun.,Most of our planet is in eternal darkness.,And for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea.,And with the absence of photosynthesis,you have no plant life, and as a result,,you have very little animal life living in this underworld.,Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations,,we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation,,looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles.,Running along this entire 42,000 miles,are tens of thousands of active volcanoes.,Tens of thousands of active volcanoes.,There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea,than on land by two orders of magnitude.,So, it's a phenomenally active region,,it's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place.,And it's then being ripped open. 
 But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then.,We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension.,In plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide,,it made sense: they would crush into one another,,you would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it.,That's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest.,It's not a flood, it was pushed up there.,We understood mountains under compression,,but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension.,It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said,,"It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge,must be a cooling curve." We said, "Let's go find out.",We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense,,except, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat.,It was hot. It wasn't hot enough.,So, we came up with multiple hypotheses:,there's little green people down there taking it;,there's all sorts of things going on.,But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.,So, there must be underwater hot springs. 
 We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat.,And so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift,,and did we find the missing heat.,It was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys.,We went up to them with our submersible.,We wanted to get a temperature probe, we stuck it in there,,looked at it -- it pegged off scale.,The pilot made this great observation: "That's hot." 
 (Laughter) 
 And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff --,it could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature,was 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead.,This is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.,What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ,of chemicals coming out of the ocean.,Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade:,copper, lead, silver, zinc and gold.,So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor,,and you have massive heavy metal deposits,that we're making in this mountain range.,We're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore,along this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered.,We discovered a profusion of life,,in a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.,I remember having to use vodka -- my own vodka -- to pickle it,because we don't carry formaldehyde.,We went and found these incredible clam beds,sitting on the barren rock. Large clams,,and when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam.,And when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam.,No mouth, no gut, no digestive system.,Their bodies had been totally taken over,by another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out,how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark,,through a process we now call chemosynthesis.,None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks.,We did not know about this life system.,We were not predicting it.,We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat. 
 So, we wanted to accelerate this process.,We wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine:,average depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet;,two and half hours to get to work in the morning;,two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work.,Three hours of bottom time, average distance traveled -- one mile. 
 (Laughter) 
 On a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go.,So, I began designing a new technology of telepresence,,using robotic systems to replicate myself,,so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system.,We began to introduce that in our explorations,,and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries,with our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else,,moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another.,The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms.,They came across new creatures they had not seen before.,But more importantly, they discovered,edifices down there that they did not understand.,That did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber.,They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City. 
 And Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations,and upside down pools. Look at that.,How do you do that? That's water upside down.,We went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano.,The pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it,and at this extreme environment.,And the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment.,All the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment,,at a pH of 11, life existed.,So life was much more creative than we had ever thought.,Again, discovered by accident. Just two years ago,working off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach,,unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby,,we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems,and more life systems.,This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe,,and they were oblivious to the existence of this system.,Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge. 
 Recently, diving off -- in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water,,this time not upside down, right side up.,Bingo. You'd think you're in air, until a fish swims by.,You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs.,Near that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane.,Instead of belching out lava, they were belching out,big, big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes,,and there were flows, not of lava,,but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by --,I've never seen this before. 
 Moving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea --,human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic.,The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.,It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.,And yet we're only now penetrating it.,Finding the state of preservation.,We found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown.,People always ask, "Did you find the right ship?",It said Yorktown on the stern. 
 (Laughter) 
 More recently, finding ancient history.,How many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million.,We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes,,where they're not supposed to be.,This shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ.,This one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple.,And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C.,More recently, into the Black Sea, where we're exploring.,Because there's no oxygen there, it's the largest reservoir,of hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved.,All their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them.,We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA.,Look at the state of preservation --,still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts.,You still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped, they sealed it.,This ship sank 1,500 years ago. 
 Fortunately, we've been able to convince Congress.,We begin to go on the Hill and lobby.,And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy.,The Okeanos Explorer on its mission.,Its mission is as good as you could get.,Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth.,And I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK. 
 (Applause) 
 It comes online this summer,,and it begins its journey of exploration.,But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.,But certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America.,This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea.,We own all of that blue and yet,,like I say, particularly the western territorial trust,,we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them.,We have maps of Venus, but not of the western territorial trust.,The way we're going to run this -- we have no idea what we're going to discover.,We have no idea what we're going to discover.,We're going to discover an ancient shipwreck, a Phoenician off Brazil,,or a new rock formation, a new life.,So, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital. 
 We're going to connect our command center,,via a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building,at the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center.,And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine,,blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day.,A discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen,in the command center a second later.,But then it's connected through Internet too --,the new Internet highway that makes Internet one,look like a dirt road on the information highway --,with 10 gigabits of bandwidth.,We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.,It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours,,have the maps disseminated out to the major universities.,It turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect,in this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2.,We can then build a command center.,This is a remote center at the University of Washington.,She's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command. 
 But the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children.,We can disseminate.,They can follow this expedition. I've started a program --,where are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program,called the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program,with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America,,so that we can use exploration,,and the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them,and then give them what they're already ready for.,I would not let an adult drive my robot.,You don't have enough gaming experience.,But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system. 
 (Applause) 
 Because we want to create --,we want to create the classroom of tomorrow.,We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done.,You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.,The game is not over -- it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning.,We need to be not only proud of our universities.,We need to be proud of our middle schools.,And when we have the best middle schools in the world,,we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system, let me tell you.,Because this is what we want. This is what we want.,This is a young lady, not watching a football game,,not watching a basketball game.,Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away,,and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing.,And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.,You can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode. 
 (Applause) 
 This, I hope, will be a future engineer,or a future scientist in the battle for truth.,And my final question, my final question --,why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea?,Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars,,and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon,,but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet?,And the technology is at hand. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Good morning.,Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.,We're all familiar with his fantastic work --,his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.,But we do not know his face.,Thousands of books have been written about him,,but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.,Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians. 
 So, what do you think?,Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?,Let's find out.,Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.,He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.,But no faces?,I find that hard to believe.,His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here --,en face or three-quarters.,So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo,must have made self-portraits from time to time.,So let's try to find them. 
 I think that if we were to scan all of his work,and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.,So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,,and looked for male portraits.,There are about 120, you see them here.,Which ones of these could be self-portraits?,Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.,So we can eliminate all the profiles.,It also has to be sufficiently detailed.,So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.,And we know from his contemporaries,that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.,So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.,(Laughter) 
 And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.,And here they are.,Yes, indeed, the old man is there,,as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.,And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician." 
 Before we go into these faces,,I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.,I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself,for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.,(Laughter),But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.,So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.,OK, now let's look at these three portraits.,And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,,remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,,the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin. 
 I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.,There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.,All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,,and look, they are very similar.,Now, are they made in the right order?,The young man should be made first.,And as you see here from the years that they were created,,it is indeed the case.,They are made in the right order.,What was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?,Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made. 
 So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person,of the same age as Leonardo at the time.,But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?,Well, we need a reference.,And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.,It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,,for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.,And if we now compare the face of the statue,,with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.,The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo,to those three faces. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.,It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.,The icon of icons finally has a face.,Here he is: Leonardo da Vinci.,(Applause)Cultural evolution is a dangerous child,for any species to let loose on its planet.,By the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler,,up and causing havoc, and it's too late to put it back.,We humans are Earth's Pandoran species.,We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box,,and we can't push it back in.,We're seeing the consequences all around us. 
 Now that, I suggest, is the view that,comes out of taking memetics seriously.,And it gives us a new way of thinking about,not only what's going on on our planet,,but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.,So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics,and the theory of memes,,and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there,,if indeed anyone is. 
 So, memetics:,memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism.,Darwin had this amazing idea.,Indeed, some people say,it's the best idea anybody ever had.,Isn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing,as a best idea anybody ever had?,Do you think there could?,Audience: No.,(Laughter),Susan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there.,Well, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin. 
 Why?,Because the idea was so simple,,and yet it explains all design in the universe.,I would say not just biological design,,but all of the design that we think of as human design.,It's all just the same thing happening.,What did Darwin say?,I know you know the idea, natural selection,,but let me just paraphrase "The Origin of Species," 1859,,in a few sentences. 
 What Darwin said was something like this:,if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted --,I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks,and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on.,And 100 pages later.,(Laughter),And if there is a struggle for life,,such that nearly all of these creatures die --,and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus,and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants,to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on.,And another 100 pages later.,And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring,whatever it was that helped them survive,,then those offspring must be better adapted,to the circumstances in which all this happened,than their parents were. 
 You see the idea?,If, if, if, then.,He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm,,but that's what he described in that book,,and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.,The principle is you just need those three things --,variation, selection and heredity.,And as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those,,then you must get evolution.,Or design out of chaos, without the aid of mind. 
 There's one word I love on that slide.,What do you think my favorite word is?,Audience: Chaos.,SB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No.,Audience: Without.,SB: No, not without.,(Laughter),You try them all in order: Mmm...?,Audience: Must.,SB: Must, at must. Must, must.,This is what makes it so amazing.,You don't need a designer,,or a plan, or foresight, or anything else.,If there's something that is copied with variation,and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.,You can't stop it.,Must is my favorite word there. 
 Now, what's this to do with memes?,Well, the principle here applies to anything,that is copied with variation and selection.,We're so used to thinking in terms of biology,,we think about genes this way.,Darwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes.,He talked mostly about animals and plants,,but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.,But the principle of Universal Darwinism,is that any information that is varied and selected,will produce design. 
 And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about,in his 1976 bestseller, "The Selfish Gene.",The information that is copied, he called the replicator.,It selfishly copies.,Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, "I want to get copied.",But that it will get copied if it can,,regardless of the consequences.,It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't,,because it's just information being copied.,And he wanted to get away,from everybody thinking all the time about genes,,and so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?",Ah, yes, there is. 
 Look around you -- here will do, in this room.,All around us, still clumsily drifting about,in its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator.,Information that we copy from person to person, by imitation,,by language, by talking, by telling stories,,by wearing clothes, by doing things.,This is information copied with variation and selection.,This is design process going on.,He wanted a name for the new replicator.,So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.,Remember that, that's the core definition:,that which is imitated.,And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good,and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.,So that's how the idea came about.,It's important to stick with that definition. 
 The whole science of memetics is much maligned,,much misunderstood, much feared.,But a lot of these problems can be avoided,by remembering the definition.,A meme is not equivalent to an idea.,It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.,Stick with the definition.,It's that which is imitated,,or information which is copied from person to person.,So, let's see some memes. 
 Well, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck,in that particularly fetching way.,I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself,,or copied it from someone else?,If you copied it from someone else, it's a meme.,And what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here.,All right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?,Oh, well, your earrings,,I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings.,You probably went out and bought them.,There are plenty more in the shops.,That's something that's passed on from person to person.,All the stories that we're telling -- well, of course,,TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes. 
 The way to think about memes, though,,is to think, why do they spread?,They're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can.,But some of them will be copied because they're good,,or true, or useful, or beautiful.,Some of them will be copied even though they're not.,Some, it's quite hard to tell why. 
 There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy.,And I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here,,and I'm sure all of you found it, too.,You go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere,,and you come in and you put down your clothes,and you go to the bathroom, and what do you see?,Audience: Bathroom soap.,SB: Pardon?,Audience: Soap.,SB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see?,Audience: (Inaudible),SB: Mmm mmm.,Audience: Sink, toilet!,SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes,,but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one.,(Laughter),What is this one doing?,(Laughter),This has spread all over the world.,It's not surprising that you all found it,when you arrived in your bathrooms here.,But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent,in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.,(Laughter),Who folded that thing up there, and why?,(Laughter),Some people get carried away.,(Laughter),Other people are just lazy and make mistakes.,Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes,with a little sticker.,(Laughter),What is this all about?,I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's,cleaned the place, and it's all lovely.,And you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person,has potentially spread germs from place to place.,(Laughter) 
 So, think of it this way.,Imagine a world full of brains,and far more memes than can possibly find homes.,The memes are all trying to get copied --,trying, in inverted commas -- i.e.,,that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will.,They're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery,,and we are the meme machines. 
 Now, why is this important?,Why is this useful, or what does it tell us?,It gives us a completely new view of human origins,and what it means to be human,,all conventional theories of cultural evolution,,of the origin of humans,,and what makes us so different from other species.,All other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use,and all these things that make us unique,,are based upon genes.,Language must have been useful for the genes.,Tool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on.,It always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained,all that long time ago, it always comes back to genes. 
 The point of memetics is to say, "Oh no, it doesn't.",There are two replicators now on this planet.,From the moment that our ancestors,,perhaps two and a half million years ago or so,,began imitating, there was a new copying process.,Copying with variation and selection.,A new replicator was let loose, and it could never be --,right from the start -- it could never be,that human beings who let loose this new creature,,could just copy the useful, beautiful, true things,,and not copy the other things.,While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy --,lighting fires, keeping fires going, new techniques of hunting,,these kinds of things --,inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair,,or wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces,,or whatever. 
 So, you get an arms race between the genes,which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains,and not waste their time copying all this stuff,,and the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied --,in other words, what turned out to be language --,competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger.,So, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes. 
 This is why, in "The Meme Machine," I called it memetic drive.,As the memes evolve, as they inevitably must,,they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes,that are doing the driving.,This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains,,that we like religion, and music, and art.,Language is a parasite that we've adapted to,,not something that was there originally for our genes,,on this view.,And like most parasites, it can begin dangerous,,but then it coevolves and adapts,,and we end up with a symbiotic relationship,with this new parasite. 
 And so, from our perspective,,we don't realize that that's how it began.,So, this is a view of what humans are.,All other species on this planet are gene machines only,,they don't imitate at all well, hardly at all.,We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well.,The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine. 
 But that's not all.,We have a new kind of memes now.,I've been wondering for a long time,,since I've been thinking about memes a lot,,is there a difference between the memes that we copy --,the words we speak to each other,,the gestures we copy, the human things --,and all these technological things around us?,I have always, until now, called them all memes,,but I do honestly think now,we need a new word for technological memes. 
 Let's call them techno-memes or temes.,Because the processes are getting different.,We began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing.,We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet,,but in order to get true temes and true teme machines,,you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying,,all done outside of humans.,And we're getting there.,We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there,,that there are machines like that.,And indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED,,I see we're even closer than I thought we were before. 
 So actually, now the temes are forcing our brains,to become more like teme machines.,Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read,,learning to use machinery.,We're going to have all kinds of implants,,drugs that force us to stay awake all the time.,We'll think we're choosing these things,,but the temes are making us do it.,So, we're at this cusp now,of having a third replicator on our planet.,Now, what about what else is going on out there in the universe?,Is there anyone else out there?,People have been asking this question for a long time.,We've been asking it here at TED already.,In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation,,but I think he concentrated on the wrong things.,It's been very productive, that equation.,He wanted to estimate N,,the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy,,and he included in there the rate of star formation,,the rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence. 
 I think that's the wrong way to think about it.,Intelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises.,Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing.,But what's really important is the replicators you have,and the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before.,So, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence,,we think replicators. 
 And on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation.,A very simple equation.,N, the same thing,,the number of communicative civilizations out there,[that] we might expect in our galaxy.,Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.,The fraction of those which get a first replicator.,The fraction of those that get the second replicator.,The fraction of those that get the third replicator.,Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out --,sending information, sending probes, getting out there,,and communicating with anywhere else. 
 OK, so if we take that equation,,why haven't we heard from anybody out there?,Because every step is dangerous.,Getting a new replicator is dangerous.,You can pull through, we have pulled through,,but it's dangerous.,Take the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth.,We may take the Gaian view.,I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday -- it's not Gaian all the time.,Actually, life forms produce things that kill themselves.,Well, we did pull through on this planet. 
 But then, a long time later, billions of years later,,we got the second replicator, the memes.,That was dangerous, all right.,Think of the big brain.,How many mothers do we have here?,You know all about big brains.,They are dangerous to give birth to,,are agonizing to give birth to.,(Laughter),My cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time.,Ah, mm -- slightly different.,(Laughter) 
 But not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies,,it kills lots of mothers,,and it's very expensive to produce.,The genes are forced into producing all this myelin,,all the fat to myelinate the brain.,Do you know, sitting here,,your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output,for two percent of your body weight?,It's a really expensive organ to run.,Why? Because it's producing the memes. 
 Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off,,and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.,But maybe it nearly did.,Has it been tried before?,What about all those other species?,Louise Leakey talked yesterday,about how we're the only one in this branch left.,What happened to the others?,Could it be that this experiment in imitation,,this experiment in a second replicator,,is dangerous enough to kill people off? 
 Well, we did pull through, and we adapted.,But now, we're hitting, as I've just described,,we're hitting the third replicator point.,And this is even more dangerous --,well, it's dangerous again.,Why? Because the temes are selfish replicators,and they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else.,They're just information, why would they?,They are using us to suck up the planet's resources,to produce more computers,,and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED.,Don't think, "Oh, we created the Internet for our own benefit.",That's how it seems to us.,Think, temes spreading because they must.,We are the old machines. 
 Now, are we going to pull through?,What's going to happen?,What does it mean to pull through?,Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through.,One that is obviously happening all around us now,,is that the temes turn us into teme machines,,with these implants, with the drugs,,with us merging with the technology.,And why would they do that?,Because we are self-replicating.,We have babies.,We make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us,,because we're not yet at the stage on this planet,where the other option is viable.,Although it's closer, I heard this morning,,it's closer than I thought it was.,Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.,That way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate,was utterly destabilized,,and it was no longer possible for humans to live here.,Because those teme machines, they wouldn't need --,they're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing,,warmth-requiring creatures.,They could carry on without us. 
 So, those are the two possibilities.,The second, I don't think we're that close.,It's coming, but we're not there yet.,The first, it's coming too.,But the damage that is already being done,to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is,,that third danger point, getting a third replicator.,And will we get through this third danger point,,like we got through the second and like we got through the first?,Maybe we will, maybe we won't.,I have no idea.,(Applause),Chris Anderson: That was an incredible talk.,SB: Thank you. I scared myself.,CA: (Laughter)Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house,,I remember these Turkish carpets,,and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.,I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear,from this soldier.,And my mom took these pictures actually, last week,,of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.,There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture,with creatures and gargoyles and nudity --,pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid. 
 What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,,so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.,And then there was another influence.,I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,,we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.,And so,,I fused together the two things I loved the most,,which was skiing and windsurfing.,Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland. 
 So, I created this compilation of the two:,I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,,and some foot straps, and some metal fins,,and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.,It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,,it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.,And I realized then I had to go to design school.,(Laughter),I mean, look at those graphics there.,(Laughter) 
 So, I went to design school,,and it was the early '90s when I finished.,And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,,so I wanted to be there,,and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,,that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.,And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,,and we would get in to these meetings,,and these managers would come in,,and they would say,,"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know.",And they would give the projects code names, you know,,mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.,So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer,in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,,and I would ask questions.,I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,,but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?",or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?,"You know, do people really use it?,Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?",(Laughter) 
 What I realized then is, they didn't really want to change,the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.,They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,,to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.,And I didn't want to be a colorist.,It wasn't what I wanted to do.,I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.,And then I saw this quote:,"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal.",(Laughter) 
 So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,,and I started a little company, fuseproject.,And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.,And I wanted to really not just work on the skins,,but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.,And so the first projects were sort of humble,,but they took technology and maybe made it into things,that people would use in a new way,,and maybe finding some new functionality. 
 This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,,right when it launched,,and it's the first watch that has a display,that switches from horizontal to vertical.,And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,,without bending my elbow.,And other projects, which were really about transformation,,about matching the human need.,This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,,and it ships completely flat,,and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.,And something a little bit more experimental:,this is a light fixture for Swarovski,,and what it does is, it changes shape.,So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.,And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,,the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want. 
 And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.,This is a pretty involved process;,it took us about four and a half years.,But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,,a new experience of light.,So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.,And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.,And the new experience I was looking for,is giving the choice for the user to go from,a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,,all the way to a bright work light.,So, the light bulb actually does that.,It allows the person to switch,,and to mix these two colorations.,And it's done in a very simple way:,one just touches the base of the light,,and on one side, you can mix the brightness,,and on the other, the coloration of the light. 
 So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,,and I think as designers we need to really think,about how we can create a different relationship,between our work and the world,,whether it's for business,,or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.,Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring,value to business, value to the users also,,but I think it's the values that we put into these projects,that ultimately create the greater value.,And the values we bring,can be about environmental issues,,about sustainability, about lower power consumption.,You know, they can be about function and beauty;,they can be about business strategy.,But designers are really the glue,that brings these things together. 
 So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,,and it has a humanistic technology.,It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,,and it knows when it is you're talking.,And by knowing when it is you're talking,,it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,,which is the environmental noises. 
 But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone,is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,,and all the nerdy stuff out of it,,and try to make it as beautiful as we can.,I mean, think about it:,the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,,or accessories is really important,,so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.,And this is what we're pursuing here. 
 But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.,I want to point at something here, on the left.,This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside,that makes this technology work.,But this is the design process:,there's somebody changing the board,,putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,,as the designers on the other side are doing the work.,So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.,It's really about designing from the inside out.,And then, on the other side of the room,,the designers are making small adjustments,,sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.,And it's what I call being design driven.,You know, there is some push and pull,,but design is really helping define,the whole experience from the inside out. 
 And then, of course, design is never done.,And this is -- the other new way that is unique,in how we work is, because it's never done,,you have to do all this other stuff.,The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue,to really touch the user, in many ways.,But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?,And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,,you know, really understands that you need a different structure.,So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,,it's a partnership. We can continue to work,and dedicate ourselves to this project,,and then we also share in the rewards. 
 And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.,This is called Y Water,,and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,,Austrian originally, who came to us,,and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,,or an organic drink for his kids,,to replace the high-sugar-content sodas,that he's trying to get them away from.,So, we worked on this bottle,,and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.,And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.,The bottles connect together,,and you can create different shapes, different forms.,(Laughter),(Applause),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 And then while we were doing this,,the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,,and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,",are probably the most important words that kids ask.,So we called it Y Water. And so this is,another place where it all comes together in the same room:,the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,,it all becomes deeply connected.,And then the other thing about this project is,,we bring intellectual property,,we bring a marketing approach,,we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,,what we bring is these values,,and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.,And it's especially rewarding when your design work,becomes a creative endeavor,,when others can be creative and do more with it. 
 Here's another project,,which I think really emulates that.,This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.,This picture is incredible.,In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.,This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.,I mean, to me, it just means so much.,But when Nicholas Negroponte --,and he has spoken about this project a lot,,he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us,about two and a half years ago,,there were some clear ideas.,He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,,and those are pillars of his life,,but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.,But the third pillar that he talked about was design.,And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.,I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.,But what he said was really significant,,is that design was going to be why the kids,were going to love this product,,how we were going to make it low cost, robust.,And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --,(Laughter) --,and the Num Lock key, too. 
 So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,,to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.,And then the integration of,all these great technologies, which you've heard about,,the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;,the screen, which you can read in sunlight;,the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,,and it's protected from the environment. 
 You know, all these great technologies really happened,because of the passion and,the OLPC people and the engineers.,They fought the suppliers,,they fought the manufacturers.,I mean, they fought like animals,for this to remain they way it is.,And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --,allows the process,from not destroying the original idea.,And I think this is something really important. 
 So, now you get these pictures --,you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria,and you see them in Uruguay,with their computers, and in Mongolia.,And we went away from obviously the beige.,I mean it's colorful, it's fun.,In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.,It's because we were able,to run, during the manufacturing process,,20 colors for the X and the O,,which is the name of the computer,,and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,,you get 20 times 20: you get,400 different options there.,So, the lessons from seeing the kids,using them in the developing world are incredible. 
 But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,,and he had the laptop for an afternoon,,and I had to take it back. It was hard.,(Laughter),And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,,I come back to Switzerland,,and there he is playing with his own version.,(Laughter),Like paper, paper and cardboard. 
 So, I'm going to finish with one last project,,and this is a little bit more of adult play.,(Laughter),Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.,It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,,February 14, about 10 days ago.,So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,,and they needed a way to distribute,36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.,So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.,These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.,It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,,and it has to be easily serviceable:,you have to know where it is and what it does.,And we also designed the condoms themselves. 
 And I was just in New York at the launch,,and I went to see all these places where they're installed:,this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;,at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.,I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.,Of course, clubs and discos, too.,And here's the public service announcement for this project.,(Music),(Laughter),Get some.,(Applause) 
 So, this is really where design,is able to create a conversation.,I was in these venues, and people were,,you know, really into getting them. They were excited.,It was breaking the ice,,it was getting over a stigma,,and I think that's also what design can do.,So, I was going to,throw some condoms in the room and whatnot,,but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.,(Laughter),Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.,(Laughter),(Applause),So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.,(Laughter),And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,,you can just say you like the design.,(Laughter) 
 So, I'll finish with just one thought:,if we all work together on creating value,,but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,,I think we can change the work that we do.,We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,,and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.,So, thank you.,(Applause)Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.,They go to see Michelangelo's "David,",and when they finally come face to face with the statue,,they both freeze dead in their tracks.,The first guy -- we'll call him Adam --,is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form.,The second guy -- we'll call him Bill --,is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center.,So here's my question for you:,which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush,,which for Al Gore? 
 I don't need a show of hands,because we all have the same political stereotypes.,We all know that it's Bill.,And in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality.,It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives,on a major personality trait called openness to experience.,People who are high in openness to experience,just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel.,People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable. 
 If you know about this trait,,you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior.,You can understand why artists are so different from accountants.,You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read,,what kinds of places they like to travel to,,and what kinds of food they like to eat.,Once you understand this trait, you can understand,why anybody would eat at Applebee's, but not anybody that you know.,(Laughter),This trait also tells us a lot about politics.,The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that,,"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views" --,they like a society which is open and changing --,"whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views." 
 This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join.,So here's the description of a group I found on the Web.,What kinds of people would join a global community,welcoming people from every discipline and culture,,who seek a deeper understanding of the world,,and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all?,This is from some guy named Ted.,(Laughter),Well, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal,,and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster,,then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal?,Let's find out.,I'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center --,on social issues, we're talking about, primarily --,or conservative, and I'll give a third option,,because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience.,So, right now, please raise your hand --,down in the simulcast rooms, too,,let's let everybody see who's here --,please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center.,Please raise your hand high right now. OK.,Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.,OK, about a -- two dozen.,And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.,One, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10. 
 OK. This is a bit of a problem.,Because if our goal is to understand the world,,to seek a deeper understanding of the world,,our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.,Because when people all share values, when people all share morals,,they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams,,it shuts down open-minded thinking.,When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004,,and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.,(Laughter),We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.,We think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.,(Laughter),(Applause),So, if you think that half of America votes Republican,because they are blinded in this way,,then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix,,in a particular moral matrix.,And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix." 
 But I'm here today to give you a choice.,You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions,,or you can take the red pill,,learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix.,Now, because I know --,(Applause) --,OK, I assume that answers my question.,I was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need.,You're all high in openness to experience, and besides,,it looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures.,So anyway, let's go with the red pill.,Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us. 
 Let's start at the beginning.,What is morality and where does it come from?,The worst idea in all of psychology,is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.,Developmental psychology has shown,that kids come into the world already knowing so much,about the physical and social worlds,,and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things,and hard to learn others.,The best definition of innateness I've ever seen --,this just clarifies so many things for me --,is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.,He says, "The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience.,Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.,Built-in doesn't mean unmalleable;,it means organized in advance of experience.",OK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind?,To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I,read through the literature on anthropology,,on culture variation in morality,and also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.,What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?,That you find across cultures and even across species?,We found five -- five best matches,,which we call the five foundations of morality. 
 The first one is harm/care.,We're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming,that makes us really bond with others, care for others,,feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.,It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.,This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent,of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. 
 The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.,There's actually ambiguous evidence,as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,,but the evidence for people could not be clearer.,This Norman Rockwell painting is called "The Golden Rule,",and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course,,as the foundation of so many religions.,That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent,of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. 
 The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.,You do find groups in the animal kingdom --,you do find cooperative groups --,but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.,It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people,who are able to cooperate, join together into groups,,but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.,This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.,And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable,that even when we don't have tribes,,we go ahead and make them, because it's fun.,(Laughter),Sports is to war as pornography is to sex.,We get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives. 
 The fourth foundation is authority/respect.,Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species.,But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality,,as it is in other primates.,It's based on more voluntary deference,,and even elements of love, at times. 
 The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.,This painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity,",but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality.,It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea,that tells you that you can attain virtue,by controlling what you do with your body,,by controlling what you put into your body.,And while the political right may moralize sex much more,,the political left is really doing a lot of it with food.,Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays,,and a lot of it is ideas about purity,,about what you're willing to touch, or put into your body. 
 I believe these are the five best candidates,for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.,I think this is what we come with, at least,a preparedness to learn all of these things.,But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town,,how is this first draft going to get revised?,And how will it end up being different,from a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?,To think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.,If there really are five systems at work in the mind --,five sources of intuitions and emotions --,then we can think of the moral mind,as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels,,where you can set it to a different setting on every channel.,And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I,,made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.,And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.,Here are the results.,Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.,On the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals;,on the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.,The blue line shows you people's responses,on the average of all the harm questions. 
 So, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.,They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements,all across the board, but as you also see,,liberals care about it a little more than conservatives -- the line slopes down.,Same story for fairness.,But look at the other three lines.,For liberals, the scores are very low.,Liberals are basically saying, "No, this is not morality.,In-group, authority, purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.",But as people get more conservative, the values rise.,We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel,,or two-foundation morality.,Conservatives have more of a five-foundation,,or five-channel morality. 
 We find this in every country we look at.,Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians.,I'll just flip through a few other slides.,The U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,,Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.,Notice also that on all of these graphs,,the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.,Which shows that within any country,,the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.,Everybody -- I mean, we debate over what's fair --,but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.,Moral arguments within cultures,are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity. 
 This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.,In one recent study,,we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog.,You picked a particular breed,,you learned some new information about the breed.,Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded,,and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal?,Well, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!",Because liberals like to say, "Fetch, please.",(Laughter),But if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.,If you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal,to its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers,,for conservatives, well, loyalty is good -- dogs ought to be loyal.,But to a liberal, it sounds like this dog,is running for the Republican nomination.,(Laughter) 
 So, you might say, OK,,there are these differences between liberals and conservatives,,but what makes those three other foundations moral?,Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia,and authoritarianism and Puritanism?,What makes them moral?,The answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,,"The Garden of Earthly Delights.",In the first panel, we see the moment of creation.,All is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals,are doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be.,But then, given the way of the world, things change.,We get every person doing whatever he wants,,with every aperture of every other person and every other animal.,Some of you might recognize this as the '60s.,(Laughter),But the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s,,where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.,Of course, Bosch called this hell. 
 So this triptych, these three panels,portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.,The truth of social entropy.,But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination,where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,,here's the same story, the same progression,,told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago,,in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma.,A game in which you give people money,,and then, on each round of the game,,they can put money into a common pot,,and then the experimenter doubles what's in there,,and then it's all divided among the players.,So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,,where we're asking people to make a sacrifice,and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.,But you really want everybody else to sacrifice,,but everybody has a temptation to a free ride.,And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative --,and this is all played anonymously.,On the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.,But they quickly see, "You know what, other people aren't doing so much though.,I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.",And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero. 
 But then -- and here's the trick --,Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people,,"You know what? New rule.,If you want to give some of your own money,to punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that.",And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,,cooperation shoots up.,It shoots up and it keeps going up.,There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.,It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.,It really helps to have some sort of punishment.,Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip,,you need some sort of punishment to bring people,,when they're in large groups, to cooperate.,There's even some recent research suggesting that religion --,priming God, making people think about God --,often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior. 
 Some people think that religion is an adaptation,evolved both by cultural and biological evolution,to make groups to cohere,,in part for the purpose of trusting each other,,and then being more effective at competing with other groups.,I think that's probably right,,although this is a controversial issue.,But I'm particularly interested in religion,,and the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.,Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.,The Grand Canyon is really simple.,It's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time,,and you get the Grand Canyon.,It's not that complicated.,This is what's really complicated,,that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon,,cooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa,,or on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages,grew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.,How did this happen?,This is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon. 
 The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.,It took all of our moral psychology,to create these cooperative groups.,Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm,,you do need a psychology of justice.,But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups,,and if those sub-groups have some internal structure,,and if you have some ideology that tells people,to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.,And now we get to the crux of the disagreement,between liberals and conservatives.,Because liberals reject three of these foundations.,They say "No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership.",They say, "Let's question authority.",And they say, "Keep your laws off my body." 
 Liberals have very noble motives for doing this.,Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive,,and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.,So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.,They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.,This guy's shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution.",If you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good,,it's change, it's fun.,Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.,They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.,The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.,It's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.,So as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men,,as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.",This was after the chaos of the French Revolution.,So once you see this -- once you see,that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute,,that they form a balance on change versus stability --,then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix. 
 This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.,Think about yin and yang.,Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other.,Yin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,,for the functioning of the world.,You find the same thing in Hinduism.,There are many high gods in Hinduism.,Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.,This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.,You have the markings of Vishnu on the left,,so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.,You have the markings of Shiva on the right,,Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together.,You find the same thing in Buddhism.,These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights,that have ever been attained into moral psychology.,From the Zen master Seng-ts'an:,"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.,The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.",Now unfortunately, it's a disease,that has been caught by many of the world's leaders.,But before you feel superior to George Bush,,before you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?,Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?,Can you be not for or against anything? 
 So, what's the point? What should you do?,Well, if you take the greatest insights,from ancient Asian philosophies and religions,,and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology,,I think you come to these conclusions:,that our righteous minds were designed by evolution,to unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams,and then to blind us to the truth.,So what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive?,Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop,,stop with this struggle of for and against?,No, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.,This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,,using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money,,to make the world a better place, to fight --,to fight wrongs, to solve problems. 
 But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story,about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in,,saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right.",Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.,A lot of the problems we have to solve,are problems that require us to change other people.,And if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it,is to first understand who we are -- understand our moral psychology,,understand that we all think we're right -- and then step out,,even if it's just for a moment, step out -- check in with Seng-ts'an.,Step out of the moral matrix,,just try to see it as a struggle playing out,,in which everybody does think they're right,,and everybody, at least, has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them --,everybody has some reasons for what they're doing.,Step out.,And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility,,to get yourself out of this self-righteousness,,which is the normal human condition.,Think about the Dalai Lama.,Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama --,and it comes from his moral humility. 
 So I think the point -- the point of my talk,,and I think the point of TED --,is that this is a group that is passionately engaged,in the pursuit of changing the world for the better.,People here are passionately engaged,in trying to make the world a better place.,But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.,And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment,to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.,Thank you.,(Applause)I was thinking about my place in the universe,,and about my first thought about what infinity might mean,,when I was a child.,And I thought that if time could reach,forwards and backwards infinitely,,doesn't that mean that,every point in time is really infinitely small,,and therefore somewhat meaningless.,So we don't really have a place in the universe,,as far as on a time line.,But nothing else does either.,Therefore every moment really is the most important moment,that's ever happened, including this moment right now.,And so therefore this music you're about to hear,is maybe the most important music,you'll ever hear in your life. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 (Applause) 
 For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards,,you could please refrain from saying,,"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life.",(Laughter),Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion,,for some reason.,(Laughter),Somewhat like the curving of the universe. 
 I don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot,,"My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!",(Laughter),"You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause),Thank you very much.,(Applause)I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.,I'm giving a short slide show this morning,that I'm giving for the very first time, so --,well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar,,I'm actually trying to lower the bar.,Because I've cobbled this together,to try to meet the challenge of this session. 
 And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation,that religion really properly understood,is not about belief, but about behavior.,Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.,How dare we be optimistic?,Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.,As Mahatma Gandhi famously said,,"You must become the change you wish to see in the world.",And the outcome about which,we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created,by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief,brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior",is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.,I'm a big advocate of changing,the lightbulbs and buying hybrids,,and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,,and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.,But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,,it is more important to change the laws.,And when we change our behavior in our daily lives,,we sometimes leave out the citizenship part,and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,,we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.,In order to solve the climate crisis,,we have to solve the democracy crisis.,And we have one. 
 I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.,I was reminded of that recently, by a woman,who walked past the table I was sitting at,,just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,,looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it,until I saw from the corner of my eye,she was walking from the opposite direction,,also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?",And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,,you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter) 
 Many years ago, when I was a young congressman,,I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge,of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.,And the military historians taught me,,during that quest, that military conflicts are typically,put into three categories: local battles,,regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important,global, world war -- strategic conflicts.,And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,,a different approach,,a different organizational model.,Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories,,and most of what we think about,are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,,hazardous waste dumps. But there are also,regional environmental problems, like acid rain,from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe,to the Arctic, and from the Midwest,out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.,And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis,is the rare but all-important,global, or strategic, conflict.,Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response,appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization,for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency,and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.,We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources,and political will. But the political will,has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources. 
 Let me show you these slides here.,I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,,of course, is the North Polar ice cap.,Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the,polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like,at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.,This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center,in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers,here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.,This is what's happened in the last 28 years.,To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.,Here's what happened last fall,that has really unnerved the researchers.,The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically --,doesn't look quite the same size --,but it is exactly the same size as the United States,,minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.,The amount that disappeared in 2005,was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.,The extra amount that disappeared last fall,was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,,but not as permanent ice, as thin ice --,vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone,in summer in as little as five years.,That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.,Already, around the Arctic Circle --,this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town,in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.,The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting,of an area equivalent to the size of California. 
 "They were the best of times,,they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence,in English literature. I want to share briefly,a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus,are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter,is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.,They have exactly the same amount of carbon.,But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon,has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,,deposited in the ground as coal, oil,,natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it,is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature,is 59 degrees on average. On Venus,,it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy,of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,,and putting it into the atmosphere.,It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.,It's three times hotter than Mercury,,which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,,here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,,but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate. 
 The global scientific community says:,man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,,thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.,You all know that. At the last,IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,,"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent.",The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was,"more than 90 percent.",Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,,this could be variations in this energy,coming in from the sun." If that were true,,the stratosphere would be heated as well as the,lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.,If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would,expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.,Here's the stratosphere: cooler.,CSI: Climate. 
 Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe,that human activity is responsible,for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up,in a significant way. There has been progress,,but here is the key: when given a list,of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.,What is missing is a sense of urgency.,If you agree with the factual analysis,,but you don't feel the sense of urgency,,where does that leave you?,Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head,in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono --,did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.,This is the winner. 
 NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists,for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007,of the presidential candidates: two of them were about,the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.,Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.,From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older,tobacco commercials.,So here's what we're doing.,This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.,But it's not just the developed nations.,The developing countries are now following us,and accelerating their pace. And actually,,their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent,to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up,very dramatically. The total concentrations:,by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.,If the wealthy countries were completely missing,from the picture, we would still have this crisis.,But we have given to the developing countries,the technologies and the ways of thinking,that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia --,over thirty years. 
 This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.,'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.,We have the technologies.,We have to have a unified view of how to go about this:,the struggle against poverty in the world,and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,,all has a single, very simple solution. 
 People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.,Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,,to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck --,and some things have changed,since the 19th century.,In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses,to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.,Plans to fight poverty in Uganda,are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis. 
 But responses can actually make a huge difference,in the poor countries. This is a proposal,that has been talked about a lot in Europe.,This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating,solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid",to supply all of the electrical power,to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents.,This is not pie in the sky; this can be done. 
 We need to do it for our own economy.,The latest figures show that the old model,is not working. There are a lot of great investments,that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands,or shale oil, then you have a portfolio,that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.,And it is based on an old model.,Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones,in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands,and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments,that I personally think make sense.,I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.,But geothermal, concentrating solar,,advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation. 
 You've seen this slide before, but there's a change.,The only two countries that didn't ratify,-- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.,And there was a campaign in Australia,that involved television and Internet and radio commercials,to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.,And we trained 250 people to give the slide show,in every town and village and city in Australia.,Lot of other things contributed to it,,but the new Prime Minister announced that,his very first priority would be to change Australia's position,on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness,partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.,This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen,said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,,we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,,and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.,We can't wait for the kind of drought,Australia had to change our political culture.,Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.,are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there,,just to localize this -- which is good news. 
 Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago,about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace,that it becomes banal or routine.,What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive,in the United States of America,today especially, but also the rest of the world,,have to somehow understand that history,has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out,how to save her life while she was distracted,by the amazing experience that she was going through.,We now have a culture of distraction.,But we have a planetary emergency.,And we have to find a way to create,,in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.,I wish I could find the words to convey this.,This was another hero generation,that brought democracy to the planet.,Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.,We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.,If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,,we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.,We have the capacity to do it. 
 One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe,we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,,to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge,that history is presenting to us.,Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis,by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.,What a burden we have." I would like to ask you,to reframe that. How many generations,in all of human history have had the opportunity,to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?,A challenge that can pull from us,more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach,this challenge with a sense of profound joy,and gratitude that we are the generation,about which, a thousand years from now,,philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate,by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves,to solve this crisis and lay the basis,for a bright and optimistic human future. 
 Let's do that. Thank you very much. 
 Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain,that basically a design issue,on a voting form --,one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard,like that in the last eight years in a position,where you could make these things come true.,That hurts. 
 Al Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter) 
 CA: When you look at what the leading candidates,in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's --,are you excited by their plans on global warming? 
 AG: The answer to the question is hard for me,because, on the one hand, I think that,we should feel really great about the fact,that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --,John McCain, and both of the finalists,for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different,and forward-leaning position,on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,,and all three are very different from the approach taken,by the current administration. And I think,that all three have also been responsible in,putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that --,as illustrated by the questions --,that was put together by the,League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions --,and, by the way, the debates have all been,sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,,"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?,Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal.","Now, even lower emissions!" 
 The richness and fullness of the dialogue,in our democracy has not laid the basis,for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.,So they're saying the right things and they may --,whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing,,but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto,in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness,that we'd gotten that breakthrough there,,and then confronted the United States Senate,,only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote,to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say,has to be laid alongside what the people say. 
 This challenge is part of the fabric,of our whole civilization.,CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.,And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern,requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change,that is beyond what we have done in the past.,So that's why I began by saying,,be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.,Demand -- change the light bulbs,,but change the laws. Change the global treaties.,We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this --,We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.,Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.,Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.,Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't,have any new coal-fired generating plants,that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to,quickly build these renewable sources.,Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe,that between now and November, it is possible.,This Alliance for Climate Protection,is going to launch a nationwide campaign --,grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,,radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody,from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen. 
 We need help. We need help. 
 CA: In terms of your own personal role going forward,,Al, is there something more than that,you would like to be doing? 
 AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer,to that question. What can I do?,Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future,of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?,How would I be?" It does depend on all of us,,but again, not just with the light bulbs.,We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.,We can change things, but we have to actively change.,What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.,And that's hard to --,that's hard to create -- but it is coming.,There's an old African proverb that some of you know,that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;,if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.,So we have to have a change in consciousness.,A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.,A new appreciation for the privilege,that we have of undertaking this challenge. 
 CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED. 
 AG: Thank you. Thank you very much.How does the news shape the way we see the world?,Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.,And here's how news shapes what Americans see.,This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of seconds,that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,,by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.,Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.,There was massive flooding in Indonesia.,And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.,The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.,And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,,we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.,The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent. 
 When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,,here's how the world looked.,What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.,This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,,and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.,And the cycle continues;,as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately. 
 So, why don't we hear more about the world?,One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.,Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,,there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America,-- places that are home to more than two billion people. 
 The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.,And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing,when we see where people go for news.,Local TV news looms large,,and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news. 
 And what about the web?,The most popular news sites don't do much better.,Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories,that appeared on Google News' front page.,And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.,Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators,is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,,and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it. 
 So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,,as well as less educated Americans,,know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.,And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,,you would be wrong.,In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time,grew to over 50 percent. 
 The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans,in our increasingly interconnected world?,I know we can do better.,And can we afford not to? Thank you.This is the Large Hadron Collider.,It's 27 kilometers in circumference.,It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.,Over 10,000 physicists and engineers,from 85 countries around the world,have come together over several decades,to build this machine.,What we do is we accelerate protons --,so, hydrogen nuclei --,around 99.999999,percent the speed of light.,Right? At that speed, they go around,that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.,And we collide them with another beam of protons,going in the opposite direction.,We collide them inside giant detectors. 
 They're essentially digital cameras.,And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.,You get some sense of the size --,you can just see these EU standard-size,people underneath. 
 (Laughter) 
 You get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide,,22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.,And we re-create the conditions that were present,less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,up to 600 million times a second,inside that detector -- immense numbers.,And if you see those metal bits there --,those are huge magnets that bend,electrically charged particles,,so it can measure how fast they're traveling.,This is a picture about a year ago.,Those magnets are in there.,And, again, a EU standard-size, real person,,so you get some sense of the scale.,And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,,sometime in the summer this year. 
 And actually, this morning, I got an email,saying that we've just finished, today,,building the last piece of ATLAS.,So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say,that I planned that for TED,,but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today. 
 (Applause) 
 Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.,So, you might be asking, "Why?,Why create the conditions that were present,less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?",Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.,And the aim of particle physics is to understand,what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.,And by everything I mean, of course,,me and you, the Earth, the Sun,,the 100 billion suns in our galaxy,and the 100 billion galaxies,in the observable universe.,Absolutely everything. 
 Now you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?,You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me.",Well, we found that as you look back in time,,the universe gets hotter and hotter,,denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.,Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,,but that seems to be the case.,So, way back in the early times of the universe,,we believe it was very simple and understandable.,All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --,human brains -- are a property of an old,and cold and complicated universe.,Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second,,we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple. 
 It's almost like ...,imagine a snowflake in your hand,,and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,,beautiful object. But as you heat it up,,it'll melt into a pool of water,,and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made,of H20, water.,So it's in that same sense that we look back in time,to understand what the universe is made of.,And, as of today, it's made of these things.,Just 12 particles of matter,,stuck together by four forces of nature.,The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons,that make up the atomic nuclei in your body.,The electron -- the thing that goes around,the atomic nucleus --,held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force,that's carried by this thing, the photon.,The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons. 
 And these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,,probably the least familiar.,But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.,And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities,of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.,Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail --,about a square centimeter --,there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second,from the sun, passing,through every square centimeter of your body.,But you don't feel them, because the weak force,is correctly named --,very short range and very weak,,so they just fly through you. 
 And these particles have been discovered,over the last century, pretty much.,The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,,and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,,in the year 2000. Actually just --,I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,,America, isn't it?,Just up the road.,Relative to the universe, it's just up the road. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,,so it's a relatively recent picture.,One of the wonderful things, actually, I find,,is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.,You know, they're a step in size,from the entire observable universe.,So, 100 billion galaxies,,13.7 billion light years away --,a step in size from that to Monterey, actually,,is about the same as from Monterey to these things.,Absolutely, exquisitely minute,,and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set. 
 So, one of my most illustrious forebears,at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,,discoverer of the atomic nucleus,,once said, "All science is either physics,or stamp collecting.",Now, I don't think he meant to insult,the rest of science,,although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what he meant was that what we've done, really,,is stamp collect there.,OK, we've discovered the particles,,but unless you understand the underlying,reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --,really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.,Fortunately, we have,probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century,that underpins that pattern.,It's the Newton's laws, if you want,,of particle physics.,It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.,You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,,which is always the sign of elegance.,This is it. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out,in all its gory detail.,This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --,other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.,So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --,in principle, you've got a big enough computer --,why DNA is the shape it is.,In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation. 
 But there's a problem.,Can anyone see what it is?,A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.,I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.,Basically, each of these terms,refers to some of the particles.,So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.,These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.,But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.,Right, H.,H stands for Higgs particle.,Higgs particles have not been discovered.,But they're necessary: they're necessary,to make that mathematics work.,So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do,with that wonderful equation,wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.,So it's a prediction:,a prediction of a new particle. 
 What does it do?,Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.,And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money,for the LHC from the U.K. government,,Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said,,"If you guys can explain, in language,a politician can understand,,what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.,I want to know what this Higgs particle does.",And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.,Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.,And the picture is that the whole universe --,and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --,the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.,Higgs particles, if you will. 
 The analogy is that these people in a room,are the Higgs particles.,Now when a particle moves through the universe,,it can interact with these Higgs particles.,But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.,Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,,essentially at the speed of light. They're massless.,And imagine someone incredibly important,and popular and intelligent,walks into the room.,They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.,It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.,And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.,The picture is that the electrons and the quarks,in your body and in the universe that we see around us,are heavy, in a sense, and massive,,because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.,They're interacting with the Higgs field. 
 If that picture's true,,then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.,If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,,although it's the simplest we've been able to think of --,then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles,we know have to turn up,at the LHC.,So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.,I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.,Actually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --,(Laughter),anyway.,So that's one thing.,That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find. 
 There are many other things. You've heard,many of the big problems in particle physics.,One of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.,There's another issue,,which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --,seem, as you go back in time,,they seem to change in strength.,Well, they do change in strength.,So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,,gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.,The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,,gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --,you can calculate how these change -- is the forces,,the three forces, other than gravity,,almost seem to come together at one point.,It's almost as if there was one beautiful,kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.,But they just miss. 
 Now there's a theory called super-symmetry,,which doubles the number of particles in the standard model,,which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.,But actually, with this theory,,we find that the forces of nature,do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --,absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,,but it seems to do it.,Also, those super-symmetric particles,are very strong candidates for the dark matter.,So a very compelling theory,that's really mainstream physics.,And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --,in a very unscientific way -- that,that these things would also crop up at the LHC.,Many other things that the LHC could discover. 
 But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you,a different perspective,of what I think -- what particle physics,really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.,And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful,narrative -- almost a creation story,,if you'd like -- about the universe,,from modern science over the last few decades.,And I'd say that it deserves,,in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,,to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories,of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.,This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful. 
 The story goes like this: we know that,the universe began 13.7 billion years ago,,in an immensely hot, dense state,,much smaller than a single atom.,It began to expand about,a million, billion, billion, billion billionth,of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.,Gravity separated away from the other forces.,The universe then underwent,an exponential expansion called inflation.,In about the first billionth of a second or so,,the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks,and the gluons and the electrons,that make us up got mass.,The universe continued to expand and cool.,After about a few minutes,,there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.,The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,,25 percent helium. It still is today. 
 It continued to expand,about 300 million years.,Then light began to travel through the universe.,It was big enough to be transparent to light,,and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background,that George Smoot described,as looking at the face of God.,After about 400 million years, the first stars formed,,and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook,into the heavier elements.,So the elements of life --,carbon, and oxygen and iron,,all the elements that we need to make us up --,were cooked in those first generations of stars,,which then ran out of fuel, exploded,,threw those elements back into the universe.,They then re-collapsed into another generation,of stars and planets. 
 And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created,in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen,to form water, liquid water on the surface.,On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,,primitive life evolved,,which evolved over millions of years into,things that walked upright and left footprints,about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,,and eventually,left a footprint on another world.,And built this civilization,,this wonderful picture,,that turned the darkness into light,,and you can see the civilization from space.,As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,,these are the things -- and actually, not only these,,but I was looking around -- these are the things,,like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,,and DNA, and literature and science --,these are the things that hydrogen atoms do,when given 13.7 billion years. 
 Absolutely remarkable.,And, the laws of physics. Right?,So, the right laws of physics --,they're beautifully balanced.,If the weak force had been a little bit different,,then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable,inside the hearts of stars,,and there would be none of that in the universe.,And I think that's,a wonderful and significant story.,50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,,because we didn't know it.,It makes me really feel that,that civilization --,which, as I say, if you believe,the scientific creation story,,has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,,and a few hydrogen atoms --,then I think, to me anyway,,it makes me feel incredibly valuable. 
 So that's the LHC.,The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,,going to write the next chapter of that book.,And I'm certainly looking forward with,immense excitement to it being turned on.,Thanks. 
 (Applause)One way to change our genes is to make new ones,,as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.,Another is to change our lifestyles.,And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,,that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.,When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,,your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.,But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.,Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago,can actually be measured now.,This was figured out by Robin Williams,a few years before the rest of us. 
 Now, there's some things that you can do,to make your brain grow new brain cells.,Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,,alcohol in moderation, stress management,and cannabinoids found in marijuana.,I'm just the messenger.,(Laughter),What were we just talking about?,(Laughter),And other things that can make it worse,,that can cause you to lose brain cells.,The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,,nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress. 
 Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle,,so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.,Your heart gets more blood flow.,We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.,That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,,after only a year become measurably less clogged.,And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,,the blue means no blood flow.,A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.,We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression,of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,,simply by making these changes.,We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited,70 percent in the group that made these changes,,whereas only nine percent in the comparison group. 
 These differences were highly significant.,Even your sexual organs get more blood flow,,so you increase sexual potency.,One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done,by the Department of Health Services,,showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,,can cause a heart attack or a stroke,,but it also causes impotence.,Half of guys who smoke are impotent.,How sexy is that? 
 Now we're also about to publish a study --,the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.,This is what's called a heat map --,and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.,And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --,in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,,turning off the disease-promoting genes. 
 And so these findings I think are really very powerful,,giving many people new hope and new choices.,And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,,that are giving you your genetic profiles,,are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?",Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes --,they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes,than we might have made otherwise,,we can actually change how our genes are expressed.,Thank you.,(Applause)How many of you have seennthe Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?,Any of you get really freaked out by that?,You might want to leave now. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is a vending machine for crows.,Over the past few days,nmany of you have been asking,,"How did you come to this?nHow did you get started doing this?",It started, as with many great ideas,,or many ideas you can'tnget rid of, anyway,,at a cocktail party.,About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktailnparty with a friend of mine.,We were sitting there,nand he was complaining about the crows,that were all over his yardnand making a big mess.,And he was telling menwe ought to eradicate these things,,kill them, because they're making a mess.,I said that was stupid,,maybe we should just train themnto do something useful.,And he said that was impossible. 
 And I'm sure I'm in good companynin finding that tremendously annoying,,when someone tells you it's impossible.,So I spent the next 10 years readingnabout crows in my spare time. 
 (Laughter) 
 And after 10 years of this, my wife said,,"You've got to do this thingnyou've been talking about,,and build the vending machine.",So I did.,But part of the reasonnI found this interesting is,,I started noticing that we're verynaware of all the species,that are going extinct on the planet,as a result of human habitation expansion,,and no one seems to be payingnattention to all the species,that are actually living;nthey're surviving.,And I'm talking specificallynabout synanthropic species,,which have adaptednspecifically for human ecologies,,species like ratsnand cockroaches and crows. 
 And as I started looking at them,nI was finding that they had hyper-adapted.,They'd become extremelynadept at living with us.,And in return, we just triednto kill them all the time. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in doing so, we werenbreeding them for parasitism.,We were giving them all sortsnof reasons to adapt new ways.,So, for example, ratsnare incredibly responsive breeders.,And cockroaches, as anyone who's triednto get rid of them knows,,have become really immunento the poisons that we're using.,So I thought, let's build somethingnthat's mutually beneficial;,something that we can both benefit from,,and find some way to makena new relationship with these species.,So I built the vending machine. 
 But the story of the vending machinenis a little more interesting,if you know more about crows.,It turns out, crows aren't justnsurviving with human beings;,they're actually thriving.,They're found everywherenon the planet except for the Arctic,and the southern tip of South America.,And in all that area,nthey're only rarely found breeding,more than five kilometersnaway from human beings.,So we may not think about them,nbut they're always around.,And not surprisingly,ngiven the human population growth,,more than half of the human populationnis living in cities now.,And out of those, nine-tenthsnof the human growth population,is occurring in cities.,We're seeing a population boom with crows.,So bird counts are indicating,that we might be seeing up to exponentialngrowth in their numbers.,So that's no great surprise. 
 But what was really interestingnto me was to find out,that the birds were adaptingnin a pretty unusual way.,And I'll give you an example of that.,This is Betty.nShe's a New Caledonian crow.,And these crows use sticks in the wild,to get insects and whatnotnout of pieces of wood.,Here, she's trying to getna piece of meat out of a tube.,But the researchers had a problem.,They messed up and leftnjust a stick of wire in there.,And she hadn't had the opportunitynto do this before.,You see, it wasn't working very well.,So she adapted. 
 Now, this is completely unprompted;nshe had never seen this done before.,No one taught her to bend this into a hook,or had shown her how it could happen.,But she did it all on her own.,So keep in mind --nshe's never seen this done. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. All right. 
 (Applause) 
 So that's the part wherenthe researchers freak out. 
 (Laughter) 
 It turns out,,we've been finding more and morenthat crows are really intelligent.,Their brains are in the same proportionnas chimpanzee brains are.,There's all kinds of anecdotes,for the different kindsnof intelligence they have.,For example, in Sweden,ncrows will wait for fishermen,to drop lines through holes in the ice.,And when the fishermen move off,,the crows fly down, reel up the lines,nand eat the fish or the bait.,It's pretty annoying for the fishermen. 
 On an entirely different tack,,at University of Washingtonna few years ago,,they were doing an experiment wherenthey captured some crows on campus.,Some students went out,nnetted some crows, brought them in,,weighed and measured them,nand let them back out again.,And they were entertained to discovernthat for the rest of the week,,whenever these particular studentsnwalked around campus,,these crows would caw at themnand run around,,and make their life kind of miserable. 
 (Laughter) 
 They were significantly less entertained,when this went on for the next week.,And the next month.,And after summer break.,Until they finally graduatednand left campus,,and -- glad to get away, I'm sure --,came back sometime later, and foundnthe crows still remembered them. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, the moral being: don't piss off crows.,So now, studentsnat the University of Washington,that are studying these crows,ndo so with a giant wig and a big mask. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's fairly interesting. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we know these crows are really smart,,but the more I dug into this,nthe more I found,that they actually havenan even more significant adaptation. 
 Video: Crows have becomenhighly skilled at making a living,in these new urban environments.,In this Japanese city, they have devisedna way of eating a food,that normally they can't manage:,drop it among the traffic.,The problem now is collecting the bits,nwithout getting run over.,Wait for the light to stop the traffic.,Then, collect your cracked nut in safety. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Joshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.,What's significant about thisnisn't that crows are using cars,to crack nuts.,In fact, that's old hat for crows.,This happened about 10 years ago,in a place called Sendai City,nat a driving school,in the suburbs of Tokyo.,And since that time,,all the crows in the neighborhoodnare picking up this behavior.,Now every crow within five kilometersnis standing by a sidewalk,,waiting to collect its lunch. 
 So they're learning from each other.nAnd research bears this out.,Parents seem to be teaching their young.,They learn from their peers,nthey learn from their enemies.,If I have a little extra time,,I'll tell you about a casenof crow infidelity,that illustrates that nicely.,The point being, they've developedncultural adaptation.,And as we heard yesterday,,that's the Pandora's boxnthat's getting human beings in trouble,,and we're starting to see it with them.,They're able to very quicklynand very flexibly adapt,to new challenges and new resourcesnin their environment,,which is really usefulnif you live in a city. 
 So we know that there's lots of crows.,We found out they're really smartnand they can teach each other.,When all this became clear,,I realized the only obvious thing to donis build a vending machine.,So that's what we did.,This is a vending machine for crows.,And it uses Skinnerian trainingnto shape their behavior over four stages.,It's pretty simple.,Basically, what happensnis that we put this out in a field,or someplace where there's lots of crows.,We put coins and peanutsnall around the base of the machine.,Crows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,,and get used to the machine being there.,Eventually, they eat all the peanuts.,Then they see peanutsnhere on the feeder tray,,and hop up and help themselves.,Then they leave, the machinenspits up more coins and peanuts,,and life is dandy if you're a crow --,you can come back anytimenand get yourself a peanut. 
 So when they get really used to that,nwe move on to the crows coming back.,Now they're used to the soundnof the machine;,they keep coming backnand digging out peanuts,from the pile of coins that's there.,When they get really happynabout this, we stymie them. 
 We move to the third stage,nwhere we only give them a coin.,Now, like most of us who have gottennused to a good thing,,this really pisses them off.,So they do what they do in naturenwhen they're looking for something:,sweep things out of the waynwith their beak.,They do that here, and that knocksnthe coins down the slot.,When that happens, they get a peanut.,This goes on for some time.,The crows learn thatnall they have to do is show up,,wait for the coin to come out,nput it in the slot,,then get their peanut. 
 When they're goodnand comfortable with that,,we move to the final stage,nwhere they show up and nothing happens.,This is where we see the differencenbetween crows and other animals.,Squirrels, for example, would show up,nlook for the peanut, go away.,Come back, look for the peanut, go away.,They do this maybe half a dozen timesnbefore they get bored,,and then they go off and play in traffic. 
 Crows, on the other hand,nshow up and they try and figure it out.,They know this machinenhas been messing with them,through three differentnstages of behavior. 
 (Laughter) 
 They figure there must be more to it.,So they poke at it and peck at it.,And eventually some crowngets a bright idea:,"Hey, there's lots of coinsnlying around from the first stage,,hops down, picks it up, drops itnin the slot, and we're off to the races.,That crow enjoys a temporarynmonopoly on peanuts,,until his friends figure outnhow to do it, and then there we go. 
 So, what's significant about this to me,isn't that we can train crowsnto pick up peanuts.,Mind you, there's 216 millionndollars' worth of change lost every year,,but I'm not sure I can dependnon that ROI from crows. 
 (Laughter) 
 Instead, I think we should lookna little bit larger.,I think crows can be trainednto do other things.,For example, why not train themnto pick up garbage after stadium events?,Or find expensive componentsnfrom discarded electronics?,Or maybe do search and rescue?,The main point of all this for me is,,we can find mutually beneficialnsystems for these species.,We can find ways to interactnwith these other species,that doesn't involve exterminating them,,but involves finding an equilibriumnwith them that's a useful balance. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)So, can we dare to be optimistic?,Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion",is that a billion people have been stuck living,in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,,and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.,And so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?",It's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?",That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development. 
 What I'm going to offer you is a recipe,,a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,,which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.,Compassion, because a billion people are living in societies,that have not offered credible hope.,That is a human tragedy.,Enlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence,continues for another 40 years,,combined with social integration globally,,it will build a nightmare for our children.,We need compassion to get ourselves started,,and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.,That's the alliance that changes the world. 
 So, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?,What can we actually do?,Well, a good guide is to think,,"What did we do last time the rich world got serious,about developing another region of the world?",That gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,,except you have to go back quite a long time.,The last time the rich world got serious,about developing another region was in the late 1940s.,The rich world was you, America,,and the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.,That was post-War Europe. 
 Why did America get serious?,It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.,It was that you knew you had to,,because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe,was falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.,Europe had to be dragged into economic development. 
 So, what did you do, last time you got serious?,Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.,That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.,But what else did you do?,Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.,Before the war, America had been highly protectionist.,After the war, you opened your markets to Europe,,you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,,and you institutionalized that trade liberalization,through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.,So, total reversal of trade policy. 
 Did you do anything else?,Yes, you totally reversed your security policy.,Before the war, your security policy had been isolationist.,After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe,for over 40 years.,So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?,Yes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" --,national sovereignty.,Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct,that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.,After the war, you found the United Nations,,you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,,you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --,all systems for mutual government support.,That is still the waterfront of effective policies:,aid, trade, security, governments.,Of course, the details of policy are going to be different,,because the challenge is different.,It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence,for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.,Is that easier or harder?,We need to be at least as serious as we were then. 
 Now, today I'm going to take just one of those four.,I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,,the one that's just motherhood and apple pie --,governments, mutual systems of support for governments --,and I'm going to show you one idea,in how we could do something to strengthen governance,,and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.,The opportunity we're going to look to,is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,,and that is the commodity booms.,The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money,into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.,Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,,but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.,Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;,Ghana has discovered oil;,Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.,So, a mass of new discoveries.,Between them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.,Just to give you one example:,Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.,The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.,So, the flow of resources from the commodity booms,to the bottom billion are without precedent.,So there's the optimism. 
 The question is, how is it going to help their development?,It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.,Will it be taken?,So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done,since "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.,I've looked to see what is the relationship between,higher commodity prices of exports,,and the growth of commodity-exporting countries.,And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world,for the last 40 years,,and looked to see what the relationship is.,And the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great.,In fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.,You get more money because your terms of trade have improved,,but also that drives up output across the board.,So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.,And how about the long run?,Come back 15 years later.,Well, the short run, it's hunky dory,,but the long run, it's humpty dumpty.,You go up in the short run, but then most societies,historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.,That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;,it's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,,for growth of an increase in prices. 
 So, what goes wrong? Why is there this "resource curse," as it's called?,And again, I've looked at that, and it turns out,that the critical issue is the level of governance,,the initial level of economic governance,,when the resource booms accrue.,In fact, if you've got good enough governance,,there is no resource boom.,You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.,That's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.,The resource curse is entirely confined to countries,below a threshold of governance.,They still go up in the short run.,That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.,The best growth rates they've had -- ever.,And the question is whether the short run will persist.,And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.,It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil. 
 So, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,,and below which you go down.,Just to benchmark that threshold,,it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.,So, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?,Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,,and that is the spread of democracy.,So I thought, well, maybe that is the thing,which has transformed governance in the bottom billion.,Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.,So, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects --,and unfortunately, they're adverse.,Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies. 
 At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but --,(Laughter),-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.,Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy:,there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,,and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.,It turns out that electoral competition is the thing,that's doing the damage with democracy,,whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.,And so, what the countries of the bottom billion need,is very strong checks and balances.,They haven't got them.,They got instant democracy in the 1990s:,elections without checks and balances. 
 How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?,In all the societies of the bottom billion,,there are intense struggles to do just that.,The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,,which will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points,that need to be taken in order,to harness these resource revenues.,We know these international standards work,because we've already got one.,It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.,That is the very simple idea that governments should report,to their citizens what revenues they have.,No sooner was it proposed,than reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.,Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked.,People wanted to know what their government was getting,in terms of revenue. 
 So, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?,I can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.,The first is how to take the resources out of the ground --,the economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground,and putting assets on top of the ground.,And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.,You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,,how they've been sold over the last 40 years?,A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.,And that's great for the company,,and it's quite often great for the minister --,(Laughter),-- and it's not great for their country.,There's a very simple institutional technology,which can transform that,,and it's called verified auctions.,The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth,is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.,And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights,to third-generation mobile phones,by working out what those rights were worth.,They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.,Just in time, a set of economists got there and said,,"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value.",It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.,If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,,think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.,(Laughter),When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,,the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team,to give expertise on how to conduct auctions. 
 There are five such decision points;,each one needs an international standard.,If we could do it, we would change the world.,We would be helping the reformers in these societies,,who are struggling for change.,That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,,but we can help the people in these societies,who are struggling and usually failing,,because the odds are so stacked against them.,And yet, we've not got these rules.,If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules,is zilch -- nothing.,Why on Earth are they not there?,I realized that the reason they're not there,is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,,politicians will get away with gestures.,That unless we have an informed society,,what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:,things that look good, but don't work.,And so I realized we had to go through the business,of building an informed citizenry. 
 That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,,and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.,(Laughter).,However, I have to say, the process of communication,does not come naturally to me.,This is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.,I grew up in a culture of self-effacement.,My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,,and the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic --,(Laughter),-- but his arguments are compelling.",(Laughter),(Applause),If you agree with that sentiment,,and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,,you will realize that I need you.,Please, become ambassadors.,Thank you.,(Applause)I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.,We all know the Earth is in trouble.,We have now entered in the 6X,,the sixth major extinction on this planet.,I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms --,otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --,(Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote,,would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?,I think that vote is occurring right now. 
 I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,,using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.,The mycelium infuses all landscapes,,it holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.,This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.,They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.,They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.,We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer,of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --,so the mycelium is the mother,that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees,to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs. 
 Dusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.,I'm in love with the old-growth forest,,and I'm a patriotic American because we have those.,Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.,And frankly, I face a big obstacle.,When I mention mushrooms to somebody,,they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,,their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.,So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.,We call it mycophobia,,the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi. 
 Mushrooms are very fast in their growth.,Day 21, day 23, day 25.,Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics.,In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.,A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists,published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --,a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.,We share in common the same pathogens.,Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria,,and so our best antibiotics come from fungi.,But here is a mushroom that's past its prime.,After they sporulate, they do rot.,But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes,that occur on rotting mushrooms,are essential for the health of the forest.,They give rise to the trees,,they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium. 
 And so we see a mushroom here sporulating.,And the spores are germinating,,and the mycelium forms and goes underground.,In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.,My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium. 
 This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.,And notice that as the mycelium grows,,it conquers territory and then it begins the net.,I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,,I have thousands of electron micrographs,,and when I'm staring at the mycelium,,I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.,We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.,It inhales oxygen, just like we do.,But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.,And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.,And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,,and as they fuse soils, they absorb water.,These are little wells.,And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.,And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,,but sets up a microbial universe,that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms. 
 I first proposed, in the early 1990s,,that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.,When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.,And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,,because of the nodes of crossing --,Internet engineers maybe call them hot points --,there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.,The mycelium is sentient.,It knows that you are there.,When you walk across landscapes,,it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.,So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet,is an inevitable consequence,of a previously proven, biologically successful model.,The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,,and we now, being the top organism on this planet,,are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere. 
 Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.,I believe matter begets life;,life becomes single cells; single cells become strings;,strings become chains; chains network.,And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe. 
 Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.,They came to land 1.3 billion years ago,,and plants followed several hundred million years later.,How is that possible?,It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,,and many other acids and enzymes,,pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals,and forming calcium oxalates.,Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.,Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.,So, fungi and mycelium,sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.,And all sorts of other oxalates,are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals,that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix. 
 This was first discovered in 1859.,This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.,This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.,420 million years ago, this organism existed.,It was called Prototaxites.,Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.,The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.,Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,,published an article in the Journal of Geology,this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,,a giant mushroom.,Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.,All across most land masses.,And these existed for tens of millions of years. 
 Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward --,65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --,we had an asteroid impact.,The Earth was struck by an asteroid,,a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.,Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.,Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,,because fungi do not need light.,More recently, at Einstein University,,they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,,much like plants use light.,So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,,I think, is a forgone conclusion,,at least in my own mind. 
 The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.,I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:,2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.,The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.,How is it that this organism can be so large,,and yet be one cell wall thick,,whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?,The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --,it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.,We were involved with several experiments.,I'm going to show you six, if I can,,solutions for helping to save the world.,Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.,There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:,one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;,one pile was treated with bacteria;,and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.,The mycelium absorbs the oil.,The mycelium is producing enzymes --,peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.,These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.,So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,,and then, when we returned six weeks later,,all the tarps were removed,,all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.,We came back to our pile, it was covered,with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,,and the color changed to a light form.,The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons,into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars. 
 Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.,They're very large.,They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.,But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.,They sporulated, the spores attract insects,,the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.,Birds then came, bringing in seeds,,and our pile became an oasis of life.,Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,,and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --,went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.,The last image we don't have.,The entire pile was a green berm of life.,These are gateway species,,vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities. 
 So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn --,and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,,you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream,from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,,or a factory with chemical toxins,,and it leads to habitat restoration.,So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,,and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.,And I'll show you a graph here.,This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.,There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,,and 10 to the third power is around 1,000.,In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species,reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.,Think of the implications.,This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --,and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year. 
 So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.,This is my wife Dusty,,with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.,It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest,that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.,as a treatment against consumption.,This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,,northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.,May not seem that large --,let's get closer.,This is extremely rare fungus.,Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --,we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.,We found one sample to be able to get into culture. 
 Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest,I think is absolutely critical for human health.,I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.,We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,,and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.,And a few years ago,,we received these results.,We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms,that were highly active against poxviruses.,Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert,of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds,that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.,10 or greater are considered to be very active.,Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range.,There's a vetted press release that you can read --,it's vetted by DOD --,if you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox.",Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview. 
 So, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.,And so, for the first time, I am showing this.,We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms,highly active against flu viruses.,Here's the selectivity index numbers --,against pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,,compared to the ribavirin controls,,we have an extraordinarily high activity.,And we're using a natural extract,within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.,We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --,as well as flu B viruses.,So then we tried a blend,,and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,,and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.,(Applause),I then think that we can make the argument,that we should save the old-growth forest,as a matter of national defense.,(Applause) 
 I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi --,fungi that kill insects.,Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.,So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies,with metarhizium species of a group of fungi,that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.,I did something that nobody else had done.,I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.,These are spores -- this is in their spores.,I was able to morph the culture,into a non-sporulating form.,And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars,specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.,But the insects aren't stupid,,and they would avoid the spores when they came close,,and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.,And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,,I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants,were making debris fields, every day,,in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,,because there's no spores.,They gave it to the queen.,One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever. 
 And then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death --,the mycelium is consumed by the ants,,they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.,(Laughter),Now after sporulation, the spores repel.,So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.,So, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.,And so my house came down, I received my first patent,against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.,Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold,,we can steer insects to different directions.,This has huge implications.,I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.,It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.,It covers over 200,000 species.,This is the most disruptive technology --,I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --,that they have ever witnessed.,This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.,You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,,because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,,prior to sporulation, attract the very insects,that are otherwise repelled by those spores. 
 And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.,The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --,you add soil, you add water,,you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,,like of the Agarikon mushroom.,The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.,And then you put tree seeds in here,,and then you end up growing -- potentially --,an old-growth forest from a cardboard box. 
 I want to reinvent the delivery system,,and the use of cardboard around the world,,so they become ecological footprints.,If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,,you could make it interactive, zip code specific --,where people could join together,,and through satellite imaging systems,,through Virtual Earth or Google Earth,,you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered,by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes. 
 You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,,you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community --,corns, beans and squash and onions.,I took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could --,and I ended up growing a seed garden.,Then you harvest the seeds --,and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this --,and then you're harvesting the seed garden.,Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.,I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.,Now, three corncobs, no other grain --,lots of mushrooms begin to form.,Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank,,and so this population will be shut down.,But watch what happens here.,The mushrooms then are harvested,,but very importantly,,the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.,And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?,And we came up with Econol. 
 Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary --,and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.,But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,,and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent,about the generation of fuels.,So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.,These are a species that we need to join with.,I think engaging mycelium can help save the world.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all,love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.,But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.,So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect --,the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years --,that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],,that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent. 
 Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.,So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.,And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it,,but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world,has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way,,and that's one of the main parts of my work.,So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now,,we've been engaged in a field called active music.,What are all the possible ways that we can think of,to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience,,not just listening, but making music? 
 And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers --,we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince,,orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors,built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.,And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling,,I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra,,or into something that nobody has ever heard before. 
 When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make,wonderful instruments like that for everybody,,people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?,So, we've made a whole series of instruments.,One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.,It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments,,all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.,So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music,,use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound,,touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.,And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in,,to try these instruments and then collaborate with us,to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.,We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna,,where we built a museum around it. 
 And that led to something which you probably do know.,Guitar Hero came out of our lab,,and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab,are proof that if you make the right kind of interface,,people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music,,and playing it over and over and over again. 
 So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg,,because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want,to make music in something like Guitar Hero.,And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.,It's very, very important.,Music can change your life, more than almost anything.,It can change the way you communicate with others,,it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying,to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.,We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project,called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive,,but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music,,want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works,,how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments,,like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,,Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm,,and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends,,who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing --,and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color,to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it,,you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button,,it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces. 
 We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids,around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.,So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities,in a much broader context, for all kinds of people,who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.,So, one of the growing fields that we're working on,at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.,A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called,"Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.,If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself,,and he details his whole career of looking at and observing,incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations. 
 So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing,that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.,Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones,,you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror,,or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music,that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that,you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.,Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes,,movement to people with Parkinson's disease.,It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things. 
 So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles,and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.,And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.,One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.,It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago,we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.,This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital,,so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.,It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most,and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.,I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.,Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.,It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms,,but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.,To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it,,to experiment with it, to make their own music.,So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.,Everybody can experience music in a profound way,,we just have to make different tools. 
 The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically,,I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have,of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although,strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.,If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you,,I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words,,more personal things, perhaps deeper things. 
 I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples,of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have,,from ourselves to the outside world.,The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called,Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera,,one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.,And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.,So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment,,actually into a series of books.,So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.,The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera,and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy. 
 And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others,,to the people we love, and what we can't.,Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument,,like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier,,but it's actually a robotic music instrument.,So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings,,each string is controlled with a little robotic element --,either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings,,acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.,These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers,,and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.,They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now,at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.,They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope,,not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.,And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.,Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality. 
 The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.,Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound,,and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls,,which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared,,but the whole physical environment becomes this person.,This is how he's chosen to represent himself.,The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.,And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.,This is a sneak preview.,This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it,,another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy,through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.,But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces,,as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives,to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.,So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're,thinking of as personal opera. 
 And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?,Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma,or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable,for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.,But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted,to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work,,to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?,I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments. 
 And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage,,so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.,So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from,the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan,,thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today,all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.,This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that,,because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.,So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are? 
 Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.,I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct,my own music with this new software. 
 Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan. (Applause) 
 So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago,,when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic,,did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out,he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.,He's very shy, too.,So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been,a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.,He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area --,mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.,And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music,technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.,What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan,be able easily to make his own pieces,,but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.,So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work? 
 Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion,following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive,person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face,,it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform,one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense. 
 So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance,,with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that,,to be able to perform his piece of music.,So, the process and the technology --,basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know,,we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.,We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to,with his speaking controller.,And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know,,the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking;,in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making. 
 But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part,,where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital,extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?,What's useful to him as an expressive motion?,You know, what's his metaphor for performance?,What types of things does he find,important to control and convey in a piece of music?,So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology,was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.,And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies --,they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.,But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers,that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?,Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship,to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know,,with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process,to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.,And so that's what we'll do today. 
 TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone,about what you're going to play now? 
 DE: This is "My Eagle Song.",TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".,In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece,,completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.,So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.,He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact. 
 (Laughter) 
 TM: He's really modest, too.,So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.,He can place those exactly where he wants.,Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window,,draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore,,you can see it also, you can see where the sections are,,something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end,up with a big bang at the end. 
 So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says,,we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.,It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements,,it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.,And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.,We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.,But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly,the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic,movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed. 
 I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what,Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement,,that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise,,very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.,So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is,the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.,So, are we ready Adam? 
 AB: Yeah. 
 TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.,(Applause) 
 TM: Bravo.,(Applause)I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,,so I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.,So, I'm going to, like, go through some slides,from way back when,,and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here. 
 So, basically it all began with,this whole idea of a computer.,Who has a computer? Yeah.,O.K., so, everyone has a computer.,Even a mobile phone, it's a computer.,And -- anyone remember this workbook,,"Instant Activities for Your Apple" --,free poster in each book?,This was how computing began.,Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software.,You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in,,and it would do absolutely nothing at all.,So, you had to program it,,and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.,I mean, this was great.,It's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.,It's such a great way to --,I mean, they should make Java books like this,,and we've have no problem learning a program.,But this was a great, grand time of the computer,,when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.,And, you see,,this era coincided with my own childhood. 
 I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.,Who of you grew up in a family business,,suffered the torture? Yes, yes.,The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?,It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu;,it was a family business.,And my mother was a kind of a designer, also.,She'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking,,and it would confuse the customers,,because they all thought it was a restaurant.,A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever.,But, anyway, that's where I grew up,,in this little tofu factory in Seattle,,and it was kind of like this:,a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture. 
 That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really:,he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.,Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here,,and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu,,because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,,and so you have to have heavy stuff,to push out the liquid and make it hard.,Tofu comes out in these big batches,,and my father would sort of cut them by hand.,I can't tell you -- family business story: you'd understand this --,my father was the most sincere man possible.,He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,,slipped, broke his arm, rushed out:,he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway.,So, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken,for two weeks in the store, and that week --,now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I,had to do everything.,And that was torture, real torture.,Because, you see, we'd seen my father,taking the big block of tofu and cutting it,,like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow.,So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this.,Bad blocks. But anyways,,the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.,And because working in a store was so hard,,I liked going to school; it was like heaven.,And I was really good at school. 
 So, when I got to MIT, you know,,as most of you who are creatives,,your parents all told you not to be creative, right?,So, same way, you know,,I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's --,John's good at math.,I went to MIT, did my math,,but I had this wonderful opportunity,,because computers had just become visual.,The Apple -- Macintosh just came out;,I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.,And it was a time when a guy who, kind of,,could cross the two sides --,it was a good time. 
 And so, I remember that my first major piece of software,was on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker.,I made a desktop publishing system way back when,,and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to --,oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.,And the problem when you're younger --,for all you students out there --,is, your head gets kind of big really easy.,And when I was making icons, I was, like,,the icon master,,and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know.,And then luckily, you know,,I had the fortune of going to something called a library,,and in the library I came upon this very book.,I found this book. It's called,,"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.,It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this.,It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand,,who was one of the greatest graphic designers,,and also a great writer as well.,And when I saw this man's work,,I realized how bad I was at design,,or whatever I called it back then,,and I suddenly had a kind of career goal,,kind of in hot pursuit. 
 So I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished.,I got my masters,nand then went to art school after that.,And just began to design stuff,,like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus -- whatever I could get a handle on:,sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever.,And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?,Remember that moment -- publishing your designs?,Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it?,So, I was published, you know,,so, wow, my design's in a book, you know?,After that, things kind of got strange,,and I got thinking about the computer,,because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me.,I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand,was a kind of crusty designer,,you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread?,You know, he wrote in one of his books:,"A Yale student once said,,'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.',Design schools take heed.",This is in the '80s,,in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.,A very difficult time, actually.,And this to me was an important message from Rand. 
 And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.,This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.,I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.,It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw.,It was very hard to make this, actually.,It took a month to make this part.,And then I thought, what if I added this feature,,where I can say, this point,,you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.,So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability,with a little control there on the dial,,and I can sort of watch it flip around.,And this is in 1993.,And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.,They were saying, Why's it moving?,They were saying, Make it stop now.,Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.,And he says, Well, when's it going to stop?,And I said, Never.,And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.,I started studying this whole idea,,of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.,It's not like print. It's not like video.,It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium.,So, I went off with this,,and began to look for things even more. 
 And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people.,This is actually bad: human experiments.,I would do these things where I'd have students become pens:,there's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.,And someone sits down and draws a picture.,They're laughing because he said,,draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.,See, humans don't know how to take orders;,the computer's so good at it.,This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once:,you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.,And so began to have multiple pens on the page --,again, hard to do with our hands.,And then someone discovered this "a-ha moment",where you could use coordinate systems.,We thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen.,In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.,It became computerish; we began to think computerish --,the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation. 
 And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people,,called a human-powered computer.,So, this happened in 1993.,Sound down, please.,It's a computer where the people are the parts.,I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU,,a graphics card, a memory system.,They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.,It's put inside the computer.,And that little program's on that cardboard disk.,So, she wears the disk,,and reads the data off the sectors of the disk,,and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.,And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,,I had a moment of -- what is it called? --,the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast.,This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard,,and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.,And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,,if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen.,On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.,On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour,for the mouse cursor to change.,To give you a sense of the speed, the scale:,the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.? 
 And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.,This is something I did for Sony in 1996.,It was three Sony "H" devices,that responded to sound.,So, if you talk into the mike,,you'll hear some music in your headphones;,if you talk in the phone, then video would happen.,So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways,with this kind of mixture of skills.,I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.,And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects. 
 And also, one thing I realized is that,I like to make things.,We like to make things. It's fun to make things.,And so I never developed the ability to have a staff.,I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand --,these sort of broken hands.,And these hands were influenced,by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.,This guy was my kind of like mentor.,He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.,He's the guy that kind of discovered me,,and kind of got me going in digital media.,He was such an inspirational guy.,I remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m.,,and then he'd show up from some client meeting.,He'd come in and say, you know,,If I am here, everything is okay.,And you'd feel so much better, you know.,And I'll never forget how, like, but -- I'll never forget how, like,,he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm.,He went into a coma.,And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink,,and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow --,how fragile is this thing we're wearing,,this body and mind we're wearing,,and so I thought, How do you go for it more?,How do you take that time you have left and go after it?,So, Naomi was pivotal in that. 
 And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.,This was a moment where I was thinking about,,so, you have a computer program,,it responds to motion -- X and Y --,and I realized that each computer program,has all these images inside the program.,So, if you can see here, you know,,that program you're seeing in the corner,,if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once.,It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with.,We're so used to working in one vector.,This is all at the same time.,The computer lives in so many dimensions.,And also, at the same time I was frustrated,,because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere,,and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know,,and this is, like, in the late 1990s,,and this is in Basel,,a great graphic design school.,And here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy,,kind of, dark computer room.,And I began to wonder, Is this the goal?,Is this what we want, you know? 
 And also, I began to be fascinated by machines --,you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel.,I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive --,this is, like, a touch screen --,and I noticed how you can only touch five places,,and so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?",became a question. And also, the sound:,I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone.,You get it? No? O.K.,And also, I discovered in Logan airport,,this was, like, calling out to me.,Do you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan. 
 So, I was wondering, like,,what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?,It didn't make any sense.,So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects,made of old computers from my basement.,I made -- I took my old Macintoshes,and made different objects out of them from Tokyo.,I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves,,so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots.,I made this series of works.,They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle,as a kind of display that's sort of thinking,,I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.,And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. 
 I began to be fascinated by plastic,,so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks,perfectly optically transparent,,as a kind of release of stress.,Because of that, I became interested in blue tape,,so in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.,I made a whole installation out of blue tape -- blue painters' tape.,And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me,,so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think,,Well, what else is there in life?,And so computers, as you know,,these big computers, there are now tiny computers.,They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers,,I began to program one-chip computers,and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.,I began to make LED sculptures,that would live inside little boxes out of MDF.,This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.,Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.,This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp:,it's sort of a plastic rice lamp;,it's very friendly.,I did a show in London last year made out of iPods --,I used iPods as a material.,So I took 16 iPod Nanos,and made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.,Recently, this is for Reebok.,I've done shoes for Reebok as well,,as a kind of a hobby for apparel. 
 So anyways, there are all these things you can do,,but the thing I love the most is to,experience, taste the world.,The world is just so tasty.,We think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are.,No, they're all out there.,So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,,actually, around the Louvre area.,This I found, where nature had made a picture for me.,This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature.,In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.,We all are creative people.,We have this gene defect in our mind.,We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.,It's the forever-always-on museum.,This is from the Cape last year.,I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design,,which we know as circle-triangle-square.,It's everywhere on the beach, I discovered.,I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.,I put these all back, by the way.,And I also discovered how .,some rocks are twins separated at birth.,This is also out there, you know.,I'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?,I brought you guys together again. 
 So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T,occurring in simplicity and complexity.,My alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment --,a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment --,where I thought, Whoa! I have to do this.,And I went after it with passion.,However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose --,going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy,,because the letters had told me, MIT forever.,But I discovered in the French word raison d'être.,I was, like, aha, wait a second.,And there RISD appeared.,And so I realized it was O.K. to go. 
 So, I'm going to RISD, actually.,Who's a RISD alum out there?,RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD.,I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center -- Art Center is good, too.,RISD is kind of my new kind of passion,,and I'll tell you a little bit about that.,So, RISD is --,I was outside RISD,,and some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,,Wow, RISD wants to know what itself is.,And I have no idea what RISD should be, actually,,or what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that,although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much.,It's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever.,People say,,Are you going to bring RISD into the future?,And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. 
 There's my perspective. Because in reality,,the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.,It's about how to make it more humane again.,And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA.,It's a strange exuberance,about materials, about the world:,a fascination that I think the world needs,quite very much right now.,So, thank you everyone.My work is play.,And I play when I design.,I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure,that I actually do that,,and the definition of play,,number one, was engaging in a childlike,activity or endeavor,,and number two was gambling.,And I realize I do both,when I'm designing.,I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.,And I think that if you're not,,there's probably something inherently wrong,with the structure or the situation you're in,,if you're a designer.,But the serious part is what threw me,,and I couldn't quite get a handle,on it until I remembered an essay.,And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.,It was written by Russell Baker,,who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.,He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you,this essay,,or an excerpt from it,because it really hit home for me.,Here is a letter of friendly advice. 
 Be serious, it says.,What it means, of course, is, be solemn.,Being solemn is easy.,Being serious is hard.,Children almost always begin by being serious,,which is what makes them so entertaining,when compared with adults as a class.,Adults, on the whole, are solemn.,In politics, the rare candidate who is serious,,like Adlai Stevenson,,is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.,That's because it is hard for most people,to recognize seriousness, which is rare,,but more comfortable to endorse solemnity,,which is commonplace.,Jogging, which is commonplace,,and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.,Poker is serious.,Washington, D.C. is solemn.,New York is serious.,Going to educational conferences to tell you anything,about the future is solemn.,Taking a long walk by yourself,,during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,,is serious. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition,of solemnity or seriousness to design,,it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.,Solemn design is often important and very effective design.,Solemn design is also socially correct,,and is accepted by appropriate audiences.,It's what right-thinking designers,and all the clients are striving for.,Serious design, serious play,,is something else.,For one thing, it often happens,spontaneously, intuitively,,accidentally or incidentally.,It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,,or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.,But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy,parts of human behavior that,don't really make any sense. 
 Serious design is imperfect.,It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being,the first of its kind.,Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful,from the solemn point of view.,That's because the art of serious play,is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.,Perfection happens during solemn play.,Now, I always saw design careers,like surreal staircases.,If you look at the staircase, you'll see,that in your 20s the risers are very high,and the steps are very short,,and you make huge discoveries.,You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.,That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,,and so that anything you do is a learning experience,and you're just jumping right up there.,As you get older, the risers get shallower,and the steps get wider,,and you start moving along at a slower pace,because you're making fewer discoveries.,And as you get older and more decrepit,,you sort of inch along on this,sort of depressing, long staircase,,leading you into oblivion. 
 (Laughter) 
 I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.,I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more,that I'm solemn when I don't have to be.,And in my 35 years of working experience,,I think I was really serious four times.,And I'm going to show them to you now,,because they came out of very specific conditions.,It's great to be a kid.,Now, when I was in my early 20s,,I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records,,and I had no idea what a great job I had.,I thought everybody had a job like that.,And what --,the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,,what was going on around me,and the things that came at the time I walked into design,were the enemy.,I really, really, really hated,the typeface Helvetica.,I thought the typeface Helvetica,was the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,,really repressive typeface,,and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.,And when I was in,my college days,,this was the sort of design,that was fashionable and popular.,This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,,but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,,and I made parodies about it.,I just thought it was, you know, completely boring. 
 (Laughter) 
 So -- so, my goal in life,was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.,And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica,was actually kind of hard because you had to find it.,And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design,in the early 70s. There weren't --,there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.,You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.,You had to go places and find the stuff.,And what I responded to was, you know,,Art Nouveau, or deco,,or Victorian typography,,or things that were just completely not Helvetica.,And I taught myself design this way,,and this was sort of my early years,,and I used these things,in really goofy ways,on record covers and in my design.,I wasn't educated. I just sort of,put these things together.,I mixed up Victorian designs with pop,,and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.,And I made these very lush,,very elaborate record covers,,not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist --,because I didn't know what those things were.,I just hated Helvetica. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that kind of passion,drove me into very serious play,,a kind of play I could never do now,because I'm too well-educated.,And there's something wonderful about,that form of youth,,where you can let yourself,grow and play, and be,really a brat, and then accomplish things.,By the end of the '70s, actually,,the stuff became known.,I mean, these covers appeared all over the world,,and they started winning awards,,and people knew them.,And I was suddenly a post-modernist,,and I began a career as -- in my own business.,And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,,but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.,I didn't do what I think,was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.,I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,,turning out these sorts of designs,that I was expected to do,because that's who I was,,and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn,to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again. 
 So, here was the second condition,for which I think I accomplished some serious play.,There's a Paul Newman movie,that I love called "The Verdict.",I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.,And in the movie, he plays,a down-and-out lawyer,who's become an ambulance chaser.,And he's taken on --,he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handle,that's sort of an easy deal,,and in the midst of trying to connect the deal,,he starts to empathize,and identify with his client,,and he regains his morality and purpose,,and he goes on to win the case.,And in the depth of despair,,in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off,,and he needs this case,,he needs to win this case so badly.,There's a shot of Paul Newman alone,,in his office, saying,,"This is the case. There are no other cases.,This is the case. There are no other cases.",And in that moment of,desire and focus,,he can win.,And that is a wonderful,position to be in to create some serious play.,And I had that moment in 1994,when I met a theater director,named George Wolfe,,who was going to have me design,an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,,then known,,and then became the Public Theater.,And I began getting immersed,in this project,in a way I never was before. 
 This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.,This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.,So, this is sort of a comment on the time.,And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.,They had no logo and no identity,,but they had these very iconic posters,painted by Paul Davis.,And George Wolf had taken over from another director,and he wanted to change the theater,,and he wanted to make it urban and loud,and a place that was inclusive.,So, drawing on my love of typography,,I immersed myself into this project.,And what was different about it was the totality of it,,was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place,in a way I had never done before,,where every aspect --,the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was --,was designed by me.,There was no format.,There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.,I literally for three years made everything --,every scrap of paper, everything online,,that this theater did.,And it was the only job,,even though I was doing other jobs.,I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't,with a client since.,It enabled me to really express myself and grow.,And I think that you know,when you're going to be given this position,,and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity,,it's the moment of serious play. 
 I did these things, and I still do them.,I still work for the Public Theater.,I'm on their board, and,I still am involved with it.,The high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996,,two years after I designed it,,which was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign,that was all over New York.,But something happened to it, and what happened to it was,,it became very popular.,And that is a kiss of death for something serious,because it makes it solemn.,And what happened was,that New York City, to a degree,,ate my identity,because people began to copy it.,Here's an ad in the New York Times,somebody did for a play called "Mind Games.",Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,,and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,,which meant I had to change it.,So, I changed it so that every season was different,,and I continued to do these posters,,but they never had the seriousness,of the first identity,because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft,of everything being the same thing.,Now -- and I think since the Public Theater,,I must have done more than a dozen,cultural identities for major institutions,,and I don't think I ever -- I ever,grasped that seriousness again --,I do them for very big, important institutions,in New York City. 
 The institutions are solemn,,and so is the design.,They're better crafted than the Public Theater was,,and they spend more money on them, but I think,that that moment comes and goes.,The best way to accomplish serious design --,which I think we all have the opportunity to do --,is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.,That doesn't happen very often,,but it happened to me in the year 2000,,when for some reason or another,,a whole pile of different architects,started to ask me to design,the insides of theaters with them,,where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.,I'd never done this kind of work before.,I didn't know how to read an architectural plan,,I didn't know what they were talking about,,and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job --,a single job -- could go on for four years,because I was used to immediacy in graphic design,,and that kind of attention to detail,was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD. 
 So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go,,but I fell in love with this process,of actually integrating graphics into architecture,because I didn't know what I was doing.,I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?",New Yorkers look at their feet.,And then I found that actors and actresses,actually take their cues from the floor,,so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems,began to make sense.,They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.,They ran around corners,,they went up sides of buildings,,and they melded into the architecture.,This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,,and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel,and backlit with fiber optics.,And the architect, Jim Polshek,,essentially gave me a canvas,to play typography out on.,And it was serious play.,This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,,made out of completely inexpensive materials.,Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.,Things I never did before, built before.,I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.,Donors' walls made out of Lucite.,And then, inexpensive signage. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think my favorite of these,was this little job in Newark, New Jersey.,It's a performing arts school.,This is the building that -- they had no money,,and they had to recast it, and they said,,if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?,And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said,,Well, I think we can paint it.,And we did. And it was play.,And there's the building. Everything was painted --,typography over the whole damn thing,,including the air conditioning ducts.,I hired guys who paint flats,fixed on the sides of garages,to do the painting on the building, and they loved it.,They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously.,They used to climb up on the building and call me,and tell me that they had to correct my typography --,that my spacing was wrong, and they moved it,,and they did wonderful things with it.,They were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful. 
 By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters,my work had begun to become accepted.,People wanted it in big, expensive places.,And that began to make it solemn.,Bloomberg was all about numbers,,and we did big numbers through the space,and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED,that my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.,But it became the end,of the seriousness of the play,,and it started to, once again, become solemn.,This is a current project,in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,,where I got to be goofy.,I was invited to design,a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,,and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.,I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?,A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place,,it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be? 
 So I had to actually give a presentation,to a city council,and neighborhood constituents,,and I went to Pittsburgh and I said,,"You know, really what you have here,are all these underpasses,that separate the neighborhood from the center of town.,Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?",So I began doing this crazy presentation,of these installations --,potential installations -- on,these underpass bridges,,and stood up in front of the city council --,and was a little bit scared,,I have to admit.,But I was so utterly unqualified for this project,,and so utterly ridiculous,,and ignored the brief so desperately,that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness,,just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.,And this is the bridge they're actually,painting up and preparing as we speak.,It will change every six months, and it will become an art installation,in the North Side of Pittsburgh,,and it will probably become a landmark in the area. 
 John Hockenberry told you a bit about,my travail with Citibank,,that is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.,And I actually am amused by them and like them,,and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation,they actually keep their graphics very nice.,I drew the logo for Citibank,on a napkin in the first meeting.,That was the play part of the job.,And then I spent a year,going to long, tedious,,boring meetings,,trying to sell this logo through,to a huge corporation,to the point of tears.,I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.,We made idiotic presentations,showing how the Citi logo made sense,,and how it was really derived from an umbrella,,and we made animations of these things,,and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.,And it was worth it, because they bought this thing,,and it played out on such a grand scale,,and it's so internationally recognizable,,but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.,As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo,until Fallon put it on,its very good "Live Richly" campaign,,and then everybody accepted it all over the world. 
 So during this time I needed,some kind of counterbalance,for this crazy, crazy existence,of going to these long, idiotic meetings.,And I was up in my country house,,and for some reason, I began painting,these very big, very involved,,laborious, complicated,maps of the entire world,,and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in,,and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot,,and completely controlling the information,,and going totally and completely nuts with it.,They would take me about six months initially,,but then I started getting faster at it.,Here's the United States.,Every single city of the United States is on here.,And it hung for about eight months,at the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it,,and they would point to a part of the map,and they'd say, "Oh, I've been here.",And, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.,(Laughter),But what I liked about it was,,I was controlling my own idiotic information,,and I was creating my own palette of information,,and I was totally and completely,at play.,One of my favorites was,this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election,that has the election results rolling around in the water.,I keep that for evidence. 
 (Laughter) 
 Somebody,was up at my house and saw the paintings,and recommended them to a gallery,,and I had a first show,about two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings,that I'm showing you now.,And then a funny thing happened -- they sold.,And they sold quickly,,and became rather popular.,We started making prints from them.,This is Manhattan, one from the series.,This is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.,We began doing these big silkscreen prints,,and they started selling, too.,So, the gallery wanted me to have another show,in two years,,which meant that I really,had to paint these paintings,much faster,than I had ever done them. And I --,they started to become more political, and I picked areas,that sort of were in the news,or that I had some feeling about,,and I began doing these things. 
 And then this funny thing happened.,I found that I was no longer at play.,I was actually in this solemn landscape,of fulfilling an expectation,for a show,,which is not where I started with these things.,So, while they became successful,,I know how to make them,,so I'm not a neophyte,,and they're no longer serious --,they have become solemn.,And that's a terrifying factor --,when you start something and it turns that way --,because it means that all that's left for you,is to go back and to find out,what the next thing is that you can push,,that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about,,that you can be arrogant about,,that you can fail with,,and that you can be a fool with.,Because in the end, that's how you grow,,and that's all that matters. 
 So, I'm plugging along here --,(Laughter),and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.,Thank you very much.I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].,When they were a bunch of kids,,they were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,,as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals,and see which one blows up more.,Well, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.,Naturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,,hey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there. 
 So, that's what we call our first five employees,during the tea break, you know, in here.,As I said, they were adventurous people.,As a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult,which was not too far from here on Orange Grove,,and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals,and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.,So, that gives you a kind of flavor,of the kind of people we have there.,We try to avoid blowing ourselves up. 
 This one I thought I'd show you.,Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.,I tried to come like him this morning,,but as I walked out, then it was too cold,,and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.,But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:,look where the other people are looking,,and look where he is looking.,Wherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,,and go do something different, you know, and doing that.,And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing. 
 And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson,that one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,,and it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.,Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail.",And that's my recommendation to all of you:,look what everybody is doing, what they are doing;,go do something completely different.,Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,,because that doesn't get you very far. 
 In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,,but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.,As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.,But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,,after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,,and that's the one you see on the left in there.,And here we made 180 degrees change:,we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.,And that was done over a period of a couple of years,,and now we are the leading organization, you know,,exploring space on all of your behalf. 
 But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,,sometimes there are setbacks.,So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;,somehow it ended going sideways.,So that's what we call the misguided missile.,But then also, just to celebrate that,,we started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile." 
 So, we used to have a celebration every year and select --,there used to be competition and parades and so on.,It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;,I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.,So, we do something a little bit more serious.,And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,,when we entered one of the floats.,That's more on the play side. And on the right side,,that's the Rover just before we finished its testing,to take it to the Cape to launch it.,These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.,So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,,you know, and the serious things that we try to do.,But I said I'm going to show you a short clip,of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea,about some of the talent that we have. 
 Video: Morgan Hendry: Beware of Safety is,an instrumental rock band.,It branches on more the experimental side.,There's the improvisational side of jazz.,There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.,Being able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig,for more abstract sounds and things to play live,,mixing electronics and acoustics.,The music's half of me, but the other half --,I landed probably the best gig of all.,I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.,Some of the most brilliant engineers I know,are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.,You've got to do what you want to do.,And anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.,Maybe they're right - I doubt it.,Tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.,I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA. 
 Charles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff,,always people ask, why do we explore?,Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?,Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple.,Somehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard,a little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.,But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination --,or lots of people's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang,we have this beautiful world that we live in today. 
 You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,,all that life that you see around you,,and here we have intelligent people like you and I,who are having a conversation here.,All that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:,How did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?,How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?,Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?,Is that very common?,Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?,So we literally are all made out of stardust.,We started from those stars; we are made of stardust.,So, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror,and you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.,You can skip the dust part.,But literally, we are all made of stardust. 
 So, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively,write the book of how things have came about as they are today.,And one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go,and explore that is to go towards Mars.,And the reason Mars takes particular attention:,it's not very far from us.,You know, it'll take us only six months to get there.,Six to nine months at the right time of the year.,It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,,but the land mass on Mars is about the same,as the land mass on Earth, you know,,if you don't take the oceans into account.,It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,,so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,,and you can see some of the features on it,,like the Grand Canyon on Mars,,or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.,It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger. 
 So it's about the size, you know, of the United States.,It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,,which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.,And if you look at the height of it,and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you,an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,,relative to Mount Everest.,So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.,So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events,which have happened on that planet.,Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like --,we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.,So it is a dynamic planet,,and activity is going on as we speak today. 
 And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,,so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.,This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,,because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground,without really working at it,,and you can see what's below the surface.,So, this is called Victoria Crater,,which is about a few football fields in size.,And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.,This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.,If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.,So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,,and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.,And we actually used the combination of the satellite images,and the Rover to actually conduct science,,because we can observe large areas,and then you can get those Rovers to move around,and basically go to a certain location. 
 So, specifically what we are doing now is,that Rover is going down in that crater.,As I told you, geologists love craters.,And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,,and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.,And what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be,a million years ago, 10 million years ago,,100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.,So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,,and you can learn the history of what happened in the past,in that location. 
 So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall,of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,,the properties and analyzing the rocks,as it's going down, you know, that canyon.,Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving,down a slope like this.,If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.,But we really made sure we tested those Rovers,before we got them down -- or that Rover --,and made sure that it's all working well. 
 Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing --,I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing --,I told you I was surprised that those Rovers,are lasting even a hundred days.,Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working.,Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,,but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last,90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,,and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust,would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while,we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm. 
 Well, I always say it's important that you are smart,,but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.,And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while,there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,,and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.,It is like a brand new car that you have,,and that's literally why they have lasted so long.,And now we designed them reasonably well,,but that's exactly why they are lasting that long,and still providing all the science data.,Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.,You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,,one of the front wheels, so what we are doing,,we are driving it backwards.,And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,,it's not working very well, so it's walking like this,,and we can move the arm, you know, that way.,But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.,Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,,you know, outside the science community about these Rovers,,so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection,about how these Rovers are being viewed by people,other than the science community. 
 So let me go on the next short video.,By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,,about four years ago.,Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned.,Okay, deploy the airbags. Open.,Camera. We have a picture right now.,Yeah!,CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.,Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.,What is he doing?,What is that?,CE: Not too bad. 
 So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit,about the beauty of that planet.,As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,,so you see sand dunes.,It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken,from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,,but these are pictures taken from Mars.,But one area which is particularly intriguing for us,is the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,,because we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking,and expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.,And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.,So, we wanted to find out, actually,,what is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it,some organic, you know, material. 
 So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,,called Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land,17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,,so you can adjust your watch.,So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here,on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.,And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,,but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,,in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,,a little bit of what's going to happen. 
 Video: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.,So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples,that we put them in an oven and actually heat them,and look what gases will come from it.,So this was launched about nine months ago.,We'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes,we have to stop and touch the surface very softly,so we don't break that lander. 
 Ben Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission.,It's the first mission that's going to try to land,near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission,that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water,on the surface of another planet. 
 Lynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth,,there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place,where life could have existed on the planet in the past. 
 Erik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling,at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt,in a soft way in a very short amount of time.,BC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.,We're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.,And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell. 
 EB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less. 
 BC: And on the front of it is this heat shield,,this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch,of essentially what's cork on the front of it,,which is our heat shield.,Now, this is really special cork,,and this cork is what's going to protect us,from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience. 
 Rob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft,,and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere,to our advantage to slow us down.,BC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour,down to 900 miles an hour. 
 EB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun. 
 RG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 EB: The inside doesn't get very hot.,It probably gets about room temperature.,Richard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity,within which we can deploy the parachute. 
 EB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.,The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.,And that would be bad. 
 BC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,,we'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour,to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.,We no longer need the heat shield to protect us,from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,,exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars. 
 LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,,the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect,how far Phoenix really is from the ground. 
 BC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.,So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.,But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part. 
 EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide,when it's going to get rid of its parachute. 
 BC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour,at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.,That's like taking two Empire State Buildings,and stacking them on top of one another. 
 EB: That's when we separate from the back shell,,and we're now in free-fall.,It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen,in a very short amount of time.,LC: So it's in a free-fall,,but it's also trying to use all of its actuators,to make sure that it's in the right position to land. 
 EB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself,,and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely. 
 BC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes,for a signal from Mars to get to Earth.,And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.,So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started,it'll already be over. 
 EB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft,so that it can land itself safely. 
 BC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.,It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space,and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out,how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.,It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem. 
 CE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here.,So it will be a very tense moment, you know,,as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet. 
 So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.,So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing,the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.,So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,,the steps we go through.,It's very similar to what you do when you design your product.,As you saw a little bit earlier,,when we were doing the Phoenix one,,we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.,So we have to study all kinds of different materials,,the shape that we want to do.,In general we don't try to please the customer here.,What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,,an efficient kind of machine. 
 First we start by we want to have our employees,to be as imaginative as they can.,And we really love being close to the art center, because we have,,as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,,Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,,far-out displays, you know,,in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,,just to get people to think wildly about things.,We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,,this is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play,with different shapes and different designs. 
 Then we get a little bit more serious, so we have,what we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved,,or scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,,know about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,,all of these things, which they work in a team effort,and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,,so to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.,On the right, also, we have to take into account,the environment of the planet where we are going.,If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,,you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment,close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor. 
 So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor,and it still has to work.,So these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,,that we have to face.,If we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.,You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,,you know, if that happened, so we have to test,,because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.,We are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them,to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.,To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute,relative to the people standing there. 
 Next step, we go and actually build some kind of test models,and actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,,in what we call our Mars Yard.,We kick them, we hit them, we drop them,,just to make sure we understand how, where would they break.,And then we back off, you know, from that point.,And then we actually do the actual building and the flight.,And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.,That big shield that you see outside,,that's a heat shield which is going to protect it.,And that will be basically built over the next year,,and it will be launched June a year from now.,Now, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,,we couldn't use airbags.,And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said,well, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.,Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,,mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.,So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with,another ingenious idea of how do we land it.,And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface,because we didn't want to contaminate the surface;,we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs. 
 So we came up with this ingenious idea,,which is used here on Earth for helicopters.,Actually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover,above that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane,which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.,Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.,And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.,What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,,it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.,So it will have an arm which will take samples,,put them in an oven, crush and analyze them.,But also, if there is something that we cannot reach,because it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system,which will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,,and actually analyze what's coming from that rock.,So it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.,It's real stuff.,And also to help you, to help the community,so you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover,to actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,,you know, also on Mars. 
 So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know,,fun things we are doing on Mars.,I thought I'd go to "The Lord of the Rings" now,and show you some of the things we have there.,Now, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it.,One, it's a very attractive planet --,it just has the beauty of the rings and so on.,But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,,because we believe they represent, on a small scale,,how the Solar System actually formed.,Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,,that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,,a lot of the dust around it created rings,and then the particles in those rings accumulated together,,and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,,you know, were formed. 
 So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching,our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,,so it's like a test bed for it.,So, let me show you a little bit,on what that Saturnian system looks like.,First, I'm going to fly you over the rings.,By the way, all of this is real stuff.,This is not animation or anything like this.,This is actually taken from the satellite,that we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.,And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,,which are the particles.,Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.,So that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,,is being formed in that location.,Now, you think that those rings are very large objects.,Yes, they are very large in one dimension;,in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.,What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.,And that's one of the satellites,which was actually formed on that one.,So, think about it as a paper-thin,,huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating. 
 And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form,,each one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps,scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,,and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain,what these things look like, or why they formed that way.,Well, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.,One of them is called Enceladus.,It's a satellite which was all made of ice,,and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice.,But there was something bizarre about it.,If you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,,when we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw,an increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes,are warmer than the rest of the planet. 
 So as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what?,We saw geysers coming out.,So this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.,We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,,which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,,below the surface.,And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers,which are being, you know, emitted from it.,And the reason I showed the little arrow there,,I think that should say 30 miles,,we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft,through the plume of that geyser,so we can actually measure the material that it is made of.,That was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried,about the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.,We flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of,organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.,And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,,we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface,and make more accurate measurements. 
 Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention,,and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,,it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.,And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere.,So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure,that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,,and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.,Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,,so immediately people start thinking,,could life have evolved in that location,,when you have a lot of organic material.,So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call,a pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get,to the stage of becoming biological material,,and therefore life could have evolved on it. 
 So it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago,before life actually started on it.,So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example,of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,,which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe,as we were orbiting Saturn.,We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.,And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.,Just looked like the coast of California for me.,You see the rivers which are coming along the coast,,and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,,and that looks like an ocean.,And then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,,we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,,so it looks very much like Earth.,It looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,,we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.,So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except,because it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,,because water would have frozen.,What it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,,[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,,similar to what you put in your car. 
 So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth,,but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.,So if you were on Mars -- sorry, on Titan,,you don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.,You just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,,and you've got your car filled up.,On the other hand, if you light a match,the whole planet will blow up.,So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.,And just to kind of put us in perspective,,this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft,from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.,The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering,",so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.,There is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well,,but on the top left, around 10 o'clock,,there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.,You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.,So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,,just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center. 
 So thank you very much.This is a guy named Bob McKim.,He was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s,,and also led the Stanford Design Program.,And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley,,who’s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.,And he liked to do an exercise with his students,where he got them to take a piece of paper,and draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor,,very quickly, just as quickly as they could. 
 And in fact, we’re going to do that exercise right now.,You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.,It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.,I need you to turn that piece of paper over;,you should find that it’s blank on the other side.,And there should be a pencil.,And I want you to pick somebody that’s seated next to you,,and when I say, go, you’ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?,So, everybody ready? OK. Off you go.,You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast.,Come on: those masterpieces ...,OK? Stop. All right, now. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, lot’s of laughter. Yeah, exactly.,Lots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment. 
 (Laughter) 
 Am I hearing a few "sorry’s"? I think I’m hearing a few sorry’s.,Yup, yup, I think I probably am.,And that’s exactly what happens every time,,every time you do this with adults.,McKim found this every time he did it with his students.,He got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry’s. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he would point this out as evidence,that we fear the judgment of our peers,,and that we’re embarrassed about showing our ideas,to people we think of as our peers, to those around us.,And this fear is what causes us,to be conservative in our thinking.,So we might have a wild idea,,but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else. 
 OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids,,they have no embarrassment at all.,They just quite happily show their masterpiece,to whoever wants to look at it.,But as they learn to become adults,,they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,,and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.,And in studies of kids playing, it’s been shown,time after time that kids who feel secure,,who are in a kind of trusted environment --,they’re the ones that feel most free to play. 
 And if you’re starting a design firm, let’s say,,then you probably also want to create,a place where people have the same kind of security.,Where they have the same kind of security to take risks.,Maybe have the same kind of security to play. 
 Before founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do,was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends.,Now, that wasn’t just self-indulgence.,He knew that friendship is a short cut to play.,And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust,,and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks,that we need to take as designers.,And so, that decision to work with his friends --,now he has 550 of them -- was what got IDEO started. 
 And our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today,,are designed to help people feel relaxed:,familiar with their surroundings,,comfortable with the people that they’re working with.,It takes more than decor, but I think we’ve all seen that,creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace,that remind people to be playful,,and that it’s a permissive environment.,So, whether it’s this microbus meeting room,that we have in one our buildings at IDEO;,or at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;,or at the Googleplex, where,it’s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,,and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.,Don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos,,but anyway, they’re there in the garden.,Or even in the Swiss office of Google,,which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.,And my theory is, that’s so the Swiss can prove,to their Californian colleagues that they’re not boring.,So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman’s pole.,Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one. 
 So all of these places have these symbols.,Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually,not so much the place, it’s a thing.,And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago,,or created a few years ago.,It’s a toy; it’s called a "finger blaster.",And I forgot to bring one up with me.,So if somebody can reach under the chair that’s next to them,,you’ll find something taped underneath it.,That’s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it. 
 So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you,has got one taped under your chair.,And I’m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.,But before we start, I need just to put these on.,Thank you. All right.,Now, what I’m going to do is, I’m going to see how --,I can’t see out of these, OK.,I’m going to see how many of you at the back of the room,can actually get those things onto the stage.,So the way they work is, you know,,you just put your finger in the thing,,pull them back, and off you go.,So, don’t look backwards. That’s my only recommendation here.,I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.,So come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh.,I have another idea. I wanted to -- there we go. 
 (Laughter) 
 There we go. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.,Not bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, they’re still coming in from the back there;,they’re still coming in.,Some of you haven’t fired them yet.,Can you not figure out how to do it, or something?,It’s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this,in the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up.,All right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.,Okay, all right. Let’s -- I suppose we'd better...,I'd better clear these up out of the way;,otherwise, I’m going to trip over them.,All right. So the rest of you can save them,for when I say something particularly boring,,and then you can fire at me. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right. I think I’m going to take these off now,,because I can’t see a damn thing when I’ve -- all right, OK.,So, ah, that was fun. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, good. 
 (Applause) 
 So, OK, so why?,So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know.,Why do we have them? Well, as I said,,we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.,But why is it important?,We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.,We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.,Helps us do our jobs better,,and helps us feel better when we do them. 
 Now, an adult encountering a new situation --,when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency,to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.,And there’s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.,Life’s complicated; we want to figure out,what’s going on around us very quickly.,I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists,probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want,to categorize new things very, very quickly.,One of them might be, you know,,when we see this funny stripy thing:,is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?,Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree?,We need to figure that out pretty fast.,Well, at least, we did once.,Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose. 
 This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.,That’s what it is, isn’t it? Of course it is, of course it is.,Well, not necessarily. 
 (Laughter) 
 Kids are more engaged with open possibilities.,Now, they’ll certainly -- when they come across something new,,they’ll certainly ask, "What is it?",Of course they will. But they’ll also ask, "What can I do with it?",And you know, the more creative of them,might get to a really interesting example.,And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.,Any parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.,Yeah, thought so. So we’ve all seen it, haven’t we? 
 We’ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning,,our kids end up playing with the boxes,far more than they play with the toys that are inside them.,And you know, from an exploration perspective,,this behavior makes complete sense.,Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy.,Even one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo --,which, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing,,whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices.,So again, this is another one of those playful activities,that, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn. 
 So another one of Bob McKim’s favorite exercises,is called the "30 Circles Test.",So we’re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again.,Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on,back over, and you’ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.,So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.,So what I’m going to do is, I’m going to give you minute,,and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can,into objects of some form.,So for example, you could turn one into a football,,or another one into a sun. All I’m interested in is quantity.,I want you to do as many of them as you can,,in the minute that I’m just about to give you.,So, everybody ready? OK? Off you go. 
 Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say.,So, who got more than five circles figured out?,Hopefully everybody? More than 10?,Keep your hands up if you did 10.,15? 20? Anybody get all 30?,No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.,Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?,Happy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?,Anybody use my examples? The sun and the football?,Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity.,I wasn’t actually very interested in whether they were all different.,I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.,And one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things.,We stop ourselves from doing things.,We self-edit as we’re having ideas. 
 And in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.,And that actually isn’t necessarily really playful.,So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things,,even if they don’t seem that different from each other,,is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play.,So now, Bob McKim did another,version of this test,in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s.,Anybody know what this is? It’s the peyote cactus.,It’s the plant from which you can create mescaline,,one of the psychedelic drugs.,For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well. 
 McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment,that he and his colleagues conducted,to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.,So he picked 27 professionals -- they were,engineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,,furniture designers even, artists --,and he asked them to come along one evening,,and to bring a problem with them that they were working on.,He gave each of them some mescaline,,and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.,And then he did what’s called the Purdue Creativity Test.,You might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?",It’s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do. 
 Now, actually, he gave the test before the drugs,and after the drugs, to see,what the difference was in people’s,facility and speed with coming up with ideas.,And then he asked them to go away,and work on those problems that they’d brought.,And they’d come up with a bunch of,interesting solutions -- and actually, quite,valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on.,And so, some of the things that they figured out,,some of these individuals figured out;,in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses,that were accepted by clients;,a design of a solar space probe experiment;,a redesign of the linear electron accelerator;,an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder --,you can tell this is a while ago;,the completion of a line of furniture;,and even a new conceptual model of the photon.,So it was a pretty successful evening. 
 In fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley,got off to its great start with innovation.,We don’t know, but it may be.,We need to ask some of the CEOs,whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.,But really, it wasn’t the drugs that were important;,it was this idea that what the drugs did,would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,,and getting them to forget the adult behaviors,that were getting in the way of their ideas.,But it’s hard to break our habits, our adult habits. 
 At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls.,Edicts like, "Defer judgment," or "Go for quantity.",And somehow that seems wrong.,I mean, can you have rules about creativity?,Well, it sort of turns out that we need rules,to help us break the old rules and norms,that otherwise we might bring to the creative process.,And we’ve certainly learnt that over time,,you get much better brainstorming,,much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.,Now, of course, many designers, many individual designers,,achieve this is in a much more organic way. 
 I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.,And they experimented with plywood for many years,without necessarily having one single goal in mind.,They were exploring following what was interesting to them.,They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers,coming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,,and from this experiment they moved on to chairs. 
 Through constant experimentation with materials,,they developed a wide range of iconic solutions,that we know today, eventually resulting in,,of course, the legendary lounge chair.,Now, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,,then we wouldn’t be the beneficiaries of so many,wonderful designs today.,And of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,,from films to buildings, from games to graphics.,So, they’re great examples, I think, of exploration,and experimentation in design. 
 Now, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities,,they were also exploring physical objects.,And they were doing that through building prototypes.,And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I’d talk about.,So the average Western first-grader,spends as much as 50 percent of their play time,taking part in what’s called "construction play.",Construction play -- it’s playful, obviously,,but also a powerful way to learn.,When play is about building a tower out of blocks,,the kid begins to learn a lot about towers.,And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again,,learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.,It’s classically learning by doing. 
 Now, David Kelley calls this behavior,,when it’s carried out by designers, "thinking with your hands.",And it typically involves making multiple,,low-resolution prototypes very quickly,,often by bringing lots of found elements together,in order to get to a solution.,On one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck,,and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together,a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.,Now, that became the first commercial computer mouse,for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh. 
 So, they learned their way to that by building prototypes.,Another example is a group of designers,who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons.,They were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons,about what it was they needed with this device.,And one of the designers ran out of the room,and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister --,which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium --,and a clothespin. He taped them all together,,ran back into the room and said, "You mean, something like this?",And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said,,well, I want to hold it like this, or like that.,And all of a sudden a productive conversation,was happening about design around a tangible object.,And in the end it turned into a real device. 
 And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something,into the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result.,At IDEO there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel,sometimes about the environment.,The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper,and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff --,I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.,But the important idea is that everything’s at hand, everything’s around.,So when designers are working on ideas,,they can start building stuff whenever they want.,They don’t necessarily even have to go,into some kind of formal workshop to do it.,And we think that’s pretty important. 
 And then the sad thing is, although preschools,are full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system,it all gets taken away.,They lose this stuff that facilitates,this sort of playful and building mode of thinking.,And of course, by the time you get to the average workplace,,maybe the best construction tool we have,might be the Post-it notes. It’s pretty barren.,But by giving project teams and the clients,who they’re working with permission to think with their hands,,quite complex ideas can spring into life,and go right through to execution much more easily. 
 This is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype,,explaining what she wants out of a portable information system,to a team of technologists and designers,that are working with her in a hospital.,And just having this very simple prototype,allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.,And of course, by building quick prototypes,,we can get out and test our ideas with consumers,and users much more quickly,than if we’re trying to describe them through words. 
 But what about designing something that isn’t physical?,Something like a service or an experience?,Something that exists as a series of interactions over time?,Instead of building play, this can be approached with role-play.,So, if you’re designing an interaction between two people --,such as, I don’t know -- ordering food at a fast food joint,or something, you need to be able to imagine,how that experience might feel over a period of time.,And I think the best way to achieve that,,and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out. 
 So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO,trying to convince our clients of this.,They can be a little skeptical; I’ll come back to that.,But a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile,is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems --,things like education or security or finance or health.,And this is another example in a healthcare environment,of some doctors and some nurses and designers,acting out a service scenario around patient care.,But you know, many adults,are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play.,Some of it’s embarrassment and some of it is because,they just don’t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid.,They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying,,you know, "That’s just happening because they’re acting it out." 
 Research into kids' behavior actually suggests,that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously.,Because when children play a role,,they actually follow social scripts quite closely,that they’ve learnt from us as adults.,If one kid plays "store," and another one’s playing "house,",then the whole kind of play falls down.,So they get used to quite quickly,to understanding the rules for social interactions,,and are actually quite quick to point out when they’re broken. 
 So when, as adults, we role-play,,then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.,We’ve gone through lots of experiences in life,,and they provide a strong intuition,as to whether an interaction is going to work.,So we’re very good, when acting out a solution,,at spotting whether something lacks authenticity.,So role-play is actually, I think,,quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.,Another way for us, as designers, to explore role-play,is to put ourselves through an experience which we’re designing for,,and project ourselves into an experience. 
 So here are some designers who are trying to understand,what it might feel like to sleep in a,confined space on an airplane.,And so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see,,and did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play,,just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers,if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes. 
 This is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian,,and he’s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient.,Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.,One of the reasons he chose to take,this rather large video camera with him was,because he didn’t want the doctors and nurses thinking,he was actually sick, and sticking something into him,that he was going to regret later.,So anyhow, he went there with his video camera,,and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.,Because when we looked at the video when he got back,,we saw 20 minutes of this. 
 (Laughter) 
 And also, the amazing thing about this video --,as soon as you see it you immediately,project yourself into that experience.,And you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty,while you’re left out in the hallway,while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case,in one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck’s going on.,And so this notion of using role-play --,or in this case, living through the experience,as a way of creating empathy --,particularly when you use video, is really powerful. 
 Or another one of our designers, Altay Sendil:,he’s here having his chest waxed, not because he’s very vain,,although actually he is -- no, I’m kidding --,but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients,go through when they’re having dressings removed.,And so sometimes these analogous experiences,,analogous role-play, can also be quite valuable. 
 So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know,,he’s beginning to try on that identity.,He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.,We’re doing the same thing as designers.,We’re trying on these experiences.,And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool,,as well as a tool for prototyping experiences.,And you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway.,Not just because they lead to insights about the experience,,but also because of their willingness to explore,and their ability to unselfconsciously,surrender themselves to the experience.,In short, we admire their willingness to play. 
 Playful exploration, playful building and role-play:,those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work.,And so far, I admit, this might feel,like it’s a message just to go out and play like a kid.,And to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.,The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.,Play has rules, especially when it’s group play.,When kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers,,they’re following a script that they’ve agreed to.,And it’s this code negotiation that leads to productive play. 
 So, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning?,The kind of little face, the portrait you did?,Well, imagine if you did the same task with friends,while you were drinking in a pub.,But everybody agreed to play a game,where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks.,That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing,,difficult situation into a fun game.,As a result, we’d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time --,but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together. 
 But there aren’t just rules about how to play;,there are rules about when to play.,Kids don’t play all the time, obviously.,They transition in and out of it,,and good teachers spend a lot of time,thinking about how to move kids through these experiences.,As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.,And if we’re running design studios,we need to be able to figure out, how can we transition,designers through these different experiences?,I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of -- 
 I think what’s very different about design,is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.,We go through a sort of generative mode,,where we’re exploring many ideas;,and then we come back together again,,and come back looking for that solution,,and developing that solution.,I think they’re two quite different modes:,divergence and convergence.,And I think it’s probably in the divergent mode,that we most need playfulness.,Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious.,And so being able to move between those modes,is really quite important. So, it’s where there’s a,more nuanced version view of play, I think, is required. 
 Because it’s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute.,You’re either playful or you’re serious, and you can’t be both.,But that’s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult,and, at times, be playful.,It’s not an either/or; it’s an "and.",You can be serious and play.,So to sum it up, we need trust to play,,and we need trust to be creative. So, there’s a connection.,And there are a series of behaviors that we’ve learnt as kids,,and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers.,They include exploration, which is about going for quantity;,building, and thinking with your hands;,and role-play, where acting it out helps us both,to have more empathy for the situations in which we’re designing,,and to create services and experiences,that are seamless and authentic. 
 Thank you very much. (Applause)I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,,and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.,And so, I have my first slide to talk about,the dawning of the universe and what I call,the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at,the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,,and then following it up and trying to understand it. 
 And so one of the questions that I asked you is,,when you look around, what do you see?,Well, you see this space that's created by designers,and by the work of people, but what you actually see,is a lot of material that was already here,,being reshaped in a certain form.,And so the question is: how did that material get here?,How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?,It's a question of what's the continuity?,So one of the things I look at is,,how did the universe begin and shape?,What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe,to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials? 
 So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you,the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.,If you look at this picture,,what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.,And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars,,and you can see them there -- little pluses.,This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?,So there's a couple of thousand galaxies,you can see easily with your eye in here.,And when I look out at particularly this galaxy,,which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's,an art design college conference going on,,and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,,what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists,trying to understand where the universe itself came from,,and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours,trying to figure out what's going on over here. 
 But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,,and they're kind of the color of the Sun,,and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.,But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you --,how come there are so many galaxies?,Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.,This is only 1,000 galaxies.,We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,,if you had the time to scan it around --,about 100 billion galaxies. Right?,It's a very large number of galaxies.,And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy. 
 But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see,more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.,So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,,what kind of creative process and what kind of design,produced the world like that?,And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.,We're going to try and follow it up.,We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,,and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big,that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.,We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.,Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,,just because that's where we're making observations.,And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon,using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.,Two seconds is like the present.,The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,,unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.,You'd like to have a little advance warning. 
 But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.,You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars,because it takes light long enough to go there.,But if you look out to the nearest set of stars,,to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.,So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.,But you go and look to the center of the galaxy,,it's thousands of years ago.,If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,,and it's two million years ago.,If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,,there'd be no evidence of humans at all,,because we don't think there were humans yet.,I mean, it just gives you the scale.,With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at,hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. 
 But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further --,there's some things even further,,and that was what I did in a lot of my work,,was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier,epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,,back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.,And so that's the sort of sequence,,and so I have a more artistic impression of this.,There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,,and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies,,and there's a sphere that marks the different times.,And behind that are some more modern galaxies. 
 You see the whole big picture?,The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?,And then there's a part of the universe we can't see,because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.,It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;,you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.,But you can see the edge of the Sun,,and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.,And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,,and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,,which is actually incredibly uniform.,The universe is almost a perfect sphere,,but there are these very tiny variations,which we show here in great exaggeration.,And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go,from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars,to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth. 
 So it's a big design job,,but we'll see about how things are going on.,So the way these measurements were done,,there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.,So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,,and we discovered these variations.,And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP --,and it made somewhat better pictures.,And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version,,the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,,and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched,,and it will make very high-resolution maps.,And that will be the sequence of understanding,the very beginning of the universe. 
 And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us,the secrets, both about the structure of space-time,,and about the contents of the universe,,and about how the universe started in its original motions.,So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,,and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have,some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.,And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe,expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,,then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,,and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.,And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.,And it's maturing up to the present time.,And there's some spectacular things.,And this wastebasket part, that's to represent,what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.,And so this is a pretty weird model, right?,What kind of evidence do we have for that? 
 So let me show you some of nature's patterns,that are the result of this.,I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,,and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.,It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.,So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.,So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.,They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,,identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,,estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.,And just put radially they're going out that way.,And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,,but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out,because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it. 
 Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.,What happens is, you take pictures,as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.,There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,,or because there are no telescopes available to do it.,So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.,Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?,Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,,you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.,And you see this thing we call the Great Wall,,and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.,There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places,where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.,So there's an interesting pattern,,but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.,We only have a million galaxies, right?,So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air,but, what's going on?,There's another survey which is very similar to this,,called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey. 
 Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.,And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy --,and if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,,because there's a redshift measurement and everything,,you put in the type of galaxy and the color,,so this is the real representation.,And when you're in the middle of the galaxies,it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.,It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,,it's hard to see the pattern of this.,So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.,And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,,and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies,that we see out there.,So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here. 
 But you can see the voids,,you can see the complicated structure, and you say,,well, how did this happen?,Suppose you're the cosmic designer.,How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?,It's not just throwing them out at random.,There's a more complicated process going on here.,How are you going to end up doing that?,And so now we're in for some serious play.,That is, we have to seriously play God,,not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.,So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?,What's the kind of technique?,What's the kind of thing you're going to do? 
 So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation,of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,,some of the play principles and some of the design principles that,,you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,,but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.,And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients,and some simple rules,,but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.,And then you put in some randomness,,some fluctuations and some randomness,,and realize a whole bunch of different representations. 
 So what I'm going to do is show you,the distribution of matter as a function of scales.,We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.,And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.,It's called dark matter.,That is matter that doesn't interact with light,the typical way that ordinary matter does,,the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.,It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,,we're going to make it white. OK?,So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.,It should be called invisible matter,,but the dark matter we've made visible.,And the stuff that is in the yellow color,,that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies. 
 So I'll show you the next movie.,So this -- we're going to zoom in.,Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.,We're going to zoom in and zoom in.,And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.,And when a number of filaments come together in a knot,,that makes a supercluster of galaxies.,This one we're zooming in on,is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.,So we live in the boonies.,We don't live in the center of the solar system,,we don't live in the center of the galaxy,and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster. 
 So we're zooming in.,This is a region which probably has more than 100,000,,on the order of a million galaxies in that region.,We're going to keep zooming in. OK.,And so I forgot to tell you the scale.,A parsec is 3.26 light years.,So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.,So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.,Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.,That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?,These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies. 
 Now we're going to zoom back out,,and you can see this structure that,,when we get very far out, looks very regular,,but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.,So they're simple building blocks.,There's a very simple fluid to begin with.,It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,,it's got photons and it's got neutrinos,,which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.,And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,,develops into this complicated structure.,And so you know when you first saw this picture,,it didn't mean quite so much to you.,Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe,and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,,but you realize they're not even the main structure.,There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,,that's out there that's actually holding it all together. 
 So let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is,when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.,So here's that same end result.,You see a filament,,you see the light is the invisible matter,,and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.,And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,,and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,,and you get a large cluster of galaxies.,And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,,and you can see what it looks like.,And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?,It's only when you look at it at a very large scale,,and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,,complicated kind of a design, right?,And it's grown up in some kind of way. 
 So the question is,,how hard would it be to assemble this, right?,How big a contractor team would you need,to put this universe together, right?,That's the issue, right?,And so here we are.,You see how the filament --,you see how several filaments are coming together,,therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.,And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look,if you -- first, you can't travel this fast,,everything would be distorted,,but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.,This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,,it might look to you, right?,And if you could see invisible matter, too. 
 And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe,in a very simple way?,We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,,everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope,plus our other instruments,,was once in a region that was smaller than an atom.,It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,,but expanding at a tremendous rate.,And those fluctuations,were stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations,eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.,And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies,and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on. 
 So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.,This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month,in order to make just this simple visible one.,So I'm going to show you one,that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.,So you start out with teeny fluctuations,when the universe was at this point,,now four times smaller, and so forth.,And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.,And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter,and it just has the dark matter in it.,And you see how the dark matter lumps up,,and the ordinary matter just trails along behind.,So there it is.,At the beginning it's very uniform.,The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.,There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,,and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in. 
 This is light over density, pulls the material around in.,That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.,But the distances on the universe are so large,and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.,And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,,in terms of its expansion.,And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating,its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.,So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,,and then only things that have started forming already,are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on. 
 So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.,We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors,to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.,So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe,by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,,and we create everything we can see in any direction, right,,from almost nothing -- that is, something extremely tiny,,extremely small -- and it is almost perfect,,except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,,which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,,that is, galaxies and stars and so forth. 
 So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it,to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.,And that design is sort of way beyond,what our original imagination ever was.,So this is what we started with 15 years ago,,with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right,,which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,,and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.,Since then we've had WMAP,,which just gives us higher angular resolution.,We see the same large-scale structure,,but we see additional small-scale structure.,And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down,and mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.,You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out,all the major continents, but that's about it. 
 But what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution,about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,,where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.,And you can also tell, because of the sharp edges,and the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes.,Geology has these effects,,which is moving the plates around and so forth.,You can see that just from the map alone.,We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe,we can see whether there are any non-linear effects,that are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how,space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.,So that's where we are today,,and that's what I wanted to give you na flavor of.,Give you a different view about what the design,and what everything else looks like.,Thank you.,(Applause)So, here we go: a flyby of play. 
 It's got to be serious if the New York Times,puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.,At the bottom of this, it says, "It's deeper than gender.,Seriously, but dangerously fun.,And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution.",Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?,You see any adults? 
 Well, lets go back to the 15th century.,This is a courtyard in Europe,,and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play.,All ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.,And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture,of what it was like in a courtyard then.,I think we may have lost something in our culture. 
 So I'm gonna take you through,what I think is a remarkable sequence.,North of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,,there's no ice on Hudson Bay.,And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,,he's wild and fairly hungry.,And Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,,is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.,And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,,with a predatory gaze.,Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,,there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze,that you know you're in trouble.,But on the other side of that predatory gaze,is a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.,And something very unusual happens.,That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped,and ends up with a meal -- changes.,And this polar bear,stands over the husky,,no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.,And they begin an incredible ballet. 
 A play ballet.,This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature,and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.,And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,,and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.,They're in a state of play.,And it's that state,that allows these two creatures to explore the possible.,They are beginning to do something that neither would have done,without the play signals.,And it is a marvelous example,of how a differential in power,can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us. 
 Now how did I get involved in this?,John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.,The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes,,in retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder,,to the importance of play,,in that that individual, by deep study,,was found to have severe play deprivation.,Charles Whitman was his name.,And our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists,,did feel at the end of that study,that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play,led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated.,And that finding has stood the test of time --,unfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech. 
 And other studies of populations at risk,sensitized me to the importance of play,,but I didn't really understand what it was.,And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals,before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.,And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.,But there are ways of looking at it,that I think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it. 
 And this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play.,When that mother and infant lock eyes,,and the infant's old enough to have a social smile,,what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.,And she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby.,If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram,,the right brain of each of them becomes attuned,,so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes,and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on. 
 And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play,builds on this base for us humans.,And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,,but it's never just singularly one thing. 
 We're going to look at body play,,which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.,This is a mountain goat.,If you're having a bad day, try this:,jump up and down, wiggle around -- you're going to feel better.,And you may feel like this character,,who is also just doing it for its own sake.,It doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play.,If its purpose is more important,than the act of doing it, it's probably not play. 
 And there's a whole other type of play, which is object play.,And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,,and he or she's going to roll down a hill.,And -- they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful.,The human hand, in manipulation of objects,,is the hand in search of a brain;,the brain is in search of a hand;,and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way. 
 JPL we heard this morning -- JPL is an incredible place.,They have located two consultants,,Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson,,who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.,He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,,and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.,And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,,that the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,,hadn't worked with their hands.,Frank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand.",They got together -- JPL hired them.,Now JPL, NASA and Boeing,,before they will hire a research and development problem solver --,even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech --,if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,,played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.,So play is practical, and it's very important. 
 Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter),But it has to be safe exploration.,This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy,and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good.,But curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene.,If you want to belong, you need social play.,And social play is part of what we're about here today,,and is a byproduct of the play scene. 
 Rough and tumble play.,These lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.,But if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky:,no claws, flat fur, soft eyes,,open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,,curvilinear movements -- all specific to play.,And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.,Preschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,,scream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation,and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive, emotional and physical --,that come as a part of rough and tumble play. 
 Spectator play, ritual play -- we're involved in some of that.,Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare --,where the Red Sox won the World Series.,But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody,in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play. 
 Imaginative play.,I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,,but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,,her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.,A really important part of being a player,is imaginative solo play. 
 And I love this one, because it's also what we're about.,We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.,The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story.,I'm telling you a story today about play.,Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long,,but it's a fundamental part of the play scene. 
 So what does play do for the brain?,Well, a lot. 
 We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain,,because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play.,I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.,They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician,for the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record,,and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play,,it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious.,I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past,,and the play wave is cresting,,because there is some good science. 
 Nothing lights up the brain like play.,Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum,,puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe --,the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed,,and -- and, and, and. 
 So it's -- for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure,to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people,who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.,And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.,And this is one of the ways you can study play --,is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.,I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,,which has limited the actual study of play.,And we've got a mother-infant play scenario,that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment. 
 The reason I put this here is also to queue up,my thoughts about objectifying what play does.,The animal world has objectified it.,In the animal world, if you take rats,,who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years,and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle,,they pin each other, that's part of their play.,If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,,and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,,and then you present those rats,with a cat odor-saturated collar,,they're hardwired to flee and hide.,Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat.,So what happens?,They both hide out.,The non-players never come out --,they die.,The players slowly explore the environment,,and begin again to test things out.,That says to me, at least in rats --,and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do,and a similar cortical architecture --,that play may be pretty important for our survival. 
 And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about. 
 Now, this is a consequence of play deprivation. (Laughter),This took a long time --,I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT,and multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.,And we do know that in domestic animals,and others, when they're play deprived,,they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal. 
 Now, the program says that the opposite of play is not work,,it's depression.,And I think if you think about life without play --,no humor, no flirtation, no movies,,no games, no fantasy and, and, and.,Try and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise,without play.,And the thing that's so unique about our species,is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime. 
 And we all have capacity to play signal.,Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.,What's going to follow from that behavior,is play.,And you can trust it.,The basis of human trust is established through play signals.,And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.,That's a shame.,I think we've got a lot of learning to do. 
 Now, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.,So part of the signaling system of play,has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.,You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play,,its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety,through their own sharing of play signals. 
 You may not know this word,,but it should be your biological first name and last name.,Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.,And we are, by physical anthropologists,,by many, many studies, the most neotenous,,the most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures.,And therefore, the most playful.,And this gives us a leg up on adaptability. 
 Now, there is a way of looking at play,that I also want to emphasize here,,which is the play history.,Your own personal play history is unique,,and often is not something we think about particularly. 
 This is a book written by a consummate player,by the name of Kevin Carroll.,Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances:,alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia,,black, had to take care of a younger brother.,Found that when he looked at a playground,out of a window into which he had been confined,,he felt something different.,And so he followed up on it.,And his life -- the transformation of his life,from deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death --,he become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker.,And he gives play as a transformative force,over his entire life. 
 Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress.,Those of you who remember Al Gore,,during the first term and then during his successful,but unelected run for the presidency,,may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person,,at least in public.,And looking at his history, which is common in the press,,it seems to me, at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view --,that a lot of his life was programmed.,Summers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers.,He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.,And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play --,because I do know something about that --,he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is,by paying attention to what is his own passion,and his own inner drive,,which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history. 
 So what I would encourage on an individual level to do,,is to explore backwards as far as you can go,to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,,whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.,And begin to build to build from the emotion of that,into how that connects with your life now.,And you'll find, you may change jobs --,which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this --,in order to be more empowered through their play.,Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it,and paying attention to it. 
 Most of us work with groups, and I put this up because,the d.school, the design school at Stanford,,thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others,who have been visionary about its establishment,,has allowed a group of us to get together,and create a course called "From Play to Innovation.",And you'll see this course is to investigate,the human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state,and its importance to creative thinking:,"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;,to apply those principles, through design thinking,,to promote innovation in the corporate world;,and the students will work with real-world partners,on design projects with widespread application." 
 This is our maiden voyage in this.,We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.,There is our star pupil, this labrador,,who taught a lot of us what a state of play is,,and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.,And Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall -- and on the far right is, I think, a person who,will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize -- Stuart Thompson,,in neuroscience.,So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,,and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students,as they put play principles into practice in the classroom.,And one of their projects was to,see what makes meetings boring,,and to try and do something about it.,So what will follow is a student-made film,about just that. 
 Narrator: Flow is the mental state of apparition,in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.,Characterized by a feeling of energized focus,,full involvement and success in the process of the activity. 
 An important key insight that we learned about meetings,is that people pack them in one after another,,disruptive to the day.,Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task,that they left at their desk.,But it doesn't have to be that way. 
 (Music) 
 Some sage and repeatedly furry monks,at this place called the d.school,designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.,Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.,Because when you need it again,,the meeting is literally hanging in your closet. 
 The Wearable Meeting.,Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need,to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.,But when you take it off --,that's when the real action happens. 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you all,to engage,not in the work-play differential --,where you set aside time to play --,but where your life becomes infused,minute by minute, hour by hour,,with body,,object,,social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.,And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.,Thank You. 
 (Applause) 
 John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that,there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work,and go --,I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,,that somehow,,the way animals and humans deal with play,,is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.,Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong. 
 SB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate,,and I think probably because animals have taught us that.,If you stop a cat from playing --,which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff --,they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.,And if you imagine a kid,pretending to be King Kong,,or a race car driver, or a fireman,,they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.,So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future --,which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as --,and thinking of it as a separate biological entity. 
 And this is where my chasing animals for four, five years,really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,,which is that play has a biological place,,just like sleep and dreams do.,And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,,animals sleep and dream,,and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory,and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams. 
 The next step of evolution in mammals and,creatures with divinely superfluous neurons,will be to play.,And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear,or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience,sets play aside as something separate.,And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.,So it's not just something you do in your spare time. 
 JH: How do you keep -- and I know you're part of the scientific research community,,and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else --,how do you prevent --,and some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.,How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work,or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,,kind of like the Mozart metaphor,,where, "Oh, MRIs show,that play enhances your intelligence.,Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pens,and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard.",How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action,on the data that you're developing? 
 SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it,is to have accumulated the advisers that I have,who go from practitioners --,who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever --,a state of play.,So people know that it's there.,And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,,and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.,And you get them into a group together focused on play,,and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously. 
 Unfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficiently,for the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health,or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.,I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease,associated with play.,And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival -- long term --,as learning some of the basic things about public health. 
 JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much. 
 (Applause)You know, we're going to do things a little differently.,I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you.,And at the same time, we're going to look at just images,from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that --,snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating.,You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures,that you see on screen that come from there.,I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,,and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively,a little bit more and think and ask questions.,You know, I guess the first question is,,why build a virtual world at all?,And I think the answer to that is always going to be,at least driven to a certain extent by the people,initially crazy enough to start the project, you know. 
 So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me,and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager,and then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.,I was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,,and then later, programming computers, when I was really young.,I was just always trying to make things.,I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,,and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood,or electronics or metal or anything else.,And so, for example -- and it's a great Second Life thing -- I had a bedroom.,And every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to --,but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up,rather than opened, like on Star Trek.,I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling,and I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,,and put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling. 
 I built -- I put a garage-door opener up in the attic,that would pull this door up.,You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house,and the displeasure of my parents.,The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people,could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do,,but are so often unable, in the real world, to actually do those things --,to actually cobble together the materials,and go through the actual execution phase of building something,that you imagine from a design perspective.,And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around,and I was doing computer programming and just, you know,,just generally trying to run my own little company,and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers,,I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing,that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers,would be to use the Internet and connected computers,to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics,and the rules of how things went together --,the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things,,and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. 
 And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing.,I just wanted this place where you could build things.,And so I think you see that in the genesis,of what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important.,I also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology,as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.,It is a -- sort of a great human progress.,Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create,in as shared and social a way as possible.,And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally,represent the best we can do to achieve that right now.,You know, another way to look at that,,and related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,,is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.,I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.,If you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.,So many movies, so many kids, we all sort of,dream about exploring space. Now, why is that?,Stop for a moment and ask, why that conceit?,Why do we as people want to do that?,I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies --,you know, it's this dream that we all share. 
 One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again.,In some sense, you would become someone else in that journey,,because there wouldn't be -- you'd leave society and life as you know it, behind.,And so inevitably, you would transform yourself --,irreversibly, in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration.,And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense,that if you travel far enough, you can find out there --,oh, yeah -- you have no idea what you're going to find,once you get there, into space.,It's going to be different than here.,And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth,that anything is going to be possible.,So that's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of,creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible.,And I think that if you really sit and think about it,,virtual worlds, and where we're going,with more and more computing technology,,represent essentially the likely, really tactically possible,version of space exploration.,We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space,,they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything,and everything, and probably anything could happen there. 
 You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know,,comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of --,and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.,In fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:,everybody's very excited,,there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next,from moment to moment, and then there's despair,and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.,Everything that's happening with Second Life,and more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.,We always play a game at the office where you can take any article,and find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life",with "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet.",You can find exactly the same articles,written about everything that people are observing.,To give you an idea of scale, Second Life is about 20,000 CPUs at this point.,It's about 20,000 computers connected together,in three facilities in the United States right now,,that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself --,there's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,,so the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.,The space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco,,and it's about as densely built out. 
 So it gives you an idea of scale. Now, it's expanding very rapidly --,about five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.,And so of course, radically unlike the real world,,and like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding,very, very quickly, and historically exponentially.,So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here,by the amount of content that's in there,,and I think that amount is critical.,It was critical with the virtual world,that it be this space of truly infinite possibility.,We're very sensitive to that as humans.,You know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space,and you know when you can't.,Second Life today is this 20,000 machines,,and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,,an object would be something like this, possibly interactive.,Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time;,they have code attached to them.,So it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there,and that's very important.,If anybody plays, like, World of Warcraft,,World of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.,Second Life, by comparison, has about 100 terabytes,of user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger. 
 So again, like the Internet compared to AOL,,and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,,what's happening here is something very different,,because the sheer scale of what people can do,when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.,The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true,that whatever this is going to evolve into,is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.,And let me justify that with two statements.,Generically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,,create and consume information.,It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data-driven.,I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information.,Everything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have,,is kind of us flowing through a sea of information,and interacting with it in different ways.,The Web puts information in the form of text and images.,The topology, the geography of the Web is text-to-text links for the most part.,That's one way of organizing information,,but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world,that I think are the important ways that they're very different,and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. 
 The first is that, as I said, the --,well, the first difference for virtual worlds is that,information is presented to you in the virtual world,using the most powerful iconic symbols,that you can possibly use with human beings.,So for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,,but a picture of this is a universal symbol.,Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it.,It's also more memorable if I show you that picture,,and I show you C-H-A-I-R on a piece of paper.,You can do tests that show that you'll remember,that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better.,So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory,,using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives,,you maximally both excite, stimulate,,are able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.,And so virtual worlds are the best way,for us to essentially organize and experience information. 
 And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years --,you know, that 3D, that lifelike environments,are really important in some magical way to us.,But the second thing -- and I think this one is less obvious --,is that the experience of creating, consuming, exploring that information,is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social.,You are always there with other people.,And we as humans are social creatures and must, or are aided by,,or enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others.,It's essential to us. You can't escape it.,When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever,,you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people,,but you can't talk to them.,You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras,on the same page as you, and ask them,,"Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it." 
 That experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example,,is an example of how as social creatures,we want to experience information in that way.,So that second point, that we inherently experience information together,or want to experience it together,,is critical to essentially, kind of,,this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us.,And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so,these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings,that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will,,to be together, to consume information.,You know, mapping in India -- that's such a great example.,Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time.,Asking for advice, rather than any possible way,that you could just statically organize a map. 
 So I think that's another big point.,I think that wherever this is all going,,whether it's Second Life or its descendants, or something broader,that happens all around the world at a lot of different points --,this is what we're going to see the Internet used for,,and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,,so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information,is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,,but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.,Big idea, but I think highly defensible.,So let me stop there and bring John back,,and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.,Thank you. John. That's great. 
 (Applause) 
 John Hockenberry: Why is the creation, the impulse to create Second Life,,not a utopian impulse?,Like for example, in the 19th century,,any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds,were explicitly utopian. 
 Philip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.,Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.,The answer is no, and I think the reason why is because,the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.,That idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen,,only happens in an environment,where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom,at the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,,if you will, that make up the virtual world.,You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,,you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,,is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,,that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it?,Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody,,even if you mean well when you build them.,And what's more, human society, when it's controlled,,when you set out a grand scheme of rules,,a new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever,,that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond,,you know -- I always laughingly say -- the Mall of America, you know,,which is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecture,that, you know, has been built. 
 JH: The Kremlin was pretty big. 
 PR: The Kremlin, yeah. That's true. The whole complex. 
 JH: Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning,in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use,in the creation of their avatars or in communicating,that people actually in practice said, no, I'm not interested in that at all,,and name something that you didn't come up with,that almost immediately people began to demand. 
 PR: I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those.,One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life --,I was really passionate about it.,It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody,and have a more private conversation,,but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.,It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat.,I just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design.,I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective,,and it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately --,I think we've now turned it off, if I remember.,We finally gave up, took it out of the code.,But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this,,which is great relative to the utopian idea.,Second Life originally had 16 simulators. It now has 20,000. 
 So when it only had 16,,it was only about as big as this college campus.,And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub,,we put a disco where you could dance,,and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to,,and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.,And we laid out the zoning, but of course,,people could build all around it however they wanted to.,And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea,that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically,,was instantly and thoroughly ignored,,and like, two months into the whole thing,,-- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time --,I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life,,the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco --,because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it,and put houses on it. And I sold it to them --,I mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big party,and blew up the entire building.,And I remember that that was just so telling, you know,,that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.,When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular -- 
 JH: CBGB's has to close eventually, you know. That's the rule. 
 PR: Exactly. And it -- but it closed on day one, basically, in Internet time.,You know, an example of something -- pregnancy.,You can have a baby in Second Life.,This is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life,,so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course --,Second Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab --,Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.,There is no attempt to structure the experience,,to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.,So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know,,taking two avatars and merging them, or something. 
 But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies,as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so --,I mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know,,what goes on in the overall economy.,And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.,I didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.,When people are given the opportunity to create in the world,,there's really two things they want.,One is fair ownership of the things they create.,And then the second one is -- if they feel like it,,and they're not going to do it in every case, but in many they are --,they want to actually be able to sell that creation,as a way of providing for their own livelihood.,True on the Web -- also true in Second Life.,And so the existence of an economy is critical. 
 JH: Questions for Philip Rosedale? Right here. 
 (Audience: Well, first an observation, which is that you look like a character.) 
 JH: The observation is, Philip has been accused of looking like a character,,an avatar, in Second Life.,Respond, and then we'll get the rest of your question. 
 PR: But I don't look like my avatar. 
 (Laughter) 
 How many people here know what my avatar looks like?,That's probably not very many. 
 JH: Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that, sort of --,PR: No, no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar --,a female avatar -- that I used to be once in a while.,But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps.,Spiky hair -- spikier than this. Kind of orange hair.,Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character.,So, very cool. 
 JH: And your question? 
 (Audience: [Unclear].) 
 JH: The question is, there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life.,It doesn't seem to have its own culture,,and the sort of differences that exist in the real world,aren't translated into the Second Life map. 
 PR: Well, first of all, we're very early,,so this has only been going on for a few years.,And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior,that you see in emerging societies.,So a fair criticism -- is what it is -- of Second Life today is that,it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome, from a cultural standpoint.,That said, the evolution of, and the nuanced interaction that creates culture,,is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world,,and in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life,,65 percent of the people there are not in the United States,,and in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages.,In fact, one of the ways to make money in Second Life,is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body,and they basically, kind of, pop up on your screen,and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish,or one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly,translate spoken -- I'm sorry -- typed text between individuals.,And so, the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot,that's happening inside Second Life is quite --,I think, quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms,in the real world we've ever been able to achieve.,So, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge,,but we still have some years to wait while that happens,,as you would naturally expect. 
 JH: Other questions? Right here. 
 (Audience: What's your demographic?) 
 JH: What's your demographic?,PR: So, the question is, what's the demographic.,So, the average age of a person in Second Life is 32,,however, the use of Second Life increases dramatically,as your physical age increases. So as you go from age 30 to age 60 --,and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life --,this is also not a sharp curve -- it's very, very distributed --,usage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percent,as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not --,many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life,is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing --,I'm just speaking broadly and critically --,it's not very appealing to people that play online video games,,because the graphics are not yet equivalent to --,I mean, these are very nice pictures,,but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent,to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4.,So average age: 32. I mentioned,65 percent of the users are not in the United States.,The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad. 
 There's users from, you know, virtually every country in the world now in Second Life.,The dominant ones are -- if you take the UK and Europe,,together they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life.,In terms of psychographic --,oh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life,,so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.,Women use Second Life, though,,about 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do,,meaning that more men sign up than women,,and more women stay and use it than men.,So that's another demographic fact.,In terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life,are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think,,when you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know,,challenge you to just do this and find out.,But it's not a bunch of programmers.,It's not easy to describe as a demographic.,If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the people,who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay?,Maybe a little bit like that: in other words, people who are early adopters.,They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial.,A lot of them -- about 55,000 people so far -- are cash-flow positive:,they're making money from what -- I mean, real-world money --,from what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build --,still a creative, building things, build-your-own-business,type of an orientation. So, that's it. 
 JH: You describe yourself, Philip, as someone who was really creative,when you were young and, you know, liked to make things.,I mean, it's not often that you hear somebody,describe themselves as really creative.,I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student,who spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible? 
 (Laughter) 
 PR: I was a -- there were times I was a C student. You know, it's funny.,When I got to college -- I studied physics in college --,and I got really -- it was funny,,because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time.,I was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy.,Moved around a bunch -- had that experience too.,So I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world,,and obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something. 
 JH: So you're on your fifth life at this point? 
 PR: If you count, yeah, cities. So -- but I did --,and I didn't do -- I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right.,I wasn't, like, an obsessed -- you know, get A's kind of guy.,I was going to say, I had a great social experience,when I went to college that I hadn't had before,,a more fraternal experience, where I met six or seven other guys,who I studied physics with, and I was very competitive with them,,so then I started to get A's. But you're right: I wasn't an A student. 
 JH: Last question. Right here. 
 (Audience: In the pamphlet, there's a statement -- ) 
 JH: You want to paraphrase that? 
 PR: Yeah, so let me restate that.,So, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement,that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones --,our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities --,and that in fact, much of human life and human experience,may move into the digital realm.,And then that's kind of a horrifying thought, of course.,That's a frightening change, frightening disruption.,I guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I -- 
 JH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying? 
 (Audience: If someone would say to you, I find that disturbing,,what would be your response?) 
 PR: Well, I'd say a couple of things.,One is, it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was.,That is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.,So, no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior,or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes,from connecting us together,,because the basic motive that people have --,to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energy,into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.,So this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change. 
 Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here,,but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober,,disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side,,has to conclude, based on the data,,that with those kinds of economic forces at play,,there is definitely going to be a sea change,,and that change is going to be intensely disruptive,relative to our concept of our very lives and being,,and our identities, as well.,I don't think we can get away from those changes.,I think generally, we were talking about this --,I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it,,being -- surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak,,is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it,,because of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it,,the sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today. 
 It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves, in many ways.,We must learn things and, you know, be more tolerant,,and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative, perhaps,,than we are typically in our real lives.,And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds,,then these changes, though scary -- and, I say, inevitable --,are ultimately for the better,,and therefore something that we should ride out.,But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this,,other than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts,because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.,JH: Philip Rosedale, thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.,I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada,,and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone,,and I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.,But about three years ago I had an art show in New York,,and I titled it "Serious Nonsense.",So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead.,I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,,I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration,from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it --,it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.,And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see. 
 This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors,,and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor --,which you can't see there.,This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book. 
 This is a home-built rocket-propelled car. That's a 1953 Henry J --,I'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo. 
 This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.,You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town. 
 My work is so personal and so strange,that I have to invent my own lexicon for it.,And I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism,",which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.,And they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.,And the peak time for that was the 30s,,because the Depression was so dismal,that anything to get away from the present into the future ...,and technology was going to carry us along. 
 This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days --,I had a huge collection of them from the '30s --,all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses,out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised,and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots,playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour --,it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful. 
 Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.,I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter,,so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.,Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half.,This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.,This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.,That's from a whole catalog -- it's 18 pages or so --,ran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth. 
 Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened --,for good reason, usually.,The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin,based, obviously, on the Hindenburg.,But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.,And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark,,and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.,So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go. 
 This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.,The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter,,but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.,It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.,You needed to know that. 
 The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream.,My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.,This is pitched into the future from 1946,,looking at the day all American families have them.,"There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!" 
 Faux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of -- not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.,It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.,Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion --,so I think that’s a case for serious play. 
 This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining,,recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s,,dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,,but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel,to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away. 
 This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.,The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that. 
 And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.,I think it adds a huge amount.,Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.,They had two machine guns and a cannon,,and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.,They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.,And they had a canary hung inside the thing,to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.,Happy little story, isn't it? 
 This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s,,where you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.,Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there.,I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.,And I love cigars -- there's a cigar billboard down there. 
 And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war.,This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940,,when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons,and buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.,It's a fond memory of times past. 
 Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit,,just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again --,"RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World.",The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages,,says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over,,and it's so safe it carries no insurance.,It's obviously modeled on the Titanic.,But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.,It's just a sick, silly joke. 
 Shamelessly cheap is something, I think -- this will wake you up.,It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi,,and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.,I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page,for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,,and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it.",People wrote in for reprints of that thing. 
 Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.,I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.,I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.,I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m.,,and this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that --,who’s to say? 
 The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it's a very somber place.,I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it. 
 This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.,I couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying,,"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,,please apologize on our website.",Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may. 
 This is the word side of my brain.,(Laughter),I love the word "Eurotrash.",(Laughter),That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs. 
 This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.,If you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.,Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do --,and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist,about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France --,sign of our times, I guess. 
 This is the only fashion cover I've ever done.,It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing --,the title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood.",I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion --,I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane,,and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying:,"Put a strap on it" -- "No, don't put a strap on it" -- "Put a strap on it -- "Don't put a strap on it" --,because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and --,I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe. 
 This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea. 
 This is a big joke.,This is the audition for "King Kong.",(Laughter),People always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?,Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,,in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.,It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.,And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg --,if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.,Her former name was Fay Wray, and so that was --,I didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting." 
 Finally, this was a three-page cover, never done before,,and I don't think it will ever be done again --,successive pages in the front of the magazine.,It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.,You can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough,,you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.,(Applause) 
 Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre.,I would just like to add a crass commercial --,I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches,",a compendium of all the serious play that ever was,,and it’s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores,,tables on the street in October.,So thank you very much.What's happening in genomics,,and how this revolution is about to change everything we know,about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them. 
 If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey,,and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,,you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation,that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.,In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,,using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,,running around and eating and doing each other,figured out they can make things if they used a tool.,And that moved us to the next level. 
 And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular,have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,,and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.,And we've seen many seminal moments.,We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,,and who would have thought back then that every single person,would not have just one computer but probably 20,,in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device --,in your washing machine, your cell phone.,You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.,Then we go along and create the Internet,and connect the world together; we flatten the world. 
 We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now --,these high-powered tools --,that are allowing us to turn the lens inward,into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome. 
 How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?,Heard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days. 
 I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.,It's, sort of, like if you ask people,,Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?,People never want to say, I really don't understand.,So, I will tell you right off of the bat.,You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.,A genome is really a description for nall of the DNA that is in a living organism.,And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.,It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;,it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;,doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.,The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes. 
 And when Watson and Crick in the '50s,first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule --,very long, complicated molecule --,we then started on this journey to understand that,inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,,what we inherit, what diseases we may get.,We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,,that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,,since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.,There is a historical archive. 
 Living in your genome is the history of our species,,and you as an individual human being, where you're from,,going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,,and that's now starting to be understood.,But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.,It is the program. It is the code of life.,It is what makes you function;,it is what makes every organism function.,DNA is a very elegant molecule.,It's long and it's complicated.,Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:,A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.,And with these four letters, you can create a language:,a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.,You know, they are generally put together in pairs,,creating a word or what we call base pairs.,And you would, you know, when you think about it,,four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work. 
 And that may not sound very intuitive,,but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.,Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures,and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.,The language of technology is binary;,you've probably heard that at some point in time.,Everything that happens in digital is converted,,or a representation, of a one and a zero.,So, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music,,that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.,When you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,,and when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone,,and it's going over the network,,your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.,And look at all the complex things and wonderful things,we've been able to create with just a one and a zero. 
 Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,,a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.,So, let's talk about what that means.,So, if you look at a human genome,,they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.,And they mix up in all different fashions,,and that makes you a human being.,If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,,we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.,It's not really all that much data.,I will also tell you we're at least as buggy.,(Laughter) 
 This here is a bug in my genome,that I have struggled with for a long, long time.,When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.,In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,,like cancer, we haven't been able to cure,because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.,We are starting to understand that. 
 So, up to this point we tried to fix it,by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,,which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,,and maybe it's going to make it work.,But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?,What is the code?,What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?,then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.,So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you. 
 We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.,We have about a hundred, 120,000 others,that don't appear to function every day,,but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species,going back tens of thousands of years.,You might also be interested in knowing,that a mouse has about the same amount of genes. 
 They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,,so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity,or the evolutionary order of any particular species.,Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor,,look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.,A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,,different races, cultures. We are all 99.9\% genetically equal.,It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material,that makes the difference between any one of us.,That's a tiny amount of material,,but the way that ultimately expresses itself,is what makes changes in humans and in all species. 
 So, we are now able to read genomes.,The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.,It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.,And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA --,genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.,And if you think about the computer industry,and how we've gone from big computers to little ones,and how they get more powerful and faster all the time,,the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:,we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes,for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;,you will see that happen in the next five years. 
 And what that means is, you are going to walk around,with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.,And when you buy medicine,,you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.,You will give your genome to the pharmacist,,and your drug will be made for you,and it will work much better than the ones that were --,you won't have side effects.,All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,,whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.,They're going to make all that stuff go away. 
 What does a genome look like?,Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.,If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,,but what scientists are doing now is,they're understanding what these do and what they mean.,Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.,In other words, the first couple of sentences here,,assuming this is a grape plant:,make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.,In a human being, down in here it could be:,make blood cells, start cancer.,For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,,because I come from a very cold climate.,For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.,It's all hidden in this code,,and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace. 
 So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,,now that we're starting to have the book of life?,Well, there's many things. Some are exciting.,Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things,that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.,So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms. 
 You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.,You can find out where your relatives come from;,you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.,We can understand functionality. This is really important.,We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,,what creates the starchiness inside of a grain,,why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.,We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,,what creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.,Because we can understand this,,we can fix them, make better organisms. 
 Most importantly, what we're learning,is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.,The toolbox exists.,An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,,and we now have the ability to use it.,We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them. 
 This company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,,created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,,a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.,If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI --,you've come in contact with this little bug.,Very simple -- only has about 246 genes --,but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.,Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,,So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --,does it just boot up and live?,Well, guess what. It does. 
 Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome --,and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,,you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.,It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.,Well, actually, you could do it the other way.,So, you know, by being able to write a genome,and plug it into an organism,,the software, if you will, changes the hardware.,And this is extremely profound. 
 So, last year the French and Italians announced,they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.,The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,,and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.,They have discovered pathways that create flavors,,although it's very important to understand,that those compounds that it's cranking out,have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,,for us to understand and interpret those flavors. 
 They've also discovered that,there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.,They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.,They now are understanding, and the work is going on,,exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,,to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.,So, then what do you do?,Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,,maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?,Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.,(Laughter) 
 We can build a better vine.,By the way, just so you know:,you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;,there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere,that is not genetically modified.,They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;,they would not exist in nature on their own. 
 So, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.,So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;,we can go for higher yields without necessarily having,dramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.,We could conceivably expand the climate window:,we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.,(Laughter) 
 We could produce better flavors and aromas.,You want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?,All of these things could conceivably be done,,and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.,But there's an ecosystem here.,In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;,we are part of a big ecosystem. 
 In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you --,that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes,which you're circulating through your body quite a bit.,Our ocean's teaming with microbes;,in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,,in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet,by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.,We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate,and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,,which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere. 
 We find microbial life in every part of the planet:,in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.,But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,,as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,,it is the ecosystem around them,,it is the microbes that live in their root systems,,that have just as much impact on the character of those plants,as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves. 
 If you take a closer look at a root system,,you will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.,This is not big news to viticulturists;,they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.,And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:,you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.,You don't necessarily know with granularity,exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.,We can start to figure that out.,We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir;,we say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.,I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe. 
 Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it --,we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?,We can figure out what the heck terroir is.,It's in there, waiting to be sequenced.,There are thousands of microbes there.,They're easy to sequence: unlike a human,,they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;,we can figure out what they are. 
 All we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs,,sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like --,that's just a big database -- and then fertilize.,And then we understand what is terroir.,So, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?,Are we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?,And, you know, people would always ask James Watson --,he's not always the most politically correct guy ...,(Laughter),... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?",And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:,"Well, somebody has to.",(Laughter) 
 I consider myself a very spiritual person,,and without, you know, the organized religion part,,and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.,I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.,I told you I'm going to make some of you puke.,It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.,They're here. They're in the universe.,We reorganize things, we change them around,,but we don't make anything unnatural. 
 Now, we can create bad impacts --,we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth --,but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.,So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,,and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.,There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.,There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast.,These are chemical factories;,the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,,and we now can use those.,There also is a set of rules. 
 Nature will not allow you to --,we could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.,We can't make the grape plant produce babies.,Nature has put a set of rules out there.,We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules;,we're just learning what the rules are.,I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease --,if you could make disease go away,,because we understand how it actually works,,if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants,that grow in very hard-to-grow environments,,if we could create clean and plentiful energy --,we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,,have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide,and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.,So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.,Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,,you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.,We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;,we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.,If we could, would we?,Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple:,working with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand,,is the next step in humankind's evolution. 
 And all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.,If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300. 
 Thank you.There are more Chinesenrestaurants in this country,than McDonald's, Burger King, KentuckynFried Chicken and Wendy's, combined --,40,000, actually.,Chinese restaurants have playednan important role in American history,,as a matter of fact.,The Cuban missile crisis was resolvednin a Chinese restaurant,called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,,which unfortunately is closed now,,and about to be turned into Walgreen's.,And the house where John Wilkes Booth,planned the assassinationnof Abraham Lincoln,is also now a Chinese restaurantncalled Wok and Roll,,on H Street in Washington. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's not completely gratuitous,,because "wok" and "roll" --nChinese food and Japanese foods,,so it kind of works out.,And Americans loventheir Chinese food so much,,they've actually brought it into space.,NASA, for example, servesnthermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork,on its shuttle menu for its astronauts. 
 So, let me present the question to you:,If our benchmarknfor Americanness is apple pie,,you should ask yourself:nhow often do you eat apple pie,,versus how often do you eat Chinese food? 
 (Laughter) 
 And if you think about it,,a lot of the foods that we or Americansnthink of as Chinese food,are barely recognizable to Chinese.,For example: beef with broccoli,negg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,,fortune cookies, chop suey,nthe take-out boxes.,For example, I took a whole bunchnof fortune cookies back to China,,gave them to Chinesento see how they would react. 
 [What is this?] 
 [Should I try it?] 
 [Try it!] 
 [What is this called?] 
 [Fortune cookie.] 
 (Laughter) 
 [There's a piece of paper inside!] 
 (Laughter) 
 [What is this?] 
 [You've won a prize!] 
 [What is this?] 
 [It's a fortune!] 
 [Tasty!] 
 So where are they from?,The short answer is, actually,nthey're from Japan.,And in Kyoto, outside, there are stillnsmall family-run bakeries,that make fortune cookies,nas they did over 100 years ago,,30 years before fortune cookiesnwere introduced in the United States.,If you see them side by side,,there's yellow and brown.,Theirs are actually flavorednwith miso and sesame paste,,so they're not as sweet as our version.,So how did they get to the US?,Well, the short answer is,nthe Japanese immigrants came over,,and a bunch of the bakersnintroduced them --,including at least one in Los Angeles,,and one here in San Francisco,ncalled Benkyodo,,which is on the cornernof Sutter and Buchanan.,Back then, they made fortune cookiesnusing very much the similar kind of irons,that we saw back in Kyoto. 
 The interesting question is:,How do you go from fortune cookiesnbeing something that is Japanese,to being something that is Chinese?,Well, we locked up all the Japanesenduring World War II,,including those that made fortune cookies.,So that's when the Chinese moved in,,saw a market opportunity and took over. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, fortune cookies:ninvented by the Japanese,,popularized by the Chinese,,but ultimately consumed by Americans.,They're more American than anything else. 
 Another of my favorite dishes:,General Tso's Chicken --nwhich, by the way, in the US Naval Academy,is called Admiral Tso's Chicken. 
 (Laughter) 
 I love this dish.,The original name of my booknwas "The Long March of General Tso.",And he has marched very far indeed,,because he is sweet, he is fried,nand he is chicken --,all things that Americans love. 
 (Laughter) 
 He has marched so far, actually,,that the chef who originallyninvented the dish,doesn't recognize it;nhe's kind of horrified. 
 Video: (In Chinese) 
 Audience: (Laughter) 
 He's in Taiwan right now.,He's retired, deafnand plays a lot of mah–jongg.,After I showed him this, he got up,,and says, "mòmíngqímiào,"nwhich means, "This is all nonsense,",and goes back to play his mah-jonggngame during the afternoon. 
 Another dish, one of my favorites:nbeef with broccoli.,Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;,in fact, it is originallynan Italian vegetable.,It was introduced intonthe United States in the 1800s,,but became popularizednin the 1920s and the 1930s.,The Chinese have their own versionnof broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,,but they've now discoverednAmerican broccoli,,and are importing itnas a sort of exotic delicacy. 
 I guarantee you, General Tsonnever saw a stalk of broccoli in his life.,That was a picture of General Tso.,I went to his home town.,This is a billboard that says:,"Welcome to the birthplacenof General Tso.",And I went looking for chicken.,Finally found a cow --,and did find chicken.,Believe it or not, these guysnwere actually crossing the road. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I found a whole bunchnof General Tso's relatives,who are still in the town.,This guy is now five generationsnremoved from the General;,this guy is about seven.,I showed them the picturesnof General Tso Chicken,,and they were like,,"We don't know this dish.nIs this Chinese food?",Because it doesn't looknlike Chinese food to them.,But they weren't surprised I travelednaround the world to visit them,,because in their eyes he is, after all,,a famous Qing dynasty military hero.,He played an important rolenin the Taiping Rebellion,,a war started by a guynwho thought he was the son of God,and baby brother of Jesus Christ.,He caused a war that killedn20 million people --,still the deadliest civil warnin the world to this day.,So, you know, I realized when I was there,,General Tso is kind of a lotnlike Colonel Sanders in America,,in that he's knownnfor chicken and not war.,But in China, this guy's actually knownnfor war and not chicken. 
 But the granddaddynof all the Chinese American dishes,we probably ought to talknabout is chop suey,,which was introducednaround the turn of the 20th century.,According to the New York Times in 1904,,there was an outbreaknof Chinese restaurants all over town,,and "... the city has gonen'chop suey' mad.",So it took about 30 yearsnbefore the Americans realized,that chop suey is actuallynnot known in China,,and as this article points out,,"The average native of any city in Chinanknows nothing of chop suey.",Back then it was a way to shownyou were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;,a guy who wanted to impress a girlncould take her on a chop suey date.,I like to say chop sueynis the biggest culinary joke,one culture ever played on another,,because "chop suey,"ntranslated into Chinese,,means "jaahp-seui," which, translatednback, means "odds and ends.",So, these people are goingnaround China asking for chop suey,,which is sort of like a Japanese guyncoming here and saying,,"I understand you havena very popular dish in your country,called 'leftovers.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 And not only that:,"This dish is particularly popular,after that holidaynyou call 'Thanksgiving.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 So, why and where did chop suey come from?,Let's go back to the mid-1800s,,when the Chinese first came to America.,Back then, Americans were notnclamoring to eat Chinese food.,In fact, they saw these peoplenwho landed at their shores as alien.,These people weren't eating dogs,nthey were eating cats.,If they weren't eating cats,nthey were eating rats.,In fact, The New York Times,nmy esteemed employer,,in 1883 ran an article that asked,,"Do Chinese eat rats?",Not the most PC questionnto be asked today,,but if you look at the popularnimagery of the time,,not so outlandish.,This is actually a realnadvertisement for rat poison,from the late 1800s.,And if you see under the wordn"Clears" -- very small --,it says, "They must go,"nwhich refers not only to the rats,,but to the Chinese in their midst,,because the waynthat the food was perceived,was that these people who atenfoods different from us,must be different from us. 
 Another way that you sawnthis antipathy towards the Chinese,is through documents like this.,This is in the Library of Congress.,It's a pamphlet publishednby Samuel Gompers,,hero of our American labor movement.,It's called, "Some Reasonnfor Chinese Exclusion:,Meat versus Rice: American Manhoodnagainst Asiatic Coolieism:,Which shall survive?",And it basically made the argument,that Chinese men who ate rice,would necessarily bring downnthe standard of living,for American men who ate meat.,And as a matter of fact, then,,this is one of the reasonsnwe must exclude them from this country.,So, with sentiments like these,,the Chinese Exclusion Actnwas passed between 1882 and 1902,,the only time in American history,when a group was specifically excluded,for its national origin or ethnicity.,So in a way, becausenthe Chinese were attacked,,chop suey was creatednas a defense mechanism. 
 Who came up with the idea of chop suey?,There's a lot of differentnmysteries and legends,,but of the ones I've found,,the most interestingnis this article from 1904.,A Chinese guy named Lem Sen,shows up in Chinatown,nNew York City, and says,,"I want you all to stop making chop suey,,because I am the original creatornand sole proprietor of chop suey.,And the way he tells it,,there was a famous Chinesendiplomat that showed up,,and he was told to make a dishnthat looked very popular,and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.,And as he said --nwe would never print this today --,but basically, the American mannhas become very rich.,Lem Sen: "I would've made this money, too,nbut I spent all this time,looking for the American mannwho stole my recipe.,Now I've found himnand I want my recipe back,,and I want everyonento stop making chop suey,,or pay me for the right to do the same.,So it was an early exercisenof intellectual property rights. 
 The thing is, this ideanof Chinese-American food,doesn't exist only in America.,In fact, Chinese foodnis the most pervasive food on the planet,,served on all seven continents,neven Antarctica,,because Monday night is Chinesenfood night at McMurdo Station,,which is the main scientificnstation in Antarctica.,You see different varietiesnof Chinese food.,For example, there is French Chinese food,,where they servensalt and pepper frog legs.,There is Italian Chinese food,nwhere they don't have fortune cookies,,so they serve fried gelato.,My neighbor, Alessandra,nwas shocked when I told her,,"Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese.",She's like, "It's not? But they serve itnin all the Chinese restaurants in Italy." 
 (Laughter) 
 Even the Brits have their own version.,This is a dish calledn"crispy shredded beef,",which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred,nand not a lot of beef.,There is West Indian Chinese food,nthere's Jamaican Chinese food,,Middle Eastern Chinese food,nMauritian Chinese food.,This is a dish called "Magic Bowl,"nthat I discovered.,There's Indian Chinese food,nKorean Chinese food,,Japanese Chinese food,,where they take the bao, the little buns,nand make them into pizza versions. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they totally randomlyntake Chinese noodle dishes,,and just ramenize them.,This is something that,nin the Chinese version, has no soup.,So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,,which should not be mixednwith Mexican Chinese food,,where they basically take thingsnand make it look like fajitas. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they have thingsnlike risotto chop suey.,My personal favoritenof all the restaurants,I've encountered around the world,was this one in Brazil,ncalled "Kung Food." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, let's take a step back and understand,what is to be appreciated in America.,McDonald's has garneredna lot of attention, a lot of respect,,for basically standardizing the menu,ndecor and dining experience,in post-World War II America.,But you know what?,They did so through a centralizednheadquarters out of Illinois.,Chinese restaurants have done largelynthe same thing, I would argue,,with the menu and the decor,neven the restaurant name,,but without a centralized headquarters.,So, this actually became very clear to me,with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,,where they expected, basednon the number of ticket sales they had,,to have three or fournsecond-place winners,,people who matchnfive or six Powerball numbers.,Instead, they had 110,nand they were completely shocked. 
 They looked all across the countrynand discovered it couldn't be fraud,,since it happened in different states,nacross different computer systems.,Whatever it was, it caused peoplento behave in a mass-synchronized way.,So, OK, maybe it had to donwith the patterns on the pieces of paper,,like it was a diamond, or diagonal.,It wasn't that, so they're like,nOK, let's look at television.,So they looked at an episode of "Lost.",Now, I don't have a TV,,which makes me a freak,nbut very productive -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And there's an episode of "Lost"nwhere one guy has a lucky number,,but it's not a lucky number,nit's why he's on the island,,but they lookednand the numbers did not match.,They looked at "The Youngnand The Restless." It wasn't that, either.,It wasn't until the first guy shows upnthe next day and they ask him,,"Where did you get your number?",He said, "I got it from a fortune cookie.",This is a slip one of the winners had,,because the Tennesseenlottery security officials,were like, "Oh, no, this can't be true.",But it was true.,Basically, of those 110 people,,104 of them or so had gottenntheir number from a fortune cookie. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. So I went and started looking.,I went across the country,nlooking for these restaurants,where these people had gottenntheir fortune cookies from.,There are a bunch of them,nincluding Lee's China in Omaha --,which is actually run by Koreans,nbut that's another point,,and a bunch of them named "China Buffet.",What's interesting is that their storiesnwere similar, but different.,It was lunch, it was take-out,nit was sit-down, it was buffet,,it was three weeks ago,nit was three months ago.,But at some point, all these peoplenhad a very similar experience,that converged at a fortune cookienand a Chinese restaurant.,And all these restaurantsnwere serving fortune cookies,,which, of course,naren't even Chinese to begin with.,It's part of the phenomenonnI called "spontaneous self-organization,",where, like in ant colonies,nlittle decisions made on the micro level,actually have a big impactnon the macro level. 
 A good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.,McDonald's actually spent 10 yearsncoming out with a chicken-like product.,They did chicken pot pie, fried chicken,nand finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.,And the great innovation of ChickennMcNuggets was not nuggifying them,,that's kind of an easy concept.,The trick was, they were ablento remove the chicken from the bone,in a cost-efficient manner,,which is why it took so longnfor people to copy them -- 10 years,,then within a couple months,nit was such a hit,,they introduced it across the entirenMcDonald's system in the country. 
 In contrast is General Tso's Chicken,,which actually startednin New York City in the early 1970s,,as I was also started in this universenin New York City in the early 1970s. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this logo!,So me, General Tso's Chickennand this logo are all karmicly related.,But that dish also took about 10 yearsnto spread across America,from a restaurant in New York City.,Someone's like, "It's sweet,nit's fried, it's chicken --,Americans will love this." 
 So what I like to say,nthis being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,,is that we think of McDonald's as sortnof the Microsoft of dining experiences.,We can think of Chinesenrestaurants perhaps as Linux,,sort of an open-source thing, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Where ideas from one personncan be copied and propagated,across the entire system,,that there can be specializednversions of Chinese food,,depending on the region.,For example, in New Orleansnwe have Cajun Chinese food,,where they serve Sichuan alligatornand sweet and sour crawfish.,And in Philadelphia,nyou have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,,which is like an egg roll on the outsidenand cheesesteak on the inside.,I was surprised to discover that not onlynin Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.,What had happened was,,a Chinese family had movednfrom Philadelphia to Atlanta,,and brought that with them. 
 So the thing is,,our historical lore,nbecause of the way we like narratives,,is full of vast characters,nsuch as Howard Schultz of Starbucks,and Ray Kroc with McDonald's,and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.,But, you know, it's very easynto overlook the smaller characters.,For example, Lem Sen,nwho introduced chop suey,,Chef Peng, who introducednGeneral Tso's Chicken,,and all the Japanese bakersnwho introduced fortune cookies.,So, the point of my presentationnis to make you think twice;,that those whose namesnare forgotten in history,can often have had as much, if not more,,impact on what we eat today. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,,and it's made with a new technique,that I've been playing around with,,and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,,we call the epoxy method.,And I call it an epoxy method because --,it's not very appetizing. I understand that --,but -- but,if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?,It's two resins that are, sort of,,in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue,,but when you put the two together,,something happens. A bond takes place,,and you get this very strong, powerful,adhesive.,Well, in this technique,,what I've tried to do is kind of,gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world,,the artisan bread-baking community,,has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so --,since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America --,and put it together to come up with a method,that would help to take whole-grain breads.,And let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.,We finally, after 40 years of knowing,that wholegrain was a healthier option,,we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over,and attempting to actually eat them. 
 (Laughter) 
 The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is,,you know, how do you make it taste good?,Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour,to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.,It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down --,what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.,So a baker, and a good baker,,knows how to pull or draw forth,the inherent sugar trapped in the starch.,With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.,You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,,or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,,for the bran is fiber.,It's got germ. Those are the good things,,but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.,So whole grain breads historically,have had sort of this onus of being health food breads,,and people don't like to eat,,quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,,but when we think of something as a health food,,we think of it as something we eat out of obligation,,not out of passion and love for the flavor. 
 And ultimately, the challenge of the baker,,the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,,is to deliver flavor.,Flavor is king. Flavor rules.,I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.,And -- and,you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,,but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?,So, this is the challenge for this bread.,We're going to try this at lunch, and,I'll explain a bit more about it,,but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --,this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor,is to make a piece of dough,the day before that is not leavened.,It's just dough that is wet.,It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" --,that helps to start enzyme activity.,And enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough,that brings out flavor.,It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.,That's what enzymes are doing.,And so, if we can release some of those,,they become accessible to us in our palate.,They become accessible to the yeast as food.,They become accessible to the oven for caramelization,to give us a beautiful crust. 
 The other pre-dough,that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.,And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga",or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,,and that starts to develop flavor also.,And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.,And we're hoping that, sort of, the,enzyme piece of dough,becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,,and when we put them together and add the final ingredients,,we can create a bread that does evoke,the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.,That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we --,in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages. 
 I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.,Okay, we're going to start with the first stage.,And this is what every student has to begin with.,Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that,the first stage of cooking is "mise en place,",which is just a French way of saying, "get organized.",Everything in its place. First stage.,So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients.,Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.,We have to develop the gluten.,There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.,Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy,because we've got glutenin and gliadin,,neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.,But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,,they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.,And so we, in the mixing process,,have to develop the gluten,,we have to activate the leaven or the yeast,,and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly. 
 Then we get into fermentation, the third stage,,which is really where the flavor develops.,The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,,creating carbon dioxide and alcohol --,essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.,It's yeast burps and sweat.,And somehow, this is transformed --,the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed --,and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special,is that it is a transformational food,,and we're going to explore that in a minute.,But then, quickly through the next few stages.,We, after it's fermented and it's developed,,started to develop flavor and character,,we divide it into smaller units.,And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,,usually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.,That's called "rounding." 
 And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.,It can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.,Then we go into final shaping,,"panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.,This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.,It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.,And then, stage nine.,The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing,through all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.,The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.,We call it "proofing.",Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.,And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,,and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.,Three transformations take place in the oven.,The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.,They give us that beautiful brown crust.,Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.,Inside, the proteins --,this gluten -- coagulates.,When it gets to about 160 degrees,,the proteins all line up nand they create structure,,the gluten structure --,what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.,And the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,,gelatinize. 
 And gelatinization is yet another,oven transformation.,Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization --,when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,,they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst.,And they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.,So basically now we're eating yeast sweats --,sweat, burps and starch guts.,Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven,because what went into the oven as dough,comes out in stage 11 as bread.,And stage 11, we call it cooling --,because we never really eat the bread right away.,There's a little carry-over baking.,The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.,And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,",but my students call "eating.",And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,,and in a few minutes we will try this,,and see if we have succeeded,in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor. 
 But I want to go back now and revisit these steps,,and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,,because I really believe that,all things can be understood --,and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients --,that all things can be understood on four levels:,the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,,the political or ethical level.,And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.,It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.,In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels,unless you first understand the literal level,,so that's why we're talking literally about bread.,But let's kind of look at these stages again,from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level --,all in my quest for answering the question,,"What is it about bread that's so special?",And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor. 
 Because what happens is,,bread begins as wheat or any other grain.,But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass,that grows in the field.,And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.,And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.,Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting?,It's just a euphemism for killing, right?,I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?,Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.,We harvest the wheat,,and in harvesting it, we kill it.,Now, wheat is alive,,and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.,Now, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.,We can plant those in the ground.,And we save some of those for the next generation.,But most of those seeds get crushed,and turned into flour.,And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.,It's not only been killed,,but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.,So we turn it into flour. 
 So as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.,The first transformation -- and, by the way,,the definition of transformation for me is,a radical change from one thing into something else.,O.K.? Radical, not subtle.,Not like hot water made cold,,or cold water turned hot,,but water boiled off and becoming steam.,That's a transformation, two different things.,Well, in this case, the first transformation,is alive to dead.,I'd call that radical.,So, we've got now this flour.,And what do we do? We add some water.,In stage one, we weigh it.,In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together,,and we create something that we call "clay.",It's like clay.,And we infuse that clay,with an ingredient that we call "leaven.",In this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?,Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven --,to vivify, to bring to life.,By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.,You see, the baker, in this moment,,has become, in a sense,,sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well,,while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.,And we know it's alive because in stage three,,it grows. Growth is the proof of life. 
 And while it's growing, all these,literal transformations are taking place.,Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.,Yeast is eating sugar and,turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.,Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,,turning them into acids.,In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough,under the watchful gaze of the baker.,And the baker's choices all along the way,determine the outcome of the product.,A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time --,it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature,and ingredients. That's the art of baking.,So all these things are determined by the baker,,and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.,And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough,is divided into smaller units, and each of those units,are given shape by the baker.,And as they're shaped, they're raised again,,all along proving that they're alive,,and developing character. 
 And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.,It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough --,a few people do, I think, but not too many.,I've met some dough eaters, but --,it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.,But dough is what we're working with,,and we take that dough to the oven,,and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough,crosses the threshold of 140 degrees,,it passes what we call the "thermal death point.",Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.,But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.,The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,,to enliven it, to vivify it,,in order to complete its mission,,which is also to turn this dough into bread,,has to give up its life.,So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.,It's starting to make sense to me --,what goes in is dough,,what comes out is bread --,or it goes in alive,,comes out dead.,Third transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.,Second transformation, dead brought back to life.,Third transformation, alive to dead --,but dough to bread. 
 Or another analogy would be,,a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.,And it's what comes out of the oven,that is what we call the staff of life.,This is the product,that,everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.,It's so,deeply embedded in our psyches that,bread is used as a symbol for life.,It's used as a symbol for transformation.,And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,,again completing the life cycle,,you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that --,it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on,and have opportunities to ponder,things like this.,So this is what I've learned from bread.,This is what bread has taught me in my journey.,And what we're going to attempt to do,with this bread here, again,,is to use, in addition to everything we talked about,,this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread",because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.,Beer is basically liquid bread,,or bread is solid beer.,And --,(Laughter),they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.,And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep,in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread. 
 But we've got this bread,,and what I did here is to try to, again,,evoke even more flavor from this grain,,was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.,And if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.,I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain,that's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort --,a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.,In other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains,by using sprouting and malting and roasting.,We're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.,So now we not only have a high-fiber bread,,but now fiber on top of fiber.,And so this is, again, hopefully,not only a healthy bread,,but a bread that you will enjoy.,So, if I, kind of, break this bread,,maybe we can share this now a little bit here.,We'll start a little piece here,,and I'm going to take a little piece here --,I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.,I'll leave you,with what I call the baker's blessing.,May your crust be crisp,,and your bread always rise.,Thank you.I went to Spain a few months ago,and I had the best foie gras of my life.,The best culinary experience of my life.,Because what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.,Ridiculous, right?,Foie gras and the future of cooking.,There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?,I mean, it's crucified.,It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.,It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.,It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,,you risk being attacked.,Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef. 
 I'm not saying that there's not a rationale,for being opposed to foie gras.,The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.,Basically you take a goose or a duck,and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.,More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.,Its liver expands by eight times.,Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming. 
 The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.,(Laughter),I mean, I love the stuff.,It is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.,It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.,Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras?,Yes, sure.,You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?,(Laughter),Not a lot of people are doing it.,And for good reason.,(Laughter) 
 So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,,Eduardo Sousa.,Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.,Natural foie gras.,What's natural about foie gras?,To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,,geese and ducks gorge on food,to prepare for the harsh realities of winter.,And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land,and eat what they want.,So no gavage, no force feeding,,no factory-like conditions, no cruelty. 
 And it's shockingly not a new idea.,His great-granddad started -- Patería de Sousa -- in 1812.,And they've been doing it quietly ever since.,That is until last year,,when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,,the coveted French gastronomic prize.,It's like the Olympics of food products.,He placed first for his foie gras.,Big, big problem.,As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.,(Laughter),He said it sort of gleefully. 
 It was all over the papers.,I read about it. It was in Le Monde.,"Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him.,"Spanish chef accused of cheating.",They accused him of paying off the judges.,They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.,Huh, amazing.,A huge scandal for a few weeks.,Couldn't find a shred of evidence.,Now, look at the guy.,He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges,for his foie gras.,So that died down, and very soon afterward,,new controversy.,He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.,It's not foie gras because it's not gavage.,There's no force feeding.,So by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified. 
 As funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it --,actually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,,I would have said, "That's kind of true.",You know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage,,and that's what you get when you want foie gras.,That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,,50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.,I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex,and then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,,is utterly simple.,And he said to me, really from the first moment,,my life's work is to give the geese what they want.,He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.,I'm just here to give the geese what they want.,Actually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone,taking pictures of them,like his children in the grass.,Amazing.,He's really just in love with -- he's at one with --,he's the goose whisperer.,(Laughter) 
 And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,,like I'm speaking to you now, right,,but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,,because the more I got to know him and his system,,the more exciting this whole idea became.,He kept going like this to me.,And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?,I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever,,so you know, I slowed down.,And finally, by the end of the day I was like,,Ed-uar-do, you know like this?,But he was still going like this.,I figured it out.,I was speaking too loudly.,So I hushed my voice.,I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator,in kind of a half whisper.,And he stopped doing this.,And amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around --,"Get the hell away from this kid!" --,when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.,Right up to us, like right up to here.,Right along the fence line. 
 And fence line was amazing in itself.,The fence -- like this conception of fence that we have,it's totally backward with him.,The electricity on this fiberglass fence,is only on the outside.,He rewired it. He invented it.,I've never seen it. Have you?,You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.,He doesn't.,He electrifies only the outside.,Why?,Because he said to me that he felt like the geese --,and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this --,the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.,Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden,with figs and everything else.,He felt like they felt manipulated.,So he got rid of the electricity,,he got rid of current on the inside,and kept it on the outside,,so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators. 
 Now, what happened?,They ate, and he showed me on a chart,,how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.,The landscape is incredible.,I mean, his farm is incredible.,It really is the Garden of Eden.,There's figs and everything else there for the taking.,And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area --,what does Extremadura mean?,Extra hard land, right?,Extra difficult. Extra hard.,But over four generations, he and his family,have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.,Upgrades the life for these geese.,And they are allowed to take whatever they want. 
 Another irony, the double irony,is that on the figs and the olives,,Eduardo can make more money selling those,than he can on the foie gras.,He doesn't care.,He lets them take what they want and he says,,"Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair.",The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.,Part of the income for his farm.,A big part of his income for his farm.,But he never controls it.,They get what they want,,they leave the rest for me and I sell it. 
 His biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,,which demands these days bright yellow foie gras.,That's how I've been trained.,You want to look and see what good foie gras is,,it's got to be bright yellow.,It's the indication that it's the best foie gras.,Well, because he doesn't force feed,,because he doesn't gavage tons of corn,,his livers were pretty grey.,Or they were.,But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.,The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.,He let it go to seed, he took the seeds,,he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.,And the geese love the Lupin bush.,Not for the bush, but for the seeds.,And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.,Radioactive yellow.,Bright yellow.,Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.,(Laughter) 
 So I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like,,is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?,Is he like, you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything,,and it was always nature.,It was never him.,And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,,weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.,Because, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?,But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity,into working with his landscape. 
 So it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,,but increasingly, eating up his every word.,And we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.,And he grabs my arm and the translator's,,and ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this.","Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.,"Shush, watch this.",And this squadron of geese come over.,[Clapping],And they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.,And like airport traffic control, as they start to go past us,they're called back -- and they're called back and back and back.,And then they circle around.,And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.,[Clapping],And the wild geese are calling down.,[Clapping],And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle,and they land.,And I'm just saying, "No way.",(Laughter),No way. 
 And I look at Eduardo, who's near tears looking at this,,and I say, "You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese,to say come for a visit?",And he says, "No, no, no.,They've come to stay.",They've come to stay?,(Laughter),It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?,I said that. I said "Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for?,To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?",He said, "No, no, no.,Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.,To happiness.,They find it here.,They don't need anything more.",They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,,and his flock continues.,Think about that for a minute.,It's brilliant, right?,Imagine -- I don't know, imagine a hog farm,in, like, North Carolina,,and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm,and decides to stay.,(Laughter) 
 So how did it taste?,I finally got to taste it before I left.,He took me to his neighborhood restaurant,and he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.,It was incredible.,And the problem with saying that, of course, is that,you know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.,And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.,I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,,he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,,this guy's a genius, you know?,I'm really in love with him at this point. 
 But it truly was the best foie gras of my life.,So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.,I'd had something that was called foie gras.,But this was transformative. Really transformative.,And I say to you, I might not stick to this,,but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again,because of that taste experience with Eduardo.,It was sweet, it was unctuous.,It had all the qualities of foie gras,,but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty. 
 And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.,And I kept -- I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.,I was sure of it.,And I'm not like some super taster, you know?,But I can taste things.,There's 100 percent star anise in there.,And he says, "No.",And I ended up like going down the spices,,and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,,thinking he's salted and peppered his liver.,But no.,He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,,he sticks them in this jar,and he confits it.,No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.,What? 
 We went back out for the final tour of the farm,,and he showed me the wild pepper plants,and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.,He doesn't need salt and pepper.,And he doesn't need spices, because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors,that his geese love to gorge on.,I turned to him at the end of the meal,,and it's a question I asked several times,,and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly,,but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain,,some of the greatest chefs in the world are --,Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.,How come you don't give him this?,How come no one's really heard of you?",And it may be because of the wine,,or it may be because of my excitement,,he answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras.",(Laughter),And he was right.,He was right. 
 Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.,They create a dish,where all the vectors point at us.,With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.,And as he said, I think fittingly,,it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.,Simple.,I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book,and I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.,I really was moved.,And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes,,is this note that says, when asked,,what do you think of conventional foie gras?,What do you think of foie gras that,99.99999 percent of the world eats?,He said, "I think it's an insult to history.",And I wrote, insult to history.,I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out.,It's like, why didn't I follow up on that?,What the hell does that mean?,Insult to history. 
 So I did some research when I got back,,and here's what I found.,The history of foie gras.,Jews invented foie gras.,True story.,True story.,By accident.,They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.,Gotten sick of the chicken fat.,They were looking for an alternative.,And they saw in the fall that there was this natural,,beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.,And they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.,The Pharaoh got wind of this --,This is true, right off the Internet.,The Pharaoh got -- (Laughter),I swear to God.,(Laughter),The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.,He tasted it and fell in love with it.,He started demanding it. 
 And he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.,And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.,And the Jews, fearing for their life,,had to come up with an ingenious idea,,or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.,And they invented, what? Gavage.,They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,,and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,,and the good stuff they kept for themselves.,Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one. 
 That's the history of foie gras.,And if you think about it,,it's the history of industrial agriculture.,It's the history of what we eat today.,Most of what we eat today.,Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,,long-distance travel, food processing.,All of it, our food system.,That's also an insult to history.,It's an insult to the basic laws of nature,and of biology.,Whether we're talking about beef cattle,or we're talking about chickens,,or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,,or in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish --,which wholesale are going out of business. 
 Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.,It's rooted in extraction.,Take more, sell more, waste more.,And for the future it won't serve us.,Jonas Salk has a great quote.,He said, "If all the insects disappeared,,life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.,If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish." 
 And he's right.,We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.,Really new.,One in which we stop treating the planet,as if it were some kind of business in liquidation.,And stop degrading resources under the guise of,cheap food.,We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.,Farmers that rely on nature,for solutions, for answers,,rather than imposing solutions on nature.,Listening as Janine Benyus,,one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,,"Listening to nature's operating instructions.",That's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.,And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,,is that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,,and for people that care about food and cooking,,is that the most ecological choice for food,is also the most ethical choice for food.,Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.,And it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise,,but almost always, the most delicious choice.,That's serendipitous.,Thank you.,(Applause)I'm just going to play a brief video clip. 
 Video:,On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold,for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.,The buyer,was Kip Forbes,,son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.,The original owner of the bottle turned out to be,one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.,Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,,the prince of any wine cellar. 
 Benjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an event,that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.,And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.,In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world,that he had made this incredible discovery.,Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,,and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --,apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.,He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,,he would not revealnexactly where the building was,and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.,The mystery persisted for about 20 years. 
 It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.,Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,,and he became suspicious.,And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI,and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.,There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,,and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes. 
 But for those 20 years,,an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures,in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.,I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine,in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,,must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.,I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of,you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,,not only on wine but on lots of things,,and are they living a better life than me? 
 So, I decided to embark on a quest.,With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,,I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item,in about a dozen categories,,which was a very grueling quest, nas you can imagine. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was the first one.,A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.,It may come from Wagyu cattle,,but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.,There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,,and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.,I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.,And it arrived, and it was tiny.,And I was outraged.,It was like, 160 dollars for this?,And then I took a bite,,and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.,It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.,I almost couldn't finish it.,I was really happy when I was done. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the photographer who took the pictures for this project,for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,,so that's why you're going to see this recurring character.,Which, I guess, you know, communicates to you,that I did not think that one was really worth the price. 
 White truffles.,One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.,To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant,in Manhattan -- Del Posto.,The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob,and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,,"Would Signore like the truffles?",And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.,It's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.,It's in the smell.,These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,,this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.,10 seconds passed and it was gone.,And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,,you know, their purpose had been served,,and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.,There were several -- several of these items were disappointments. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah.,The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there. 
 (Laughter) 
 They did give me a tour, though.,And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.,It has 360-degree views.,It has four balconies.,It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.,It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.,It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.,When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.,30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel. 
 This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,,which have antibacterial properties.,I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.,And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,,but I have to say that nobody here,has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today. 
 (Laughter) 
 But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.,These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you,,not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,,I have not gotten a compliment from anybody,in the months that I have owned and worn these.,I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment,should be the test of something's value,,but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,,that's a reasonable benchmark.,That said, a lot of work goes into these.,They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton,that has been shuttle loomed,and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.,But no compliments. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil,from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.,And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.,He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,,he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.,And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,,he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,,so you can go online and look at your batch number,and see how the phenolics are developing,,and, you know, gauge its freshness.,I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.,It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.,It was very green, it was very peppery.,But in the blind taste test, it came in last.,The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of,Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove,for six months. 
 (Laughter) 
 A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan --,you'll start to notice. 
 I don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,,but I did interview a guy who owns them.,Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll say,these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed,and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know,,you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.,You're paying for the bling,,that they're encrusted with gold and platinum.,The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say,that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ... 
 Oh, yeah, you know this one?,This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.,The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.,It's a cat that lives in trees,,and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.,And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,,hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.,And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,,and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings,then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results,and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it,in the unprocessed form.,That's right. 
 Unrelatedly -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Japan is doing crazy things with toilets. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.,There's one with a fragrance dispenser.,There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl,and transmits the results via email to your doctor.,It's almost like a home medical center --,and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.,This one does not have those bells and whistles,,but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.,And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner,,but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,,and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.,It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.,The seat is preheated.,There's a water jet that cleans you.,There's an air jet that dries you.,You get up, it flushes by itself.,The lid closes, it self-cleans.,Not only is it a technological leap forward,,but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.,I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.,And I want to get one of these. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was another one I could not get a loaner of.,Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.,There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,,each buyer gets their name engraved on it. 
 (Laughter) 
 To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife,spend the night in the Manhattan showroom.,Lights glaring in off the street,,and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.,But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.,And you spend a third of your life in bed.,I don't think it's that bad of a deal. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was a fun one.,This is the fastest street-legal car in the world,and the most expensive production car.,I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,,a professional race car driver,,and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles,and down on the Pacific Coast Highway.,And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight,the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.,And it was really amazing.,It was such a smooth ride.,Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.,I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,,"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour.",And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people,you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,,because it was just that smooth.,And if I was a billionaire, I would get one. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show,of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.,This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.,When he tries to open the door,,you could call it "Mission: Impossible IV." 
 There was one object that I could not get my hands on,,and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.,The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.,And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux,in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.,And 1947 was a legendary vintage,,especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.,And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura,that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.,But it's 60 years old.,There's not much of it left.,What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --,it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.,Not that many people are looking to pop open,their one remaining bottle for a journalist. 
 So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.,I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,,and it was coming up empty.,And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.,Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist,who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,,and he said, "I've got a tasting coming up,where we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc.",And it was going to be a double vertical --,it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,,and 30 vintages of Yquem.,And it was an invitation you do not refuse.,I went. 
 It was three days, four meals.,And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.,And you know, it had this fragrant softness,,and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.,And then I tasted it, and it,,you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,,which is characteristic of that wine --,that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.,There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.,There were some people who were a little less impressed.,And I wasn't that impressed.,And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --,so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,,but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.,And it wasn't just to that wine.,Any one of the wines served at this tasting,,if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,,the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.,But drinking 60 great wines over three days,,they all just blurred together,,and it became almost a grueling experience. 
 And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study,which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.,And they gave subjects the same wine,,labeled with different price tags.,A lot of people, you know,,said that they liked the more expensive wine more --,it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one,that was more expensive.,But what was unexpected was that these researchers did,MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,,and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more --,their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure,from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag. 
 Thank you.What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,,is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,,and then nod to the person on your left.,(Laughter),Now, chances are that over the last winter,,if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people,you just nodded at would have died.,Now, that's an awful lot of bees.,And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent,of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter. 
 Now, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.,And most of those losses are because of things we know.,We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced,and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,,which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.,And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.,And below, you can see all these out yards,,or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,,and then they're shipped out to the almonds.,And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months,after I was here, described this not as beehives,but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them. 
 Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences,to say that we have been trying to figure out,what the cause of this is.,And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.,And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.,In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,,this flu was caused by a new virus to us,,or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.,It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,,and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,,of course, there's the implication.,But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.,It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses,or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,,and the question that keeps us up at night,,is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,,and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?,And we don't have the answer to that yet,,and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.,We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.,We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team,that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides,in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives,have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these,very strange things that we can't begin to understand. 
 And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.,Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,,beekeepers can replace them very quickly.,And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.,If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,,the National Guard would be out.,But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,,they can split that colony in two.,And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.,It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,,and you can introduce that queen.,And in fact, America was the first country,that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,,it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail,in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.,If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,,a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,,the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,,you know, your three-pound packages of bees.,And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.,So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,,and so they've been able to cover those losses.,So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,,the same number of colonies have existed in the country,,at about 2.4 million colonies. 
 Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts,,and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.,And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,,because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.,If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone,from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,,to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco,backyard pig farmer.,(Laughter),And you get all of these people in the same room,,and they're all engaged and they're getting along,,and they're all there because of the passion for bees.,Now, there's another part of that community,which are the commercial beekeepers,,the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.,And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,,intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.,They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world. 
 I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.,And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.,I mean, there may be 100 explanations,for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,,but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.,But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,,and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.,No formal education, but very knowledgeable.,We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,,he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen,from cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,,right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring. 
 We also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.,He's the one who first identified this condition,and raised the alarm bells.,And he has a history of these trucks,,and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.,And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,,and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.,The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,,so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.,And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder,is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.,And you can do that one year in a row,,you may be able to do it two years in a row.,But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,,you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried,about losing this segment of our industry. 
 And that's important for many fronts,,and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.,And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.,You know, they pick up their hives;,they move their families once or twice in a year.,And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,,that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.,And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,,and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.,And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café,at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.,And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees,into the almond groves.,They all have their breakfast,and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,,and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,,because that's quite essential American experience.,And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,,father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.,And they're not people who like to ask for help,,although they are the most helpful people ever.,If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,,everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives,to help him replace those lost colonies.,And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,,historic and exciting community to be involved with. 
 Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.,And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.,I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,,and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.,But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat,is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.,Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact,that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning --,a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,,I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,,jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee --,and had we taken out all those ingredients,,-- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola --,if we had taken out all those ingredients,the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,,we wouldn't have much on our plate.,So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,,but clearly our diet would be diminished.,It's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,,and for flowers bees are the messengers of love. 
 And that's a really great expression, because really,,bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know --,they get paid for their services.,They get paid by pollen and nectar,,to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.,And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't --,the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.,So in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples,of one variety, and then you have another apple tree,that's a different type of pollen.,And bees are very faithful.,When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,,they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.,And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.,They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them,and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom. 
 However, honeybees are a minority.,Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced,with the colonialists.,And there are actually more species of bees,than there are mammals and birds combined.,In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,,and very intensely in the last three years.,We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.,Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.,Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,,but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong,with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating. 
 We have bumblebees on the top.,And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,,because only the queen is, over winter.,We also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.,They're like tiny little flies and they fly around.,And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,,which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering --,what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering --,Audience: Bee?,Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.,(Laughter),What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,,they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,,and they collect pollen and make it into a ball,,and they lay an egg on it.,Well, these bees hang out at that hole,,and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,,and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.,And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,,you know that your environment is healthy,,because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.,And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators,that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list,are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.,And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,,go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people,to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think,some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined. 
 And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,,but we don't understand these native pollinators,or all those other parts of our community.,And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.,There are other animals that pollinate, like bats,,and bats are in trouble too.,And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,,because there's no money to research the bat problems.,And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.,White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.,If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,,and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco,becoming the population of half of this county in three years.,And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that. 
 But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause,of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:,Nature Deficit Disorder.,And that is that I think that what we have in our society is,,we forgot our connection with nature.,And I think if we reconnect to nature,,we'll be able to have the resources and that interest,to solve these problems.,And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.,And that is, make meadows and not lawns.,And I think we have lost our connection,,and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.,I've had the privilege of living by a meadow,for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.,And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.,It used to be, two, three hundred years ago,,that a lawn was a symbol of prestige,,and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green,actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.,Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.,Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns. 
 And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent,keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.,And so we need to rethink this idea.,In fact, you know, the White House,used to have sheep in front in order to help fund,the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;,it wouldn't be a bad idea.,I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.,I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns,at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.,But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,,because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.,That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.,These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow,over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,,or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that --,and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,,this companion you can have as it matures,and as it has these different fragrances.,And this is a companion,,and this is a relationship that never dries up.,You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.,And I encourage you to look at that. 
 Now, not all of us have meadows,,or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,,grow a meadow in a pot.,Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.,So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,,but a pot in a meadow.,But you can also have this great community of city,or building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live --,This is in Paris where these beekeepers live.,And everyone should open a beehive,,because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.,And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,,I think this is a great way of doing it.,Get a beehive and grow a meadow,,and watch that life come back into your life.,And so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,,we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future --,includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.,And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs,as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees,or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.,And I hope that you experience it,and I hope you tell me about it one day.,So thank you very much for being here. nThank you very much.I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,,and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism.,The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way,and pictures had a powerful influence on me.,Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing,and photographers were telling us another. 
 I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans.,Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.,They not only recorded history -- they helped change the course of history.,Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness,and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,,change became not only possible, but inevitable. 
 It puts a human face on issues which, from afar,,can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.,What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,,happens to ordinary citizens one by one.,And I understood that documentary photography,has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.,It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. 
 My TED wish. There’s a vital story that needs to be told,and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it,and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways,to use news photography in the digital era.,Thank you very much.

 (Video): We're traveling today with,the Minister of Defense of Colombia,,head of the army and the head of the police,,and we're dropping off 650 laptops,today to children,who have no television, no telephone,and have been in a community,cut off from the rest of the world,for the past 40 years. 
 The importance of delivering laptops to this region,is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected,because of the FARC,,the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago,as a political movement and then became a drug movement.,There are one billion children in the world,,and 50 percent of them don't have electricity,at home or at school.,And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan --,75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.,And I don't mean that they drop out of school,in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go. 
 So in the three years,since I talked at TED and showed a prototype,,it's gone from an idea,to a real laptop.,We have half a million laptops today,in the hands of children.,We have about a quarter of a million in transit,to those and other children,,and then there are another quarter of a million more,that are being ordered at this moment.,So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.,That's smaller than I predicted --,I predicted three to 10 million --,but is still a very large number. 
 In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.,It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working,,not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as,a strategic defense issue,in the sense of liberating these zones,that had been completely closed off,,in which the people who had been causing, if you will,,40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings,and assassinations lived. 
 And suddenly,,the kids have connected laptops.,They've leapfrogged.,The change is absolutely monumental,,because it's not just opening it up,,but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.,So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone,,yes, there will be television.,But the kids six to 12 years old,are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages,,so the children grow up,with access to information,,with a window into the rest of the world.,Before, they were closed off. 
 Interestingly enough, in other countries,,it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it,as an engine of economic growth.,And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.,It's not going to happen, you know, in one year,,but it's an important, deeply economic,and cultural change,that happens through children.,Thirty-one countries in total are involved,,and in the case of Uruguay,,half the children already have them,,and by the middle of 2009,,every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop --,a little green laptop. 
 Now what are some of the results?,Some of the results,that go across every single country,include teachers saying,they have never loved teaching so much,,and reading comprehension,measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.,Probably the most important thing we see,is children teaching parents.,They own the laptops. They take them home.,And so when I met with three children from the schools,,who had traveled all day to come to Bogota,,one of the three children brought her mother.,And the reason she brought her mother,is that this six-year-old child,had been teaching her mother,how to read and write.,Her mother had not gone to primary school.,And this is such an inversion,,and such a wonderful example,of children being the agents of change. 
 So now, in closing, people say,,now why laptops?,Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.,The reason you want laptops,is that the word is education, not laptop.,This is an education project, not a laptop project.,They need to learn learning. And then, just think --,they can have, let's say, 100 books.,In a village, you have 100 laptops,,each with a different set of 100 books,,and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.,You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school. 
 Sometimes school is under a tree,,or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,,so you need a collaborative model of learning,,not just building more schools and training more teachers,,which you have to do anyway.,So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One.",Last year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program,,and it generated over 100,000 laptops,that we were then able to give free.,And by being a zero-dollar laptop,,we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.,And that's what we did. We went to Haiti,,we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan,,Ethiopia, Mongolia.,Places that are not markets,,seeding it with the principles of,saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.,And then we can actually roll out large numbers. 
 So think of it this way:,think of it as inoculating children,against ignorance.,And think of the laptop as a vaccine.,You don't vaccinate a few children.,You vaccinate all the children in an area.This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.,You can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy --,and not without reason.,I had a very charming routine at the time,,which was to wait until late in the evening,when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,,doing their crossword puzzles, watching television.,I would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,,rip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,,scream at the top of my lungs and run out,because I was the Incredible Hulk.,(Laughter),Obviously, you see the resemblance.,And this routine went on for some time. 
 When I was seven I went to summer camp.,My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.,And at noon each day,the campers would go to a pond,,where they had floating docks.,You could jump off the end into the deep end.,I was born premature. I was always very small.,My left lung had collapsed when I was born.,And I've always had buoyancy problems.,So water was something that scared me to begin with.,But I would go in on occasion.,And on one particular day,,the campers were jumping through inner tubes,,They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.,So I dove through the inner tube,,and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.,And I tried to come up for air,,and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.,And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.,A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.,From that point onward I was terrified of swimming.,That is something that I did not get over.,My inability to swim has been,one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.,That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk. 
 But there is a happy ending to this story.,At age 31 -- that's my age now --,in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,,and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.,And went from swimming one lap --,so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey,,at about 200 beats per minute heart rate --,I measured it --,to going to Montauk on Long Island,,close to where I grew up,,and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,,getting out and feeling better than when I went in.,And I came out,,in my Speedos, European style,,feeling like the Incredible Hulk. 
 And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,,the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.,More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable,of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,,a world-class language learner,,and a tango champion.,And I would like to share my art.,If I have an art, it's deconstructing things,that really scare the living hell out of me.,So, moving onward. 
 Swimming, first principles.,First principles, this is very important.,I find that the best results in life,are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.,And the turnaround in swimming came,when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --,this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy --,"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race.",So the clock started ticking.,I started seeking out triathletes,because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.,I tried kickboards.,My feet would slice through the water like razors,,I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.,Hand paddles, everything.,Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.,And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,,had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,,said, "I have the answer to your prayers.",And he introduced me to,the work of a man named Terry Laughlin,who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.,That set me on the road to examining biomechanics. 
 So here are the new rules of swimming,,if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.,The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.,So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.,Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem,because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent,of their energy expenditure into forward motion.,The problem is hydrodynamics.,So what you want to focus on instead,is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,,much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.,And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.,The only way you can do that,is to not swim on top of the water.,The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,,at least, submerged naturally. 
 So you end up, number three,,not swimming, in the case of freestyle,,on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.,But actually rotating from streamlined right,to streamlined left,,maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.,So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.,And you can see that he's extending his right arm,below his head and far in front.,And so his entire body really is underwater.,The arm is extended below the head.,The head is held in line with the spine,,so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --,very important, especially for people with lower body fat.,Here is an example of the stroke.,So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.,You can see this is the left extension.,Then you see his left leg.,Small flick, and the only purpose of that,is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.,And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this,,he's not reaching in front and catching the water.,Rather, he is entering the water,at a 45-degree angle with his forearm,,and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.,Incorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.,Not their fault, honestly.,And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.,Below is what most swimmers,will find enables them to do what I did,,which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length,to 11 strokes,in two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.,And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.,I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me. 
 Last thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.,In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is,to turn with body roll,,and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.,And that will get you very far.,That's it. That's really all you need to know. 
 Languages. Material versus method.,I, like many people, came to the conclusion,that I was terrible at languages.,I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,,and the sum total of my knowledge,was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?",And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.,Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and,I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.,So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.,Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.,My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.,You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.,It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.,So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left. 
 I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.,I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.,I met my host family. Things went quite well I think,,all things considered.,My first evening, before my first day of school,,I said to my mother, very politely,,"Please wake me up at eight a.m.",So, (Japanese),But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.,But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m.",(Laughter),You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.,(Laughter) 
 I walked in to school.,And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.,I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been --,because it was Kanji,,Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.,Asked him what this said.,And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,,eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,,Traditional Japanese." And so on.,And so it came to me in waves.,There had been something lost in translation.,The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.,They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students --,the other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.,And that's pretty much my response.,(Laughter) 
 And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.,I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.,I tried every possible book, every possible CD.,Nothing worked until I found this.,This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,,or a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters,as determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.,Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,,to facilitate literacy -- some are required to.,And this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone. 
 As soon as I focused on this material,,I took off.,I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,,about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later --,and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.,Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,,and have continued to apply this material,over method approach to close to a dozen languages now.,Someone who was terrible at languages,,and at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.,This brings us to the point,,which is, it's oftentimes what you do,,not how you do it, that is the determining factor.,This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things --,and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important. 
 You can also do this with grammar.,I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.,Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,,by translating these sentences into past, present, future,,will show you subject, object, verb,,placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.,From that point, you can then, if you want to,,acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.,We can talk about that if anyone in interested.,And now I love languages. 
 So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit --,very important.,You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer.",But no, you'd be wrong,because my body is very poorly designed for most things --,pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.,I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.,And so I ended up walking like this.,I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.,Not very good for ballroom dancing. 
 I found myself in Argentina in 2005,,decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating.,Went in, paid my ten pesos,,walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.,The instructor says, "You are participating.",Immediately: death sweat.,(Laughter),Fight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college --,stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.,I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,,that it exploded in my face,,never to return to the ballroom dancing club.,She comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.,"Okay, come on, grab me.",Gorgeous assistant instructor.,She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.,So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.,And she pulled back, threw down her arms,,put them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,,"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,,and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,",(Laughter),which I found encouraging.,(Laughter),Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.,She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day.",As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,,"Of Mice and Men" style.,And she looked up and said,,"Now that's better.",So I bought a month's worth of classes.,(Laughter) 
 And proceeded to look at --,I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline --,Parkinson's Law,,the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.,So I had a very short deadline for a competition.,I got a female instructor first,,to teach me the female role, the follow,,because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities,that the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.,And then I took an inventory of the characteristics,,along with her, of the,of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.,I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.,I compared the two lists,,and what you find is that there is explicitly,,expertise they recommended, certain training methods.,Then there were implicit commonalities,that none of them seemed to be practicing.,Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,,I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.,Long steps. So a lot of milongueros --,the tango dancers will use very short steps.,I found that longer steps were much more elegant.,So you can have --,and you can do it in a very small space in fact.,Secondly, different types of pivots.,Thirdly, variation in tempo.,These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete,if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years. 
 That photo is of the,semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.,Then one month later, went to the world championships,,made it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,,two weeks later.,I want you to see part of what I practiced.,I'm going to jump forward here.,This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.,His name is Gabriel Misse.,One of the most elegant dancers of his generation,,known for his long steps, and his tempo changes,and his pivots.,Alicia, in her own right, very famous.,So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.,Now what I like about this video,is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together,because of his lead. He had a strong lead.,He didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.,I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,,the strength in my feet, to do that.,So he uses a lead that focuses on,his shoulder girdle and his arm.,So he can lift the woman to break her, for example.,That's just one benefit of that.,So then we broke it down.,This would be an example of one pivot.,This is a back step pivot.,There are many different types.,I have hundreds of hours of footage --,all categorized, much like George Carlin,categorized his comedy.,So using my arch-nemesis,,Spanish, no less, to learn tango. 
 So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.,Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.,More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.,And the best results that I've had in life,,the most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:,what's the worst that can happen?,Especially with fears you gained when you were a child.,Take the analytical frameworks,,the capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.,Apply them to very big dreams. 
 And when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.,When I imagine my life,,what my life would have been like,without the educational opportunities that I had,,it makes me wonder.,I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct,the American public school system,,to either fix it or replace it.,And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far --,built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,,my readers, at this point.,And if any of you are interested in that,,I would love to speak with you.,I know nothing. I'm a beginner.,But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.,And I'm here today to give you,a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,,through what I'm doing now.,I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.,I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.,I've been doing that for about 10 years.,I have a monthly puzzle calendar.,I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.,I did puzzles for "Bejeweled.",(Applause),I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that. 
 So, very first puzzle,,sixth grade, my teacher said,,"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.,I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper,for the board.",I thought this was a great assignment.,And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.,I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet,that's been folded just once.,The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?,One hint: It's not "L.",(Laughter),It could be an "L," of course.,So, what else could it be?,Yeah, a lot of you got it.,Oh yeah. So, clever thing. 
 Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.,I created something new, I was very excited,because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,,but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.,This was something really original. I got hooked.,I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.,Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that. 
 Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?,A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve,and has a right answer.,"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,,which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.,You know, they might have a solution.,It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.,Who designed this?,It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story,so we have to hire writers to make movies. 
 Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.,And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;,many puzzles have more than one.,But as opposed to a couple other forms of play,,toys and games --,by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.,You can create one out of Legos.,You know, you can do anything you want.,Or competitive games like chess where,,well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,,but the goal really is to beat another player. 
 I consider that puzzles are an art form.,They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.,It's a very small form, like a joke,,a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.,At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.,But at best they can reach for something more,and create a memorable impression.,The progression of my career that you'll see,is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact. 
 So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,,is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.,I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.,So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.,This is called a figure-ground illusion.,The artist M.C. Escher exploited that,in some of his wonderful prints.,Here we have "Day and Night.",Here is what I did with figure and ground.,So, here we have "figure" in black.,Here we have "figure" in white.,And it's all part of the same design.,The background to one is the other.,Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground.",But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.,It's all "figure.",(Laughter) 
 A few other things. Here is my name.,And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions.",These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram.",I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have,the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.,Each letter here is one of these digits.,Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.,I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean. 
 Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.,It's the same this way.,And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab,who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.,And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.,(Laughter),And recently in Magic magazine,I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.,So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.,This appears in my puzzle calendar.,Okay, let's go back to the slides.,Thank you very much. 
 Now, those are fun to look at.,Now how would you do it interactively?,For a while I was an interface designer.,And so I think a lot about interaction.,Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,,make the thing on the right.,Now, if you could pick up the black vase,,it would look like the figure on top.,If you could pick up the white area,,it would look like the figure on the bottom.,Well, you can't do that physically,,but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C. 
 And here it is, figure-ground.,The goal here is to take the pieces on the left,and make them so they look like the shape on the right.,And this follows the rules I just said:,any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.,But that is also true of any white area.,So, here we got the white area in the middle,,and you can pick it up.,I'll just go one step further.,So, here is --,here is a couple pieces. Move them together,,and now this is an active piece.,You can really get inside somebody's perception,and have them experience something.,It's like the old maxim of,"you can tell somebody something,and show them, but if they do it they really learn it." 
 Here is another thing you can do.,There is a game called Rush Hour.,This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design,besides Rubik's cube.,So, here we have a crowded parking lot,with cars all over the place.,The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.,It's made by the company Think Fun.,It's done very well. I love this puzzle. 
 Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.,Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.,Okay, so how would you solve this one?,Well, move the blue one out of the way.,Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.,Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.,Now, this one is a little bit trickier.,You know? What do you do here?,The first move is going to be what?,You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.,And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.,Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart. 
 I wanted to make a sequel.,I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way,I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.,I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.,It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,,a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.,In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.,Created a whole bunch of levels for it.,Now I'm making it available to schools.,And it includes exercises that show you,not just how to solve these puzzles,,but how to extract the principles that will let you solve,mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas. 
 So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles,as well as just me creating them.,Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.,You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.,In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.,I got interested in gene sequencing.,And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence,of the base pairs in DNA?",Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,,and then you look for overlaps,,and you basically match them at the edges. And I said,,"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap." 
 So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.,And it has to be solvable in a magazine.,You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.,So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.,And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.,There is only one solution. It's not that hard.,But it takes some persistence.,And when you're done, it makes this design,,which, if you squint, is the word "helix.",So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,,rather than the other way around. 
 Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.,Which way will these fall?,One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.,And depending on which one weighs which amount,,they'll fall different directions.,And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.,I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,,the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,,and you get these peculiar pictures.,Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures?,Gets you thinking about color. 
 Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,,website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.,She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.,So, we're making smart games for social media.,I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.,This is what's going on in the games industry right now.,First of all, you know, for a long time,computer games meant things like "Doom,",where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,,aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games. 
 Well, guess what? That's changing.,"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open,what's called casual games.,And the main players are over 35, and are female.,Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.,And it's a game you play with other people.,It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.,This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming. 
 Now, within that there is some interesting things happening.,There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.,Why? Well, we aging Boomers,,Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,,we're exercising. What about our minds?,Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.,Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.,So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.,A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it. 
 And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.,Everybody now considers themselves a creator,,and not just a viewer.,And what does this add up to?,Here is what we see coming.,It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.,They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.,And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.,I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.,And we decided to combine our skills. 
 Our first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.,This is your first time playing my game. Okay.,Let's see how well we can do. There are three images.,And we have 24 seconds each.,Where is that?,I'll play as fast as I can.,But if you can see it, shout out the answer.,You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?,Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and --,I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.,That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.,Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.,Okay, so that's the lens.,Anybody?,Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?,That's the corner of the whole thing.,Yeah, I've played this image before,,but even when I make up my own puzzles --,and you can put your own images in here.,And we have people all over the world doing that now. 
 There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com,if you want to try it yourself. Thank you.,(Applause)About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article,about a cache of dodo bones that was found,in a pit on the island of Mauritius.,Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island,off the east coast of Madagascar,in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place,where the dodo bird was discovered,and extinguished, all within about 150 years.,Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find,,because it meant that they might finally be able,to assemble a single dodo skeleton. 
 See, while museums all over the world,have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody --,not even the actual Natural History Museum,on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made,from the bones of a single dodo.,Well, this isn't exactly true.,The fact is, is that the British Museum,had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection,up until the 18th century --,it was actually mummified, skin and all --,but in a fit of space-saving zeal,,they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet,and they burned the rest in a bonfire.,If you go look at their website today,,they'll actually list these specimens, saying,,the rest was lost in a fire. 
 Not quite the whole truth. Anyway.,The frontispiece of this article was this photo,,and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown,was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker,,because this photo completely rocked my world.,I became obsessed with the object --,not just the beautiful photograph itself,,and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible,,the wire you can see on the beak there,that the conservator used to put this skeleton together --,there's an entire story here.,And I thought to myself,,wouldn't it be great,if I had my own dodo skeleton?,(Laughter) 
 I want to point out here at this point that,I've spent my life obsessed,by objects and the stories that they tell,,and this was the very latest one.,So I began looking around for --,to see if anyone sold a kit,,some kind of model that I could get,,and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.,No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.,I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons,into my "Creative Projects" folder --,it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.,Any time I have an internet connection,,there's a sluice of stuff moving into there,,everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.,The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington,to celebrate the storming of the Bastille.,Russian nuclear launch key:,The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;,the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,,because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.,Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth --,that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.,This folder has 17,000 photos --,over 20 gigabytes of information --,and it's growing constantly.,And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been,maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,,and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.,I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.,And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,,maybe,,yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull. 
 I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor;,I'm a hard-edged model maker.,You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,,you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" --,especially parts from "Star Wars" --,I can do this stuff all day long.,It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.,But you give me something like this --,my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;,it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" --,this is not my thing --,this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things. 
 However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls,to actually be able to,understand the topology and perhaps replicate it --,I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.,So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.,I grabbed all the reference,,and I found this lovely piece of reference.,This is someone selling this on eBay;,it was clearly a woman’s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.,Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand,,I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.,I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,,along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it,as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,,exactly how long, etc. 
 And over a few hours, I eventually achieved,what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I --,it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room,by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.,I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton;,I just noticed that as I finished this skull,,the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up,was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.,And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years,is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.,I actually understood the mechanics,of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.,And so button by button,,vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.,And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,,a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis. 
 And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,,every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.,This guy -- I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner,with a ruler.,This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,,and I,replicated every last bone and put it in.,And after about six weeks,,I finished, painted, mounted,my own dodo skeleton.,You can see that I even made a museum label for it,that includes a brief history of the dodo.,And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it --,a museum vitrine.,I don't have the room for this in my house,,but I had to finish what I had started. 
 And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.,Again, like I said, my life has been about,being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,,and also making them for myself, obtaining them,,appreciating them and diving into them.,And in this folder, "Creative Projects,",there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on,,projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,,and things that I may just want to find and buy and have,and look at and touch.,But now there was potentially this new category of things,that I could sculpt,that was different, that I -- you know,,I have my own R2D2, but that's --,honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy. 
 And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder,,and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.,Now, this is funny for me:,to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,,because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,,Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.,But in this case,,it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,,it's about the object in and of itself.,And in this case, this object is --,plays on a host of levels. 
 First of all, there's the object in the world.,This is the "Kniphausen Hawk.",It is a ceremonial pouring vessel,made around 1700 for a Swedish Count,,and it is very likely the object from which,Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.,Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.,Built out of words, it is the engine,that drives the plot of his book and also the movie,,in which another object is created:,a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,,inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.,And then there is this fourth level, which is,a whole new object in the world:,the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,,becomes, in its own right,,a whole other thing,,a whole new object of desire. 
 And so now it was time to do some research.,I actually had done some research,a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.,I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,,of the Maltese Falcon on eBay,,and had downloaded enough pictures to actually,have some reasonable reference.,But I discovered,,in researching further,,really wanting precise reference, that,one of the original lead birds,had been sold at Christie's in 1994,,and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller,who had the original Christie's catalogue,,and in it I found this magnificent picture,,which included a size reference.,I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size. 
 I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,,a New Jersey editor, actually found this,resin Maltese Falcon,at a flea market in 1991,,although it took him five years,to authenticate this bird to,the auctioneers' specifications,,because there was a lot of controversy about it.,It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props,about the time the movie was made.,It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,,because I can see it compared to this thing,,and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing,,it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.,In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,,Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this --,I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars --,they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom --,not just a front elevation, but also,a side, rear,and other side elevation. 
 So now, I had all the topology I needed,to replicate the Maltese Falcon.,What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.,So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,,I blew all my reference up to full size,,and then I began cutting out the negatives and using,those templates as shape references.,So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,,and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.,And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,,I worked out and achieved --,working in front of the television and Super Sculpey --,here's me sitting next to my wife --,it's the only picture I took of the entire process.,As I moved through, I achieved,a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.,But again, I am not a sculptor, 
 and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,,I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;,I certainly wasn't able to get it.,So, I went down to my shop,,and I molded it and I cast it in resin,,because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.,Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.,My preference is about 70 coats of this --,matte black auto primer.,I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,,but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface,and I can get it glass-smooth.,Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.,Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that,because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,,and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.,So I was able to actually,screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.,And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light,in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it --,that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.,I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.,And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority,at this point in time, when I'd finished it,,of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few --,this is by far the most accurate,representation of the original Maltese Falcon,than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you, 
 is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.,This is where it gets weird.,Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.,Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer,of the Black Dahlia.,Now, James Ellroy believes,that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,,killed James Elroy's mother.,I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,,during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon,",called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal,,the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon --,one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie --,stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought,it was a publicity stunt for the movie.,John's Grill, which actually,is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon,",is still a viable San Francisco eatery,,counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,,who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,,and he gave them,one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.,And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,,until it got stolen,in January of 2007.,It would seem that the object of desire,only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly. 
 So here I had this Falcon,,and it was lovely. It looked really great,,the light worked on it really well,,it was better than anything that I could achieve,or obtain out in the world.,But there was a problem. And the problem was that:,I wanted the entirety of the object,,I wanted the weight behind the object.,This thing was made of resin and it was too light.,There's this group online that I frequent.,It's a group of prop crazies just like me,called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,,make and travel in information about movie props.,And it turned out that one of the guys there,,a friend of mine that I never actually met,,but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.,He took my master Falcon pattern,,he actually did lost wax casting,in bronze for me,,and this is the bronze I got back.,And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with. 
 And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.,Here, I'm going to put it out there,,later on tonight, and,I want you to pick it up and handle it.,You want to know,how obsessed I am. This project's only for me,,and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay,a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper,,in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...,like it is in the movie.,(Laughter),Yeah, I know!,(Laughter) (Applause),There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.,That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley. 
 But there's a problem.,Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.,On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.,There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon,,because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting,,there's my master and there's my bronze.,There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,,which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,,you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.,And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,,it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.,Yeah, no, really, this was like aah --,why didn't I remember this?,Why didn't I start and make it bigger?,So what do I do? I figure I have two options.,One, I can fire a freaking laser at it,,which I have already done,,to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.,I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved,going from a wax master to a bronze master,and blown this up big enough to make,a 3D lithography master of this,,which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker,and then I will have it done in bronze. Or: 
 There are several people who own originals,,and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them,,hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes,in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture,,or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner,that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box,,and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear,,get a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages,saying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.,I'll give them one if they want it.,And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.,But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves,,I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise,was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.,Thank you.I'll tell you a little bitnabout irrational behavior.,Not yours, of course -- other people's. 
 (Laughter) 
 So after being at MIT for a few years,,I realized that writing academic papersnis not that exciting.,You know, I don't knownhow many of those you read,,but it's not fun to readnand often not fun to write --,even worse to write.,So I decided to try and writensomething more fun.,And I came up with an ideanthat I would write a cookbook.,And the title for my cookbooknwas going to be,,"Dining Without Crumbs:nThe Art of Eating Over the Sink." 
 (Laughter) 
 And it was going to be a looknat life through the kitchen.,I was quite excited about this.,I was going to talkna little bit about research,,a little bit about the kitchen.,We do so much in the kitchen,nI thought this would be interesting.,I wrote a couple of chapters,nand took it to MIT Press and they said, 
 "Cute, but not for us.nGo and find somebody else." 
 I tried other people,nand everybody said the same thing, 
 "Cute. Not for us." 
 Until somebody said,,"Look, if you're serious about this,,you have to write about your researchnfirst; you have to publish something,,then you'll get the opportunitynto write something else.,If you really want to do it,nyou have to do it." 
 I said, "I don't want to writenabout my research.,I do it all day long,,I want to write somethingna bit more free, less constrained." 
 And this personnwas very forceful and said,,"Look, that's the only waynyou'll ever do it." 
 So I said, "Okay, if I have to do it --",I had a sabbatical.,I said, "I'll write about my research,nif there's no other way.,And then I'll get to do my cookbook.",So, I wrote a book on my research. 
 And it turned out to benquite fun in two ways.,First of all, I enjoyed writing.,But the more interesting thingnwas that I started learning from people.,It's a fantastic time to write,,because there's so much feedbacknyou can get from people.,People write to menabout their personal experience,,and about their examples,nand where they disagree,,and their nuances.,And even being here --nI mean, the last few days,,I've known heights of obsessive behavior,I never thought about. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which I think is just fascinating. 
 I will tell you a little bitnabout irrational behavior,,and I want to start by giving younsome examples of visual illusion,as a metaphor for rationality.,So think about these two tables.,And you must have seen this illusion.,If I asked you what's longer, the verticalnline on the table on the left,,or the horizontal linenon the table on the right,,which one seems longer?,Can anybody see anythingnbut the left one being longer?,No, right? It's impossible.,But the nice thing about visual illusionnis we can easily demonstrate mistakes.,So I can put some linesnon; it doesn't help.,I can animate the lines.,And to the extent you believenI didn't shrink the lines,,which I didn't, I've proven to younthat your eyes were deceiving you.,Now, the interesting thing about thisnis when I take the lines away,,it's as if you haven't learnednanything in the last minute. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can't look at this and say,n"Now I see reality as it is.",Right? It's impossible to overcomenthis sense that this is indeed longer.,Our intuition is really fooling us,in a repeatable,npredictable, consistent way.,and there is almost nothingnwe can do about it,,aside from taking a rulernand starting to measure it. 
 Here's another one.nIt's one of my favorite illusions.,What color is the top arrow pointing to? 
 Audience: Brown.nDan Ariely: Brown. Thank you. 
 The bottom one? Yellow.,Turns out they're identical.,Can anybody see them as identical?,Very, very hard.,I can cover the rest of the cube up.,If I cover the rest of the cube,nyou can see that they are identical.,If you don't believe me,nyou can get the slide later,and do some arts and craftsnand see that they're identical.,But again, it's the same story,nthat if we take the background away,,the illusion comes back.,There is no way for us notnto see this illusion.,I guess maybe if you're colorblind,nI don't think you can see that.,I want you to thinknabout illusion as a metaphor. 
 Vision is one of the best things we do.,We have a huge part of our brainndedicated to vision --,bigger than dedicated to anything else.,We use our vision more hoursnof the day than anything else.,We're evolutionarilyndesigned to use vision.,And if we have these predictablenrepeatable mistakes in vision,,which we're so good at,,what are the chances we won't makeneven more mistakes,in something we're not as good at,nfor example, financial decision-making. 
 (Laughter) 
 Something we don't havenan evolutionary reason to do,,we don't have a specializednpart of the brain for,,and we don't do that manynhours of the day.,The argument is in those cases,,it might be that we actuallynmake many more mistakes.,And worse -- not havingnan easy way to see them,,because in visual illusions, we canneasily demonstrate the mistakes;,in cognitive illusionnit's much, much harder,to demonstrate the mistakes to people. 
 So I want to show younsome cognitive illusions,,or decision-making illusions,nin the same way.,And this is one of my favoritenplots in social sciences.,It's from a papernby Johnson and Goldstein.,It basically shows the percentagenof people who indicated,they would be interestednin donating their organs.,These are different countries in Europe.,You basically see two types of countries:,countries on the right,nthat seem to be giving a lot;,and countries on the leftnthat seem to giving very little,,or much less.,The question is, why?,Why do some countries give a lotnand some countries give a little? 
 When you ask people this question,,they usually think that it hasnto be about culture.,How much do you care about people?,Giving organs to somebody else,is probably about how much you carenabout society, how linked you are.,Or maybe it's about religion.,But if you look at this plot,,you can see that countriesnthat we think about as very similar,,actually exhibit very different behavior.,For example, Swedennis all the way on the right,,and Denmark, which we thinknis culturally very similar,,is all the way on the left.,Germany is on the left,nand Austria is on the right.,The Netherlands is on the left,nand Belgium is on the right.,And finally, dependingnon your particular version,of European similarity,,you can think about the U.K. and Francenas either similar culturally or not,,but it turns out that with organndonation, they are very different. 
 By the way, the Netherlandsnis an interesting story.,You see, the Netherlands is kindnof the biggest of the small group.,It turns out that they got to 28 percent,after mailing every householdnin the country a letter,,begging people to joinnthis organ donation program.,You know the expression,n"Begging only gets you so far.",It's 28 percent in organ donation. 
 (Laughter) 
 But whatever the countriesnon the right are doing,,they're doing a muchnbetter job than begging.,So what are they doing?,Turns out the secret has to donwith a form at the DMV.,And here is the story.,The countries on the leftnhave a form at the DMV,that looks something like this.,"Check the box below if you want tonparticipate in the organ donor program.",And what happens?,People don't check, and they don't join.,The countries on the right,nthe ones that give a lot,,have a slightly different form.,It says, "Check the box belownif you don't want to participate ...",Interestingly enough,nwhen people get this,,they again don't check, but now they join. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, think about what this means.,You know, we wake up in the morningnand we feel we make decisions.,We wake up in the morningnand we open the closet;,we feel that we decide what to wear.,we open the refrigerator and we feelnthat we decide what to eat.,What this is actually saying,,is that many of these decisionsnare not residing within us.,They are residing in the personnwho is designing that form.,When you walk into the DMV,,the person who designed the formnwill have a huge influence,on what you'll end up doing. 
 Now, it's also very hardnto intuit these results.,Think about it for yourself.,How many of you believe,that if you went to renewnyour license tomorrow,,and you went to the DMV,,and you encountered one of these forms,,that it would actuallynchange your own behavior?,Very hard to thinknthat it would influence us.,We can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans,nof course it would influence them.",But when it comes to us,,we have such a feelingnthat we're in the driver's seat,,such a feeling that we're in controlnand we are making the decision,,that it's very hardnto even accept the idea,that we actually have an illusionnof making a decision,,rather than an actual decision. 
 Now, you might say,,"These are decisions we don't care about.",In fact, by definition,nthese are decisions,about something that will happennto us after we die.,How could we care about something less,than about somethingnthat happens after we die?,So a standard economist,nsomebody who believes in rationality,,would say, "You know what?,The cost of lifting the pencilnand marking a "V" is higher,than the possible benefit of the decision,,so that's why we get this effect." 
 (Laughter) 
 But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.,It's not because it's trivial.nIt's not because we don't care.,It's the opposite. It's because we care.,It's difficult and it's complex.,And it's so complexnthat we don't know what to do.,And because we have no idea what to do,,we just pick whatever it wasnthat was chosen for us. 
 I'll give you one more example.,This is from a papernby Redelmeier and Shafir.,And they said, "Would thisneffect also happens to experts?,People who are well-paid,nexperts in their decisions,,and who make a lot of them?",And they took a group of physicians.,They presented to themna case study of a patient.,They said, "Here is a patient.nHe is a 67-year-old farmer.,He's been suffering fromnright hip pain for a while.",And then, they said to the physicians,,"You decided a few weeks ago,that nothing is working for this patient.,All these medications,nnothing seems to be working.,So you refer the patientnfor hip replacement therapy.,Hip replacement. Okay?",So the patient is on a pathnto have his hip replaced. 
 Then they said to half of the physicians,,"Yesterday, you reviewednthe patient's case,,and you realized that you forgotnto try one medication.,You did not try ibuprofen.,What do you do? Do you pullnthe patient back and try ibuprofen?,Or do you let him gonand have hip replacement?",Well, the good news isnthat most physicians in this case,decided to pull the patientnand try ibuprofen.,Very good for the physicians. 
 To the other groupnof physicians, they said,,"Yesterday when you reviewed the case,nyou discovered there were two medications,you didn't try out yet --nibuprofen and piroxicam.",You have two medicationsnyou didn't try out yet.,What do you do? You let him go,nor you pull him back?,And if you pull him back, do you trynibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?",Now, think of it:,This decision makes it as easy to letnthe patient continue with hip replacement,,but pulling him back, all of the suddennit becomes more complex.,There is one more decision.,What happens now?,The majority of the physiciansnnow choose to let the patient go,for a hip replacement.,I hope this worries you, by the way -- 
 (Laughter) 
 when you go to see your physician.,The thing is thatnno physician would ever say,,"Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement.nLet's go for hip replacement.",But the moment you set thisnas the default,,it has a huge power over whatevernpeople end up doing. 
 I'll give you a couple of more examplesnon irrational decision-making.,Imagine I give you a choice:,Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome,nall expenses paid --,hotel, transportation, food,na continental breakfast, everything --,or a weekend in Paris?,Now, weekend in Paris, weekendnin Rome -- these are different things.,They have different food,ndifferent culture, different art.,Imagine I added a choice to the setnthat nobody wanted.,Imagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,,a weekend in Paris,,or having your car stolen?" 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a funny idea, because whynwould having your car stolen,,in this set, influence anything? 
 (Laughter) 
 But what if the option to have your carnstolen was not exactly like this?,What if it was a trip to Rome,nall expenses paid,,transportation, breakfast,,but it doesn't includencoffee in the morning?,If you want coffee, you have to paynfor it yourself, it's two euros 50. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now in some ways,,given that you can have Rome with coffee,,why would you possiblynwant Rome without coffee?,It's like having your car stolen.nIt's an inferior option.,But guess what happened?,The moment you add Rome without coffee,,Rome with coffee becomes more popular,nand people choose it.,The fact that you have Rome without coffee,makes Rome with coffee look superior,,and not just to Rome without coffee --neven superior to Paris. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here are two examples of this principle.,This was an ad in The Economistna few years ago,that gave us three choices:,an online subscription for 59 dollars,,a print subscription for 125 dollars,,or you could get both for 125. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now I looked at this,nand I called up The Economist,,and I tried to figure outnwhat they were thinking.,And they passed me from one personnto another to another,,until eventually I got to the personnwho was in charge of the website,,and I called them up, and they wentnto check what was going on.,The next thing I know,nthe ad is gone, no explanation. 
 So I decided to do the experiment,that I would have lovednThe Economist to do with me.,I took this and I gave itnto 100 MIT students.,I said, "What would you choose?",These are the market shares --nmost people wanted the combo deal.,Thankfully, nobody wantednthe dominant option.,That means our students can read. 
 (Laughter) 
 But now, if you have an optionnthat nobody wants,,you can take it off, right?,So I printed another version of this,,where I eliminated the middle option.,I gave it to another 100 students.nHere is what happened:,Now the most popular optionnbecame the least popular,,and the least popularnbecame the most popular. 
 What was happeningnwas the option that was useless,,in the middle, was uselessnin the sense that nobody wanted it.,But it wasn't useless in the sensenthat it helped people figure out,what they wanted.,In fact, relativento the option in the middle,,which was get only the print for 125,,the print and web for 125nlooked like a fantastic deal.,And as a consequence, people chose it.,The general idea here, by the way,,is that we actually don't knownour preferences that well.,And because we don't knownour preferences that well,,we're susceptible to all of theseninfluences from the external forces:,the defaults, the particular optionsnthat are presented to us, and so on. 
 One more example of this.,People believe that when we dealnwith physical attraction,,we see somebody, and we know immediatelynwhether we like them or not,,if we're attracted or not.,This is why we haventhese four-minute dates.,So I decided to donthis experiment with people.,I'll show you images here, no real people,nbut the experiment was with people.,I showed some people a picturenof Tom, and a picture of Jerry.,and I said, "Who do you want to date?,Tom or Jerry?",But for half the people,nI added an ugly version of Jerry.,I took Photoshop and I madenJerry slightly less attractive. 
 (Laughter) 
 For the other people, I addednan ugly version of Tom.,And the question was,nwill ugly Jerry and ugly Tom,help their respective,nmore attractive brothers?,The answer was absolutely yes.,When ugly Jerry was around,nJerry was popular.,When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular. 
 (Laughter) 
 This of course has twonvery clear implications,for life in general.,If you ever go bar-hopping,nwho do you want to take with you? 
 (Laughter) 
 You want a slightly ugliernversion of yourself. 
 (Laughter) 
 Similar, but slightly uglier. 
 (Laughter) 
 The second point, or course, is thatnif somebody invites you to bar hop,,you know what they think about you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now you get it. 
 What is the general point?,The general point is that,,when we think about economics, we haventhis beautiful view of human nature.,"What a piece of work is a man!nHow noble in reason!",We have this view of ourselves, of others.,The behavioral economics perspectivenis slightly less "generous" to people;,in fact, in medical terms,,that's our view. 
 (Laughter) 
 But there is a silver lining.,The silver lining is, I think,,kind of the reason that behavioralneconomics is interesting and exciting.,Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson? 
 When it comes to buildingnthe physical world,,we kind of understand our limitations.,We build steps.,And we build these thingsnthat not everybody can use, obviously. 
 (Laughter) 
 We understand our limitations,,and we build around them.,But for some reason, when it comesnto the mental world,,when we design things like healthcarenand retirement and stock markets,,we somehow forget the ideanthat we are limited. 
 I think that if we understoodnour cognitive limitations,in the same way we understandnour physical limitations,,even though they don't stare usnin the face the same way,,we could design a better world,nand that, I think,,is the hope of this thing. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times.,I review gadgets and stuff.,And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year,is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.,What I'm mostly doing this year,is going on cable TV and answering the same question:,"What are the tech trends for next year?",And I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?" 
 But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most, and that is the,completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet.,You know, I found that volcano on Google Images,,not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, this all started a few years ago,,when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line,,and we've come a long way since that.,But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.,Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box,that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.,Now, it works just like a regular phone.,So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone,,but its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone,,just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended.,It could be anything. It could be salsa music,or a comedy routine -- it doesn't matter.,The little box has your phone number.,So that's really cool -- you can take it to London or Siberia,,and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring,,because it's got everything in the box.,They've got every feature known to man in there,,because adding a new feature is just software. 
 And as a result of Voice Over IP --,I hate that term -- Voice Over Internet --,land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years.,I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.,This is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular,VOIP service in the world: It's Skype.,It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC,,and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world,The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd.,It's not your phone -- it's your computer.,But nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money,,believe me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone. 
 It's really cute seeing middle-aged people,like me, try out Skype for the first time,,which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.,They don't want to pay the international fees,,so they're like, "Timmy! Is that you?" 
 (Laughter) 
 It's really cute.,But I -- at least it was when I did it -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting,is when they start putting it on cell phones.,Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone,,and any time you were in a wireless hotspot --,free calls anywhere in the world,,never pay the cellular company a nickel.,It'd be really, really cool -- and yet,,even though the technology for this has been available,for five years, incredibly,,the number of standard cell phones,offered by US carriers with free VOIP,is zero!,I can't figure out why! 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, I need to update that. There's one now.,And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.,It comes from T-Mobile.,And I am not paid by T-Mobile.,I'm not plugging T-Mobile.,The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.,Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us. 
 (Laughter) 
 Basically, the reason you haven't heard about this program,is because it was introduced last year,on June 29.,Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?,It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.,I'm like, can you imagine being the,T-Mobile PR lady? You know? 
 "Hi, we have an announcement to -- WAH!!!" 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's actually really, really cool. You have a choice of phones,,and we're not talking smartphones --,ordinary phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi.,The deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot,,all your calls are free.,And when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.,You're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?",The answer is, "All the time!",Because they give you,a regular wireless router that works with the phone,,for your house.,Which is really ingenious, because we all know that,T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.,They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.,(Laughter),But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right?,They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us,a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program.,We're putting it in our homes for them! 
 Anyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe.,But the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before,is, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range,,the call is handed off in mid-syllable,,seamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies,we use at the New York Times to test this gear.,This is me with a camcorder on a phone,going like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot,into the cellular network on a call with my wife --,look at the upper left. That's the Wi-Fi signal. 
 (Video): Jennifer Pogue: Hello? 
 David Pogue: Hi babes, it's me. 
 JP: Oh, hi darling, how are you? 
 DP: You're on Wi-Fi. How does it sound? 
 JP: Oh, it sounds pretty good. 
 Now, I'm leaving the house. DP: I'm going for a walk -- do you mind? 
 JP: No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids. 
 DP: What are you guys doing? 
 Right there!,It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.,I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that. 
 (Laughter) 
 The bottom line is that the boundaries,,because of the Internet plus cell phone, are melting.,The cool thing about the T-Mobile phones,is that although switching technologies is very advanced,,the billing technology has not caught up.,So what I mean is that you can start a call,in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot,,you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead --,which would be like 10 minutes -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And the call will continue to be free.,Because they don't, they haven't --,well, no, wait! Not so fast.,It also works the other way.,So if you start a call on your cellular network,and you come home, you keep being billed.,Which is why most people with this service,get into the habit of saying,,"Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?",Now you get it.,It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas,,it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.,On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,,right? Nobody knows you're in Pakistan.,You can make free unlimited calls,home to the US with these phones. So, very, very interesting. 
 This is another favorite of mine.,Does anyone here have a working cell phone,that's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?,OK. Would you call me please right now? [Phone number given.],And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works.,I should know not to do technology demos,in front of an audience. It's just, like, absurd.,This one is going off. And -- oh, I have the ringer off. Tsh! Great.,Anyway, this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time.,Excuse me one second.,Hello?,Oh. Where are you calling from?,No, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that.,I didn't even know it was you -- I was looking at this guy.,Oh great! Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now! 
 (Laughter) 
 All right! We've made the point.,All right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is Grand Central at work -- it's a --,oh, for gods sake! 
 (Laughter) 
 I have your numbers now! 
 (Laughter) 
 You will pay. 
 Grand Central is this really brilliant idea,where they give you a new phone number,,and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.,Your home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone,(this is the EG crowd). 
 (Laughter) 
 The beauty of that is you never miss a call.,I know a lot of you are like,,"Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour.",But the beauty is it's all going through the internet,,so you get all of these really cool features --,like you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours.,And I want these people to hear this greeting,,"Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message.",And then your wife calls, and, "Hi honey, leave me a message.",Very, very customizable.,Google bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.,They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method. 
 By the way, this is something that really bothers me.,I don't know if you realize this. When you call 411 on your cell phone,,they charge you two bucks.,Did you know that? It's an outrage.,I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.,I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.,What you're going to use is Google Cellular.,It's totally free -- there's not even ads.,If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.,I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it.,You send a text message to the word "Google,",which turns out to be 46645.,Leave off the last "e" for savings. 
 Anyway, so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago.,You type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.,You hit send, and in five seconds,,they will send you back the two closest drugstores,,complete with name address and phone number.,Here it comes.,And it's already written down -- so, like, if you're driving,,you don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh." 
 It works with weather, too.,You can say "Weather," and the name of the city you're going to travel to.,And then in five seconds, they send you back,the complete weather forecast for that town.,Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.,Here we go. And those are just the beginning.,These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will --,yeah! You're all trying to write this down.,That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me.,It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside,is that it requires you to know how to text --,send a text message. Nobody over 40 knows how to do that. 
 So I'm going to teach you something even better.,This is called Google Info.,They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.,It's speech recognition like you've never heard before.,So lets say I'm in Monterey,,and I want what?,I want to find what? Bagels. OK. 
 Google: Say the business and the city and state. 
 DP: Bagels, Monterey, California.,I got the Chinese line. 
 (Laughter) 
 Google: Bagels, Monterey, California.,Top eight results: Number one,,Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street.,To select number one, you can press one or say "number one.",Number two: Bagel Bakery, commissary department. 
 Number Two. Number Two. Two. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why do I listen to people in the audience?,Well anyway -- oh! Here we go! 
 Google: ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue, Monterey.,I'll connect you, or say "details," or "go back." 
 DP: He's connecting me! He doesn't even tell me the phone number.,He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet. 
 Google: Hold on. 
 (Laughter) 
 DP: Hi, could I have 400 with a schmear?,No, no, no -- just kidding, no no.,So anyway, you never even find out the number.,It's just so amazing.,And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.,This is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial.,This you can ask by voice any question.,Who won the 1958 World Series?,What's the recipe for a certain cocktail?,It's absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer.,I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.,"Which actors have played James Bond?",They text me back this: "Sean Connery,,George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig.",Right! And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl.,I'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like,,when the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?",Just to see how the recognition was.,They texted me back, "It's called a syzygy.",Which I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976. 
 You know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to,make money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line.,They put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.,And a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?,How can it be so good? It's as though there is a human being,on the other end of the line.",Because there is one!,They have 10,000 people,who are being paid 20 cents per answer.,As you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.,That's who can afford to do that.,But it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many,tough positions like, "When's the last flight out of Chicago?",You know. It's just absolutely amazing. 
 Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today --,this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology.,When I call to leave you a message,,I get 15 seconds of instructions,from a third-grade teacher on Ambien! 
 (Laughter) 
 "To page this person ... ",Page? What is this, 1975?,Nobody has pagers anymore.,"You may begin speaking at the tone.,When you have finished recording,,you may hang up." No! 
 (Laughter) 
 And then it gets worse:,when I call to retrieve my messages,,first of all: "You have 87 messages.,To listen to your messages ... ",Why else am I calling? 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course I want to listen to the messages! 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh! You all have cell phones too.,So last year I went to Milan, Italy,,and I got to speak to an audience,of cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.,And I said as a joke -- as a joke, I said,,"I did the math. Verizon has 70 million customers.,If you check your voicemail twice a day,,that's 100 million dollars a year.,I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?",No chuckle. They're like this -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Where is the outrage, people? Rise up! 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry. I'm not bitter. 
 (Laughter) 
 So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that.,There are these services that transcribe,your voicemail into text.,And they send it either to your email,or as text messages to your phone.,It is a life-changer.,And by the way, they don't always get the words right,,because it's over the phone and all that.,So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email,so you can listen to double-check.,The services are called things like Spinvox,,Phonetag -- this is the one I use --,Callwave. A lot of people say, "How are they doing this?,I don't really want people listening in to my calls.",The executives at these companies told me,,"Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti -- " you know.,I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in. 
 The reason I think that is that,on the first day I tried one of these services,,I got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson,,which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe, and it was misspelled.,The other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh,,with the silent 'h'. Nailed that one. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you be the judge. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, this service, Callwave, promises,that it's all software -- nobody is listening to your messages.,And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist,of your messages. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I thought I'd see how that goes.,This is me testing it out. 
 (Video): Hello, this is Michael.,Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good.,Hey, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.,And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.,I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.,She's in room -- emergency room 53W.,OK, talk to you later -- bye. 
 (Laughter) 
 I love my job. 
 (Laughter) 
 So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.,It's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that,,I got the text message version. Now remember,,a text message can only be 160 characters long.,So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?,I'm not kidding you. The message said, 
 "Was walking along the street" and "sky was blue" and "emergency"! 
 (Laughter) 
 What the f -- ? 
 (Laughter) 
 Well I guess that was the gist. 
 (Laughter) 
 And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.,This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com.,Basically, you're going to go on some,iffy date, or a potentially bad meeting.,So you go and you type in your phone number,,and at the exact minute where you want to be called -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And at that moment your phone will ring.,And you're like, "I'm sorry. I've got to take this.",The really beautiful thing is,,you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of,hear a little bit of the caller.,So they give you a choice,of what you want to hear on the other end.,Here's the girlfriend. 
 Phone: Hey you, what's going on? 
 DP: I'm kinda, like, giving a talk right now. 
 Phone: Well, that's good. 
 DP: What are you doing? 
 Phone: I was just wondering what you were up to. 
 DP: Right, I can't really talk right now.,This is the -- I love this -- the boss call. 
 Phone: Hey, this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office. 
 DP: Oh, hi, sir. 
 Phone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago? That photocopier training? 
 DP: Oh -- sorry I forgot. 
 Phone: Yeah, well so when was the last time you used the photocopier? 
 DP: It was like three weeks ago. 
 Phone: Well, I don't know if you heard, you might have heard from Lenny, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I think the biggest change when Internet met phone,was with the iPhone.,Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism.,It was when in the fall of 2006,,I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone. 
 (Laughter) 
 I looked like a moron. However, my logic was good,,because -- I don't know if you realize this, but -- until the iPhone came along,,the carriers -- Verizon, AT&T, Cingular --,held veto power over every aspect,of every design of every phone.,I know the people who worked on the Treo.,They went around to these carriers and said, 
 "Look at these cool features." And Verizon is like, "Hmm, no.,I don't think so.",It was not very conducive to innovation.,What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs,went around and said, "Tell you what -- I'll give you a five-year exclusive,if you'll let me design this phone in peace --,and you won't even see it till it's done.",Actually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.,Finally Cingular said OK. 
 I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.,Please don't corner me at the party tonight,and go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?",- you know. I'm not.,You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece.,It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now. 
 But it did change a few things. The first thing it changed,was that all those carriers saw,that they sold 10 million of these things in a year.,And they said, "Oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.,Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones." 
 (Applause) 
 Another thing was that it let 10 million people,,for the first time, experience being online all the time.,Not using these 60-dollar-a-month,cellular cards for their laptops.,I don't understand why we're not there yet.,When I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren,,"When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email,,I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "We had wireless base stations that could,broadcast -- yay, about 150 feet across." 
 (Laughter) 
 It's absurd. We have power outlets,in every room of every building. We have running water.,What's the problem?,Anyway -- but this teaches people what it's like.,You have to go to YouTube,and type in "iPhone Shuffle.",This guy did a mock video of one,that's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.,It's like, "It only has one button.,Touch it and it dials a number at random." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Who the hell is this?" 
 (Laughter) 
 But the other thing it did,is it opened up this idea of an app store.,It downloads right to the phone.,And you can use the tilt sensor,to steer this car using this game.,These programs can use all the components,of the iPhone -- the touch screen.,This is the Etch-A-Sketch program -- the theme of EG 2008.,You know how you erase it?,Of course. You shake it.,Right, of course. We shake it to erase, like this. 
 They have 10,000 of these programs.,This is the translator program. They have every language in the world.,You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.,This is amazing. This is Midomi.,A song is running through your head --,you sing it into the thing:,do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...,OK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.,I know. It's insane, right? 
 This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio --,you type in a band or a song name.,It will immediately play you that song or that band.,It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.,You say if you like this song or not.,If you like it, it tries another song on you,from a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals,,theme and tempo.,If you like that one, or don't like it,,you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down. Over time it tailors the songs,so that it completely stops playing bad songs.,It eventually only plays songs you like. 
 This is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing.,You want to find a place to eat. You shake it.,It proposes a restaurant.,It gives you the price, and the location and ratings.,Video: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.,Anyway, just amazing, amazing things.,Of course, its not just about the iPhone. 
 The iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.,But now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system,that will soon be on handsets -- phones from 34 companies.,Touch screen -- very, very nice.,Also with its own app store, where you can download programs. 
 This is amazing. In the wake of all this,,Verizon, the most calcified, corporate,,conservative carrier of all,,said, "You can use any phone you want on our network.",I love the Wired headline:,Pigs Fly, Hell Freezes Over,and Verizon Opens Up Its Network -- No. Really. 
 So everything is changing. We've entered,a new world of innovation, where the cell phone becomes your laptop,,customized the way you want it.,Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on.,Can I do one more one-minute song? Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Just to round it up -- this is the new Apple Power Music Stand.,It's only three pounds,,or 12 if you install Microsoft Office. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry, that was mean.,This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video.,Ladies and gentlemen, for seven blissful hours,it was the number one video on YouTube.,(To the tune of "My Way") 
 And now the end is near.,I'm sick to death,of this old cell phone.,Bad sound, the signal's weak,,the software stinks.,A made-in-Hell phone.,I've heard there's something new --,a million times more rad than my phone.,I too will join the cult.,I want an iPhone.,Concerns -- I have a few. It's got some flaws;,we may just face it.,No keys, no memory card,,the battery's sealed --,you can't replace it.,But God, this thing is sweet.,A multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.,You had me from, "Hello.",I want an iPhone.,I want to touch its precious screen.,I want to wipe the smudges clean.,I want my friends to look and drool.,I want to say, "Look -- now I'm cool",I stood in line and I'll get mine.,I want an iPhone.,For what is a man?,What has he got? If not iPhone,,then he's got squat.,It's all the things a phone should be.,Who cares if it's AT&T?,I took a stand, paid half a grand!,And I got an iPhone! 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called,to a little townnin Colorado, called Craig.,It's only a couple dozen square miles.,It's in the Rockies.,And the job in question was sheep rancher. 
 My role on the show, for those of younwho haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.,I'm an apprentice,,and I work with the peoplenwho do the jobs in question.,And my responsibilitiesnare to simply try and keep up,,and give an honest accountnof what it's like to be these people,for one day in their life.,The job in question: herding sheep.,Great. 
 We go to Craig and we check into a hotel,,and I realize the next day,that castration is going to benan absolute part of this work.,Normally, I never do any research at all.,But this is a touchy subject,nand I work for the Discovery Channel,,and we want to portray accuratelynwhatever it is we do.,And we certainly want to do itnwith a lot of respect for the animals.,So I call the Humane Society and I say,,"Look, I'm going to be castratingnsome lambs. Can you tell me the deal?" 
 And they're like, "Yeah,nit's pretty straightforward.",They use a band, basically, a rubber band,nlike this, only a little smaller.,This one was actuallynaround the playing cards,I got yesterday -- 
 (Laughter),But it had a certain familiarity to it. 
 And I said, "Well, what exactlynis the process?" 
 And they said, "The bandnis applied to the tail, tightly.,And then another band is appliednto the scrotum, tightly.,Blood flow is slowly retarded;,a week later the partsnin question fall off. 
 "Great -- got it.",OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.,They confirm it.,I also call PETA just for fun,,and they don't like it,nbut they confirm it.,OK, that's basically how you do it. 
 So the next day I go out.,And I'm given a horsenand we go get the lambs,and we take them to a pen that we built,,and we go about the businessnof animal husbandry. 
 Melanie is the wife of Albert.,Albert is the shepherd in question.,Melanie picks up the lamb,none hand on both legs on the right,,likewise on the left.,Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.,Alright. Great.,Albert goes in, I follow Albert,nthe crew is around.,I always watch the process donenthe first time before I try it.,Being an apprentice,nyou know, you do that.,Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out,nyou know, this black rubber band,,but what comes out instead is a knife.,And I'm like, "Hmm, that's notnrubber at all," you know? 
 (Laughter) 
 And he kind of flicked it opennin a way that caught the sun,that was just comingnover the Rockies, it was very -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It was ... it was impressive. 
 In the space of about two seconds,,Albert had the knifenbetween the cartilage of the tail,,right next to the butt of the lamb,,and very quickly, the tail was gonenand in the bucket that I was holding.,A second later, with a big thumbnand a well-calloused forefinger,,he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.,And he pulled it toward him, like so,,and he took the knifenand he put it on the tip.,"Now, you think you knownwhat's coming, Michael,,You don't, OK?" 
 (Laughter) 
 He snips it, throws the tipnover his shoulder,,and then grabs the scrotumnand pushes it upward,,and then his head dips down,nobscuring my view.,But what I hear is a slurping sound,,and a noise that sounds like Velcronbeing yanked off a sticky wall,,and I am not even kidding. 
 Can we roll the video?,No, I'm kidding, we don't -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought it best to talk in pictures. 
 I do something now I've never, ever donenon a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.,I say, "Time out. Stop.",You guys know the show, we use take one;nwe don't do take two.,There's no writing, there's no scripting,nthere's no nonsense.,We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --,we shoot what we get! 
 I said, "Stop. This is nuts.",I mean -- 
 (Laughter) 
 "This is crazy.,We can't do this." 
 And Albert's like, "What?" 
 And I'm like, "I don't knownwhat just happened,,but there are testicles in this bucket,,and that's not how we do it." 
 He said "Well, that's how we do it." 
 I said, "Why would you do it this way?",And before I even let him explain,,I said, "I want to do it the right way,nwith the rubber bands." 
 And he says, "Like the Humane Society?" 
 I said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.,Let's do something that doesn't makenthe lamb squeal and bleed.,We're on in five continents, dude!,We're on twice a daynon the Discovery -- we can't do this." 
 He says, "OK.",He goes to his box and pulls outna bag of these little rubber bands.,Melanie picks up another lamb,nputs it on the post,,band goes on the tail,nband goes on the scrotum.,Lamb goes on the ground,nlamb takes two steps, falls down,,gets up, shakes a little,,takes another couple steps, falls down.,I'm like, this is not a good signnfor this lamb, at all.,Gets up, walks to the corner.,It's quivering, and it liesndown and it's in obvious distress. 
 And I'm looking at the lambnand I say, "Albert, how long?,When does he get up?" 
 He's like, "A day?" 
 I said, "A day! How long doesnit take them to fall off?" 
 "A week." 
 Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just donenhis little procedure on,is, you know, he's just prancingnaround, bleeding stopped.,He's, you know, nibblingnon some grass, frolicking.,And I was just so blown awaynat how completely wrong I was,,in that second.,And I was reminded how utterly wrongnI am, so much of the time. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was especially reminded,of what a ridiculouslynshort straw I had that day,,because now I had to donwhat Albert had just done,,and there are like 100nof these lambs in the pen.,And suddenly, this whole thing's startingnto feel like a German porno,,and I'm like -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Melanie picks up the lamb,nputs it on the post, opens it up.,Albert hands me the knife.,I go in, tail comes off.,I go in, I grab the scrotum,ntip comes off.,Albert instructs, "Push it way up there.",I do.,"Push it further.",I do. 
 The testicles emerge. They looknlike thumbs, coming right at you.,And he says, "Bite 'em.,Just bite 'em off." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I heard him, I heard all the words -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Like, how did I get here?,How did -- I mean --,how did I get here? 
 It's just -- it's one of those momentsnwhere the brain goes off on its own,,and suddenly, I'm standingnthere in the Rockies,,and all I can think of is the Aristotelianndefinition of a tragedy.,You know, Aristotle saysna tragedy is that moment,when the hero comes face to facenwith his true identity. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm like, "What is thisnjacked-up metaphor?,I don't like what I'm thinking right now.",And I can't get this thoughtnout of my head,,and I can't get that visionnout of my sight,,so I did what I had to do.,I went in and I took them.,I took them like this,,and I yanked my head back.,And I'm standing therenwith two testicles on my chin. 
 (Laughter) 
 And now I can't get --nI can't shake the metaphor. 
 I'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle,nand I'm thinking --,out of nowhere, two terms come crashingninto my head, that I hadn't heard,since my classics professor in collegendrilled them there.,And they are "anagnorisis"nand "peripeteia.",Anagnorisis and peripeteia.,Anagnorisis is the Greeknword for discovery.,Literally, the transition from ignorancento knowledge is anagnorisis.,It's what our network does;nit's what "Dirty Jobs" is.,And I'm up to my necknin anagnorises every single day.,Great.,The other word, peripeteia,,that's the momentnin the great tragedies --,Euripides and Sophocles.,That's the moment where Oedipus hasnhis moment, where he suddenly realizes,that hot chick he's been sleeping withnand having babies with,is his mother.,That's peripety, or peripeteia.,And this metaphor in my head --,I've got anagnorisisnand peripeteia on my chin -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I've got to tell you,nit's such a great device, though.,When you start to look for peripeteia,,you find it everywhere.,I mean, Bruce Willisnin "The Sixth Sense," right?,Spends the whole movie trying to helpnthe little kid who sees dead people,,and then -- boom! -- "Oh, I'm dead.",Peripeteia. You know?,It's crushing when the audiencensees it the right way.,Neo in "The Matrix," you know?,"Oh, I'm living in a computer program.,That's weird." 
 These discoveriesnthat lead to sudden realizations.,And I've been having them,nover 200 dirty jobs,,I have them all the time, but that one --,that one drilled something homenin a way that I just wasn't prepared for.,And, as I stood there,,looking at the happy lambnthat I had just defiled --,but it looked OK;,looking at that poor other little thingnthat I'd done it the right way on,,and I just was struck by --,if I'm wrong about that,,and if I'm wrong so often,nin a literal way,,what other peripatetic misconceptionsnmight I be able to comment upon? 
 Because, look --nI'm not a social anthropologist,,but I have a friend who is.,And I talk to him. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he says, "Hey Mike, look.,I don't know if your brain is interestednin this sort of thing or not,,but do you realizenyou've shot in every state?,You've worked in mining,nyou've worked in fishing,,you've worked in steel,nyou've worked in every major industry.,You've had your backnshoulder to shoulder with these guys,that our politicians are desperatento relate to every four years, right?" 
 I can still see Hillaryndoing the shots of rye,,dribbling down her chin,nwith the steel workers.,I mean, these are the peoplenthat I work with every single day.,"And if you have something to saynabout their thoughts, collectively,,it might be time to think about it.,Because, dude, you know, four years.",So, that's in my head,ntesticles are on my chin,,thoughts are bouncing around.,And, after that shoot,n"Dirty Jobs" really didn't change,,in terms of what the show is,nbut it changed for me, personally. 
 And now, when I talk about the show,,I no longer just tell the storynyou heard and 190 like it.,I do, but I also start to talknabout some of the other things,I got wrong;,some of the other notions of work,that I've just been assumingnare sacrosanct,,and they're not.,People with dirty jobsnare happier than you think.,As a group, they'renthe happiest people I know.,And I don't want to start whistlingn"Look for the Union Label,",and all that happy-worker crap.,I'm just telling younthat these are balanced people,who do unthinkable work.,Roadkill picker-uppers whistlenwhile they work, I swear to God --,I did it with them.,They've got this amazingnsort of symmetry to their life.,And I see it over and over and over again. 
 So I started to wonder what would happen,if we challengednsome of these sacred cows?,Follow your passion --,we've been talking about itnhere for the last 36 hours.,Follow your passion -- what couldnpossibly be wrong with that?,It's probably the worst advice I ever got. 
 (Laughter) 
 Follow your dreams and go broke, right?,I mean, that's all I heard growing up.,I didn't know what to do with my life,,but I was told if you follow your passion,nit's going to work out. 
 I can give you 30 examples right now.,Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas,who collects the uneaten scrapsnof food from the casinos,and feeds them to his swine.,Why?,Because there's so much proteinnin the stuff we don't eat,,his pigs grow at twice the normal speed,nand he's one rich pig farmer.,He's good for the environment,,he spends his daysndoing this incredible service,,and he smells like hell,nbut God bless him.,He's making a great living.,You ask him, "Did you follownyour passion here?",and he'd laugh at you.,The guy's worth -- he just got offerednlike 60 million dollars for his farm,and turned it down, outside of Vegas.,He didn't follow his passion.,He stepped back and he watchednwhere everybody was going,,and he went the other way.,And I hear that story over and over. 
 Matt Freund, a dairy farmernin New Canaan, Connecticut,,who woke up one day and realized,the crap from his cowsnwas worth more than their milk,,if he could use it to makenthese biodegradable flowerpots.,Now he's selling them to Walmart, right?,Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on. 
 So I started to look at passion,,I started to looknat efficiency vs. effectiveness.,As Tim talked about earlier,nthat's a huge distinction.,I started to look at teamworknand determination.,And basically, all those platitudesnthey call "successories",that hang with that schmaltzy artnin boardrooms around the world right now,,that stuff -- it's suddenlynall been turned on its head. 
 Safety. Safety first is ...,Going back to OSHA and PETAnand the Humane Society:,What if OSHA got it wrong?,I mean -- this is heresy,nwhat I'm about to say --,but what if it's really safety third?,Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 No, I mean, really.,What I mean to say is:,I value my safety on these crazy jobs,as much as the peoplenthat I'm working with,,but the ones who really get it done --,they're not out therentalking about safety first.,They know that other things come first --,the business of doingnthe work comes first,,the business of getting it done. 
 And I'll never forget,nup in the Bering Sea,,I was on a crab boatnwith the "Deadliest Catch" guys --,which I also work on in the first season.,We were about 100 milesnoff the coast of Russia:,50-foot seas, big waves, green waterncoming over the wheelhouse, right?,Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,,and I was back with a guy,nlashing the pots down.,So I'm 40 feet off the deck,,which is like looking downnat the top of your shoe, you know,,and it's doing this in the ocean.,Unspeakably dangerous. 
 I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse,and I say, with some level of incredulity,,"Captain -- OSHA?" 
 And he says, "OSHA? Ocean.",And he points out there. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in that moment, what he said nextncan't be repeated in the Lower 48.,It can't be repeated on any factory floornor any construction site.,But he looked at me and said, "Son," --,he's my age, by the way,nhe calls me "son," I love that --,he says, "Son, I'm the captainnof a crab boat.,My responsibilitynis not to get you home alive.,My responsibilitynis to get you home rich." 
 (Laughter) 
 You want to get home alive,nthat's on you.",And for the restnof that day -- safety first. 
 I mean, I was like --,So, the idea that we createnthis sense of complacency,when all we do is talknabout somebody else's responsibility,as though it's our own, and vice versa.,Anyhow, a whole lot of things.,I could talk at lengthnabout the many little distinctions we made,and the endless list of waysnthat I got it wrong.,But what it all comes down to is this:,I've formed a theory,,and I'm going to share it nownin my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds. 
 It goes like this:,we've declared war on work,nas a society -- all of us.,It's a civil war.,It's a cold war, really.,We didn't set out to do it,and we didn't twist our mustachenin some Machiavellian way,,but we've done it.,And we've waged this warnon at least four fronts,,certainly in Hollywood.,The way we portray working people on TV --,it's laughable.,If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds,and he's got a giant butt crack, admit it.,You see him all the time.,That's what plumbers look like, right?,We turn them into heroes,nor we turn them into punch lines.,That's what TV does.,We try hard on "Dirty Jobs"nnot to do that,,which is why I do the worknand I don't cheat. 
 But, we've waged this warnon Madison Avenue.,So many of the commercials that come outnthere in the way of a message --,what's really being said?,"Your life would be betternif you could work a little less,,didn't have to work so hard,ngot home a little earlier,,could retire a little faster,npunch out a little sooner.",It's all in there,nover and over, again and again. 
 Washington?,I can't even begin to talknabout the deals and policies in place,that affect the bottom-line realitynof the available jobs,,because I don't really know; I just knownthat that's a front in this war. 
 And right here, guys -- Silicon Valley.,I mean -- how many people havenan iPhone on them right now?,How many people have their BlackBerry?,We're plugged in; we're connected.,I would never suggest for a second,that something badnhas come out of the tech revolution.,Good grief, not to this crowd. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I would suggest,that innovation without imitationnis a complete waste of time.,And nobody celebrates imitation,the way "Dirty Jobs" guysnknow it has to be done.,Your iPhone without those peoplenmaking the same interface,,the same circuitry,nthe same board, over and over --,all of that -- that's what makesnit equally as possible,as the genius that goes inside of it. 
 So, we've got this new toolbox. You know?,Our tools today don't looknlike shovels and picks.,They look like the stuffnwe walk around with.,And so the collectiveneffect of all of that,has been this marginalizationnof lots and lots of jobs.,And I realized, probablyntoo late in this game --,I hope not, because I don't knownif I can do 200 more of these things --,but we're going to do as many as we can.,And to me, the mostnimportant thing to know,and to really come face to face with,,is that fact that I got it wrongnabout a lot of things,,not just the testicles on my chin.,I got a lot wrong. 
 So, we're thinking --nby "we," I mean me -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that the thing to do is to talknabout a PR campaign for work --,manual labor, skilled labor.,Somebody needs to be out there,ntalking about the forgotten benefits.,I'm talking about grandfather stuff,,the stuff a lot us probably grew up with,but we've kind of --nyou know, kind of lost a little. 
 Barack wants to createntwo and a half million jobs.,The infrastructure is a huge deal.,This war on work that I suppose exists,nhas casualties like any other war.,The infrastructure is the first one,,declining trade school enrollmentsnare the second one.,Every single year, fewer electricians,nfewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,,fewer welders, fewer pipe fitters,nfewer steam fitters.,The infrastructure jobs that everybodynis talking about creating,are those guys -- the onesnthat have been in decline, over and over.,Meanwhile, we've gotntwo trillion dollars, at a minimum,,according to the American Societynof Civil Engineers,,that we need to expendnto even make a dent in the infrastructure,,which is currently rated at a D minus. 
 So, if I were runningnfor anything -- and I'm not --,I would simply saynthat the jobs we hope to make,and the jobs we hope to create,aren't going to stick unlessnthey're jobs that people want.,And I know the point of this conference,is to celebrate thingsnthat are near and dear to us,,but I also know that cleannand dirty aren't opposites.,They're two sides of the same coin,njust like innovation and imitation,,like risk and responsibility,nlike peripeteia and anagnorisis,,like that poor little lamb,nwho I hope isn't quivering anymore,,and like my time that's gone. 
 It's been great talking to you.,And get back to work, will you? 
 (Applause)I was raised in Seoul, Korea,,and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.,I was pre-med at the time,,and I thought I would become a surgeon,because I was interested in anatomy,and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.,At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.,I started to realize that I could look at the whole city,as a living organism.,I wanted to dissect it,and look into its unseen layers.,And the way to it, for me,,was through artistic means.,So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.,and in grad school I became interested,in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city. 
 In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.,Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.,But I took a liking to them,because they dwell on the fringes of society.,And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,,they're also considered pests.,I also started looking around in the city,and trying to photograph them.,One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks,hoping to catch a rat or two,,and a man came up to me and said,,"You can't take photographs here.,The MTA will confiscate your camera.",I was quite shocked by that,,and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.,I'll follow the rats.",Then I started going into the tunnels,,which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city,that I never saw before and most people don't get to see. 
 Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals,who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,,guerrilla historians, etc.,I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network,of people who regularly explore urban ruins,such as abandoned subway stations,,tunnels, sewers, aqueducts,,factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on. 
 When I took photographs in these locations,,I felt there was something missing in the pictures.,Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures,wasn't enough for me.,So I wanted to create a fictional character,or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,,and the simplest way to do it, at the time,,was to model myself.,I decided against clothing,because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications,or time-specific elements.,I wanted a simple way to represent a living body,inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces. 
 This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.,It's now an empty, six-acre lot,waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.,I was very fond of this space,because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own,that is abandoned.,When I first went in, I was scared,,because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.,But they happened to be wild dogs living there,,and it was right by the water,,so there were swans and ducks swimming around,and trees growing everywhere,and bees nesting in the sugar barrels. 
 The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.,And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture,to become a part of that nature.,When I got comfortable in the space,,it also felt like a big playground.,I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams,as if I went back in time and became a child again. 
 This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct,,which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.,The construction began in 1837.,It lasted about five years.,It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.,When you go into spaces like this,,you're directly accessing the past,,because they sit untouched for decades.,I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.,Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home,,you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks,and shimmying up and down narrow cracks,and getting wet and muddy,and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight. 
 This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.,It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.,The murals were done by a graffiti artist,to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people,that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991,when the tunnel reopened for trains.,Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.,There's nobody around you,,and you hear the kids playing in the park above you,,completely unaware of what's underneath. 
 When I was going out a lot to these places,,I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation,because I was in a solitary phase in my life,,and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,",which references Charles Baudelaire.,"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,,and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia,that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment. 
 This is the same tunnel.,You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts,and the train approaching. 
 This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.,I was there alone, setting up,,and a homeless man approached.,I was basically intruding in his living space.,I was really frightened at first,,but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project,and he didn't seem to mind,and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer,and ran back and forth.,And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt,to wipe off my feet,and kindly walked me out.,It must have been a very unusual day for him.,(Laughter) 
 One thing that struck me, after this incident,,was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.,That homeless man, to me, really represented,an element of the unconscious of the city.,He told me that he was abused above ground,and was once in Riker's Island,,and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.,The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,,but is now a sanctuary for outcasts,,who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life. 
 This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.,The tunnels are famous for having been used,during the development of the Manhattan Project.,This particular tunnel is interesting,because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,,which was demolished in 1890,when Columbia moved in. 
 This is the New York City Farm Colony,,which was a poorhouse in Staten Island,from the 1890s to the 1930s.,Most of my photos are set in places,that have been abandoned for decades,,but this is an exception. 
 This children's hospital was closed in 1997;,it's located in Newark.,When I was there three years ago,,the windows were broken and the walls were peeling,,but everything was left there as it was.,You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines,and even used utensils,,which you see on the autopsy table. 
 After exploring recently-abandoned buildings,,I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:,your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church --,any man-made structures around you.,I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is,and how vulnerable people truly are. 
 I love to travel,,and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.,It's full of history,,and also full of underground bunkers,and ruins from the war. 
 This was taken under a homeless asylum,built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.,I saw the structure while I was on the train,,and I got off at the next station and met people there,that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,,which was used for ammunition storage during the war,and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.,This is the actual catacombs in Paris.,I explored there extensively,in the off-limits areas,and fell in love right away. 
 There are more than 185 miles of tunnels,,and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.,The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.,They were consistently dug as limestone quarries,and by the 18th century,,the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,,so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries,and dug new observation tunnels,in order to monitor and map the whole place. 
 As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.,It's very dangerous to get lost in there.,And at the same time,,there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.,So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,,making them into the catacombs.,The remains of over six million people are housed in there,,some over 1,300 years old.,This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery,where most of the ossuaries are located.,There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s,and many bunkers from the World War II era. 
 This is a German bunker.,Nearby there's a French bunker,,and the whole tunnel system is so complex,that the two parties never met.,The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,,which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables.",And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one. 
 After exploring the underground of Paris,,I decided to climb up,,and I climbed a Gothic monument,that's right in the middle of Paris.,This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.,It was built in the early 1500s.,I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.,It was not very comfortable. (Laughter) 
 And all this time,,I never saw a single rat in any of these places,,until recently, when I was in the London sewers.,This was probably the toughest place to explore.,I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes --,I guess, except for in this picture.,And when the tides of waste matter come in,it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you. 
 This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door.",I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.,And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it. 
 And this is the first theater project I worked on.,I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.,It was performed last September one time only,in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,,which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,,built in 1844.,I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.,But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series. 
 The last place I visited,was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.,This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple. 
 I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.,I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually,in order to preserve their memories in a creative way --,before they're lost forever.,Thank you.
