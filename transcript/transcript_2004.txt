I'd like to speak about technology trends,,which is something that many of you follow --,but we also follow, for related reasons.,Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends,are something that we write about and need to know about. 
 But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --,you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.,We have to plan issues many months in advance;,we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,,nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business. 
 We also, like a lot of companies, create a product,that's based on technology trends.,In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,,some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.,And so we have to understand,not only why tech's important, where it's going,,but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything. 
 And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made,during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,,or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,,they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.,Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.,But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations,is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything. 
 You've probably seen something like this before.,This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about,kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.,And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,,to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,,or whether they were about to crash,into the trough of disillusionment,,or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.,And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense,of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn. 
 We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;,we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.,We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,,we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.,You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.,But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies,are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.,And then it's time to do it again. Last year.,And that's one way that we try to time technology trends. 
 I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends,that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,",but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.,It's based on the presumption, the observation even,,that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --,at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.,And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --,a collision with something else --,for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology,and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.,And these are the inflection points that tell you,what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,,and maybe how you can do something about it. 
 The first is the critical price.,The first stage in a technology's advance,is that it'll fall below a critical price.,After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,,if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.,Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology,,and that's another important point.,And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.,Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free. 
 Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;,it's an opportunity for the technology to change.,And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --,you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,,but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --,there's still more opportunity in that. 
 I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this,by telling the story of the DVD,,which is a technology which has done all of these.,The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s,and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,,it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.,And it started to take off. And you can see that the units,started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off. 
 The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,,20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.,And what's interesting here,is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.,Suddenly you have a DVD in the house;,you've got high-quality digital video;,you have a reason to have a big-screen television;,you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.,And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,,and bring the rest of your entertainment in.,What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.,Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,,that was an inflection point that he could do something with. 
 The next phase it hit was displacement.,You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.,And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.,Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD,in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.,Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;,you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.,That gave an advantage; that was an implication,of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody. 
 And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.,There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,,who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one,DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.,You're aware of the,perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede,over the 30-dollar DVD.,But they're getting very, very cheap,,and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,,the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,,and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.,They're being commodified, and that's what happens,when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.,(Laughter) 
 Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,,these four stages of technology's life.,I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,,just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,,these four, as a way to kind of tell you,where each one of those technologies is in its development.,They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --,they're just examples of technologies,that are in each one of these periods.,But I think that the implications of them approaching,these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about. 
 Start with gene sequencing.,As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,,because it's built on computers -- is falling in price,at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.,It is now possible -- will be possible,,and if Craig Venter indeed comes today,,he may tell you something about this --,to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.,That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.,You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation,is getting closer and closer. 
 What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes,that we're discovering is rising very quickly.,Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.,There will come a day,when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,,if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic. 
 Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.,This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect,of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.,In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.,The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,,and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.,Today it's less than 50 cents a day.,And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,,if you look at the correlation between these two,,as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat,goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO,believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --,two million in sub-Saharan Africa.,And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. 
 Linux is another good example.,Now we've switched to critical mass.,These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.,If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.,Interestingly, it's done a crossover before,,but not the crossovers that matter.,The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.,But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,,you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.,It's not just for the geeks any more.,That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond,wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.,(Laughter) 
 Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.,I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.,And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --,and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --,they'll be two percent of auto sales.,Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,,which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.,At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere. 
 And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off,is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.,It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.,And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:,you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.,You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;,you can have replaceable body shapes --,it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,,but it can lead to a whole new era of the car. 
 Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.,Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;,it's a little hard to use right now.,There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.,Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;,they already have nearly four million registered users --,that's critical mass.,And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.,You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional,telecom standards. This is a tipping point --,if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,,and the speed, and the players in the industry.,It's going to look a little bit like that. 
 And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.,Free is something that comes with digital, because,the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,,because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,,because there's so much bandwidth.,Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.,It's an economic force; it's a technical force.,It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.,It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.,Free is probably the most interesting thing. 
 And here you have just the number of songs,that can be stored on a hard drive.,You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,,but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored,on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,,the physical element, of songs off the table.,And you've seen the numbers.,I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding,in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.,They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.,And their response is draconian, and not necessarily,the one that's going to get them out of this. 
 And finally, I'll give you one last example of free --,perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --,their abundance tends to make things free.,This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.,And what's interesting is that it was just 1990,when it was more than two dollars a minute.,India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.,It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,,but then there was just so much fiber out there,,you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.,It's seven cents a minute, in many cases. 
 And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,,to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.,It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization,and one of the most powerful economic tools,that we're seeing in our world today.,The force of India, and then China, and any other country,that can contact our markets,and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --,is just beginning to be felt.,And I think that's probably one,of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.,Thank you.When you have 21 minutes to speak,,two million years seemsnlike a really long time.,But evolutionarily,ntwo million years is nothing.,And yet in two million years,,the human brainnhas nearly tripled in mass,,going from the one-and-a-quarter poundnbrain of our ancestor here, Habilis,,to the almost three-pound meatloaf,that everybody herenhas between their ears.,What is it about a big brain,that nature was so eagernfor every one of us to have one? 
 Well, it turns out whennbrains triple in size,,they don't just get three times bigger;nthey gain new structures.,And one of the main reasons our brain gotnso big is because it got a new part,,called the "frontal lobe.",Particularly, a part callednthe "pre-frontal cortex.",What does a pre-frontal cortexndo for you that should justify,the entire architectural overhaulnof the human skull,in the blink of evolutionary time? 
 It turns out the pre-frontalncortex does lots of things,,but one of the most important thingsnit does is an experience simulator.,Pilots practice in flight simulators,so that they don't makenreal mistakes in planes.,Human beings have thisnmarvelous adaptation,that they can actually havenexperiences in their heads,before they try them out in real life.,This is a trick that nonenof our ancestors could do,,and that no other animalncan do quite like we can.,It's a marvelous adaptation.,It's up there with opposable thumbsnand standing upright and language,as one of the things that gotnour species out of the trees,and into the shopping mall. 
 (Laughter) 
 All of you have done this.,Ben and Jerry's doesn't havenliver-and-onion ice cream,,and it's not because they whippednsome up, tried it and went, "Yuck.",It's because, withoutnleaving your armchair,,you can simulate that flavornand say "yuck" before you make it. 
 Let's see how your experiencensimulators are working.,Let's just run a quick diagnostic,before I proceednwith the rest of the talk.,Here's two different futuresnthat I invite you to contemplate.,You can try to simulate them and tell menwhich one you think you might prefer.,One of them is winning the lottery.nThis is about 314 million dollars.,And the other is becoming paraplegic. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just give it a moment of thought.,You probably don't feelnlike you need a moment of thought. 
 Interestingly, there are datanon these two groups of people,,data on how happy they are.,And this is exactlynwhat you expected, isn't it?,But these aren't the data.nI made these up! 
 These are the data.,You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardlynfive minutes into the lecture.,Because the fact is that a yearnafter losing the use of their legs,,and a year after winning the lotto,nlottery winners and paraplegics,are equally happy with their lives. 
 Don't feel too badnabout failing the first pop quiz,,because everybody failsnall of the pop quizzes all of the time.,The research that my laboratorynhas been doing,,that economists and psychologistsnaround the country have been doing,,has revealed somethingnreally quite startling to us,,something we call the "impact bias,",which is the tendencynfor the simulator to work badly.,For the simulator to make younbelieve that different outcomes,are more differentnthan in fact they really are. 
 From field studies to laboratory studies,,we see that winning or losing an election,ngaining or losing a romantic partner,,getting or not getting a promotion,npassing or not passing a college test,,on and on, have far less impact,nless intensity and much less duration,than people expect them to have.,This almost floors me --,a recent study showingnhow major life traumas affect people,suggests that if it happenednover three months ago,,with only a few exceptions,,it has no impact whatsoevernon your happiness. 
 Why?,Because happiness can be synthesized.,Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642,n"I am the happiest man alive.,I have that in me that can convert povertynto riches, adversity to prosperity.,I am more invulnerable than Achilles;nfortune hath not one place to hit me.",What kind of remarkable machineryndoes this guy have in his head? 
 Well, it turns out it's precisely the samenremarkable machinery that all off us have.,Human beings have something,that we might think ofnas a "psychological immune system.",A system of cognitive processes, largelynnon-conscious cognitive processes,,that help them changentheir views of the world,,so that they can feel better,about the worldsnin which they find themselves.,Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.,Unlike Sir Thomas,nyou seem not to know it. 
 We synthesize happiness, but we thinknhappiness is a thing to be found.,Now, you don't need me to give you,too many examples of peoplensynthesizing happiness, I suspect.,Though I'm going to shownyou some experimental evidence,,you don't have to looknvery far for evidence.,I took a copy of the New York Times,and tried to find some instancesnof people synthesizing happiness.,Here are three guysnsynthesizing happiness.,"I'm better off physically,nfinancially, mentally ...,"I don't have one minute's regret.nIt was a glorious experience.","I believe it turned out for the best." 
 Who are these charactersnwho are so damn happy?,The first one is Jim Wright.,Some of you are old enough to remember:,he was the chairmannof the House of Representatives,and he resigned in disgrace,when this young Republicannnamed Newt Gingrich,found out about a shadynbook deal he had done.,He lost everything.,The most powerful Democratnin the country lost everything.,He lost his money, he lost his power.,What does he have to saynall these years later?,"I am so much better off physically,nfinancially, mentally,and in almost every other way.",What other way would therenbe to be better off?,Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?,He's pretty much covered them there. 
 Moreese Bickham is somebodynyou've never heard of.,Moreese Bickham utterednthese words upon being released.,He was 78 years old.,He'd spent 37 yearsnin a Louisiana State Penitentiary,for a crime he didn't commit.,[He was ultimately released,for good behaviornhalfway through his sentence.],What did he say about his experience?,"I don't have one minute's regret.nIt was a glorious experience." Glorious!,He is not saying,,"Well, there were some nice guys.nThey had a gym.","Glorious,",a word we usually reserve for somethingnlike a religious experience. 
 Harry S. Langerman uttered these words,nand he's somebody you might have known,but didn't, because in 1949nhe read a little article in the paper,about a hamburger stand ownednby two brothers named McDonalds.,And he thought,n"That's a really neat idea!",So he went to find them. They said,,"We can give you a franchisenon this for 3,000 bucks.",Harry went back to New York,nasked his brother, an investment banker,,to loan him the $3,000,nand his brother's immortal words were,,"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers.",He wouldn't lend him the money,,and of course, six months laternRay Kroc had exactly the same idea.,It turns out people do eat hamburgers,,and Ray Kroc, for a while,nbecame the richest man in America. 
 And then, finally,,some of you recognizenthis young photo of Pete Best,,who was the originalndrummer for the Beatles,,until they, you know, sent himnout on an errand and snuck away,and picked up Ringo on a tour.,Well, in 1994, when Pete Bestnwas interviewed --,yes, he's still a drummer;nyes, he's a studio musician --,he had this to say: "I'm happiernthan I would have been with the Beatles." 
 Okay. There's something importantnto be learned from these people,,and it is the secret of happiness.,Here it is, finally to be revealed.,First: accrue wealth, power,nand prestige, then lose it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Second: spend as much of your lifenin prison as you possibly can. 
 (Laughter) 
 Third: make somebody elsenreally, really rich.,And finally: never ever join the Beatles. 
 (Laughter),Yeah, right.,Because when people synthesize happiness,,as these gentlemen seem to have done,,we all smile at them,nbut we kind of roll our eyes and say,,"Yeah right, you nevernreally wanted the job.","Oh yeah, right. You really didn't haventhat much in common with her,,and you figured that out justnabout the time,she threw the engagementnring in your face.",We smirk because we believenthat synthetic happiness,is not of the same qualitynas what we might call "natural happiness." 
 What are these terms?,Natural happiness is what we getnwhen we get what we wanted,,and synthetic happiness is what we makenwhen we don't get what we wanted.,And in our society,nwe have a strong belief,that synthetic happinessnis of an inferior kind. 
 Why do we have that belief?,Well, it's very simple.,What kind of economic enginenwould keep churning,if we believednthat not getting what we want,could make us just as happy as getting it?,With all apologiesnto my friend Matthieu Ricard,,a shopping mall full of Zen monks,is not going to benparticularly profitable,,because they don't want stuff enough. 
 (Laughter) 
 I want to suggest to younthat synthetic happiness,is every bit as real and enduring,as the kind of happiness you stumble upon,when you get exactlynwhat you were aiming for.,I'm a scientist, so I'm goingnto do this not with rhetoric,,but by marinating younin a little bit of data. 
 Let me first show you an experimentalnparadigm that is used,to demonstrate the synthesis of happinessnamong regular old folks.,And this isn't mine.,It's a 50-year-old paradigmncalled the "free choice paradigm.",It's very simple.,You bring in, say, six objects,,and you ask a subject to rank themnfrom the most to the least liked.,In this case, becausenthis experiment uses them,,these are Monet prints.,So, everybody can rank these Monet prints,from the one they like the most,nto the one they like the least.,Now we give you a choice:,"We happen to havensome extra prints in the closet.,We're going to give younone as your prize to take home.,We happen to have number threenand number four," we tell the subject.,This is a bit of a difficult choice,,because neither one is preferrednstrongly to the other,,but naturally, peoplentend to pick number three,because they liked itna little better than number four. 
 Sometime later -- it could ben15 minutes; it could be 15 days --,the same stimuli are putnbefore the subject,,and the subject is askednto re-rank the stimuli.,"Tell us how much you like them now.",What happens?,Watch as happiness is synthesized.,This is the result that hasnbeen replicated over and over again.,You're watching happiness be synthesized.,Would you like to see it again?,Happiness!,"The one I got is reallynbetter than I thought!,That other one I didn't get sucks!",That's the synthesis of happiness. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, what's the right response to that?,"Yeah, right!",Now, here's the experiment we did,,and I hope this is going to convince you,that "Yeah, right!"nwas not the right response. 
 We did this experimentnwith a group of patients,who had anterograde amnesia.,These are hospitalized patients.,Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,,a polyneuritic psychosis.,They drank way too much,nand they can't make new memories.,OK? They remember their childhood,nbut if you walk in and introduce yourself,,and then leave the room,,when you come back,nthey don't know who you are. 
 We took our Monet prints to the hospital.,And we asked these patients to rank them,from the one they likednthe most to the one they liked the least.,We then gave them the choicenbetween number three and number four.,Like everybody else, they said,,"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great!nI could use a new print.,I'll take number three.",We explained we would havennumber three mailed to them.,We gathered up our materialsnand we went out of the room,,and counted to a half hour. 
 (Laughter) 
 Back into the room,nwe say, "Hi, we're back.",The patients, bless them,nsay, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,,I've got a memory problem;nthat's why I'm here.,If I've met you before, I don't remember.","Really, you don't remember?nI was just here with the Monet prints?","Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue.","No problem, Jim. All I wantnyou to do is rank these for me,from the one you like the mostnto the one you like the least." 
 What do they do?,Well, let's first check and make surenthey're really amnesiac.,We ask these amnesiac patientsnto tell us which one they own,,which one they chose lastntime, which one is theirs.,And what we find is amnesiacnpatients just guess.,These are normal controls,nwhere if I did this with you,,all of you would knownwhich print you chose.,But if I do this with amnesiac patients,nthey don't have a clue.,They can't pickntheir print out of a lineup. 
 Here's what normal controls do:nthey synthesize happiness.,Right? This is the change in liking score,,the change from the first time they rankednto the second time they ranked.,Normal controls show --nthat was the magic I showed you;,now I'm showing it to younin graphical form --,"The one I own is better than I thought.,The one I didn't own,nthe one I left behind,,is not as good as I thought.",Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing.nThink about this result. 
 These people like better the one they own,,but they don't know they own it.,"Yeah, right" is not the right response!,What these people didnwhen they synthesized happiness,is they really, truly changed,their affective, hedonic, aestheticnreactions to that poster.,They're not just saying itnbecause they own it,,because they don't know they own it. 
 When psychologists show you bars,,you know that they are showingnyou averages of lots of people.,And yet, all of us have thisnpsychological immune system,,this capacity to synthesize happiness,,but some of us do this tricknbetter than others.,And some situations allow anybodynto do it more effectively,than other situations do.,It turns out that freedom,,the ability to make up your mindnand change your mind,,is the friend of natural happiness,nbecause it allows you to choose,among all those delicious futures,and find the onenthat you would most enjoy.,But freedom to choose,,to change and make up your mind,,is the enemy of synthetic happiness. 
 And I'm going to show you why.nDilbert already knows, of course.,"Dogbert's tech support.nHow may I abuse you?","My printer prints a blanknpage after every document.","Why complain about getting free paper?","Free? Aren't you justngiving me my own paper?","Look at the quality of the free paperncompared to your lousy regular paper!,Only a fool or a liar would saynthat they look the same!","Now that you mention it,nit does seem a little silkier!","What are you doing?","I'm helping people accept the thingsnthey cannot change." Indeed. 
 The psychological immune system works best,when we are totally stuck,nwhen we are trapped.,This is the differencenbetween dating and marriage.,You go out on a date with a guy,,and he picks his nose;nyou don't go out on another date.,You're married to a guynand he picks his nose?,He has a heart of gold.nDon't touch the fruitcake!,You find a way to be happynwith what's happened. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, what I want to show you,is that people don't knownthis about themselves,,and not knowing this can worknto our supreme disadvantage. 
 Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.,We created a black-and-whitenphotography course,,and we allowed students to come innand learn how to use a darkroom.,So we gave them cameras;nthey went around campus;,they took 12 picturesnof their favorite professors,and their dorm room and their dog,,and all the other things they wantednto have Harvard memories of.,They bring us the camera;nwe make up a contact sheet;,they figure out which arenthe two best pictures;,and we now spend six hoursnteaching them about darkrooms.,And they blow two of them up,,and they have two gorgeousneight-by-10 glossies,of meaningful things to them, and we say,,"Which one would you like to give up?","I have to give one up?","Yes, we need one as evidencenof the class project.,So you have to give me one.nYou have to make a choice.,You get to keep one,nand I get to keep one." 
 Now, there are two conditionsnin this experiment.,In one case, the students are told,,"But you know,nif you want to change your mind,,I'll always have the other one here,,and in the next four days, beforenI actually mail it to headquarters" --,Yeah, "headquarters" --,"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.,In fact, I'll come to your dorm room,njust give me an email.,Better yet, I'll check with you.,You ever want to change your mind,nit's totally returnable.",The other half of the studentsnare told exactly the opposite:,"Make your choice, and by the way,,the mail is going out, gosh,nin two minutes, to England.,Your picture will be wingingnits way over the Atlantic.,You will never see it again.",Half of the studentsnin each of these conditions,are asked to make predictions,about how much they're going to comento like the picture that they keep,and the picture they leave behind.,Other students are just sent backnto their little dorm rooms,and they are measurednover the next three to six days,on their liking, satisfactionnwith the pictures.,And look at what we find. 
 First of all, here's what studentsnthink is going to happen.,They think they're going to maybencome to like the picture they chose,a little morenthan the one they left behind,,but these are not statisticallynsignificant differences.,It's a very small increase,nand it doesn't much matter,whether they were in the reversiblenor irreversible condition. 
 Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Becausenhere's what's really happening.,Both right before the swapnand five days later,,people who are stuck with that picture,,who have no choice,,who can never change their mind,,like it a lot!,And people who are deliberatingn-- "Should I return it?,Have I gotten the right one?nMaybe this isn't the good one?,Maybe I left the good one?" --nhave killed themselves.,They don't like their picture,,and in fact even after the opportunitynto swap has expired,,they still don't like their picture.,Why?,Because the [reversible] conditionnis not conducive,to the synthesis of happiness. 
 So here's the final piecenof this experiment.,We bring in a whole new groupnof naive Harvard students,and we say, "You know,nwe're doing a photography course,,and we can do it one of two ways.,We could do it so that whennyou take the two pictures,,you'd have four days to change your mind,,or we're doing another coursenwhere you take the two pictures,and you make up your mind right awaynand you can never change it.,Which course would you likento be in?" Duh!,66 percent of the students, two-thirds,,prefer to be in the course where they haventhe opportunity to change their mind.,Hello? 66 percent of the studentsnchoose to be in the course,in which they will ultimately be deeplyndissatisfied with the picture.,Because they do not know the conditionsnunder which synthetic happiness grows. 
 The Bard said everything best,nof course, and he's making my point here,but he's making it hyperbolically:,"'Tis nothing good or bad /nBut thinking makes it so.",It's nice poetry,nbut that can't exactly be right.,Is there really nothing good or bad?,Is it really the case that gall bladdernsurgery and a trip to Paris,are just the same thing?,(Laughter),That seems like a one-question IQ test.,They can't be exactly the same. 
 In more turgid prose,nbut closer to the truth,,was the father of modern capitalism,nAdam Smith, and he said this.,This is worth contemplating:,"The great source of both the miserynand disorders of human life,seems to arise from overratingnthe difference,between one permanentnsituation and another --,Some of these situations may, no doubt,ndeserve to be preferred to others,,but none of them can deserve to be pursued,with that passionate ardornwhich drives us to violate the rules,either of prudence or of justice,,or to corrupt the futurentranquility of our minds,,either by shame from the remembrancenof our own folly,,or by remorse for the horrornof our own injustice.",In other words: yes, some thingsnare better than others. 
 We should have preferences that lead usninto one future over another.,But when those preferencesndrive us too hard and too fast,because we have overratednthe difference between these futures,,we are at risk.,When our ambition is bounded,nit leads us to work joyfully.,When our ambition is unbounded,,it leads us to lie, to cheat,nto steal, to hurt others,,to sacrifice things of real value.,When our fears are bounded,,we're prudent, we're cautious,,we're thoughtful.,When our fearsnare unbounded and overblown,,we're reckless, and we're cowardly. 
 The lesson I want to leavenyou with, from these data,,is that our longings and our worriesnare both to some degree overblown,,because we have within us the capacitynto manufacture the very commodity,we are constantly chasingnwhen we choose experience. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)This session is on natural wonders,,and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.,I want to try to combine them all,,because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.,Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself,,and much more quickly than people had once realized,,if you simply stop doing what’s causing the problem.,And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general,is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet. 
 I love doing this work, because it really gives many people,new hope and new choices that they didn’t have before,,and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet,,but that happiness is not --,we're talking about the pursuit of happiness,,but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions,,what Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom,",when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people,,it’s really about -- our nature is to be happy;,our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy.,And so it’s not something -- happiness is not something you get,,health is generally not something that you get.,But rather all of these different practices --,you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns,didn’t develop these techniques to just manage stress,or lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries,,even though it can do all those things.,They’re powerful tools for transformation,,for quieting down our mind and bodies,to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,,to be peaceful, to be joyful,and to realize that it’s not something that you pursue and get,,but rather it’s something that you have already until you disturb it. 
 I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda,and people would say, "What are you, a Hindu?" He’d say, "No, I’m an undo.",And it’s really about identifying what’s causing us,to disturb our innate health and happiness,,and then to allow that natural healing to occur.,To me, that’s the real natural wonder. 
 So, within that larger context,,we can talk about diet, stress management --,which are really these spiritual practices --,moderate exercise, smoking cessation, support groups and community --,which I’ll talk more about -- and some vitamins and supplements.,And it’s not a diet.,You know, when most people think about the diet I recommend,,they think it’s a really strict diet.,For reversing disease, that’s what it takes,,but if you’re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices.,And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction,,you’re going to live longer, you’re going to feel better,,you’re going to lose weight, and so on.,And in our studies, what we’ve been able to do,is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures,to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost --,and in many ways, ancient -- interventions, can be. 
 We first began by looking at heart disease,,and when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago,,it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse.,And what we found was that, instead of getting worse and worse,,in many cases it could get better and better,,and much more quickly than people had once realized. 
 This is a representative patient who at the time was 73 --,totally needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead.,We used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing.,This is one of the arteries that feed the heart, one of the main arteries,,and you can see the narrowing here.,A year later, it’s not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction.,These minor changes in blockages,caused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow,,and using cardiac positron emission tomography, or "PET," scans,,blue and black is no blood flow, orange and white is maximal. 
 Huge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery.,Clinically, he literally couldn’t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain;,within a month, like most people, was pain-free, and within a year,,climbing more than 100 floors a day on a Stairmaster.,This is not unusual, and it’s part of what enables people,to maintain these kinds of changes,,because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life.,Overall, if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients,,they got worse and worse, from one year to five years, in the comparison group.,This is the natural history of heart disease,,but it’s really not natural because we found it could get better and better,,and much more quickly than people had once thought.,We also found that the more people change, the better they got.,It wasn’t a function of how old or how sick they were --,it was mainly how much they changed,,and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones. 
 I got this as a Christmas card a few years ago,from two of the patients in one of our programs.,The younger brother is 86, the older one’s 95;,they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were.,And the following year they sent me this one, which I thought was kind of funny.,(Laughter),You just never know.,And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients,start to reverse the progression of their heart disease.,Now I thought, you know, if we just did good science,,that would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive.,It’s important, but not enough.,Because we doctors do what we get paid to do,,and we get trained to do what we get paid to do,,so if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.,Insurance will cover the bypass, it’ll cover the angioplasty;,it won’t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle. 
 So, we began through our nonprofit institute's,training hospitals around the country,,and we found that most people could avoid surgery,,and not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective.,And the insurance companies found,that they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient,,and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project,where they’re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program,on the sites that we train.,The fortuneteller says, "I give smokers a discount,because there’s not as much to tell." (Laughter),I like this slide, because it’s a chance to talk about,what really motivates people to change, and what doesn’t.,And what doesn’t work is fear of dying,,and that’s what’s normally used. 
 Everybody who smokes knows it’s not good for you,,and still 30 percent of Americans smoke --,80 percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it?,Well, because it helps them get through the day.,And I’ll talk more about this, but the real epidemic,isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression.,As one woman said, "I’ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes,,and they’re always there for me and nobody else is.,You’re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?",Or they eat when they get depressed,,or they use alcohol to numb the pain,,or they work too hard, or watch too much TV.,There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain,,but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.,And the pain is not the problem: it’s the symptom.,And telling people they’re going to die is too scary to think about,,or, they’re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary,,and so they don’t want to think about it, so they don’t. 
 The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one.,You’ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth,,and "impotence" -- the headline is, "Impotent" -- it’s not emphysema.,What was the biggest selling drug of all time,when it was introduced a few years ago?,Viagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it.,It’s not like you say, "Hey Joe, I’m having erectile dysfunction, how about you?",And yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold.,It’s not so much psychological, it’s vascular,,and nicotine makes your arteries constrict.,So does cocaine, so does a high fat diet, so does emotional stress. 
 So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture,are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired,,lethargic, depressed and impotent, and that’s not much fun.,But when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood,,you think more clearly, you have more energy,,your heart gets more blood in ways I’ve shown you.,Your sexual function improves.,And these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal,,and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less --,and you’ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving.,When you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel?,You feel kind of sleepy afterwards.,On a low-fat meal, the blood flow doesn’t go down -- it even goes up.,Many of you have kids, and you know that’s a big change in your lifestyle,,and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they’re worth it.,And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits,,and you feel so much better so quickly.,For many people, those are choices worth making --,not to live longer, but to live better. 
 I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic,,because it really is a problem.,Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,,and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds,has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. It’s no joke: it’s real.,And just to show you this, this is from the CDC.,These are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight.,And if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 --,you get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 --,you get a new category; '98, '99, 2000, and 2001.,Mississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight.,Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well ...,but it doesn’t last, which is the problem. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, there’s no mystery in how you lose weight;,you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories.,Now, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,,which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food,,or if you restrict entire categories of foods.,But the problem is, you get hungry, so it’s hard to keep it off.,The other way is to change the type of food.,And fat has nine calories per gram,,whereas protein and carbs only have four.,So, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.,So you can eat the same amount of food, but you’ll be getting fewer calories,because the food is less dense in calories.,And it’s the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type of food. 
 You know, I don’t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day,,and so I just thought I’d spend a few minutes on that.,The myth that you hear about is,,Americans have been told to eat less fat,,the percent of calories from fat is down,,Americans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn’t make you fat.,It’s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever,,and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower,,the actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both.,Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died,,and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs,,the "bad carbs," and these are things like --,(Laughter),-- sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy:,you get all these calories that don’t fill you up because you’ve removed the fiber,,and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.,Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good.,But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat.,So, the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages --,these are not health foods --,but to go from "bad carbs" to what are called "good carbs.",And these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs:,fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.,And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories,,and it slows the absorption so you don’t get that rapid rise in blood sugar.,So, and you get all the disease-protective substances. 
 It’s not just what you exclude from your diet,,but also what you include that’s protective.,Just as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats.,And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids.,You find these, for example, in fish oil.,And the bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids and processed food,and saturated fats, which we find in meat.,If you don’t remember anything else from this talk,,three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack,and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent.,Three grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules;,more than that just gives you extra fat you don’t need.,It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers,like breast, prostate and colon cancer.,Now, the problem with the Atkins diet,,everybody knows people who have lost weight on it,,but you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen.,I mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren’t good for you.,You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health,rather than the one that harms it.,And the problem is that it’s based on this half-truth,,which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs,,so if you eat fewer simple carbs you’re going to lose weight.,You’ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat,,and you’ll enhance your health rather than harming it.,He says, "I’ve got some good news.,While your cholesterol level has remained the same,,the research findings have changed." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet?,The red is good at the beginning, and a year later --,this is from a study done in a peer-reviewed journal called Angiology --,there’s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend,,there’s less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet.,So, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn’t happy.,Now, one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center,found that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath,,54 percent had headaches – this is not a healthy way to eat.,And so, you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you,,but when they get too close it’s going to be a problem. 
 (Laughter) 
 And more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls,who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet --,of bone disease, kidney disease, and so on.,And that’s how your body excretes waste, is through your breath,,your bowels and your perspiration.,So when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad.,So, an optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs,,high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats.,And then, again, it’s a spectrum:,when you move in this direction, you’re going to lose weight,,you’re going to feel better and you’re going to gain health. 
 Now, there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too,,whether it’s the deforestation of the Amazon, or making more protein available,,to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day --,not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have.,So, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. 
 Now, we’re about to publish the first study,looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer,,and, in collaboration with Sloane-Kettering and with UCSF.,We took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer,and who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery.,We could randomly divide them into two groups,,and then we could have one group,that is a non-intervention control group to compare to,,which we can’t do with, say, breast cancer, because everyone gets treated. 
 What we found was that, after a year,,none of the experimental group patients,who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment,,whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation.,When we looked at their PSA levels -- which is a marker for prostate cancer --,they got worse in the control group,,but they actually got better in the experimental group,,and these differences were highly significant. 
 And then I wondered: was there any relationship,between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle --,whichever group they were in -- and the changes in PSA?,And sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship,,just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies.,And in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes. 
 I then wondered, well, maybe they’re just changing their PSA,,but it’s not really affecting the tumor growth.,So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA;,they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture,,and it inhibited the growth seven times more,in the experimental group than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent.,And finally, I said, I wonder if there’s any relationship between,how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth,,whichever group they happened to be in.,And this really got me excited because again,,we found the same pattern: the more people change,,the more it affected the growth of their tumors.,And finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients,,and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,,and you can see clearly it’s better a year later, along with the PSA going down.,So, if it’s true for prostate cancer, it’ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well.,And whether or not you have conventional treatment,,in addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence. 
 The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness,,is that study after study have shown,that people who are lonely and depressed --,and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture --,are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely,,in part because, as we talked about, they’re more likely to smoke,and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on.,But also, through mechanisms that we don’t fully understand,,people who are lonely and depressed are many times --,three to five to ten times, in some studies --,more likely to get sick and die prematurely.,And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that. 
 Now, on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing.,It can be sexual intimacy –,I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy,are just different forms of the same thing.,Friendship, altruism, compassion, service – all the perennial truths that we talked about,that are part of all religion and all cultures --,once you stop trying to see the differences,,these are the things in our own self-interest,,because they free us from our suffering and from disease.,And it’s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do. 
 Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford.,He took women with metastatic breast cancer,,randomly divided them into two groups.,One group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group.,It was a nurturing, loving environment,,where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses,and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer,with people who understood, because they were going through it too.,They just met once a week for a year.,Five years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people --,and that was the only difference between the groups.,It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet.,Other studies have shown this as well.,So, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing,,and even the word healing, it comes from the root "to make whole.",The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit,,meaning "union, to yoke, to bring together." 
 And the last slide I want to show you is from -- I was -- again,,this swami that I studied with for so many years, and I,did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds,at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago.,And at the end of it, somebody said,,"Hey, Swami, what’s the difference between wellness and illness?",And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word "illness,",and circled the first letter, and then wrote the word "wellness,",and circled the first two letters ...,To me, it’s just shorthand for what we’re talking about:,that anything that creates a sense of connection,and community and love is really healing.,And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process.,Thank you. (Applause)The immersive ugliness,of our everyday environments in America,is entropy made visible.,We can't overestimate the amount of despair,that we are generating with places like this.,And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better,if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America.,By the way, this doesn't help.,Nobody's having a better day down here because of that. 
 There are a lot of ways you can describe this.,You know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum.",You can call it suburban sprawl.,I think it's appropriate to call it,the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.,You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.,And it's a tremendous problem for us.,The outstanding -- the salient problem about this for us,is that these are places that are not worth caring about.,We're going to talk about that some more.,A sense of place:,your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character,depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,,and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,,syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture,in order to inform us who we are. 
 The public realm in America has two roles:,it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,,and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.,And when you degrade the public realm,,you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life,and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.,The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America,because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas,and market squares of older cultures.,And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about,all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.,This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle,that we threw in the garbage after World War II,and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.,And consequently, we can see the result all around us.,The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,,but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.,Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,,by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going,in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.,And if there is one tremendous --,if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built,,the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years,,it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present. 
 The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.,You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.,And remember, to create a place of character and quality,,you have to be able to define space.,So how is that being accomplished here?,If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here,and try to look at the Target store over here,,you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter),That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.,Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.,These will be places that are not worth caring about. 
 We have about, you know, 38,000 places,that are not worth caring about in the United States today.,When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.,And I want you to think about that when you think about,those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,,spilling their blood in the sand,,and ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?",I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store,because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause),We need better places in this country. 
 Public space. This is a good public space.,It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.,It is emphatically an outdoor public room.,It has something that is terribly important --,it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.,That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations --,things go in and out of it. It's permeable.,The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,,and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.,You know, in these places in other cultures,,people just go there voluntarily because they like them.,We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter),You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.,People just go because it's pleasurable to be there.,But this is how we do it in the United States. 
 Probably the most significant public space failure in America,,designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:,Boston City Hall Plaza.,A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter),And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,,and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.,And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings. 
 This is the other side of the building.,This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.,It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,,but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.,This is the back of Boston City Hall,,the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston.,And what is the message that is coming,,what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building,and how is it informing us about who we are? 
 This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits,of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,,and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,,because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.,You know, that it's a despotic building;,it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter),This is it on a smaller scale:,the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.,By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,,they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter),and they shouted at me and said,,"It was raining that day when you took that picture!",Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter) 
 You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter),Audio jack, power supply --,and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?,You know, we hire firms to design these things.,You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.,You know, eight hours before deadline,,four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?,And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table,with all the drawings, and the renderings,,and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and --,I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter),Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.,It was: "Fuck it." (Laughter) (Applause) 
 That -- that is the message of this form of architecture.,The message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.,So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to --,you know -- do some reality testing,,and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter),it's not interesting enough for his clients,,you know, the burglars, the muggers.,It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.,OK. 
 The pattern of Main Street USA --,in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.,It's not that complicated:,buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,,so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.,Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,,you know, apartments, offices, and so on.,You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.,They haven't learned that in Monterey.,If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,,you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.,It's really incredible. 
 Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,,and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,,when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?,So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.,OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,,where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter),Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.,Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,,we pop a handicapped ramp on that,,and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.,And that's how we do it.,I call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America,that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.,And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.,Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.,You know, that's not good enough.,We have to do good buildings. 
 The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:,To spatially denote the pedestrian realm,,to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,,to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,,and to soften the hardscape of the buildings,and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.,And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.,They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;,they're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans." 
 You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding,of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.,They're not the same thing.,And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,,which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.,Here you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed,,R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch,to see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter) 
 A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma,that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,,city life, and everything connected with it.,And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,,is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,,which is going to be life in the country for everybody.,And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:,the country villa along the railroad line,,which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,,but to return to the countryside every night.,And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,,so it really was a form of country living. 
 But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years,and it turns into something rather insidious.,It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.,And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia,and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.,Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now. 
 And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.,Basically, a house with nothing on the side,because this house wants to state, emphatically,,"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.,I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.",So you have this one last facade of the house,,the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.,Because -- notice the porch here.,Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.,This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called "We're Normal.",We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.,Please respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal. 
 But we know what's going on in these houses, you know.,We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,,getting ready for homeroom. (Laughter),We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,,is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.,Because these places, these habitats,,are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,,and they don't have a lot of experience with medication.,So they take the first one that comes along, often.,These are not good enough for Americans.,These are the schools we are sending them to:,The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.,This is a real school!,You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,,that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.,So every effort is made to keep them within the building.,Notice that nature is present. (Laughter) 
 We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.,We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America,-- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.,It is going to change absolutely everything.,Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,,except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.,Forget it. It's not going to happen.,We're going to have to do something else instead.,We're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size,virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.,We're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.,We're going to have to live closer to each other.,We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.,The age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.,We're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!,We gotta do better than that! 
 And we should have started two days before yesterday.,We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,,excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage,by our parents' generation after World War II.,Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.,We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill,in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,,that allow -- that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life,and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion. 
 So that, you know, the residences make sense,deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.,We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:,the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,,the courtyard, the civic square,and how to really make use of this property.,We can see some of the first ideas,for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.,The dead malls: what are we going to do with them?,Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.,They're not going to be retro-fitted;,they're going to be the salvage yards of the future. 
 Some of them we're going to fix, though.,And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems,and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.,And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers,in our existing towns and cities.,And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were,because they occupy all the important sites.,And most of them are still going to be there,,although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished. 
 We've got a lot of work to do.,We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.,No amount or combination of alternative fuels,is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.,We're going to have to do everything very differently.,And America's not prepared.,We are sleepwalking into the future.,We're not ready for what's coming at us.,So I urge you all to do what you can.,Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.,Be prepared to be good neighbors.,Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful,to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens. 
 One final thing -- I've been very disturbed about this for years,,but I think it's particularly important for this audience.,Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as "consumers." OK?,Consumers are different than citizens.,Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties,to their fellow human beings.,And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,,you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.,And we're going to continue being clueless,going into this very difficult future that we face.,So thank you very much.,Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about,and a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?,Brain magic to me indicatesnthat area of magic,dealing with psychologicalnand mind-reading effects.,So unlike traditional magic,nit uses the power of words,,linguistic deception,nnon-verbal communication,and various other techniquesnto create the illusion of a sixth sense. 
 I'm going to show you all how easy it is,to manipulate the human mindnonce you know how.,I want everybody downstairs alsonto join in with me and everybody.,I want everybody to put out your handsnlike this for me, first of all.,OK, clap them together, once.,OK, reverse your hands.,Now, follow my actions exactly.,Now about half the audience hasntheir left hand up. Why is that?,OK, swap them around,nput your right hand up.,Cross your hands over,nso your right hand goes over,,interlace your fingers like this,,then make sure your right thumbnis outside your left thumb --,that's very important.,Yours is the other way around,nso swap it around.,Excellent, OK. Extendnyour fingers like this for me.,All right. Tap them together once.,OK, now, if you did not allow mento deceive your minds,,you would all be able to do this. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter ends) 
 Now you can see how easy it is,for me to manipulate the human mind,nonce you know how. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I remember when I was about 15, 
 (Laughter) 
 I read a copy of Life magazine,,which detailed a storynabout a 75-year-old blind Russian woman,who could sense printed letters --,there's still people trying to do it -- 
 (Laughter) 
 -- who could sense printed lettersnand even sense colors, just by touch.,And she was completely blind.,She could also readnthe serial numbers on bills,when they were placed,nface down, on a hard surface.,Now, I was fascinated,nbut at the same time, skeptical.,How could somebody readnusing their fingertips?,You know, if you actually think about it,nif somebody is totally blind --,a guy yesterday did a demonstrationnin one of the rooms,,where people had to close their eyesnand they could just hear things.,And it's just a really weird thingnto try and figure out.,How could somebody readnusing their fingertips? 
 Now earlier on, as part of a TV shownthat I have coming up on MTV,,I attempted to givena similar demonstration,of what is now known as second sight.,So, let's take a look. 
 (Video) Man: There we go.,I'm going to guide you into the car. 
 Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter) 
 Man: You're OK, keep on going. 
 KT: How are you? 
 Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here.,I'm going to take younto a secret location, OK?,Kathryn, there was no waynyou could see through that blindfold. 
 KT: OK, but don't say my name like that.nKB: But you're OK? 
 KT: Yes. 
 KB: No way to see through it?nKT: No. 
 KB: I'll take it off.,Do you want to take the rest off?,Take it off, you're OK.nWe'll stop for a second. 
 KT: I'm so afraidnof what I'm going to see. 
 KB: You're fine, take it off.nYou're OK. You're safe.,Have you ever heard of second sight? 
 KT: No. 
 KB: Second sight is wherebyna mind-control expert,can see through somebody else's eyes.,And I'm going to try that right now. 
 KT: God. 
 KB: Are you ready?,Where is it? There's no way -- 
 KT: (Beep) 
 KT: Oh, my God! 
 KB: Don't say anything,,I'm trying to see through your eyes.nI can't see. 
 KT: There's a wall, there's a wall. 
 KB: Look at the road, look at the road. 
 KT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God! 
 KB: Now, anything coming at all?nKT: No. 
 KB: Sure there's not? 
 KT: No, no, I'm just stillnlooking at the road.,I'm looking at the road, all the time.,I'm not taking my eyes off the road. 
 (Beep) 
 (Beep) 
 (Beep) 
 KT: Oh, my God! 
 KB: Where are we? Where are we?,We're going uphill, are we going uphill? 
 KT: Look at the road -- (Beep),Still got that goddamn blindfold on. 
 KB: What? 
 KT: How are you doing this? 
 KB: Just don't break my concentration. 
 We're OK, though?nKT: Yes.,That's so weird.,We're nearly there. Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! 
 KB: And I've stopped. 
 KT: That is weird.,You're like a freak-ass of nature.,That was the most scary thingnI've ever done in my life! 
 (Applause) 
 KB: Thank you.,By the way, two days ago,nwe were going to film this,down there, at the race course,nand we got a guy into a car,,and we got a camera man in the back,,but halfway through the drive,,he told me he had,nI think it was a nine-millimeter,,stuck to his leg.,So, I stopped pretty quick,nand that was it. 
 So, do you believe it's possiblento see through somebody else's eyes?,That's the question.,Now, most people herenwould automatically say no.,OK, but I want you to realize some facts.,I couldn't see through the blindfold.,The car was not gimmickednor tricked in any way.,The girl, I'd never met before, all right.,So, I want you to just thinknabout it for a moment.,A lot of people try to come up,with a logical solutionnto what just happened, all right.,But because your brains are notntrained in the art of deception,,the solutions you come up with,will, 99 percent of the time,nbe way off the mark. 
 This is because magicnis all about directing attention.,If, for instance, I didn't wantnyou to look at my right hand,,then I don't look at it.,But if I wanted younto look at my right hand,,then I look at it, too.,You see, it's very simple,nonce you know how,,but very complicated in other ways. 
 I'm going to give younsome demonstrations right now.,I need two people to help me outnreal quick. Can you come up?,And let's see, down at the end, here,ncan you also come up, real quick?,Do you mind? Yes, at the end.,OK, give them a round of applausenas they come up.,You might want to use the stairs, there. 
 (Applause) 
 It's very importantnfor everybody here to realize,I haven't set anything up with you.,You don't know what will happen, right?,Would you mind just standingnover here for a moment? 
 Your name is?nNicole: Nicole. 
 KB: Nicole, and? 
 (Telephone ringing) 
 KB: Actually, here's the thing,nanswer it, answer it, answer it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Is it a girl?nMan: They've already gone. 
 KB: OK, swap over positions.,Can you stand over here?nThis will make it easier.,Pity, I would have told themnit was the ace of spades.,OK, a little bit closer. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, a little bit closer, come over --nthey look really nervous up here.,Do you believe in witchcraft? 
 Nicole: No. 
 KB: Voodoo?nNicole: No. 
 KB: Things that go bump in the night?nNicole: No. 
 KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK.,I want you to just standnexactly like this for me,,pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind.,OK, now, I want you to be aware,of all the differentnsensations around you,,because we'll try a voodoo experiment.,I want you to be aware of the sensations,nbut don't say anything until I ask you,,and don't open your eyes until I ask you.,From this point onwards, close your eyes,,do not say anything, do not open them,,be aware of the sensations. 
 Yes or no, did you feel anything? 
 Nicole: Yes. 
 KB: You did feel that? What did you feel? 
 Nicole: A touch on my back. 
 KB: How many times did you feel it? 
 Nicole: Twice. 
 KB: Twice. OK, extend your left armnout in front of you.,Extend your left arm, OK.,OK, keep it there.,Be aware of the sensations, don't saynanything, don't open your eyes, OK. 
 Did you feel anything, there? 
 Nicole: Yes.nKB: What did you feel? 
 Nicole: Three -- 
 KB: Like a tickling sensation?nNicole: Yes. 
 KB: Can you show us where?,OK, excellent. Open your eyes.,I never touched you.,I just touched his back,nand I just touched his arm.,A voodoo experiment. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, I walk around nightclubsnall night like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 You just take a seatnover here for a second.,I'm going to use you again, in a moment.,Can you take a seatnright over here, if you don't mind. 
 Sit right here.nMan: OK. 
 KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK.,Now, what I want you to donis look directly at me, OK,,just take a deep breathnin through your nose,,letting it out throughnyour mouth, and relax.,Allow your eyes to close,non five, four, three, two, one.,Close your eyes right now.,OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,,I'm merely placing you in a heightenednstate of synchronicity,,so our minds are along the same lines.,And as you sink and drift and floatninto this relaxed state of mind,,I'm going to take your left hand,nand just place it up here. 
 I want you to hold it therenjust for a moment,,and I only want you to allow your hand,to sink and drift and floatnback to the tabletop,at the same rate and speed,as you drift and float into thisnrelaxed state of awareness,,and allow it to go all the wayndown to the tabletop.,That's it, all the way down,nall the way down.,and further, and further.,Excellent.,I want you to allow your handnto stick firmly to the tabletop.,OK, now, allow it to stay there. 
 OK, now, in a moment,nyou'll feel a certain pressure, OK,,and I want younto be aware of the pressure.,Just be aware of the pressure.,And I only want you to allow your hand,to float slowly back up from the tabletopnas you feel the pressure release,,but only when you feelnthe pressure release.,Do you understand? Just answer yes or no. 
 Man: Yes. 
 KB: Hold it right there.,And only when you feelnthe pressure go back,,allow your hand to driftnback to the tabletop,,but only when you feel the pressure. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, that was wonderfully done.nLet's try it again. 
 Excellent. Now that you've got the idea,nlet's try something even more interesting.,Allow it to stick firmlynto the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.,Can you stand up?nJust stand, stage forward.,I want you to point directlynat his forehead.,OK.,Imagine a connection between you and him.,Only when you wantnthe pressure to be released,,make an upward gesture, like this,,but only when you want it to be released.,You can wait as long as you want,,but only when you wantnthe pressure released.,OK, let's try it again.,OK, now, imagine the connection, OK.,Point directly at his forehead.,Only when you want the pressurenreleased, we'll try it again. 
 OK, it worked that time, excellent.,And hold it there, both of you.,Only when you want the pressurento go back, make a downward gesture.,You can wait as long as you want.,You did it pretty quickly,nbut it went down, OK. 
 Now, I want you to be awarenthat in a moment,,when I snap my fingers,nyour eyes will open, again.,It's OK to remember to forget,nor forget to remember what happened.,Most people ask you, "Whatnthe hell just happened up here?",But it's OK that even thoughnyou're not hypnotized,,you will forget everything that happened.,On five, four, three, two, one --nopen your eyes, wide awake.,Give them a round of applause,nas they go back to their seats. 
 (Applause) 
 OK, you can go back. 
 (Applause) 
 I once saw a film calledn"The Gods Are Crazy.",Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah.,Remember when they threwnthe Coke out of the airplane,,and it landed on the ground,nand it didn't break?,Now, see, that's becausenCoke bottles are solid.,It's nearly impossiblento break a Coke bottle.,Do you want to try it?,Good job. She's not taking any chances. 
 (Laughter) 
 You see, psychokinesisnis the paranormal influence,of the mind on physicalnevents and processes.,For some magicians or mentalists,,sometimes the spoon will bendnor melt, sometimes it will not.,Sometimes the object will slidenacross the table, sometimes it will not.,It depends on how muchnenergy you have that day,,so on and so forth. 
 We're going to try an experimentnin psychokinesis, right now.,Come right over here, next to me.nExcellent.,Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.,Make sure it is solid, there's onlynone hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.,And you can whack it against the table,nif you want; be careful.,Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.,I want you to pinch right herenwith two fingers and your thumb.,Excellent.nNow, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.,I want you to examine the shard of glass.,Careful, it's sharp.nJust hold on to it for a moment.,Now, hold it out here. 
 I want you to imagine, right now,na broken relationship from many years ago.,I want you to imaginenall the negative energy,from that brokennrelationship, from that guy,,being imparted into the brokennpiece of glass,,which will represent him, OK.,But I want you to take thisnvery seriously.,Stare at the glass,nignore everybody right here.,In a moment, you'll feelna certain sensation, OK,,and when you feel that sensation,,I want you to drop the piecenof glass into the bottle.,Think of that guy, that ba -- that guy. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm trying to be good here.,OK, and when you feel the sensation --,it might take a while --ndrop it into the glass.,OK, drop it in. 
 Now, imagine all that negativenenergy in there.,Imagine his namenand imagine him inside the glass.,And I want you to releasenthat negative energy,by shaking it from side to side. 
 (Burst) 
 (Laughter) 
 That was a lot of negative energy,nbuilt up in there. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I also want you to look at menand think of his name.,OK, think of how many lettersnin the title of his name.,There's five letters in the title.,You didn't react to that,nso it's four letters.,Think of one of the letters in the title.,There's a K in his name, there is a K.,I knew that because my namenstarts with a K also,,but his name doesn't startnwith a K, it starts with an M.,Tell Mike I said hello,nthe next time you see him. 
 Was that his name?nNicole: Mm-hmm. 
 KB: OK, give her a round of applause. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 I've got one more thingnto share with you right now.,Actually, Chris, I was goingnto pick you for this,,but instead of picking you,ncan you hop up here,and pick a victimnfor this next experiment?,And it should be a male victim,nthat's the only thing. 
 Chris Anderson: Oh, OK. 
 KB: I was going to use you,,but I decided I might wantnto come back another year. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: Well, to reward himnfor saying "eureka,",and for selecting Michael Mercil to comenand talk to us -- Steve Jurvetson. 
 KB: OK, Steve, come on up here. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: You knew! 
 KB: OK, Steve, I want you to takena seat, right behind here. Excellent.,Now, Steve -- oh, youncan check underneath.,Go ahead, I've no fancynassistants underneath there.,They insist that because I was a magician,,put a nice, black tablecloth on.,There you are, OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve.,One, two, three and four.,Now, they're all the exactnsame except this one,obviously has a stainless steelnspike sticking out of it.,I want you to examine it,nand make sure it's solid.,Happy? 
 Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes. 
 KB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm goingnto stand in front of the table,,When I stand in front of the table,,I want you to put the cups on the plinths,,in any order you want,nand then mix them all up,,so nobody has any idea wherenthe spike is, all right? 
 SJ: No one in the audience? 
 KB: Yes, and just to help you out,,I'll block them from view,nso nobody can see what you're doing.,I'll also look away. So, gonahead and mix them up, now.,OK, and tell me when you're done. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 KB: You done?nSJ: Almost. 
 KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're makingnsure that's well hidden.,Oh, we've got one here,nwe've got one here. 
 (Applause) 
 So, all right, we'll leave them like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm going to have the last laugh, though. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, Steve, you know where the spike is,nbut nobody else, does? Correct?,But I don't want you to know either,nso swivel around on your chair.,They'll keep an eye on mento make sure I don't do anything funny.,No, stay around, OK.,Now, Steve, look back.,Now you don't know where the spike is,nand I don't know where it is either.,Now, is there any way to seenthrough this blindfold? 
 SJ: Put this on? 
 KB: No, just, is there any waynto see through it? No? 
 SJ: No, I can't see through it.nKB: Excellent.,Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold.,Don't stack them up, OK.nGive them an extra mix up.,Don't move the cups, I don't wantnanybody to see where the spike is,,but give the plinths an extra mix up,nand then line them up.,I'll put the blindfold on.nGive them an extra mix up.,No messing around this time.nOK, go ahead, mix them up.,My hand is at risk here. 
 (Laughter) 
 Tell me when you're done.nSJ: Done. 
 KB: OK, where are you?nPut out your hand. Your right hand.,Tell me when I'm over a cup. 
 SJ: You're over a cup.nKB: I'm over a cup, right now? 
 SJ: Mm-hmm. 
 KB: Now, Steve, do you thinknit's here? Yes or no? 
 SJ: Oh! 
 (Laughter) 
 KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh. 
 (Laughter) 
 SJ: I don't think it's there.nKB: No? Good decision. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Now, if I go this way,nis there another cup over here? 
 SJ: Can we do the left hand? 
 KB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me couldnhe do the left hand. Absolutely not. 
 (Laughter) 
 KB: If I go this way,nis there another cup? 
 SJ: Yes.nKB: Tell me when to stop. 
 SJ: OK.nKB: There? 
 SJ: Yes, there's one. 
 KB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no?nThis is your decision, not mine. 
 (Laughter) 
 SJ: I'm going to say no.nKB: Good decision. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, give me both hands.,Now, put them on both cups.,Do you think the spikenis under your left or your right hand? 
 SJ: Neither. 
 KB: Neither, oh, OK.,But if you were to guess. 
 (Laughter) 
 SJ: Under my right hand.nKB: Under your right hand?,Now, remember, you madenall the decisions all along.,Psychologists, figure this out. 
 (SJ gasps) 
 Have a look. 
 SJ: Oh! 
 (Applause) 
 KB: Thank you. 
 (Applause ends),If anybody wants to seensome sleight of hand later on,,I'll be outside.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was President of the AmericannPsychological Association,,they tried to media-train me.,And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes,what I'm going to be talking about today,,which is the eleventh reasonnto be optimistic.,The editor of Discover told us 10 of them;,I'm going to give you the eleventh. 
 So they came to me, CNN,nand they said, "Professor Seligman --,would you tell us about the statenof psychology today?,We'd like to interview you about that.",And I said, "Great.",And she said, "But this is CNN,nso you only get a sound bite.",I said, "Well, how many words do I get?",And she said, "Well, one." 
 (Laughter) 
 And the cameras rolled, and she said,,"Professor Seligman,nwhat is the state of psychology today?","Good." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Cut! Cut. That won't do.,We'd really better givenyou a longer sound bite.","How many words do I get this time?","Well, you get two." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Doctor Seligman, what is the statenof psychology today?","Not good." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Look, Doctor Seligman,,we can see you're reallynnot comfortable in this medium.,We'd better give you a real sound bite.,This time you can have three words.,Professor Seligman, what is the statenof psychology today?","Not good enough.",That's what I'm going to be talking about. 
 I want to say why psychologynwas good, why it was not good,,and how it may become,nin the next 10 years, good enough.,And by parallel summary, I want to saynthe same thing about technology,,about entertainment and design,,because I think the issuesnare very similar. 
 So, why was psychology good?,Well, for more than 60 years, psychologynworked within the disease model.,Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane,and I introduced myself to my seatmate,nand told them what I did,,they'd move away from me,,because, quite rightly, they were saying,psychology is about findingnwhat's wrong with you.,Spot the loony.,And now, when I tell peoplenwhat I do, they move toward me. 
 What was good about psychology --,about the $30 billionninvestment NIMH made,,about working in the disease model,,about what you mean by psychology --,is that, 60 years ago,nnone of the disorders were treatable;,it was entirely smoke and mirrors.,And now, 14 of the disordersnare treatable,,two of them actually curable. 
 And the other thing that happenednis that a science developed,,a science of mental illness.,We found out we could take fuzzy concepts,like depression, alcoholism,,and measure them with rigor;,that we could create a classificationnof the mental illnesses;,that we could understandnthe causality of the mental illnesses.,We could look across timenat the same people --,people, for example, who were geneticallynvulnerable to schizophrenia --,and ask what the contributionnof mothering, of genetics are,,and we could isolate third variables,by doing experimentsnon the mental illnesses. 
 And best of all, we were able,nin the last 50 years,,to invent drug treatmentsnand psychological treatments.,And then we were ablento test them rigorously,,in random-assignment,nplacebo-controlled designs,,throw out the things that didn't work,,keep the things that actively did. 
 The conclusion of that is,,psychology and psychiatrynof the last 60 years,can actually claim that we can makenmiserable people less miserable.,And I think that's terrific.,I'm proud of it.,But what was not good,nthe consequences of that,,were three things. 
 The first was moral;,that psychologists and psychiatristsnbecame victimologists, pathologizers;,that our view of human naturenwas that if you were in trouble,,bricks fell on you.,And we forgot that peoplenmade choices and decisions.,We forgot responsibility.,That was the first cost. 
 The second cost wasnthat we forgot about you people.,We forgot about improving normal lives.,We forgot about a mission to makenrelatively untroubled people happier,,more fulfilled, more productive.,And "genius," "high-talent,"nbecame a dirty word.,No one works on that. 
 And the third problemnabout the disease model is,,in our rush to do somethingnabout people in trouble,,in our rush to do somethingnabout repairing damage,,it never occurred to usnto develop interventions,to make people happier --npositive interventions. 
 So that was not good.,And so that's what led peoplenlike Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,,Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself,to work in something I call,n"positive psychology,",which has three aims.,The first is that psychologynshould be just as concerned,with human strengthnas it is with weakness.,It should be just as concernednwith building strength,as with repairing damage.,It should be interestednin the best things in life.,And it should be just as concerned,with making the livesnof normal people fulfilling,,and with genius,nwith nurturing high talent. 
 So in the last 10 yearsnand the hope for the future,,we've seen the beginningsnof a science of positive psychology,,a science of what makes life worth living.,It turns out that we can measurendifferent forms of happiness.,And any of you, for free,ncan go to that website -- 
 [www.authentichappiness.org] 
 and take the entire panoplynof tests of happiness.,You can ask, how do you stacknup for positive emotion, for meaning,,for flow, against literally tensnof thousands of other people?,We created the opposite of the diagnosticnmanual of the insanities:,a classification of the strengthsnand virtues that looks at the sex ratio,,how they're defined, how to diagnose them,,what builds themnand what gets in their way.,We found that we could discovernthe causation of the positive states,,the relationship between leftnhemispheric activity,and right hemispheric activity,nas a cause of happiness. 
 I've spent my life workingnon extremely miserable people,,and I've asked the question:,How do extremely miserable peoplendiffer from the rest of you?,And starting about six years ago,nwe asked about extremely happy people.,How do they differ from the rest of us?,It turns out there's one way,nvery surprising --,they're not more religious,nthey're not in better shape,,they don't have more money,nthey're not better looking,,they don't have more good eventsnand fewer bad events.,The one way in which they differ:nthey're extremely social.,They don't sit in seminarsnon Saturday morning. 
 (Laughter) 
 They don't spend time alone.,Each of them is in a romantic relationship,and each has a rich repertoire of friends. 
 But watch out here -- this is merelyncorrelational data, not causal,,and it's about happinessnin the first, "Hollywood" sense,,I'm going to talk about,,happiness of ebulliencenand giggling and good cheer.,And I'm going to suggest to younthat's not nearly enough,,in just a moment.,We found we could begin to looknat interventions over the centuries,,from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.,About 120 interventions have been proposednthat allegedly make people happy.,And we find that we've been ablento manualize many of them,,and we actually carry out,random-assignment efficacynand effectiveness studies.,That is, which ones actuallynmake people lastingly happier?,In a couple of minutes, I'll tell younabout some of those results. 
 But the upshot of this is that the missionnI want psychology to have,,in addition to its missionnof curing the mentally ill,,and in addition to its mission of makingnmiserable people less miserable,,is, can psychology actuallynmake people happier?,And to ask that question -- "happy"nis not a word I use very much --,we've had to break it down,into what I thinknis askable about "happy.",And I believe there are three different --,I call them "different" because differentninterventions build them,,it's possible to have onenrather than the other --,three different happy lives.,The first happy life is the pleasant life.,This is a life in which you havenas much positive emotion,as you possibly can,,and the skills to amplify it.,The second is a life of engagement:,a life in your work, your parenting,nyour love, your leisure;,time stops for you.,That's what Aristotle was talking about.,And third, the meaningful life.,I want to say a little bitnabout each of those lives,and what we know about them. 
 The first life is the pleasant life,nand it's simply, as best we can find it,,it's having as manynof the pleasures as you can,,as much positive emotion as you can,,and learning the skills -- savoring,nmindfulness -- that amplify them,,that stretch them over time and space.,But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,,and it's why positive psychologynis not happy-ology,,and why it doesn't end here. 
 The first drawback is,nit turns out the pleasant life,,your experience of positive emotion,,is about 50 percent heritable,,and, in fact, not very modifiable.,So the different tricksnthat Matthieu and I and others know,about increasing the amountnof positive emotion in your life,are 15 to 20 percent tricks,ngetting more of it.,Second is that positivenemotion habituates.,It habituates rapidly, indeed.,It's all like French vanilla ice cream:,the first taste is 100 percent;,by the time you're downnto the sixth taste,,it's gone.,And, as I said,nit's not particularly malleable. 
 And this leads to the second life.,I have to tell you about my friend Len,,to talk about why positive psychologynis more than positive emotion,,more than building pleasure.,In two of the three great arenasnof life, by the time Len was 30,,Len was enormously successful.,The first arena was work.,By the time he was 20,nhe was an options trader.,By the time he was 25,nhe was a multimillionaire,and the head of an optionsntrading company.,Second, in play, he's a nationalnchampion bridge player.,But in the third great arena of life,nlove, Len is an abysmal failure.,And the reason he was,nwas that Len is a cold fish. 
 (Laughter) 
 Len is an introvert.,American women said to Len,nwhen he dated them,,"You're no fun. You don't havenpositive emotion. Get lost.",And Len was wealthy enough to be ablento afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,,who for five years triednto find the sexual trauma,that had somehow lockednpositive emotion inside of him.,But it turned out there wasn'tnany sexual trauma.,It turned out that --,Len grew up in Long Island,and he played footballnand watched football, and played bridge.,Len is in the bottom five percentnof what we call positive affectivities. 
 The question is: Is Len unhappy?,And I want to say, not.,Contrary to what psychology told us,about the bottom 50 percentnof the human race in positive affectivity,,I think Len is onenof the happiest people I know.,He's not consignednto the hell of unhappiness,,and that's because Len, like most of you,,is enormously capable of flow.,When he walks onto the floornof the American Exchange,at 9:30 in the morning,,time stops for him.,And it stops till the closing bell.,When the first card is playedntill 10 days later,,when the tournament is over,,time stops for Len. 
 And this is indeednwhat Mike Csikszentmihalyi,has been talking about, about flow.,And it's distinct from pleasurenin a very important way:,pleasure has raw feel -- you knownit's happening; it's thought and feeling.,But what Mike told younyesterday -- during flow ...,you can't feel anything.,You're one with the music.,Time stops.,You have intense concentration.,And this is indeed the characteristicnof what we think of as the good life.,And we think there's a recipe for it,,and it's knowing whatnyour highest strengths are --,again, there's a valid test,of what your five highest strengths are --,and then re-crafting your life,to use them as much as you possibly can.,Re-crafting your work, your love,,your play, your friendship,nyour parenting. 
 Just one example.,One person I worked withnwas a bagger at Genuardi's.,Hated the job.,She's working her way through college.,Her highest strengthnwas social intelligence.,So she re-crafted baggingnto make the encounter with her,the social highlightnof every customer's day.,Now, obviously she failed.,But what she did was to takenher highest strengths,,and re-craft work to use themnas much as possible.,What you get out of thatnis not smiley-ness.,You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.,You don't giggle a lot.,What you get is more absorption. 
 So, that's the second path.,The first path, positive emotion;,the second path is eudaemonian flow;,and the third path is meaning.,This is the most venerablenof the happinesses, traditionally.,And meaning, in this view, consists of --,very parallel to eudaemonia --,it consists of knowingnwhat your highest strengths are,,and using them to belong tonand in the service of,something larger than you are. 
 I mentioned that for all threenkinds of lives --,the pleasant life, the good life,nthe meaningful life --,people are nownhard at work on the question:,Are there things that lastinglynchange those lives?,And the answer seems to be yes.,And I'll just give you some samples of it.,It's being done in a rigorous manner.,It's being done in the same waynthat we test drugs,to see what really works.,So we do random-assignment,nplacebo-controlled,,long-term studiesnof different interventions.,Just to sample the kind of interventionsnthat we find have an effect:,when we teach peoplenabout the pleasant life,,how to have more pleasure in your life,,one of your assignmentsnis to take the mindfulness skills,,the savoring skills,,and you're assignednto design a beautiful day.,Next Saturday, set a day aside,ndesign yourself a beautiful day,,and use savoring and mindfulnessnto enhance those pleasures.,And we can show in that waynthat the pleasant life is enhanced. 
 Gratitude visit.,I want you all to do thisnwith me now, if you would.,Close your eyes.,I'd like you to remember someone,who did something enormously important,that changed your lifenin a good direction,,and who you never properly thanked.,The person has to be alive.,Now, OK, you can open your eyes.,I hope all of you have such a person.,Your assignment, when you're learningnthe gratitude visit,,is to write a 300-wordntestimonial to that person,,call them on the phone in Phoenix,,ask if you can visit, don't tell them why.,Show up at their door,,you read the testimonial --neveryone weeps when this happens.,And what happens is, when we test people,one week later, a month later,nthree months later,,they're both happier and less depressed. 
 Another example is a strengths date,,in which we get couples to identifyntheir highest strengths,on the strengths test,,and then to design an eveningnin which they both use their strengths.,We find this is a strengthenernof relationships.,And fun versus philanthropy.,It's so hearteningnto be in a group like this,,in which so many of you have turnednyour lives to philanthropy.,Well, my undergraduates and the peoplenI work with haven't discovered this,,so we actually have peoplendo something altruistic,and do something fun,,and contrast it.,And what you findnis when you do something fun,,it has a square wave walk set.,When you do something philanthropicnto help another person,,it lasts and it lasts.,So those are examplesnof positive interventions. 
 So the next to last thingnI want to say is:,we're interested in how muchnlife satisfaction people have.,This is really what you're about.,And that's our target variable.,And we ask the question as a functionnof the three different lives,,how much life satisfaction do you get?,So we ask -- and we've done thisnin 15 replications,,involving thousands of people:,To what extent doesnthe pursuit of pleasure,,the pursuit of positive emotion,,the pleasant life,,the pursuit of engagement,ntime stopping for you,,and the pursuit of meaningncontribute to life satisfaction? 
 And our results surprised us;nthey were backward of what we thought.,It turns out the pursuit of pleasurenhas almost no contribution,to life satisfaction.,The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.,The pursuit of engagementnis also very strong.,Where pleasure mattersnis if you have both engagement,and you have meaning,,then pleasure's the whippedncream and the cherry.,Which is to say, the full life --nthe sum is greater than the parts,,if you've got all three.,Conversely, if you have nonenof the three, the empty life,,the sum is less than the parts. 
 And what we're asking now is:nDoes the very same relationship --,physical health, morbidity,nhow long you live and productivity --,follow the same relationship?,That is, in a corporation,,is productivity a function of positivenemotion, engagement and meaning?,Is health a functionnof positive engagement,,of pleasure, and of meaning in life?,And there is reason to think the answernto both of those may well be yes. 
 So, Chris said that the lastnspeaker had a chance,to try to integrate what he heard,,and so this was amazing for me.,I've never been in a gathering like this.,I've never seen speakers stretchnbeyond themselves so much,,which was one of the remarkable things.,But I found that the problemsnof psychology seemed to be parallel,to the problems of technology,nentertainment and design,in the following way:,we all know that technology,nentertainment and design,have been and can be usednfor destructive purposes.,We also know that technology,nentertainment and design,can be used to relieve misery.,And by the way, the distinctionnbetween relieving misery,and building happinessnis extremely important.,I thought, when I first becamena therapist 30 years ago,,that if I was good enoughnto make someone not depressed,,not anxious, not angry,,that I'd make them happy.,And I never found that;,I found the best you could ever do,was to get to zero;,that they were empty. 
 And it turns out the skills of happiness,nthe skills of the pleasant life,,the skills of engagement,nthe skills of meaning,,are different from the skillsnof relieving misery.,And so, the parallel thing holdsnwith technology, entertainment,and design, I believe.,That is, it is possiblenfor these three drivers of our world,to increase happiness,,to increase positive emotion.,And that's typicallynhow they've been used.,But once you fractionatenhappiness the way I do --,not just positive emotion,nthat's not nearly enough --,there's flow in life,nand there's meaning in life.,As Laura Lee told us,,design and, I believe,nentertainment and technology,,can be used to increase meaningnengagement in life as well. 
 So in conclusion,,the eleventh reason for optimism,,in addition to the space elevator,,is that I think with technology,nentertainment and design,,we can actually increasenthe amount of tonnage,of human happiness on the planet.,And if technology can,nin the next decade or two,,increase the pleasant life,nthe good life and the meaningful life,,it will be good enough.,If entertainment can be divertednto also increase positive emotion,,meaning eudaemonia,,it will be good enough.,And if design can increasenpositive emotion,,eudaemonia, and flow and meaning,,what we're all doing togethernwill become good enough. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I guess it is a resultnof globalization,that you can find Coca-Cola tinsnon top of Everest,and a Buddhist monk in Monterey. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I just came,ntwo days ago, from the Himalayas,to your kind invitation.,So I would like to invite you, also,nfor a while, to the Himalayas themselves.,And to show the placenwhere meditators, like me,,who began with being a molecular biologistnin Pasteur Institute,,and found their way to the mountains. 
 So these are a few imagesnI was lucky to take and be there.,There's Mount Kailashnin Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.,This is from Marlboro country. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a turquoise lake.,A meditator.,This is the hottest day of the yearnsomewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.,And the night before, we camped,nand my Tibetan friends said,,"We are going to sleep outside.",And I said, "Why? We havenenough space in the tent.",They said, "Yes, but it's summertime." 
 (Laughter) 
 So now, we are goingnto speak of happiness.,As a Frenchman, I must say,that there arena lot of French intellectuals,that think happinessnis not at all interesting. 
 (Laughter) 
 I just wrote an essay on happiness,nand there was a controversy.,And someone wrote an article saying,,"Don't impose on usnthe dirty work of happiness." 
 (Laughter) 
 "We don't care about being happy.nWe need to live with passion.,We like the ups and downs of life.,We like our suffering because it's so goodnwhen it ceases for a while." 
 (Laughter) 
 This is what I see from the balconynof my hermitage in the Himalayas.,It's about two meters by three,nand you are all welcome any time. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, let's comento happiness or well-being.,And first of all, you know,ndespite what the French intellectuals say,,it seems that no one wakes upnin the morning thinking,,"May I suffer the whole day?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Which means that somehow,nconsciously or not,,directly or indirectly,nin the short or the long term,,whatever we do, whatever we hope,nwhatever we dream --,somehow, is related to a deep, profoundndesire for well-being or happiness.,As Pascal said,neven the one who hangs himself,,somehow, is lookingnfor cessation of suffering.,He finds no other way.,But then, if you looknin the literature, East and West,,you can find incredible diversitynof definition of happiness.,Some people say, I only believednin remembering the past,,imagining the future, never the present.,Some people say happiness is right now;,it's the quality of the freshnessnof the present moment.,And that led Henri Bergson,nthe French philosopher, to say,,"All the great thinkers of humanitynhave left happiness in the vague,so that each of themncould define their own terms." 
 Well, that would be fine if it was justna secondary preoccupation in life.,But now, if it is somethingnthat is going to determine,the quality of every instant of our life,,then we better know what it is,nhave some clearer idea.,And probably, the factnthat we don't know that is why, so often,,although we seek happiness,nit seems we turn our back to it.,Although we want to avoid suffering,,it seems we are runningnsomewhat towards it.,And that can also comenfrom some kind of confusions. 
 One of the most common onesnis happiness and pleasure.,But if you look atnthe characteristics of those two,,pleasure is contingent upon time,nupon its object,,upon the place.,It is something that -- changes of nature.,Beautiful chocolate cake:nfirst serving is delicious,,second one not so much,nthen we feel disgust. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's the nature of things.,We get tired.,I used to be a fan of Bach.,I used to play it on the guitar, you know.,I can hear it two, three, five times.,If I had to hear it 24 hours,nnon-stop, it might be very tiring.,If you are feeling very cold,nyou come near a fire, it's so wonderful.,After some moments,nyou just go a little back,,and then it starts burning.,It sort of uses itselfnas you experience it.,And also, again, it can --nalso, it's something that you --,it is not somethingnthat is radiating outside.,Like, you can feel intense pleasure,and some others around youncan be suffering a lot. 
 Now, what, then, will be happiness?,And happiness, of course, is suchna vague word, so let's say well-being.,And so, I think the best definition,naccording to the Buddhist view,,is that well-being is not justna mere pleasurable sensation.,It is a deep sensenof serenity and fulfillment.,A state that actually pervades,and underlies all emotional states,,and all the joys and sorrowsnthat can come one's way.,For you, that might be surprising.,Can we have this kind of well-beingnwhile being sad?,In a way, why not?,Because we are speakingnof a different level. 
 Look at the waves coming near the shore.,When you are at the bottomnof the wave, you hit the bottom.,You hit the solid rock.,When you are surfing on the top,nyou are all elated.,So you go from elationnto depression -- there's no depth.,Now, if you look at the high sea,,there might be beautiful,ncalm ocean, like a mirror.,There might be storms,,but the depth of the oceannis still there, unchanged.,So now, how is that?,It can only be a state of being,nnot just a fleeting emotion, sensation.,Even joy -- that can benthe spring of happiness.,But there's also wicked joy,nyou can rejoice in someone's suffering. 
 So how do we proceednin our quest for happiness?,Very often, we look outside.,We think that if we could gathernthis and that, all the conditions,,something that we say,n"Everything to be happy --,to have everything to be happy.",That very sentence already revealsnthe doom, destruction of happiness.,To have everything.,If we miss something, it collapses.,And also, when things go wrong,nwe try to fix the outside so much,,but our controlnof the outer world is limited,,temporary, and often, illusory.,So now, look at inner conditions.,Aren't they stronger?,Isn't it the mind that translates,the outer conditionninto happiness and suffering?,And isn't that stronger?,We know, by experience,,that we can benwhat we call "a little paradise,",and yet, be completely unhappy within. 
 The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,,and there was a lot of constructionngoing on everywhere.,So one evening, he said,n"Look, you are doing all these things,,but isn't it nice, also,nto build something within?",And he said, "[Without] that --neven if you get a high-tech flat,on the 100th floor of a super-modernnand comfortable building,,if you are deeply unhappy within,,all you are going to look fornis a window from which to jump.",So now, at the opposite,,we know a lot of people who,nin very difficult circumstances,,manage to keep serenity, inner strength,ninner freedom, confidence.,So now, if the inner conditionsnare stronger --,of course, the outernconditions do influence,,and it's wonderful to livenlonger, healthier,,to have access to information, education,,to be able to travel, to have freedom.,It's highly desirable.,However, this is not enough.,Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.,The experience that translatesneverything is within the mind.,So then, when we ask oneself,how to nurturenthe condition for happiness,,the inner conditions, and which are thosenwhich will undermine happiness.,So then, this just needsnto have some experience. 
 We have to know from ourselves,nthere are certain states of mind,that are conducive to this flourishing,nto this well-being,,what the Greeks calledneudaimonia, flourishing.,There are some which are adversento this well-being.,And so, if we looknfrom our own experience,,anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,,obsessive desire, strong grasping,,they don't leave us in such a good statenafter we have experienced it.,And also, they are detrimentalnto others' happiness.,So we may consider that the morenthose are invading our mind,,and, like a chain reaction,,the more we feel miserable,nwe feel tormented.,At the opposite,neveryone knows deep within,that an act of selfless generosity,,if from the distance, without anyonenknowing anything about it,,we could save a child's life,nmake someone happy.,We don't need the recognition.nWe don't need any gratitude.,Just the mere fact of doing that,fills such a sense of adequationnwith our deep nature.,And we would like to benlike that all the time. 
 So is that possible,,to change our way of being,nto transform one's mind?,Aren't those negative emotions,nor destructive emotions,,inherent to the nature of mind?,Is change possible in our emotions,nin our traits, in our moods?,For that we have to ask,nwhat is the nature of mind?,And if we look fromnthe experiential point of view,,there is a primarynquality of consciousness,that's just the mere factnto be cognitive, to be aware.,Consciousness is like a mirrornthat allows all images to rise on it.,You can have ugly faces,nbeautiful faces in the mirror.,The mirror allows that,nbut the mirror is not tainted,,is not modified,nis not altered by those images.,Likewise, behind every single thought,there is the bare consciousness,npure awareness.,This is the nature.,It cannot be tainted intrinsicallynwith hatred or jealousy because then,,if it was always there --,like a dye that would permeatenthe whole cloth --,then it would be foundnall the time, somewhere.,We know we're not always angry,nalways jealous, always generous. 
 So, because the basicnfabric of consciousness,is this pure cognitive qualitynthat differentiates it from a stone,,there is a possibility for changenbecause all emotions are fleeting.,That is the ground for mind training.,Mind training is based on the ideanthat two opposite mental factors,cannot happen at the same time.,You could go from love to hate.,But you cannot, at the same time,ntoward the same object,,the same person, want to harmnand want to do good.,You cannot, in the same gesture,nshake hand and give a blow.,So, there are naturalnantidotes to emotions,that are destructivento our inner well-being.,So that's the way to proceed.,Rejoicing compared to jealousy.,A kind of sense of inner freedom,as opposite to intensengrasping and obsession.,Benevolence, loving kindnessnagainst hatred.,But, of course, each emotion thennwould need a particular antidote. 
 Another way is to try to findna general antidote to all emotions,,and that's by looking at the very nature.,Usually, when we feel annoyed,nhatred or upset with someone,,or obsessed with something,,the mind goes againnand again to that object.,Each time it goes to the object,,it reinforces that obsessionnor that annoyance.,So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.,So what we need to look for now is,,instead of looking outward,nwe look inward.,Look at anger itself.,It looks very menacing,,like a billowing monsoon cloudnor thunderstorm.,We think we could sit on the cloud,,but if you go there, it's just mist.,Likewise, if you looknat the thought of anger,,it will vanish like frostnunder the morning sun.,If you do this againnand again, the propensity,,the tendencies for anger to arise again,will be less and lessneach time you dissolve it.,And, at the end, although it may rise,,it will just cross the mind,,like a bird crossing the skynwithout leaving any track.,So this is the principal of mind training. 
 Now, it takes time,,because it took time for all those faultsnin our mind, the tendencies, to build up,,so it will take timento unfold them as well.,But that's the only way to go.,Mind transformation --nthat is the very meaning of meditation.,It means familiarizationnwith a new way of being,,new way of perceiving things,,which is more in adequation with reality,,with interdependence, with the streamnand continuous transformation,,which our being and our consciousness is. 
 So, the interface with cognitive science,,since we need to come to that,nit was, I suppose, the subject of --,we have to deal in such a short time --nwith brain plasticity.,The brain was thoughtnto be more or less fixed.,All the nominal connections,nin numbers and quantities,,were thought, until the last 20 years,,to be more or less fixednwhen we reached adult age.,Now, recently, it has been foundnthat it can change a lot.,A violinist, as we heard, who has donen10,000 hours of violin practice,,some area that controls the movementsnof fingers in the brain changes a lot,,increasing reinforcementnof the synaptic connections.,So can we do that with human qualities?,With loving kindness,nwith patience, with openness? 
 So that's what those greatnmeditators have been doing.,Some of them who came to the labs,,like in Madison, Wisconsin,nor in Berkeley,,did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.,They do, like, three years' retreat,nwhere they do meditate 12 hours a day.,And then, the rest of their life,nthey will do three or four hours a day.,They are real Olympicnchampions of mind training. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is the place where the meditators --nyou can see it's kind of inspiring.,Now, here with 256 electrodes. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what did they find?,Of course, same thing.,The scientific embargo --,if it's ever submitted to "Nature,"nhopefully, it will be accepted.,It deals with the state of compassion,nunconditional compassion.,We asked meditators, who havenbeen doing that for years and years,,to put their mind in a statenwhere there's nothing but loving kindness,,total availability to sentient being.,Of course, during the training,nwe do that with objects.,We think of people suffering,nof people we love,,but at some point, it can bena state which is all pervading.,Here is the preliminary result,,which I can shownbecause it's already been shown.,The bell curve shows 150 controls,,and what is being looked at,is the difference between the rightnand the left frontal lobe.,In very short, peoplenwho have more activity,in the right side of the prefrontal cortex,are more depressed, withdrawn.,They don't describena lot of positive affect.,It's the opposite on the left side:,more tendency to altruism,,to happiness, to express,nand curiosity and so forth.,So there's a basic line for people.nAnd also, it can be changed.,If you see a comic movie,nyou go off to the left side.,If you are happy about something,nyou'll go more to the left side.,If you have a bout of depression,nyou'll go to the right side.,Here, the -0.5 is the fullnstandard deviation,of a meditatornwho meditated on compassion.,It's something that is totally outnof the bell curve. 
 So, I've no time to goninto all the different scientific results.,Hopefully, they will come.,But they found that --nthis is after three and a half hours,in an fMRI,,it's like coming out of a space ship.,Also, it has been shown in other labs --,for instance,nPaul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --,that some meditators are able, also,,to control their emotional responsenmore than it could be thought.,Like the startle experiments, for example.,If you sit a guy on a chair,with all this apparatusnmeasuring your physiology,,and there's kind of a bomb that goes off,,it's such an instinctive response that,,in 20 years, they never sawnanyone who would not jump.,Some meditators,nwithout trying to stop it,,but simply by being completely open,,thinking that that bang is just goingnto be a small event like a shooting star,,they are able not to move at all. 
 So the whole point of that is not,nsort of, to make, like,,a circus thing of showing exceptionalnbeings who can jump, or whatever.,It's more to saynthat mind training matters.,That this is not just a luxury.,This is not a supplementarynvitamin for the soul.,This is somethingnthat's going to determine,the quality of every instant of our lives.,We are ready to spend 15 yearsnachieving education.,We love to do jogging, fitness.,We do all kinds of thingsnto remain beautiful.,Yet, we spend surprisingly little timentaking care of what matters most --,the way our mind functions --,which, again, is the ultimate thing,that determinesnthe quality of our experience. 
 Now, compassionnis supposed to be put in action.,That's what we try to donin different places.,Just this one examplenis worth a lot of work.,This lady with bone TB,nleft alone in a tent,,was going to die with her only daughter.,One year later, how she is.,Different schools and clinicsnwe've been doing in Tibet. 
 And just, I leave younwith the beauty of those looks,that tells more about happinessnthan I could ever say. 
 (Laughter) 
 And jumping monks of Tibet. 
 (Laughter) 
 Flying monks. 
 Thank you very much.This is called Hooked on a Feeling:,The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.,I put up a somewhat dour Darwin,,but a very happy chimp up there.,My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.,Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,,and cannot wish not to be so.,We are wired to pursue happiness,,not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it. 
 So given that that's true,,how good are we at increasing our happiness?,Well, we certainly try.,If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles,with advice on the seven habits, the nine choices,,the 10 secrets,,the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.,Now another way we try to increase our happiness,is we medicate ourselves.,And so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.,Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.,It was clean, efficient, there was no high,,there was really no danger, it had no street value.,In 1995,,illegal drugs were a $400 billion business,,representing eight percent of world trade,,roughly the same as gas and oil. 
 These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much.,One problem that's happening now is,,although the rates of happiness,are about as flat as the surface of the moon,,depression and anxiety are rising.,Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis,,and more people are being found out.,It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world.,In the United States right now,there are more suicides than homicides.,There is a rash of suicide in China.,And the World Health Organization predicts,by the year 2020,that depression will be,the second largest cause of disability. 
 Now the good news here,is that if you take surveys from around the world,,we see that about three quarters of people,will say they are at least pretty happy.,But this does not follow any of the usual trends.,For example, these two show great growth in income,,absolutely flat happiness curves. 
 My field, the field of psychology,,hasn't done a whole lot,to help us move forward in understanding human happiness.,In part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist,,who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest,,is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual,that can never be met in reality.,He said, "One feels inclined to say,that the intention that man should be happy,is not included in the plan of creation.",So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy,was really what Freud called ordinary misery. 
 (Laughter) 
 And Freud in part reflects,the anatomy of the human emotion system --,which is that we have both a positive and a negative system,,and our negative system,is extremely sensitive.,So for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet,and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.,We also find that people are more averse to losing,than they are happy to gain.,The formula for a happy marriage,is five positive remarks, or interactions,,for every one negative.,And that's how powerful the one negative is.,Especially expressions of contempt or disgust,,well you really need a lot of positives to upset that. 
 I also put in here the stress response.,We're wired for dangers that are immediate,,that are physical, that are imminent,,and so our body goes into an incredible reaction,where endogenous opioids come in.,We have a system that is really ancient,,and really there for physical danger.,And so over time, this becomes a stress response,,which has enormous effects on the body.,Cortisol floods the brain;,it destroys hippocampal cells and memory,,and can lead to all kinds of health problems. 
 But unfortunately, we need this system in part.,If we were only governed by pleasure,we would not survive.,We really have two command posts.,Emotions are short-lived intense responses,to challenge and to opportunity.,And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves,that tune in, turn on, drop out,thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.,We tend to think of emotions as just feelings.,But in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert,that change what we remember,,what kind of decisions we make,,and how we perceive things. 
 So let me go forward to the new science of happiness.,We've come away from the Freudian gloom,,and people are now actively studying this.,And one of the key points in the science of happiness,is that happiness and unhappiness,are not endpoints of a single continuum.,The Freudian model is really one continuum,that, as you get less miserable,,you get happier.,And that isn't true -- when you get less miserable,,you get less miserable.,And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.,And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.,So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur,,because there isn't a sense of the other half --,of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude,,what are the positive emotions.,And of course we know this intuitively,,that happiness is not just the absence of misery.,But somehow it was not put forward until very recently,,seeing these as two parallel systems.,So that the body can both look for opportunity,and also protect itself from danger, at the same time.,And they're sort of two reciprocal,and dynamically interacting systems. 
 People have also wanted to deconstruct.,We use this word "happy,",and it's this very large umbrella of a term.,And then three emotions for which there are no English words:,fiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge;,schadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune,,a malicious pleasure;,and naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.,Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness,,are happiness in another's happiness.,We don't seem to have a word for that.,We are very sensitive to the negative,,but it is in part offset by the fact,that we have a positivity. 
 We're also born pleasure-seekers.,Babies love the taste of sweet,and hate the taste of bitter.,They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.,They like to look at beautiful faces,rather than plain faces.,They like to listen to consonant melodies,instead of dissonant melodies.,Babies really are born,with a lot of innate pleasures.,There was once a statement made by a psychologist,that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness,is really just about the genes,,and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.,That's nonsense.,There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes --,about 50 percent --,but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for. 
 Let's just go into the brain for a moment,,and see where does happiness,arise from in evolution.,We have basically at least two systems here,,and they both are very ancient.,One is the reward system,,and that's fed by the chemical dopamine.,And it starts in the ventral tegmental area.,It goes to the nucleus accumbens,,all the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,,where decisions are made, high level.,This was originally seen as a system,that was the pleasure system of the brain.,In the 1950s,,Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.,And the rat would just keep pressing that bar,thousands and thousands and thousands of times.,It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.,It wouldn't do anything but press this bar.,So they assumed,this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron. 
 It turned out that it wasn't,,that it really is a system of motivation,,a system of wanting.,It gives objects what's called incentive salience.,It makes something look so attractive,that you just have to go after it.,That's something different,from the system that is the pleasure system,,which simply says, "I like this.",The pleasure system, as you see,,which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin,,is widely spread throughout the brain.,Dopamine system, the wanting system,,is much more centralized. 
 The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.,And we see here the smile.,And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips,to the zygomatic major.,It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye,,the orbicularis oculi.,So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother,,will show this particular kind of smile.,Extroverts use it more than introverts.,People who are relieved of depression,show it more after than before.,So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness,,you will look for this expression. 
 Our pleasures are really ancient.,And we learn, of course, many, many pleasures,,but many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia --,that we have a response to the natural world,that's very profound.,Very interesting studies,done on people recovering from surgery,,who found that people who faced a brick wall,versus people who looked out on trees and nature,,the people who looked out on the brick wall,were in the hospital longer, needed more medication,,and had more medical complications.,There is something very restorative about nature,,and it's part of how we are tuned. 
 Humans, particularly so, we're very imitative creatures.,And we imitate from almost the second we are born.,Here is a three-week-old baby.,And if you stick your tongue out at this baby,,the baby will do the same.,We are social beings from the beginning.,And even studies of cooperation,show that cooperation between individuals,lights up reward centers of the brain.,One problem that psychology has had,is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity --,or the importance of the social brain,to humans who come into the world helpless,and need each other tremendously --,is that they focus instead on the self,and self-esteem, and not self-other.,It's sort of "me," not "we.",And I think this has been a really tremendous problem,that goes against our biology and nature,,and hasn't made us any happier at all. 
 Because when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow,,when they're absorbed in something out in the world,,when they're with other people, when they're active,,engaged in sports, focusing on a loved one,,learning, having sex, whatever.,They're not sitting in front of the mirror,trying to figure themselves out,,or thinking about themselves.,These are not the periods when you feel happiest.,The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is,,is if you look at computerized text analysis,of people who commit suicide,,what you find there, and it's quite interesting,,is use of the first person singular --,"I," "me," "my,",not "we" and "us" --,and the letters are less hopeless,than they are really alone.,And being alone is very unnatural to the human.,There is a profound need to belong. 
 But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.,Because, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy,,they care that we replicate,,that we pass our genes on.,So for example we have three systems,that underlie reproduction, because it's so important.,There's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.,And that's really mediated by the sex hormones.,Romantic attraction,,that gets into the desire system.,And that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person.",There's attachment, which is oxytocin,,and the opiates, which says, "This is a long-term bond.",See the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.,So a person can be in a long term attachment,,become romantically infatuated with someone else,,and want to have sex with a third person. 
 The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray,is in social status.,We are very acutely aware of our social status,and always seek to further and increase it.,Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status,,and that's dominance.,I seize command by physical prowess,,and I keep it by beating my chest,,and you make submissive gestures.,Now, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top,,and that is a prestige route,,which is freely conferred.,Someone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things,,and we give that person status.,And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status,so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy,as they are in the animal world. 
 The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness.,But it's not irrelevant.,So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction,,you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.,You see mental distress going up with lower income.,So clearly there is some effect.,But the effect is relatively small.,And one of the problems with money is materialism.,What happens when people pursue money too avidly,,is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.,So we have here, this couple.,"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?",And then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys.",So one of the things is that it really takes over.,That whole dopamine-wanting system,takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system. 
 Maslow had this idea back in the 1950s,that as people rise above their biological needs,,as the world becomes safer,and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met --,our biological system, whatever motivates us, is being satisfied --,we can rise above them, to think beyond ourselves,toward self-actualization or transcendence,,and rise above the materialist. 
 So to just quickly conclude with some brief data,that suggests this might be so.,One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change:,they felt their life and their whole values had changed.,And sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in,,you see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected,,before the change,,and much more post-materialist values after.,Women had a whole different set of value shifts.,But very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.,They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control,to generosity and forgiveness. 
 I end with a few quotes.,"There is only one question:,How to love this world?",And Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor,,do not blame it; blame yourself.,Tell yourself that you are not poet enough,to call forth its riches.","First, say to yourself what you would be.,Then do what you have to do." 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Many of you could ask the question, you know,,why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,,a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?,A number of years ago,,Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars,of some form would be available.,Now, 60 years later,,I'm here to tell you why it's possible.,When I was about five years old,,not very much -- about a year after,Mr. Ford made his predictions,,I was living in a rural part of Canada,,on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.,Getting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age,,through the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.,It was a trying and scary thing,for a young kid to be going through. 
 At the end of my first year in school, in the summer of that year,,I discovered a couple hummingbirds,that were caught in a shed near my home.,They'd worn themselves out,,beating themselves against the window,,and, well, they were easy to capture.,I took them outside and as I let them go, that split second, even though they were very tired,,that second I let them go they hovered for a second,,then zipped off into the distance.,I thought, what a great way to get to school. 
 (Laughter) 
 For a kid at that age, this was like infinite speed, disappearing,,and I was very inspired by that.,And so the next -- over the next,six decades, believe it or not,,I've built a number of aircraft,,with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me,,what the hummingbird does,,and give you that flexibility.,I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor,,after the Latin word "volant," meaning,,to fly in a light, nimble manner.,Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.,The FAA, the controlling body above all,,calls it a "powered lift aircraft.",And they've actually issued a pilot's license --,a powerlift pilot's license -- for this type of aircraft.,It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that,there are no operational powered lift aircraft.,So for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself. 
 The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar.",This is a little bit earlier version of it,,that's why it's given the X designation,,but it's a four-passenger aircraft,that could take off vertically, like a helicopter --,therefore it doesn't need an airfield.,On the ground, it's powered electrically.,It's actually classified as a motorcycle,because of the three wheels, which is a great asset,because it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways,in most states, and actually in all cities.,So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues,of the automobile, forget it -- you're never going to fly it. 
 (Laughter) 
 One could say that a helicopter,does pretty much what the hummingbird does,,and gets around in much the same way, and it's true,,but a helicopter is a very complex device.,It's expensive --,so expensive that very few people could own or use it.,It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity,,as a series of parts -- a large number of parts --,flying in formation. 
 (Laughter) 
 Another difference, and I have to describe this,,because it's very personal,,another great difference between the helicopter,and the volantor --,in my case the Skycar volantor --,is the experience that I've had,in flying both of those.,In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation --,you feel like you're being hauled up from above,by a vibrating crane.,When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you,,there's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation --,you really feel like you're being lifted up,by a magic carpet,,without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.,And it's been a great motivator.,I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally,,and only when I can persuade my stockholders,to let me do so,,but it's still one of those wonderful experiences,that reward you for all that time. 
 What we really need is something to replace the automobile,for those 50-plus mile trips.,Very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips,make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.,If we can get rid of that,,then the highways will now be useful to you,,as contrasted by what's happening,in many parts of the world today.,On this next slide, is an interesting history,of what we really have seen in infrastructure,,because whether I give you a perfect Skycar,,the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you,unless you've got a system to use it in.,I'm sure any of you have asked the question,,yeah, are there great things up there -- what am I going to do, get up there?,It's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?,This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow,is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot,,you're going to be a passenger.,And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward. 
 I can tell you, technically we can build Skycars --,my God, we went to the moon!,The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.,But we have to have these priority changes,,we have to have infrastructure to go with this.,Historically you see that we got around,200 years ago by canals,,and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.,As that disappeared we came in with highways.,But if you look at that top corner -- the highway system --,you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built,,and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways,in the next 10 years.,However, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years,,we're going to see 30 percent more traffic.,And where is that going to lead you to?,So the issue then, I've often asked, is,when is it going to happen? 
 When are we going to be able to have these vehicles?,And of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view.,After all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow.,So, I'm not going to quote myself on this.,I'd prefer to quote someone else,,who testified with me before Congress,,and in his position as head of NASA,put forward this particular vision,of the future of this type of aircraft.,Now I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today,,you're only averaging about 30 miles per hour --,on average, according to the DOT --,the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour,,up to 25,000 feet.,And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase,in the ability to get around,as far as speed is concerned. 
 Unbeknownst to many of you,,the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here,has been under construction for 10 years.,It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile,,but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.,,there's a Russian GPS,,and there's a new GPS system,going to Europe, called Galileo.,With those three systems,,you have what is always necessary --,a level of redundancy that says,,if one system fails, you'll still have a way,to make sure that you're being controlled.,Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing,,it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you. 
 How would a trip in a Skycar work?,Well, you can't right now,take off from your home because it's too noisy.,I mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.,But it's still fairly quiet.,You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport,,which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.,This is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft,,and you're not going to spend that much time on the road.,After all, if you can fly like that,,why are you going to drive around on a highway?,Go to a local vertiport,,plug in your destination,,delivered almost like a passenger.,You can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way.,This is the world -- there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that --,and I've had a lot of bad feedback,from people who want to be up there, flying around,and experiencing that.,And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.,But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.,Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system. 
 We flew the first vehicle for the international press,in 1965, when I really got it started.,I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System,,and I got a lot of excitement around this,,and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.,And then through the various years,we invented various vehicles.,Actually the critical point was in 1989,,when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle --,how completely stable it was in all circumstances,,which is of course very critical.,Still not a practical vehicle during all of this,,but moving in the right direction, we believe.,Finally, in the early part of --,or actually the middle of 2002,,we flew the 400 -- M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.,In this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.,And we had very small power plants in it at this time.,We are now installing larger powerplants,,which will make it possible for me to get back on board. 
 A vertical-takeoff aircraft,is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.,There's an old adage that applied for the years,between 1950s and 1970s,,when every aeronautical company,was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft.,A vertical-takeoff aircraft,needs an artificial stabilization system --,that's essential.,At least for the hover,,and the low-speed flight.,If that single-stability system,,that brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails,,that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.,And the adage that I'm referring to,,that applied at that time,,was that nothing comes down faster,than a VTOL aircraft upside down. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots.,In fact, the aircraft companies gave up on,vertical-takeoff aircraft,more or less for a number of years.,And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today,that's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter --,and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet.,A vertical-takeoff aircraft,,like the hummingbird,,has a very high metabolism,,which means it requires a lot of energy.,Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down,to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package. 
 Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel,invented the rotary engine.,A very unique engine -- it's round,,it's small, it's vibration-free.,It fits exactly where we need to fit it,,right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system --,very critical. In fact that engine --,for those who are into the automobile --,know that it recently is applied to the RX8 --,the Mazda.,And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.,Wonderful engine.,In that application, it generates one horsepower per pound,,which is twice as good as your car engine today,,but only half of what we need.,My company has spent 35 years,and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine,,which was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get,over two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical.,We actually get 175 horsepower,into one cubic foot.,We have eight engines in this vehicle.,We have four computers. We have two parachutes. 
 Redundancy is the critical issue here.,If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.,And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine,,and continued to hover.,The computers back up each other. There's a voting system --,if one computer is not agreeing with the other three,,it's kicked out of the system.,And then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy.,If one of those fails, you still have a second chance.,If you stick around, then good luck.,There won't be a third chance.,The parachutes are there -- hopefully,,more for psychological than real reasons, but,they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd like to show you an animation in this next one,,which is one element,of the Skycar's use,,but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.,You could think of it personally in your own terms,,of how you might use it.,Video: Skycar dispatched, launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.,Paul Moller: I believe that personal transportation,in something like the Skycar,,probably in another volantor form as well,,will be a significant part of our lives,,as Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.,And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.,If you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes,,you're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment,,buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain,,buy a Skycar,,which I think would be priced at that time perhaps,in the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...,that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.,But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell. 
 (Laughter) 
 Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge.,Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people,believing in what I'm doing -- both financially and in technical help.,And that has --,you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing,,and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.,I characterized this emerging technology,in an aphorism,,as it's described,,which really talks about what I've experienced,,and I'm sure what other people may have experienced,in emerging technologies. 
 There's an interesting poll that came out recently,under NAS --,I think it's MSNBC --,in which they asked the question,,"Are you in the market for a volantor?",Twenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible.",Forty-seven percent -- yes, as soon as they could -- price could come down.,Twenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe.",Only seven percent said,that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.,I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like,,to some extent, it is becoming self-evident.,That we need an alternative to the automobile,,at least for those 50-mile trips and more,,so that the highways become usable in today's world.,Thank you.This is the first of twonrather extraordinary photographs,I'm going to show you today.,It was taken 18 years ago.,I was 19 years old at the time.,I had just returned,from one of the deepest divesnI'd ever made at that time --,a little over 200 feet.,And I had caught this little fish.,It turns out that particular onenwas the first of its kind,ever taken alive.,I'm not just an ichthyologist,nI'm a bona fide fish nerd.,And to a fish nerd,nthis is some pretty exciting stuff.,More exciting was the factnthat the person who took this photo,is a guy named Jack Randall,,the greatest livingnichthyologist on earth --,the Grand Poobahnof fish nerds, if you will.,And so, it was really excitingnto me to have this moment in time.,It set the course for the rest of my life. 
 But really, the most significant,nmost profound thing about this picture,is it was taken two daysnbefore I was completely paralyzed,from the neck down.,I made a really stupid kind of mistake,that most 19-year-old males donwhen they think they're immortal,,and I got a bad case of the bendsnand was paralyzed,,and had to be flown back for treatment.,I learned two reallynimportant things that day.,The first thing I learned -- well,nI'm mortal. That's a really big one.,And the second thing I learnednwas that I knew, with profound certainty,,that this is exactly what I was goingnto do for the rest of my life.,I had to focus all my energies,towards going to findnnew species of things,down on deep coral reefs. 
 When you think of a coral reef,nthis is what most people think of:,these big, hard, elaborate corals,,lots of bright, colorfulnfishes and things.,But this is reallynjust the tip of the iceberg.,If you look at this diagramnof a coral reef,,we know a lot about that partnup near the top.,The reason we know so much about it,is scuba divers can very easilyngo down there and access it. 
 There is a problem with scuba, though,,in that it imposes some limitationsnon how deep you can go.,It turns out that depth is about 200 feet.,I'll get into why that isnin just a minute,,but the point is, scuba diversngenerally stay less than 100 feet deep,,and very rarely go much below this,nat least, not with any kind of sanity.,So to go deeper, most biologistsnhave turned to submersibles.,Now, submersibles are great,nwonderful things,,but if you're going to spend 30,000ndollars a day to use one of these things,and it's capable of going 2,000 feet,,you're not going to go farting aroundnup here in a couple of hundred feet,,you're going to go way down deep.,So the bottom line is, almostnall research using submersibles,has taken place well below 500 feet. 
 Now, it's pretty obvious at this point,there's a zone here in the middle.,That's the zone,that centers around my ownnpersonal pursuit of happiness.,I want to find out what's in this zone;nwe know almost nothing about it.,Scuba divers can't get there,nsubmarines go right on past it. 
 It took me a year to learn to walk againnafter my diving accident in Palau.,During that year,,I spent a lot of time learningnabout the physics and physiology of diving,and how to overcome these limitations.,I'm just going to show you a basic idea.,We're all breathing air right now.,Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,,20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.,It's in our lungs.,And there's a phenomenonncalled Henry's law,,that says gases will dissolve into a fluid,in proportion to the partial pressuresnyou're exposing them to.,So, basically the gasndissolves into our body.,The oxygen is bound by metabolism,nwe use it for energy.,The nitrogen sort of floats aroundnin our blood and tissues.,That's fine, it's how we're designed.,The problem happensnwhen you go underwater. 
 The deeper you go underwater,nthe higher the pressure is.,If you were to go downnto a depth of about 130 feet,,which is the recommendednlimit for most scuba divers,,you'd get this pressure effect.,The effect of that pressure is you havenan increased density of gas molecules,in every breath you take.,Over time, those gas moleculesndissolve into your blood and tissues,and start to fill you up. 
 Now, if you were to gondown to, say, 300 feet,,you don't have five times as manyngas molecules in your lungs,,you've got 10 times as manyngas molecules in your lungs.,And, sure enough, they dissolveninto your blood and tissues as well.,And if you were to go down to wherenthere's 15 times as much --,the deeper you go, the morenexacerbating the problem becomes.,The limitation of diving with airnis all those dots in your body,,all the nitrogen and all the oxygen. 
 There are three basicnlimitations of scuba diving.,The first limitation is the oxygen --,oxygen toxicity.,Now, we all know the song:n"Love is like oxygen.,You get too much, you get too high.nNot enough, and you're gonna die.",Well, in the context of diving,nyou get too much, you die also.,You die because oxygenntoxicity can cause a seizure.,It makes you convulse underwater --nnot a good thing to happen underwater.,It happens because there's too muchnconcentration of oxygen in your body. 
 The nitrogen has two problems.,One of them is what Jacques Cousteauncalled "rapture of the deep.",It's nitrogen narcosis.,It makes you loopy; the deepernyou go, the loopier you get.,You don't want to drive drunk,nyou don't want to dive drunk.,So that's a real big problem.,And of course, the third problem,is the one I found outnthe hard way in Palau,,which is the bends. 
 One thing I forgot to mention,is that to obviate the problemnof nitrogen narcosis --,all of those blue dots in our body --,you remove the nitrogennand replace it with helium.,Helium's a gas; there're a lotnof reasons why helium's good,,it's a tiny molecule, it's inert,nit doesn't give you narcosis.,So that's the basic concept we use.,But the theory's relatively easy.,The tricky part is the implementation. 
 So this is how I began about 15 years ago.,I'll admit, it wasn't exactlynthe smartest of starts,,but you've got to start somewhere. 
 (Laughter) 
 At the time, I wasn't the only onenwho didn't know what I was doing.,Almost nobody did.,This rig was actually usednfor a dive of 300 feet.,But over time we got better at it,,and we came up with this reallynsophisticated-looking rig,with four scuba tanks, five regulatorsnand all the right gas mixtures,,all that good stuff.,It was fine and dandy, it allowed usnto go down and find new species. 
 This picture was taken at 300 feet,ncatching new species of fish.,The problem wasnit didn't allow us much time.,For all its bulk and size, it only gave usnabout 15 minutes at most,down at those sorts of depths.,We needed more time.nThere had to be a better way.,And indeed, there is a better way. 
 In 1994, I was fortunatenenough to get access,to these prototypenclosed-circuit rebreathers.,Closed-circuit rebreather:nwhat makes it different from scuba,,and why is it better?,Well, there are three mainnadvantages to a rebreather.,One, they're quiet,nthey don't make any noise.,Two, they allow you to staynunderwater longer.,Three, they allow you to go deeper.,How is it that they do that?,In order to really understandnhow they do that,,you have to look underneath the hoodnand see what's going on. 
 There are three basic systemsnto a closed-circuit rebreather.,The most fundamentalnis called the breathing loop.,It's a breathing loopnbecause you breathe off of it;,it's a closed loop, and you breathenthe same gas around and around.,There's a mouthpiecenthat you put in your mouth,,and there's a counter lung,nor in this case, two counter lungs.,The counter lungs aren't high tech,nthey're simply flexible bags.,They allow you to mechanicallynbreathe, mechanically ventilate.,When you exhale, it goesnin the exhale counter lung;,when you inhale, it comesnfrom the inhale counter lung.,It's just pure mechanics, allowing younto cycle air through this breathing loop. 
 The other component on a breathing loopnis the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.,Now, as we breathe,nwe produce carbon dioxide,,and that carbon dioxide needsnto be scrubbed out of the system.,There's a chemical filter in there,that pulls the carbon dioxidenout of the breathing gas,,so that when it comes back to us,nit's safe to breathe again.,That's the breathing loop in a nutshell. 
 The second main componentnof a closed-circuit rebreather,is the gas system.,The primary purpose of the gas systemnis to provide oxygen,,to replenish the oxygennthat your body consumes.,So the main tank, the main critical thing,,is this oxygen gasnsupply cylinder we have here.,But if we only hadnan oxygen gas supply cylinder,,we wouldn't be able to go very deep,,because we'd run intonoxygen toxicity very quickly.,So we need another gas,nsomething to dilute the oxygen with.,And that, fittingly enough,nis called the diluent gas supply.,In our applications, we generallynput air inside this diluent gas supply,,because it's a very cheapnand easy source of nitrogen. 
 So that's where we get our nitrogen from.,But if we want to go deeper,nof course, we need another gas supply,,and helium is whatnwe really need to go deep.,Usually we'll havena slightly larger cylinder,,mounted exteriornon the rebreather, like this.,That's what we use to inject,nas we start to do our deep dives.,We also have a second oxygen cylinder,nsolely as a backup;,if there's a problemnwith our first oxygen supply,,we can continue to breathe.,The way you manage all these differentngases and different gas supplies,is this really high-tech, sophisticatedngas block up on the front here,,where it's easy to reach.,It's got the valves and knobsnand things you need,to inject the right gasesnat the right time. 
 Normally, you don't have to do that,,because all of it's done automatically,with the electronics,nthe third system of a rebreather.,The most critical part of a rebreathernare the oxygen sensors.,You need three, so if one goes bad,nyou know which one it is.,You need voting logic.,You also have three microprocessors.,Any one of those computersncan run the entire system,,so if you have to lose two of them,,there's back-up power supplies.,And there are multiple displays,nto get the information to the diver.,This is the high-tech gadgetrynthat allows us to do what we do,on these deep dives.,I can talk about it all day --njust ask my wife --,but I want to move onnto something much more interesting. 
 I'm going to take you on a deep dive,,and show you what it's like to do one.,We start up on the boat,,For all this high-tech,nexpensive equipment,,this is still the best waynto get in the water,,just flop over the side of the boat. 
 Now, as I showed younin the earlier diagram,,these reefs that we dive onnstart out near the surface,and they go almost vertically,ncompletely straight down.,So we drop in the waternand go over the edge of this cliff,,and then we start dropping,ndropping, dropping.,People ask if it takesna long time to get there.,No; it only takes a couple minutesnto get down to three or four hundred feet,,which is what we're aiming for.,It's like skydiving in slow motion.nIt's really very interesting.,You ever see "The Abyss,",where Ed Harris is sinking downnalong the side of the wall?,That's what it feels like. Amazing. 
 And down there, you find that the waternis very clear, extremely clear,,because there's hardly any plankton.,When you turn on your lightnand look around the caves,,you're confronted with a tremendousnamount of diversity,,much more than anyone used to believe.,Now, not all of it is new species --,that fish you see with the white stripe,nthat's a known species.,But if you look carefullyninto the cracks and crevices,,you'll see little thingsnscurrying all over the place.,There's a just unbelievable diversity. 
 It's not just fish, either.,These are crinoids, sponges, black corals.nThere're some more fishes.,Those fishes that you see nownare new species.,They're still new species,,because I had a video cameraninstead of my net,,so they're still waiting down therenfor someone to go find them.,But this is what it looks like.,And this kind of habitat just goesnon and on and on for miles.,This is Papua, New Guinea. 
 Now little fishes and invertebratesnaren't the only things we see down there.,We also see sharks,,much more regularlynthan I would have expected to.,We're not quite sure why.,What I want you to do nownis imagine yourself 400 feet underwater,,with all this high-tech gear on your back,,you're in a remote reefnoff Papua, New Guinea,,thousands of miles from the nearestnrecompression chamber,,and you're completelynsurrounded by sharks. 
 (Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice)nLook at those ... 
 Diver 2: Uh, oh ...,Uh, oh! 
 Audience: (Laughter) 
 (Video) Diver 1: I think we haventheir attention ... 
 Richard Pyle: When you startntalking like Donald Duck,,there's no situation in the worldnthat can seem tense. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we're down there --nthis is at 400 feet.,That's looking straight up, by the way,nto give a sense of how far the surface is.,And if you're a biologistnand know about sharks,,and you want to assess,nhow much jeopardy am I really in here,,there's one question that sort of jumpsnto the forefront of your mind immediately,,which is -- 
 (Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks? 
 Diver 2: Silvertip sharks. 
 Diver 1: Oh. 
 RP: There are actuallynthree species of sharks here.,The silvertips are the onesnwith the white edges on the fins,,and there're also gray reef sharksnand hammerheads off in the distance.,And yes, it's a little nerve-racking. 
 (Video) Diver 2: Hoo!,That little guy is frisky! 
 Audience: (Laughter) 
 Now, you've seen video like this on TVna lot, and it's very intimidating.,I think it gives the wrongnimpression about sharks;,they're actually notnvery dangerous animals.,That's why we weren't worried muchnand were joking around.,More people are killednby pigs, by lightning strikes,,more people are killednat soccer games in England.,There's a lot of other ways you can die.,And I'm not making that stuff up.,Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconutnmore likely than killed by a shark.,So sharks aren't quite as dangerousnas most people make them out to be. 
 Now, I don't know if any of you getnUS News and World Report --,I got the recent issue.,There's a cover storynabout the great explorers of our time.,The last article is entitled,n"No New Frontiers.",It questions whether or not therenreally are any new frontiers out there,,whether there are any true, hardcorendiscoveries that can still be made.,My favorite line from the article:,[... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppynwith an extra spine in its dorsal fin."],I have to laugh; they don't call usnfish nerds for nothing.,We actually do get excited about findingna new dorsal spine in a guppy.,But it's much more than that.,I want to show you a few of the guppiesnwe've found over the years. 
 This one -- you can see how ugly it is. 
 (Laughter) 
 Even if you ignorenthe scientific value of this thing,,look at the monetary value of this thing.,A couple of these were soldnthrough the aquarium trade to Japan,,where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.,That's half a million dollars a pound. 
 Here's another new angelfishnwe discovered.,This one we first discovered backnin the air days -- the bad old air days,,when we were doingnthese kind of dives with air.,We were at 360 feet.,I remember coming up from onenof these deep dives and I had this fog,,and the narcosis takes a little whilento fade away, sort of like sobering up.,I had this vague recollection of seeingnthis yellow fish with a black spot,,and thought, "Damn,nI should have caught one --,I think that's a new species.",Eventually, I looked in my bucket.,Sure enough, I had caught one,nI just completely forgot.,So this one, we decided to giventhe name Centropyge narcosis to.,That's its official scientific name,,in reference to its deep-dwelling habits. 
 This is another neat one.,When we first found it,,we weren't even surenwhat family it belonged to,,so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,,since it looked like somethingnfrom one of those books. 
 Now, this one's pretty cool.,If you go to Papua, New Guineanand go down 300 feet,,you'll see these big mounds.,This may be hard to see,nbut they're a couple meters in diameter.,If you look closely, you'll seenthere's a little white and gray fish,that hangs out near them.,It turns out this little white fishnbuilds these giant mounds,,one pebble at a time.,It's extraordinarynto find something like this.,It's not just new species,nit's new behaviors, new ecology,,all kind of new things. 
 What I'm going to show you now, quickly,,is a sampling of the new speciesnwe've discovered.,What's extraordinary is not justnthe number of species we're finding --,though as you can see,nthat's pretty amazing;,this is only half of what we've found --,what's extraordinarynis how quickly we find them.,We're up to seven new species per hournof time we spend at that depth.,If you go to an Amazon jungle and fogna tree, you may get a lot of bugs,,but for fishes,nthere's nowhere in the world,you can get seven new speciesnper hour of time. 
 Now, we've done somenback-of-the-envelope calculations,,and we're predicting there are probablynabout 2,000 to 2,500 new species,in the Indo-Pacific alone.,There are only fivento six thousand known species,,so a very large percentagenof what is out there isn't really known.,We thought we had a handle on all the reefnfish diversity -- evidently not. 
 I'm going to just closenon a very somber note.,At the beginning, I said I'd show yountwo extraordinary photographs.,This is the second extraordinarynphotograph I'm going to show you.,This one was taken at the exact momentnI was down there filming those sharks.,This was taken exactlyn300 feet above my head.,The reason this photographnis extraordinary,is because it captures a moment,in the very last minutenof a person's life.,Less than 60 seconds after this picturenwas taken, this guy was dead.,When we recovered his body,nwe figured out what had gone wrong.,He had made a very simple mistake;,he turned the wrong valvenwhen he filled his cylinder.,he had 80 percent oxygen in his tanknwhen he should have had 40.,He had an oxygen toxicitynseizure and he drowned. 
 The reason I show this --nnot to put a downer on everything --,but I just want to use it to key offnmy philosophy of life in general,,which is that we all have two goals.,The first goal we share with every othernliving thing on this planet,,which is to survive.,I call it perpetuation: the survivalnof the species and survival of ourselves,,And those are bothnabout perpetuating the genome. 
 The second goal, for those of usnwho have mastered the first goal --,call it spiritual fulfillment,ncall it financial success,,you can call it any numbernof different things.,I call it seeking joy,nthis pursuit of happiness.,So, I guess my theme on thisnis this guy lived his life to the fullest,,he absolutely did.,You have to balance those two goals.,If you live your whole life in fear --,I mean, life is a sexually transmittedndisease with 100 percent mortality.,So you can't live your life in fear. 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought that was an old one! 
 (Applause) 
 But at the same time, you don't wantnto get so focused on rule number two,,goal number two,,that you neglect goal number one.,Because once you're dead, you really can'tnenjoy anything after that.,So I wish you all the best of lucknin maintaining that balance,in your future endeavors. 
 Thanks.Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question,I know that's been pressing on many of your minds.,We spoke to you last several years ago.,And before I get started today,,since many of you are wondering,,I just wanted to get it out of the way.,The answer is boxers.,Now I hope all of you feel better. 
 Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is? 
 Audience: Yes. 
 SB: What is it? 
 Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world. 
 SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.,But this is what helped me see it.,This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.,Here it's slightly logged.,But here you can see around the world,how people are using Google.,And every one of those rising dots,represents probably about 20, 30 searches,,or something like that.,And they're labeled by color right now, by language. 
 So you can see: here we are in the U.S.,,and they're all coming up red.,There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.,You can see that Japan is busy at night,,right there.,We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.,There's a lot of activity in China.,There's a lot of activity in India.,There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.,And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,,is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages. 
 Now you can also see, if I turn this around here --,hopefully I won't shake the world too much.,But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.,Australia, because there just aren't very many people there.,And this is something that we should really work on,,which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,,basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.,But basically, what we've noticed is these queries,,which come in at thousands per second,,are available everywhere there is power.,And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.,And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --,we from time to time will see a query rising up.,And if we had it plotted correctly,,I think the International Space Station would have it, too. 
 So this is,some of the challenge that we have here,,is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --,there we go.,This is how we have to move the bits around,to actually get the people the answers to their questions.,You can see that there's a lot of data running around.,It has to go all over the world: through fibers,,through satellites, through all kinds of connections.,And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies,as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.,But you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired,than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,,going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth. 
 Now what I would like to do is just to show you,what one second of this activity would look like.,And if we can switch to slides --,all right, here we go.,So this is slowed down.,This is what one second looks like.,And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,,is just making sure that we can keep up,with this kind of traffic load.,Now, each one of those queries,has an interesting life and tale of its own.,I mean, it could be somebody's health,,it could be somebody's career, something important to them.,And it could potentially be something,as important as tomato sauce,,or in this case, ketchup. 
 So this is a query that we had --,I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.,You can see that it got started right here.,In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.,But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.,as it did in Spain.,And then from Spain, it went to Italy,,and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.,And so I guess the U.S. finally,,finally started to like it, too.,And I just wanted to play it for you. 
 Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves --,hopefully that search will work.,As a part of --,you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company,is to have more searches.,And what that means is we want to have,more people who are healthy and educated.,More animals, if they start doing searches as well.,But partly, we want to make the world a better place,,and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,,and we're in the process of setting that up. 
 We also have a program already called Google Grants,that now serves over 150 different charities around the world,,and these are some of the charities that are on there.,And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.,In fact, many of the organizations that are here --,the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --,and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.,They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit,so they can let organizations know. 
 One of the earlier results that we got --,we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village,of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,,and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been,many, many stories that have come in,,because we do have hundreds of charities in there,,and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.,Now does anybody know who this is?,A-ha! 
 Audience: Orkut. 
 SB: Yes! Somebody got it.,This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?,Do we have any?,Okay, not very many people know about it.,I'll explain it in a second.,This is one of our engineers.,We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.,That's how we churn those products out.,Orkut had a vision to create a social network.,I know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network.",But it was a dream of his, and we, basically,,when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.,So this is what he built.,We just released it in a test phase last month,,and it's been taking off. 
 This is our VP of Engineering.,You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.,And these are all of his friends.,So this is how -- we just deployed it --,we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,,and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.,And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.,And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S. 
 You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here --,though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --,but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,,and all the rest of the countries.,So it's a fun little project.,There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.,But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun,and see where it goes.,And --,well, I'll leave you in suspense.,Larry, you can explain this one. 
 Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.,So one of the things -- both Sergey and I,went to a Montessori school,,and I think, for some reason,,this has been incorporated in Google.,And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,,you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,,and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time,",and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,,if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.,And many, many things at Google have come out of that,,such as Orkut and also Google News.,And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.,Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,,actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --,as a hobby, basically.,So many, many useful things come out of this. 
 And News, which I just mentioned,,was started by a researcher.,And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.,And he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?",And so he started clustering it by category,,and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.,And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,,we made it a Googlette,,which is basically a small project at Google. 
 So it'd be like three people, or something like that,,and they would try to make a product.,And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.,And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people,working on it for a while, and then more and more people,started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,,and more and more people started using it.,And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.,And this is how we keep our innovation running. 
 I think usually, as companies get bigger,,they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.,And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,,"Oh, we really need a new concept.",You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,,but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,,some of them will really work and turn out, such as News. 
 But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.,And I don't know about all of you,,but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.,And we found that if we just wrote all of them down,and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.,Don't really pay attention to them.,For example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.,We would never do such a crazy thing, but --,in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,,that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.,And this was kind of a surprise to me, but,we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,,which you did by writing them down,,that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do,and where to put your resources.,And so that's basically what we've done,since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative,and still stay reasonably well-organized. 
 The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,,and so naturally,,people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.,I just wanted to highlight a couple of things,that are new, or you might not know about.,And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.,So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?,Raise your hands. 
 How many of you use the Deskbar?,All right, see? You guys should try it out.,But if you go to our site and search,for "Deskbar," you'll get this.,And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time,on your screen on the bottom,,and you can do searches really easily.,And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.,Thank you, Sergey. 
 This is another example of a project that somebody at Google,was really passionate about, and they just, they got going,,and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.,Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,,which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,,you can type a question in,,and then there's a pool of researchers,that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,,and you can get actually very good answers to things,without spending all that time yourself. 
 Froogle lets you search shopping information,,and Blogger lets you publish things.,But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --,you know, we try many, many different things,in our company.,We also like to innovate in our physical space,,and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time,for projectors to turn on and off,,and they're noisy, so people shut them off.,And we didn't like that, so we actually,,in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures,that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time,and they're completely silent.,And as a result, we were able to build some software,that also lets us manage a meeting,,so when you walk into a meeting room now,,it lists all the meetings that are happening,,you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically,to all the people that were present in the meeting. 
 And as we become more of a global company,,we find these things really affect us --,you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?,And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.,We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,,and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.,And so we found it was pretty helpful,to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...,we also allow dogs and things like that,,and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,,which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. 
 This is actually our "cult picture.",I just wanted to show quickly.,We had this on our website for a while,,but we found that after we put it on our website,,we didn't get any job applications anymore.,But anyway, every year we've taken,the whole company on a ski trip.,A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.,And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.,It makes it a really fun place to work. 
 Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody,our culture when we change things.,In the early days, we were actually advised,we should never change our logo because,we should establish our brand, you know,,because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.,You want it to be consistent.,And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.,Why don't we try changing it every day?" 
 One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now,is we have this thing called AdSense,,and this is a little bit foreshadowing --,this is from before Dean dropped out.,But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,,we show you relevant ads.,And this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:,Howard Dean for President" -- articles on Howard Dean.,And these ads are generated automatically --,like in this case, on the Washington Post --,from the content on the site.,And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers,and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one,that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,,much as we do on search.,So the idea is we can make advertising useful,,not just annoying, right? 
 And the nice thing about this,,we have a self-serve program,,and many thousands of websites have signed up,,and this let's them really make money. And I --,you know, there's a number of people I met --,I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,,and he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money.,I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.,And, you know, thank you.,I don't have to do my other job now.",And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.,It makes content get better, it makes searching work better,,when people can really make their livelihood,from producing great content. 
 So this session is supposed to be about the future,,so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.,And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,,you really have to be smart.,Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,,and you expect an answer back, right?,But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.,And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.,It would be artificial intelligence.,And so that's something we work on,,and we even have some people who are excited enough,and crazy enough to work on it now,,and that's really their goal.,So we always hope that Google will be smart,,but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. 
 And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.,This is a blog from Iraq,,and it's not really what,I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.,Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.,So we decided --,actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you. 
 So, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well,,but we decided we should put in this feature,into our AdSense ads, called "related searches.",And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this,,in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq --,and you know, in addition to the ads,,and we thought this would be a great idea. 
 And so there is this blog,of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,,"You know, I'm sleeping a lot.",He was just kind of writing about his life.,And our algorithms -- not a person, of course,,but our algorithms, our computers --,read his blog and decided that,the related search was, "I am bored.",And he read this, and he thought a person had decided,that he was boring,,and it was very unfortunate,,and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?,Why don't they like my blog?",And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,,sort of going from bad to worse,,and we said the related search was, "Retards.",And then, you know, he got even more mad,,and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.,And then we produced "You suck.",And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass.",And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,,and of course, you know,,we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,,and it didn't quite work,,and we don't have this feature anymore. 
 So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.,I wanted to end just by saying that,there's a couple things that really make me excited,to be involved with Google,,and one of those is that we're able to make money,largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that,was that we're able to serve everyone in the world,without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.,So we don't have to worry about our products being sold,,for example, for less money in places that are poor,,and then they get re-imported into the U.S. --,for example, with the drug industry. 
 And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model,because everyone in the world has access to our search,,and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.,The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly,is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility,to provide people the right information,,and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --,that we should provide very objective information. 
 And so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.,We accept payment for advertising,,and we mark it as such.,And that's unlike many of our competitors.,And I think decisions we're able to make like that,have a tremendous impact on the world,,and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.,So thank you.About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.,And at the time I was very superstitious.,So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport,that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city --,I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in,my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed." 
 So the plane landed in between the buildings,and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.,(Laughter),And I actually went to see some of the design companies,in Hong Kong in my stay there.,And it turned out that --,I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong. 
 But I actually walked away with a great job offer.,And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,,and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong,still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,,I'm going to have a good time working here.,(Laughter),But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful.",So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up,but they had put this one right next to it.,(Laughter),On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me,because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.,(Laughter) 
 However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life --,of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to,as "moments that take your breath away.",And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.,(Laughter),Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them,and I won't read them for you.,I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.,(Laughter) 
 What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint,and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.,And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design. 
 So there are, of course, two different possibilities.,There's one from a consumer's point of view --,where I was happy while experiencing design.,And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.,This is 1983.,My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle,that he was willing to borrow to me freely.,And The Police's "Synchronicity",cassette had just been released,and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.,So you could drive up into the mountains,freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.,(Laughter),And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.,You know, of course, they are related to this combination of,at least two of them being, you know, design objects.,And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design,but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know,,situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss. 
 Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint --,if you're happy while actually doing it.,And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to,look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?,(Laughter),So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese,as well as the Mexicans,are very happy.,(Laughter),While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...,and, I think, particularly, the Swiss,(Laughter),,don't seem to be doing all that well.,(Laughter) 
 Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum,,in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.,And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness.",And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because --,well, also, with an eye on this conference.,And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.,Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period --,a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.,Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on,was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles. 
 Under "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.,And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.,This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.,And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know,open as much room for the un-representable --,and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more. 
 Then, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings --,also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.,And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet. 
 Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that,maybe with the exception of the mandala,most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness,and not about happiness.,And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization --,that's a really easy thing to do.,And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.,This is, you know, a book.,A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.,It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.,Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.,You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish. 
 It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising,or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that,if you actually want to do something with the subject,and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know,,do it from a cynical point of view.,This is, you know, the movie poster.,Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads,where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it. 
 Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness --,and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.,This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True.",Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be,familiar with these signs?,True printed his own version of these signs.,Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.,They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.,(Laughter),So this is one.,(Laughter) 
 Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.,So you're,(Laughter),you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.,And it takes you a while until it actually --,you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.,(Laughter),I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.,(Laughter) 
 Now, True is a real humanitarian.,He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested,,so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.,(Laughter),And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody --,sort of like pretending that it's an art project,financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.,(Laughter) 
 Another New York project.,This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room,by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.,Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.,You don't see the horizon.,You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.,And the room is truly something to be seen.,People's demeanor changes when they go in there.,And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way,after spending an hour in there. 
 There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.,I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud",a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.,But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.,He's from Korea originally.,And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles --,empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.,And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.,(Laughter),And other people go and fill them in.,(Laughter) 
 This one says, "Please let me die in peace.",(Laughter),I think that was --,the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.,This is on a musician poster, that says:,"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units,and that, as a result, my recoupable advance,from my label will be taken from me,,after which, my contract will be cancelled,,and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street.",(Laughter) 
 I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.,Jee gets to have his project;,the public gets a sweeter environment;,and different public gets a place to express itself;,and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.,(Laughter) 
 Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while:,You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design,and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?,Which brought me back to my list making --,you know, just to see what I actually like about my job. 
 You know, one is: just working without pressure.,Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled.,Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.,Try not to get stuck doing the same thing --,or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.,This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.,Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things,where the content is actually important for me.,And being able to enjoy the end results. 
 And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained,all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.,And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked,if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads,that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?,And the whole thing just fell together.,So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned --,in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" --,and we made these spreads right out of this.,So it was: "Everything,I do,always,comes,back,to me." 
 A couple of weeks ago, a,(Laughter),French company asked us to design five billboards for them.,Again, we could supply the content for it.,So I just picked another one.,And this was two weeks ago.,We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself --,and photographed this one.,So it's: "Trying,to look,good,limits,my life." 
 And then we did one more of these.,This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.,This is: "Having" --,this is the same thing;,it's just, you know, photographed from the side.,This is from the front.,Then it's: "guts.",Again, it's the same thing -- "guts" is just the same room, reworked.,Then it's: "always,works out.",Then it's "for," with the light on.,(Laughter),And it's "me." 
 Thank you so much.,(Applause)I was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,,and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.,We like to dance together, we like singing together.,And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help,with a first experiment today. The experiment is --,and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,,that you did it in a typical North American way,,that is, you were raucous and incoherent.,You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.,Do you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would --,no, you haven't practiced, as far as I know --,can you get it together to clap in sync? 
 (Clapping) 
 Whoa! Now, that's what we call emergent behavior. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I didn't expect that, but -- I mean, I expected you could synchronize.,It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.,It's interesting. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what do we make of that? First of all, we know that you're all brilliant.,This is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.,Some trained musicians out there.,Is that what enabled you to synchronize?,So to put the question a little more seriously,,let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,,for spontaneous synchronization.,Do you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?,Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?,Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?,Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.,It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,,if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.,It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.,It's a deep tendency toward order in nature,that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.,I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not.,But there is a countervailing force in the universe --,the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme. 
 Now, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately,when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,,which is the glorious example of birds that flock together,,or fish swimming in organized schools.,So these are not particularly intelligent creatures,,and yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.,This is from a BBC show called "Predators,",and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.,When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,,or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.,Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.,For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,,wondering how it could be possible.,We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.,These creatures are not choreographed.,They're choreographing themselves. 
 And only today is science starting to figure out how it works.,I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,,that shows how swarms work.,There are just three simple rules.,First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.,Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.,And third, they're all attracted to each other,,but they try to keep a small distance apart.,And when you build those three rules in,,automatically you start to see swarms,that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.,Now, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.,Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.,But except for that difference, the rules are the same for both. 
 Now, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.,There's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.,Here on the model you see the predator attacking.,The prey move out in random directions,,and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,,so there's this constant splitting and reforming.,And you see that in nature.,Keep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,,what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.,Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.,That is, out of the desire to save itself,,each creature is following these rules,,and that leads to something that's safe for all of them.,Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.,You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,,so you can think of several. 
 As I say, if you're in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one,are reduced as compared to a small group.,There are many eyes to spot danger.,And you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,,when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,,that actually waves of panic can propagate,,sending messages over great distances.,You'll see -- let's see, it's coming up possibly at the very end -- maybe not.,Information can be sent over half a kilometer away,in a very short time through this mechanism.,Yes, it's happening here.,See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.,It's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,,from that computer model, what's going on.,As I say, it's just those three simple rules,,plus the one about watch out for predators. 
 There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this.,We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.,I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.,I mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding.,A computer is, in a way, just another experiment.,We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works,and to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.,How do the rules give rise to the patterns? 
 There is one case that we have begun to understand better,,and it's the case of fireflies.,If you see fireflies in North America,,like so many North American sorts of things,,they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.,They each do their own thing, flashing on and off,,paying no attention to their neighbors.,But in Southeast Asia -- places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo --,there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.,You can see it every night along the river banks.,The trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.,Specifically, it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,,in perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.,And the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me." 
 (Music) 
 In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly,so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.,Then on, and then off -- a 30th of a second, there.,And then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.,On, more on and then off.,The combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles --,is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them,as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.,For a long time it was not believed,when the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake,,went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.,No one believed them.,We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.,And for a long time, even after it was documented,,it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.,Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids,that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency,to see patterns where there are none.,But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video,,that they really were very well synchronized. 
 Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive,to see this kind of spontaneous order,,and I've already hinted that the answer is no.,Well, you don't have to be a whole creature.,You can even be just a single cell.,Like, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.,They're keeping you alive.,Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,,which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,,have an electrical rhythm -- a voltage up and down --,to send a signal to the ventricles to pump.,Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell.,It's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison,for the pacemaker to work correctly. 
 I don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea.,If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,,discharging in pathological concert.,So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.,You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.,If you look, for instance, at how lasers work,,that would be a case of atomic synchrony.,In a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here,is that this light is incoherent --,many different colors and different frequencies,,sort of like the way you clapped initially --,but if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.,It would be all atoms pulsating in unison,,emitting light of one color, one frequency. 
 Now comes the very risky part of my talk,,which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize.,Hold your breath for me.,What I have here are two empty water bottles.,This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.,This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.,I have some metronomes here.,Can you hear that?,All right, so, I've got a metronome,,and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise.,Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.,I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take,another one set to the same setting.,We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together,,there's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't. 
 Maybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here.,What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart,because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same.,Right? They did.,They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.,And the reason is that they're not able to communicate.,Now, you might think that's a bizarre idea.,How can metronomes communicate?,Well, they can communicate through mechanical forces.,So I'm going to give them a chance to do that.,I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?,I'm going to put them on a movable platform,,which is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is.,Let's see if we can get this to work.,My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time,because otherwise the whole thing will tip over.,All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat --,let me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that. 
 (Applause) 
 All right. So before any one goes out of sync, I'll just put those right there. 
 (Laughter),Now, that might seem a bit whimsical,,but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order,sometimes has unexpected consequences.,And a clear case of that,,was something that happened in London in the year 2000.,The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London --,a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,,first river crossing in over 100 years in London.,There was a big competition for the design of this bridge,,and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team --,in the TED spirit, actually -- of an architect --,perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster --,working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,,and an engineering firm, Ove Arup.,And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,,which was -- he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,,and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,,he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber. 
 He would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,,and then scamper across on this blade of light.,He said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.,I want a blade of light across the Thames.",So they built the blade of light,,and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's --,probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,,with cables that are out on the side.,You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.,These cables were on the side of the bridge,,like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames --,that's what's holding up this bridge.,Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.,On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.,And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.,So I want to first show you some interviews with people,who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened. 
 Man: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down,,rather like being on the boat. 
 Woman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy,,and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely --,there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe. 
 Interviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No. 
 Interviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No. 
 Interviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think? 
 Boy: It was about -- 
 Interviewer: I mean, that much, or this much? 
 Boy: About the second one. 
 Interviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah. 
 Man: It was at least six, six to eight inches, I would have thought. 
 Interviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes. 
 Woman: I remember wanting to get off. 
 Interviewer: Oh, did you? Woman: Yeah. It felt odd. 
 Interviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me. 
 Interviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this? 
 Boy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance,because if you didn't keep your balance,,then you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.,Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.,And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.,So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and --,oh, and short steps? 
 Man: That's right. And it seemed obvious to me,that it was probably the number of people on it. 
 Interviewer: Were they deliberately walking in step, or anything like that? 
 Man: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge. 
 Steven Strogatz: All right, so that already gives you a hint of what happened.,Think of the bridge as being like this platform.,Think of the people as being like metronomes.,Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,,but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.,And especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?,They all showed this strange sort of skating gait,that they adopted once the bridge started to move.,And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.,But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip,of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,,who figured out what happened on the bridge,,and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.,It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop,between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,,that engineers knew nothing about.,Actually, I think the first person you'll see,is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay. 
 (Video) Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No. 
 Interviewer: Right. So it was quite small -- Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: -- but real? 
 Engineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother." 
 Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it. 
 We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it,,we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes --,and here it was doing something that we didn't know about.,Interviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly. 
 Narrator: The most dramatic and shocking footage,shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people --,apparently rocking from side to side in unison,,not only with each other, but with the bridge.,This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.,But how could the crowd become synchronized?,Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?,This was to be the focus of the investigation. 
 Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.,Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes. 
 Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge,,and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge? 
 AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes. 
 Interviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes? 
 Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,,suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble,in the same way as the real bridge --,provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length. 
 AM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going.,Just by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now. 
 AM: It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go. 
 Interviewer: It's actually quite difficult to walk.,You have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,,because if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet. 
 AM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it. 
 Interviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another,,it's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes. 
 Interviewer: So you've got to put your feet out sideways.,So already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way,as our witnesses walked on the real bridge. 
 AM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking. 
 Interviewer: For a more convincing experiment,,I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.,Their instructions: just walk normally.,It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.,They're all having some difficulty walking.,And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.,But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.,You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,,and therefore to drive it to move further. 
 SS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks,,maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over.,But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way,,to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Welcome to 10,000 feet.,Let me explain why we are here,and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.,Once upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn.",Today's event you might call "How Mountains Teach.",A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to,hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking,to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare --,or in some cases, non-existent.,It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking,of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,,next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years --,basically civilization's story so far. 
 So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.,It's an incubator for about a dozen projects,,all having to do with continuity over the long term.,Our core project is a rather ambitious folly --,I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock,that can really keep good time for that long a period.,And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.,Go to the clock. And what we have here is something,many of you saw here three years ago.,It's the first working prototype of the clock.,It's about nine feet high.,Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London,,and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there. 
 So the design problem for today is going to be,,how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this,so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?,Well, this was the first solution.,Alexander Rose came up with this idea,of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.,And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking,about, what does deep time do to a building?,Well, this is what deep time does to a building.,This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old,,and look what happened to it.,Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever,,because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.,And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.,That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.,Even the most durable and intactable buildings,,like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.,They've been looted inside and out.,And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things. 
 So we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building,,where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.,How about underground with a view?,Underground in a place that's really solid.,So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.,You don't want just any mountain.,You need absolutely the right mountain,if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.,So here's an image of the long view of the search problem.,And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,,so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.,We looked at mesas in New Mexico.,We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona. 
 Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,,led us to Eastern Nevada,,to America's newest and oldest national park,,which is called Great Basin National Park.,It's right on the eastern border of Nevada.,It's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet.,And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep,,and on the right it's gentle.,This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.,It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.,And it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called,America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50. 
 Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is -- that's all national park.,Inside the green line is national forest.,And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.,Now, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,,this vertical, was available because it was private land.,And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,,who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.,And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there. 
 We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment,of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.,Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.,That's a 2,000-foot thick formation,,and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.,It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike,to get up to where the clock is.,So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors,and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain,to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain,,and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us. 
 Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.,He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.,It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.,It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind,of the goal at the end of the journey.,In this case it might well be an image of the clock.,Then there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition,from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.,Then -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth.,The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone,,it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented,,maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it,if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.,Then there should always be in sight the draw --,a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth,to finish the process of getting there. 
 Now Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process,,spent two years making a C.D. called "January 7003,",and it's "Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.",Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed,,so that a peal of 10 bells,makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.,The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.,And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.,January 7003. There it is. 
 OK, back to Danny's list.,Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax.,The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.,And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.,Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.,Then there's the return.,You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,,so you have time to assimilate what you've learned.,And then, how about a memento? Number seven.,At the end of it there's something physical,,a kind of reward that you take away.,It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain.,Something that's just yours.,How do you study a mountain,for the kinds of things we're talking about?,This is not a normal building project.,What do you look for?,What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions? 
 Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here,,that's national park. That's sacrosanct --,you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.,There's possibilities. The borders are important.,Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.,And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.,It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.,They're the world's oldest living thing.,People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.,There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.,The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.,So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,,some of them go back 10,000 years.,The stone itself is absolutely beautiful,,sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.,We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona,join us on the expedition. 
 Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy,,now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.,That's interesting.,You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience.,Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest,on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones,was discovered, led by a theory.,Edmund Schulman in the 1950s,had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,,and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine,called, "Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.",And then, based on that principle, he started looking around,at the various trees at Timberline,,and realized that the bristlecone pines --,he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.,Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. 
 OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property,when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.,Because the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain.",And we said, "Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero? 
 (Laughter) 
 And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property,and take a hell of a tax deduction. 
 (Laughter) 
 All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars." 
 Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,,and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay,,we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.,This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.,It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten,,a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.,But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line,,due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that,,as you'll see when we go inside in a minute,,we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.,And shale is not quite completely competent rock.,Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.,The shale would like some shoring,,and so parts of it are caved in in there. 
 That's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park.,But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus,on some of the collapsed timbers.,OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property,,and it dates back to 1870.,That's what the property was originally built around --,it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.,In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada,,and it ran year round.,You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.,You may recognize a couple of the miners there.,There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena,,which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.,They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine. 
 It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.,And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people,from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep.,And they also found four species of bats in there.,Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain.,They don't quite, but it's something to think about.,They don't quite meet.,Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.,Way more interesting than Monterey even today. 
 And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.,Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow.,That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again,,thanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.,And it's a pretty interesting scene.,This is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin,,who's the regional head of the National Forest Service,,and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.,We want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually --,10,000-year temporary use permit. 
 (Laughter) 
 The weather station's pretty interesting.,Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station.,It runs on solar, and it sends a signalnwith that antenna,and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere,to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down,and then sent through landlines to San Francisco,,where we put the data in real time up on our website.,And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.,Let's go to approaches.,As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,,just a few old mining roads like this,,so you have to bushwhack everywhere.,But there's no bears, and there's no poison oak,,and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time.,You can hike for days and not encounter anybody. 
 Well, here's a potential approach.,You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon.,It's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,,and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,,until you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.,So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.,Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.,You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.,And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,,it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest,through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.,And you can carry right on up through meadows,and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet,,where there's a bit of a problem. 
 Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition,,"Make the clock inaccessible.,The harder it is to get to, the more people will value it.",And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there.,So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route,,and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck,at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.,Now, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but your emotional affect goes up,,which is great for having a mythic experience,,whether you want to or not.,In fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude,by how much math he can't do in his head. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander,when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote,,"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways.",Now, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director.,I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.,I'm saying, "Be careful, be careful, be careful.",Then he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is,,"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees.,It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien.",And I'm going, "Careful, careful. Please be careful.",And then, of course, the next thing I hear is,,"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here.",And he dashed across the top of the mountains. 
 In fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose.,First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington,,and a solo ascent at that.,This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs,and what to do with them.,We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.,How about Zander's Crevice? No. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq.,Zander's Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra,,there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra,called the Siq, and so this is the Siq.,And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image,,and I'm not sure you can.,Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there,,and that brings it out. 
 Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,,and Danny looked over to the right,and noticed something halfway up the cliffs,,which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,,and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain,could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.,And the people toiling up the mountain could see them,,these tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.,How did they get there? Do I have to do that?,And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.,You can get another angle on Danny's porch,by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there.,And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate,by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,,and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger,which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate.,So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on,,the clock will keep perfectly good time. 
 So here we're looking from the south, look north.,This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,,that's some of the Long Now land in those trees.,And if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of,what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.,That's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon.,And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.,That's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite.,Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,,it's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot,,there is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq.,That's what it looks like looking down it.,We should probably put in a rail or something.,Over on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.,And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like.,You also see there a bighorn sheep.,Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.,And they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble. 
 This is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem.,he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land,would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.,because the real peak is hidden around the corner.,This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.,And as it turned out the answer is, yes,,that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak,,and that might be conjured with.,We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this.,One is the experience of the mountain.,Another is the experience in the mountain.,And the third is the experience from the mountain,,which is really dominated by the view shed,of the spring valley there behind Danny,,and if you look off to the right, out there,,15 miles across to the Schell Creek range. 
 In the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains,using the water from the mountains.,In fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.,One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch,,and I'll take you there for a minute.,It's a very nice ranch.,Alfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham,,and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.,And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.,This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.,And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end,,you'll see what the valley used to look like.,This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years. 
 And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see,if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley,,because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres,dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on,,and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing,for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition,,and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,,and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell. 
 OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.,The clock experience should be profound,,but from the outside it should be invisible.,Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.,It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?,You excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.,And then you could have an entrance,which was very rough and narrow as you first went in,,that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.,And this stone takes a perfect polish.,You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there,eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock. 
 And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation,of the basic structure of the mountain,,and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside.,This is architecture not made by building,,but by what you very carefully take away.,So that's what the mountain taught us.,Most of the amazingness of the clock,we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.,All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.,It's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clock.,Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying,for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.,They say, "pin peya obe" -- welcome to the mountain. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I work with a species called "Bonobo.",And I'm happy most of the time,,because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.,It's kind of a well-kept secret.,This species lives only in the Congo.,And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.,Their sexual behavior is too human-like,for most of us to be comfortable with. 
 (Laughter) 
 But -- 
 (Laughter) 
 actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very,egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.,And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life,that they sort of set aside.,It permeates their entire life.,And it's used for communication.,And it's used for conflict resolution.,And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,,divided our lives up into lots of parts.,We divided our world up with lots of categories.,And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.,But I don't think that we were that way initially. 
 There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired,and that there's something very, very special about man.,Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.,Maybe it's something special in his brain,that allows him to have language.,Maybe it's something special in his brain,that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.,Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered,around the 1600s and they had no fire.,They had no stone tools.,To our knowledge they had no music.,So when you compare them to the Bonobo,,the Bonobo is a little hairier.,He doesn't stand quite as upright.,But there are a lot of similarities.,And I think that as we look at culture,,we kind of come to understand,how we got to where we are.,And I don't really think it's in our biology;,I think we've attributed it to our biology,,but I don't really think it's there. 
 So what I want to do now is introduce you,to a species called the Bonobo.,This is Kanzi.,He's a Bonobo.,Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.,His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.,And she came to us when she was just at puberty,,about six or seven years of age. 
 Now this shows a Bonobo on your right,,and a chimpanzee on your left.,Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.,The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,,is more upright, just as we are.,This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.,As you can see, there's not a lot of difference,between the way a Bonobo walks,and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.,As they turn toward us you'll see,that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter,and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.,So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.,And now we see all four. 
 Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle,encircled by the Congo River.,Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet,,grow densely in the area.,It was a Japanese scientist,who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,,almost three decades ago.,Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.,Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.,Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.,One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.,What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.,Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame. 
 SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.,None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.,None of them are tricks.,They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,,by NHK of Japan.,We have eight Bonobos. 
 Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. 
 SS: An entire family at our research centre. 
 Video: You going to help get some sticks?,Good.,We need more sticks, too.,I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.,That's a wasps' nest.,You can get it out.,I hope I have a lighter.,You can use the lighter to start the fire. 
 SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.,He doesn't do it yet without a lighter,,but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do --,make a fire without a lighter.,He's learning about how to keep a fire going.,He's learning the uses for a fire,,just by watching what we do with fire. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.,These are happy vocalizations. 
 Video: You're happy.,You're very happy about this part.,You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?,Good job. 
 SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.,But he likes to carry things from place to place. 
 Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin." 
 SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,,farther than we can hear.,This is his sister.,This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart. 
 Video: Goodbye. 
 (Laughter) 
 SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.,She switches from reverse to forward,and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her. 
 (Music) 
 Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,,and documenting their development across two decades,,scientists are exploring how cultural forces 
 (Laughter) 
 may have operated during human evolution. 
 His name is Nyota.,It means "star" in Swahili. 
 (Music) 
 Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.,In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.,Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,,to groom Nyota.,Very impressive.,Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required,to perform delicate tasks like this.,Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.,Realizing that Nyota might get hurt,,Panbanisha, like any human mother,,carefully tugs to get the scissors back. 
 He can now cut through tough animal hide. 
 SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools. 
 Video: Kanzi now makes his tools,,just as our ancestors may have made them,,two-and-a-half million years ago --,by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.,He has learned that by using both hands,and aiming his glancing blows,,he can make much larger, sharper flakes.,Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.,The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.,The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard,and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,,requiring great skill.,Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia,and is identical to that used by our African ancestors,two-and-a-half million years ago.,These are the rocks Kanzi used,and these are the flakes he made.,The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.,Compare them to the tools our ancestors used;,they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's. 
 Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.,She keeps staring out the window. 
 SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do. 
 Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside. 
 SS: I normally talk about language. 
 Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected. 
 SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,,I haven't told you that these apes have language.,It's a geometric language. 
 Video: She takes a piece of chalk,and begins writing something on the floor.,What is she writing? 
 SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice. 
 Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again. 
 SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard. 
 (Music) 
 They speak when she touches them. 
 Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.,"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.,Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.,Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.,SS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha. 
 SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,,until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. 
 Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.,The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.,The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar.",It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out. 
 SS: That's an institutional requirement. 
 Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others,,but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line,and several straight lines.,Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said,,by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.,Panbanisha watched.,Soon she began to write as well.,The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.,How did they develop? 
 SS (video): We found that the most important thing,for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.,It's simply to use language around them,,because the driving force in language acquisition,is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.,Once you have that capacity,,the ability to produce language,comes rather naturally and rather freely.,So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,,like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --,we want to create an environment in which they have fun,,and an environment in which the others,are meaningful individuals for them.,Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential,in Kanzi and Panbanisha. 
 Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,,until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.,Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.,Is he looking for where the sound came from?,Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.,This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.,She wasn't forced to learn the piano;,she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. 
 Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.,Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part. 
 Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;,using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.,Kanzi and Panbanisha,are stimulated by this fun-filled environment,,which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. 
 (Laughter) 
 Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.,Take the cherries too.,Now watch out, stay away from them now.,Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.,Now you have to stay away. Get away.,Run away. Run.,Now we can chase them again. Go get them.,Oh no!,Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much. 
 Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine? 
 SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture.",We're learning how to become like them.,We're learning how to communicate with them,,in really high-pitched tones.,We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.,And they're learning to become like us.,Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.,So we're sharing tools and technology and language,with another species. 
 Thank you.Thomas Dolby: For pure pleasure,please welcome the lovely,,the delectable,,and the bilingual Rachelle Garniez.

 (Applause)You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,,and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.,So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.,It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.,And it comes in a male form, too --,very glamorous.,Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,,there actually is a little wine in there --,and of course, always wears a tuxedo.,But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --,one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,,but also comes in other forms. 
 A magazine?,Well, it's certainly not this one.,This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.,Sex tips are not glamorous.,And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,,is not glamorous either.,But there is a glamour of industry.,This is Margaret Bourke-White's --,one of her pictures she did.,Fantastic, glamorous pictures,of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.,And there's the mythic glamour,of the garage entrepreneur.,This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.,We know everyone who starts a business in a garage,ends up founding Hewlett-Packard.,There's the glamour of physics.,What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,,grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --,he has other kinds of glamour. 
 And there is, of course, this glamour.,This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --,and not the alien-style glamour,,but the nice, clean, early '60s version.,So what do we mean by glamour?,Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means,is you can look in the dictionary.,And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,,in this case the 1913 dictionary.,Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,,and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.,You had "a" glamour.,It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour.",Glamour was a literal magic spell.,Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,,but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies,and to some extent, Celtic magic.,And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,,it started to take on this other kind of deception --,this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,,an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.,But still, glamour is an illusion.,Glamour is a magic spell.,And there's something dangerous about glamour,throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell,on you, it was not in your self-interest --,it was to get you to act against your interest. 
 Well of course, in the 20th century,,glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.,And this is Hedy Lamarr.,Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,,all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter),But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --,about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.,There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement,associated with creating this Hollywood glamour.,There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.,You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood,and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors,depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.,So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something,that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.,And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --,they call them false color. 
 Glamour is a form of falsification,,but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.,It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.,And it involves a great deal of technique.,It's not -- glamour is not something --,you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.,Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.,There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,",and it's not just the case for people.,Glamour doesn't have to be people.,Architectural photography --,Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,,took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.,Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.,It puts you into this special, special world.,This is Alex Ross's comic book art,,which appears to be extremely realistic,,as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.,Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world. 
 When you stack people in rows,,the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --,but not in the world of glamour.,What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb,in the table of contents of New York magazine,,which was telling us that glamour is back --,glamour is all about transcending the everyday.,And I think that that's starting to get at what the core,that combines all sorts of glamour is.,This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.,And I don't know who she is either,,but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.,It's a very glamorous portrait.,Why is it glamorous?,It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --,but that does not make you glamorous,,that only makes you beautiful.,She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,,and those are the central qualities of glamour.,You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.,She's not looking away from you exactly,,but you have to mentally imagine her world.,She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world,to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil,while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.,Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.,That's glamour:,that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus,and they're both awfully happy and pleasant. 
 Glamour invites us to live in a different world.,It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --,that's why, often in these glamour shots,,the person is not looking at the audience,,it's why sunglasses are glamorous --,but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.,In some sense, there has to be something like us.,So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.,God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,,omniscient -- too far above us.,And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary,will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.,As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,,but it has to have this transcendent quality.,What is it about Superman?,Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,,one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly. 
 Glamour is all about transcending this world,and getting to an idealized, perfect place.,And this is one reason that modes of transportation,tend to be extremely glamorous.,The less experience we have with them,,the more glamorous they are.,So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,,but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.,You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.,The notion is that it's going to transport you,,and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,,who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.,The story is about where you're arriving,,or thinking about where you're arriving.,And this sense of being transported,is one reason that we have glamour styling.,This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous,because we associate it with movies of that period, but because,,in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday. 
 The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.,Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.,Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.,I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous,because, to me, it captures the whole promise,of the academic contemplative life --,but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.,Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,,city streets -- not so glamorous.,You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.,The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.,There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --,except, possibly, multiple horizons.,Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --,you just see the possibilities.,In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality,of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione,in his book, "The Book Of The Courtier.",There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,,after a few centuries. 
 And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.,It makes things look effortless.,You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --,she just looks completely natural.,And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,,how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.,Of course, they covered that with make-up,,because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --,but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.,"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":,And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.,Glamour is about editing.,How do you create the sense of transcendence,,the sense of evoking a perfect world?,The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --,I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.,We don't tell you all the grubby details. 
 Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.,This is underneath Jeff's desk.,This is what the real world of computers,,lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.,But if you look in a catalog --,particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --,it looks like this.,There are no cords.,Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --,you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.,But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,,you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter),And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop,or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,,you don't get to live in the world without cords.,You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.,And there she is -- Grace.,This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.,Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,",the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?,And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie. 
 Here's Hedy Lamarr again.,And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous,because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.,Translucence is glamorous --,that's why all these people wear pearls.,It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --,not transparent, not opaque.,It invites us into the world,but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.,And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,,maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,,because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.,It has that sense of going up and away,,and yet you never think about how you would really trip,if you were -- particularly going down.,And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.,So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure,but glamour's really partly about meaning.,All individuals and all cultures have ideals,that cannot possibly be realized in reality. 
 They have contradictions,,they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --,whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose,to our lives as cultures and as individuals.,And the way we deal with that is we displace them --,we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,,an age of heroes, the world to come.,And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.,The white picket fence, the perfect house.,The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.,You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.,The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,,the perfect diamond ring.,The perfect getaway in your perfect car.,This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.,The perfect office --,again, no cords, as far as I can tell.,And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.,I mean, there's no paper on the desk.,We want this golden world.,And some people get rich enough,,and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,,they get to acquire their perfect world. 
 Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --,I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.,That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.,This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?,What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?,Is it something important?,"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.,I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.,It was criticized for glamorizing violence,,because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,,they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things,that are impossible in the real world.,This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.,This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.,I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.,You know, we're marching toward Utopia. 
 I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.,Because what they're doing is they're saying,,your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.,But actually, what's even more important,than remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?,Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.,And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.,This is from "Triumph Of The Will" --,brilliant editing to cut together things.,There's a glamour shot.,National Socialism is all about glamour.,It was a very aesthetic ideology.,It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,,and ridding it of anything unglamorous.,So glamour can be dangerous. 
 I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.,I'm not against glamour.,But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.,And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour,and a way to broaden your appreciation of it.,And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice,and confront the manipulation of it all,,and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,,but also enjoy how it happens.,And here's Hedy Lamarr.,She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.,So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,,even though she thought she could look stupid. 
 David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this,very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about,the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,,which only took a fraction of a second to happen.,There is a book out in the bookstore --,it's called "Symphony In Steel,",and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.,And that has a fascination.,It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.,There's a wonderful book called "Crowns",that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.,And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,,"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.,They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.,But I also knew how hard they worked all week.,Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow.",And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour,when you realize what went into creating it.,Thank you.I became an inventor by accident.,I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true:,I went in in 1956, came out in 1959,,was working at the University of Washington,,and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,,for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.,Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs --,any of the cool stuff we've got now.,And it was an arm that,,instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record,,went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.,And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,,and I got really lucky after that. 
 And without giving you too much of a tirade,,I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today:,my 44th invention. No, that's not true either.,Golly, I'm just totally losing it.,My 44th patent; about the 15th invention.,I call this hypersonic sound.,I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,,but I want to make an analogy before I do,to this.,I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say,,That's really cool, but what's it good for?,And I say, What is the light bulb good for?,Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.,When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.,Hasn't changed that much.,Light came out of it in every direction.,Before the light bulb was invented,,people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it,,focus it a little bit;,put lenses in front of it,,focus it a little bit better.,Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers,that were totally focused. 
 Now, think about where the world would be today,if we had the light bulb,,but you couldn't focus light;,if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.,That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.,You turn on the loudspeaker,,and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,,the sound just kind of goes where it wants.,Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone,,it's pretty much every direction.,A little bit of differential, but not much.,If the light bulb was the way the speaker is,,and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,,we wouldn't have that, or movies in general,,or computers, or T.V. sets,,or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the list,of what the importance is,of being able to focus light. 
 Now, after almost 80 years of having sound,,I thought it was about time that we figure out,a way to put sound where you want to.,I have a couple of units.,That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day,for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car --,small version, over your head --,so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.,What if I could aim sound the way I aim light? 
 I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.,Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.,Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.,(Applause),The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?,(Applause),Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,,and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. 
 Course, like light, it's great to be able to put sound,to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,,or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.,Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now.,They tried this back in the '60s,and were too smart, and so they gave up.,But they want to use it -- seriously.,There's a mix an inventor has to have.,You have to be kind of smart,,and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,,because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.,Too many other smart people out there. So.,I just happened to get my education in a little different way.,I'm not at all against education.,I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,,when they get educated, lose it:,they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.,And we're living in a great time right now,,because almost everything's being explored anew.,I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:,virtually nothing --,and I mean this honestly --,has been invented yet.,We're just starting.,We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.,And this is, I hope, a little piece of it. 
 Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track --,that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,,you're going to watch a new T.V. channel.,They know that when you watch T.V. at home,,because there are so many choices,you can change channels, miss their commercials.,A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.,Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,,because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message,every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.,And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.,For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,,you get to watch it for free;,when you want to hear the sound, you pay.,And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing,where when you step in the line in the supermarket --,initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;,they're trying this in three parts of the country right now --,you'll be watching TV. 
 And hopefully they'll be sensitive,that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.,But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,,if you don't want to hear it,,you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.,So, we create silence as much as we create sound.,ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.,Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;,your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;,doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.,We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles. 
 I have been really lucky with this technology:,all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.,They have literally beat a path to our door.,We've been selling it since about last September, October,,and it's been immensely gratifying.,If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today --,but this unit, with the electronics and everything,,if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.,We expect by this time next year,,it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.,It's not any more pricey than regular electronics. 
 Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.,This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.,It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound --,that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.,And the sound that you're hearing,,unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,,is made out in front of it, in the air.,The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.,You turn up the volume just a little bit --,I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels --,and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.,Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.,It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure. 
 Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,,I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.,Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much,,I'm having an effect on the pressure,,which means during the making of that sine wave,,the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.,All of audio as we know it,is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.,Linearity means higher quality sound.,Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:,it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.,An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound --,the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted,,but it's so predictable,that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect. 
 Now, the question is, where's the sound made?,Instead of being made on the face of the cone,,it's made at literally billions of little independent points,along this narrow column in the air,,and so when I aim it towards you,,what you hear is made right next to your ears.,I said we can shorten the column,,we can spread it out to cover the couch.,I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,,the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.,When you listen to stereo on your home system,,your both ears hear both speakers.,Turn on the left speaker sometime,and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.,So, the stage is more restricted --,the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.,Because the sound is made in the air along this column,,it does not follow the inverse square law,,which says it drops off about two thirds,every time you double the distance:,6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.,That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,,and the guy in the front row gets the same level,as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.,Isn't that terrific? 
 So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,,in having companies catch the vision of this,,from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,,and a separate system in the back --,oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.,(Laughter),I was seeing if you were listening.,Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet.,A stereo system in the front for mom and dad,,and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,,and the parents don't want to be bothered with that,,or their rap music or whatever.,So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to,is really starting to catch on.,It also works for transmitting and communicating data.,It also works five times better underwater. 
 We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq,,where you can put fake troop movements,quarter of a mile away on a hillside.,(Laughter),Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.,(Laughter),I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices,that can look at their countenance,,and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift,from 100 yards away when they play this thing.,And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.,We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.,Pain is 120.,So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,,and there can be a public beach just off to the side,,and they don't even know it's turned on.,We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,,and they're buying them as fast as we can make them.,We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,,you're over there, and it's there. 
 I have a bunch of other inventions.,I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.,Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day --,I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project --,and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.,We're using very short wavelengths.,We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.,When you run very short wavelengths,,like a tuning fork the antenna resonates,,and there's more energy coming out of the antenna,than there is the backscatter from the ground,that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing.",I says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?,Turn it on; turn it off.,That's a fluorescent tube refined.",I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.,I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,,when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,,and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.,(Laughter) 
 Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone -- the little cell headphones?,That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.,Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.,I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer,in my attic at my house,,and one of the many designs which they have now,is still the same design I drew way back when. 
 So, I've been really lucky as an inventor.,I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.,And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family,would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.,You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.,I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group. 
 Let me give you, in the last minute,,one more quick demo of this guy,,for those of you that haven't heard it.,Can never tell if it's on.,If you haven't heard it, raise your hand.,Getting it over there?,Get the cameraman.,Yeah, there you go.,I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.,Thank you once again.,Appreciate it very much.I bet you're worried. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was worried.,That's why I began this piece.,I was worried about vaginas.,I was worried what we think about vaginas,and even more worriednthat we don't think about them.,I was worried about my own vagina.,It needed a context, a culture,na community of other vaginas.,There is so much darknessnand secrecy surrounding them.,Like the Bermuda Triangle,nnobody ever reports back from there. 
 (Laughter) 
 In the first place, it's not so easynto even find your vagina.,Women go days, weeks, months,nwithout looking at it.,I interviewed a high-powerednbusinesswoman;,she told me she didn't have time.,"Looking at your vagina,"nshe said, "is a full day's work." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You've got to get down therenon your back, in front of a mirror,,full-length preferred.,You've got to get in the perfect positionnwith the perfect light,,which then becomes shadowednby the angle you're at.,You're twisting your head up,narching your back, it's exhausting.",She was busy; she didn't have time.,So I decided to talk to womennabout their vaginas.,They began as casual vagina interviews,,and they turned into vagina monologues.,I talked with over 200 women.,I talked to older women, younger women,,married women, lesbians, single women.,I talked to corporate professionals,ncollege professors, actors, sex workers.,I talked to African-American women,nAsian-American women,,Native-American women,nCaucasian women, Jewish women. 
 OK, at first women were a little shy,na little reluctant to talk.,Once they got going,nyou couldn't stop them.,Women love to talknabout their vaginas, they do.,Mainly because no one's evernasked them before. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's just start with the wordn"vagina" -- vagina, vagina.,It sounds like an infection, at best.,Maybe a medical instrument.,"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Vagina, vagina, vagina. 
 It doesn't matter how many timesnyou say the word,,it never sounds like a wordnyou want to say.,It's a completely ridiculous,ntotally un-sexy word.,If you use it during sex,ntrying to be politically correct,,"Darling, would you stroke my vagina,",you kill the act right there. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm worried what we call themnand don't call them.,In Great Neck, New York,nthey call it a Pussycat.,A woman told me therenher mother used to tell her,,"Don't wear panties, dear,nunderneath your pajamas.,You need to air out your Pussycat." 
 (Laughter) 
 In Westchester, they call it a Pooki,,in New Jersey, a twat.,There's Powderbox, derriere,na Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi,,a Poopelu, a Pooninana,na Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi,nDignity, Coochi Snorcher,,Cooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,,Wee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,,Mongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox,na Mimi in Miami,,a Split Knish in Philadelphia ... 
 (Laughter) 
 and a Schmende in the Bronx. 
 (Laughter) 
 I am worried about vaginas.,This is how the "VaginanMonologues" begins.,But it really didn't begin there.,It began with a conversation with a woman.,We were having a conversationnabout menopause,,and we got onto the subject of her vagina,,which you'll do if you'rentalking about menopause.,And she said things that reallynshocked me about her vagina --,that it was dried-upnand finished and dead --,and I was kind of shocked.,So I said to a friend casually,,"Well, what do you thinknabout your vagina?",And that woman saidnsomething more amazing,,and then the next woman saidnsomething more amazing,,and before I knew it,nevery woman was telling me,I had to talk to somebodynabout their vagina,because they had an amazing story,,and I was sucked down the vagina trail. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I really haven't gotten off of it.,I think if you had told menwhen I was younger,that I was going to grow up,nand be in shoe stores,,and people would scream out,n"There she is, the Vagina Lady!",I don't know that that would havenbeen my life ambition. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I want to talk a little bitnabout happiness,,and the relationshipnto this whole vagina journey,,because it has beennan extraordinary journey,that began eight years ago.,I think before I didnthe "Vagina Monologues,",I didn't really believe in happiness.,I thought that only idiotsnwere happy, to be honest.,I remember when I startednpracticing Buddhism 14 years ago,,and I was told that the endnof this practice was to be happy,,I said, "How could you be happynand live in this world of suffering,and live in this world of pain?",I mistook happinessnfor a lot of other things,,like numbness or decadence or selfishness.,And what happened through the coursenof the "Vagina Monologues",and this journey is,nI think I have come to understand,a little bit more about happiness. 
 There are three qualitiesnI want to talk about.,One is seeing what'snright in front of you,,and talking about it, and stating it.,I think what I learnednfrom talking about the vagina,and speaking about the vagina,nis it was the most obvious thing --,it was right in the center of my bodynand the center of the world --,and yet it was the one thingnnobody talked about.,The second thing is that what talkingnabout the vagina did,is it opened this doornwhich allowed me to see,that there was a way to serventhe world to make it better.,And that's where the deepest happinessnhas actually come from.,And the third principle of happiness,nwhich I've realized recently: 
 Eight years ago, this momentumnand this energy, this "V-wave" started --,and I can only describe itnas a "V-wave" because, to be honest,,I really don't understand it completely;nI feel at the service of it.,But this wave started,nand if I question the wave,,or try to stop the wavenor look back at the wave,,I often have the experience of whiplash,or the potential of my neck breaking.,But if I go with the wave,,and I trust the wavenand I move with the wave,,I go to the next place, and it happensnlogically and organically and truthfully.,And I started this piece, particularlynwith stories and narratives,,and I was talking to one womannand that led to another woman,and that led to another woman.,And then I wrote those stories down,,and I put them outnin front of other people. 
 And every single timenI did the show at the beginning,,women would literallynline up after the show,,because they wantednto tell me their stories.,And at first I thought, "Oh great,nI'll hear about wonderful orgasms,,and great sex lives, and how womennlove their vaginas.",But in fact, that's notnwhat women lined up to tell me.,What women lined up to tell menwas how they were raped,,and how they were battered,nand how they were beaten,,and how they were gang-rapednin parking lots,,and how they were incestednby their uncles.,And I wanted to stop doingnthe "Vagina Monologues,",because it felt too daunting.,I felt like a war photographernwho takes pictures of terrible events,,but doesn't intervene on their behalf. 
 And so in 1997, I said,n"Let's get women together.,What could we do with this information,that all these women are being violated?",And it turned out, after thinkingnand investigating,,that I discovered -- and the UNnhas actually said this recently --,that one out of every threenwomen on this planet,will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.,That's essentially a gender;,that's essentially the resourcenof the planet, which is women.,So in 1997 we got all these incrediblenwomen together and we said,,"How can we use the play, this energy,nto stop violence against women?",And we put on one eventnin New York City, in the theater,,and all these great actorsncame -- from Susan Sarandon,,to Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg --,and we did one performance on one evening,,and that catalyzed this wave, this energy. 
 And within five years,,this extraordinary thing began to happen.,One woman took that energy and she said,n"I want to bring this wave,,this energy, to college campuses,",and so she took the play and she said,,"Let's use the play and havenperformances once a year,,where we can raise moneynto stop violence against women,in local communitiesnall around the world.",And in one year, it went to 50 colleges,nand then it expanded.,And over the course of the last six years,,it's spread and it's spreadnand it's spread around the world. 
 What I have learned is two things:,one, that the epidemic of violencentowards women is shocking; it's global;,it is so profoundnand it is so devastating,,and it is so in every little pocketnof every little crater,,of every little societynthat we don't even recognize it,,because it's become ordinary.,This journey has taken me to Afghanistan,,where I had the extraordinarynhonor and privilege,to go into parts of Afghanistannunder the Taliban.,I was dressed in a burqa and I went innwith an extraordinary group,,called the Revolutionary Associationnof the Women of Afghanistan.,And I saw firsthandnhow women had been stripped,of every single right that was possiblento strip women of --,from being educated, to being employed,,to being actually allowednto eat ice cream.,For those of you who don't know,,it was illegal to eat ice creamnunder the Taliban.,And I actually saw and metnwomen who had been flogged,for being caught eating vanilla ice cream.,I was taken to the secret ice cream-eatingnplace in a little town,,where we went to a back room,nand women were seated,and a curtain was pulled around us,nand they were served vanilla ice cream.,And women lifted their burqasnand ate this ice cream.,And I don't think I ever understoodnpleasure until that moment,,and how women have found a waynto keep their pleasure alive. 
 It has taken me, this journey,nto Islamabad,,where I have witnessed and met womennwith their faces melted off.,It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico,nwhere I was a week ago,,where I have literally beennthere in parking lots,,where bones of women have washed up,and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.,It has taken me to universitiesnall over this country,,where girls are date-raped and drugged.,I have seen terrible, terrible,nterrible violence.,But I have also recognized,nin the course of seeing that violence,,that being in the face of thingsnand seeing actually what's in front of us,is the antidote to depression,,and to a feeling that onenis worthless and has no value. 
 Because before the "Vagina Monologues,",I will say that 80 percentnof my consciousness was closed off,to what was really going onnin this reality,,and that closing-off closed offnmy vitality and my life energy.,What has also happenednis in the course of these travels --,and it's been an extraordinary thing --,is that every single placenthat I have gone to in the world,,I have met a new species.,And I really love hearing about allnthese species at the bottom of the sea.,And I was thinking about how beingnwith these extraordinary people,on this particular panel,,that it's beneath, beyond and between,,and the vagina kind of fitsninto all those categories. 
 (Laughter) 
 But one of the thingsnI've seen is this species --,and it is a species,nand it is a new paradigm,,and it doesn't get reportednin the press or in the media,because I don't thinkngood news ever is news,,and I don't think peoplenwho are transforming the planet,are what gets the ratings on TV shows.,But every single country I have been to --,and in the last six years,nI've been to about 45 countries,,and many tiny little villagesnand cities and towns --,I have seen something what I've comento call "vagina warriors.",A "vagina warrior" is a woman,nor a vagina-friendly man,,who has witnessed incrediblenviolence or suffered it,,and rather than getting an AK-47nor a weapon of mass destruction,or a machete,,they hold the violence in their bodies;,they grieve it; they experience it;nand then they go out,and devote their lives to making surenit doesn't happen to anybody else. 
 I have met these womenneverywhere on the planet,,and I want to tell a few stories,,because I believe that stories are the waynthat we transmit information,,where it goes into our bodies.,And I think one of the things about beingnat TED that's been very interesting,is that I live in my body a lot,,and I don't live in my headnvery much anymore.,And this is a very heady place.,And it's been really interestingnto be in my head,for the last two days;nI've been very disoriented -- 
 (Laughter) 
 because I think the world, the V-world,nis very much in your body.,It's a body world, and the speciesnreally exists in the body.,And I think there's a real significancenin us attaching our bodies to our heads,,that that separation has created a divide,that is often separatingnpurpose from intent.,And the connection between body and head,often brings those things into union. 
 I want to talk about threenparticular people that I've met,,vagina warriors, who reallyntransformed my understanding,of this whole principle and species,,and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.,Marsha Lopez was a womannI met in Guatemala.,She was 14 years old,nand she was in a marriage,and her husband was beating hernon a regular basis.,And she couldn't get out,,because she was addictednto the relationship,,and she had no money.,Her sister was younger than her,nand she applied --,we had a "Stop Rape" contestna few years ago in New York --,and she applied, hopingnthat she would become a finalist,and she could bring her sister.,She did become a finalist;nshe brought Marsha to New York. 
 And at that time,,we did this extraordinary V-Daynat Madison Square Garden,,where we sold out the entirentestosterone-filled dome --,18,000 people standing upnto say "Yes" to vaginas,,which was really a prettynincredible transformation.,And she came, and she witnessed this,,and she decided that she would go backnand leave her husband,,and that she would bringnV-Day to Guatemala.,She was 21 years old.,I went to Guatemala and she had sold outnthe National Theater of Guatemala.,And I watched her walk up on stagenin her red short dress and high heels,,and she stood there and said,n"My name is Marsha.,I was beaten by my husband for five years.nHe almost murdered me.,I left and you can, too.",And the entire 2,000 peoplenwent absolutely crazy. 
 There's a woman named Esther Cháveznwho I met in Juarez, Mexico.,And Esther Chávez wasna brilliant accountant in Mexico City.,She was 72 years oldnand she was planning to retire.,She went to Juareznto take care of an ailing aunt,,and in the course of it, she begannto discover what was happening,to the murdered and disappearednwomen of Juarez.,She gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.,She started to write the storiesnwhich documented the disappeared women.,300 women have disappeared in a borderntown because they're brown and poor.,There has been no responsento the disappearance,,and not one personnhas been held accountable.,She began to document it.,She opened a center callednCasa Amiga, and in six years,,she has literally brought thisnto the consciousness of the world.,We were there a week ago,,when there were 7,000 peoplenin the street, and it was truly a miracle.,And as we walked through the streets,,the people of Juarez, who normallyndon't even come into the streets,,because the streets are so dangerous,,literally stood there and wept,,to see that other peoplenfrom the world had showed up,for that particular community. 
 There's another woman, named Agnes.,And Agnes, for me, epitomizesnwhat a vagina warrior is.,I met her three years ago in Kenya.,And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;,she was circumcised against her willnwhen she was 10 years old,,and she really made a decision,that she didn't want this practicento continue anymore in her community.,So when she got older,nshe created this incredible thing:,it's an anatomical sculpturenof a woman's body, half a woman's body.,And she walked through the Rift Valley,,and she had vaginanand vagina replacement parts,,where she would teach girlsnand parents and boys and girls,what a healthy vagina looks like,nand what a mutilated vagina looks like. 
 And in the course of her travel --,she walked literally for eight yearsnthrough the Rift Valley,,through dust, through sleepingnon the ground,,because the Maasai are nomads,,and she would have to find them,nand they would move,,and she would find them again --,she saved 1,500 girls from being cut. 
 And in that time, she creatednan alternative ritual,,which involved girlsncoming of age without the cut.,When we met her three years ago,,we said, "What could V-Day do for you?",And she said, "Well, if you got me a jeep,nI could get around a lot faster." 
 (Laughter) 
 So we bought her a jeep.,And in the year that she had the jeep,nshe saved 4,500 girls from being cut.,So we said to her,n"What else could we do for you?",She said, "Well, Eve,nif you gave me some money,,I could open a housenand girls could run away,,and they could be saved.",And I want to tell this little storynabout my own beginnings,,because it's very interrelatednto happiness and Agnes. 
 When I was a little girl --nI grew up in a wealthy community;,it was an upper-middle classnwhite community,,and it had all the trappings and the looks,of a perfectly nice,nwonderful, great life.,And everyone was supposednto be happy in that community,,and, in fact, my life was hell.,I lived with an alcoholic father,who beat me and molested me,nand it was all inside that.,And always as a child I had this fantasynthat somebody would come and rescue me.,And I actually made up a little characternwhose name was Mr. Alligator.,I would call him upnwhen things got really bad,,and say it was timento come and pick me up.,And I would pack a little bagnand wait for Mr. Alligator to come. 
 Now, Mr. Alligator never did come,,but the idea of Mr. Alligator comingnactually saved my sanity,and made it OK for me to keep going,,because I believed, in the distance,,there would be someonencoming to rescue me. 
 Cut to 40-some odd years later,,we go to Kenya, and we're walking,,we arrive at the opening of this house.,And Agnes hadn't let me comento the house for days,,because they were preparingnthis whole ritual. 
 I want to tell you a great story.,When Agnes first started fighting,to stop female genital mutilationnin her community,,she had become an outcast,nand she was exiled and slandered,,and the whole communitynturned against her.,But being a vagina warrior,nshe kept going,,and she kept committing herselfnto transforming consciousness.,And in the Maasai community,,goats and cows are the mostnvalued possession.,They're like the Mercedes-Benznof the Rift Valley.,And she said two daysnbefore the house opened,,two different people arrivednto give her a goat each,,and she said to me,,"I knew then that female genitalnmutilation would end one day in Africa." 
 Anyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,,there were hundreds of girlsndressed in red homemade dresses --,which is the color of the Maasainand the color of V-Day --,and they greeted us.,They had made up these songsnthat they were singing,,about the end of sufferingnand the end of mutilation,,and they walked us down the path.,It was a gorgeous day in the African sun,,and the dust was flyingnand the girls were dancing,,and there was this house, and it said,n"V-Day Safe House for the Girls." 
 And it hit me in that momentnthat it had taken 47 years,,but that Mr. Alligatornhad finally shown up.,And he had shown up, obviously,,in a form that it took mena long time to understand,,which is that when we give in the worldnwhat we want the most,,we heal the broken part inside each of us. 
 And I feel, in the last eight years,,that this journey --nthis miraculous vagina journey --,has taught me this really simple thing,,which is that happiness exists in action;,it exists in telling the truthnand saying what your truth is;,and it exists in giving awaynwhat you want the most.,And I feel that knowledge and that journey,has been an extraordinary privilege,,and I feel really blessed,to have been here todaynto communicate that to you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)You know, when Chris first approached mento speak at TED, I said no,,because I feltnlike I wasn't going to be able,to make that personal connection,nyou know, that I wanted to.,It's such a large conference.,But he explained to menthat he was in a bind,,and that he was having troublenfinding the kind of sex appeal,and star power thatnthe conference was known for. 
 So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.,I'll come on two conditions.,One: I want to speak as earlynin the morning as possible.,And two: I want to picknthe theme for TED 2006.,And luckily he agreed.,And the theme, in two years,nis going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."

 Knowing your country to beneconomical conducive for investment,,and your people as transparentnand trustworthy to engage in business,,on which premise I write you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Before my father death,,he had the sum of 23 millionnUnited States dollars,,which he kept away from the rebelnleaders during the course of the war. 
 (Laughter) 
 This fund was supposed to be used,for the rehabilitation of water reservesnall over the country,,before the outbreak of war.,When the war broke out,,the rebel leader demandednthe fund be given to him,,my father insisted itnwas not in his possession,,and he was killed because of his refusalnto release the fund.,Meanwhile, my mother and I,is the only person who knows about itnbecause my father always confide in me. 
 (Sighs) 
 I made an arrangementnwith a Red Cross relief worker,,who used his official van to transportnthe money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,,although he did not knownthe real contents of the box. 
 (Laughter) 
 The fund was depositednas a family reasure,,in a safe, reliable security companynin Dakar, Senegal,,where I was only given temporary asylum.,I do not wish to investnthe money in Senegal,due to unfavorable economic climate,nand so close to my country.,The only assistance I need from you,nwhich I know you would do for me,,are the following:none, be a silent partner,and receive the fundsnin your account in trust;,two, provide a bank accountnunder your control,to which the funds will be remitted;,three, receive the fundsninto your account in trust;,take out your commission;nand leave the rest of the money,until I arrive,nafter the transfer is complete.,Sincerely, Mr Micheal Bangura." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This is really embarrassing.,I was told backstagenthat I have 18 minutes.,I only prepared 15.

 Yeah, I was hanging outnwith some Google guys last night.,Really cool, we were getting wasted. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they were telling me that Googlensoftware has gotten so advanced,that, based on your interactionnwith Google over your lifetime,,they can actually predictnwhat you are going to say -- 
 (Laughter) 
 next. 
 And I was like, "Get the fucknout of here. That's crazy." 
 (Laughter) 
 But they said,n"No, but don't show anyone." 
 But they slipped up.,And they said that I could just type inn"What was I going to say next?",and my name, and it would tell me.,And I have to tell you, this isnan unadulterated piece of software,,this is a real Internet browsernand this is the actual Google site,,and we're going to test it out live today.,What was I going to say next?,And "Ze Frank" -- that's me.,Am I feeling lucky?

 In March of 2001 -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I filmed myself dancingnto Madonna's "Justify My Love.",On a Thursday, I sent out a linknto a website that featured those clips,to 17 of my closest friends,,as part of an invitation to my --nan invitation to my th --,th -- 26th birthday party. 
 (Laughter)

 By Monday, over a million peoplenwere coming to this site a day. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Laughter) 
 Within a week, I received a callnfrom Earthlink that said,,due to a 10 centsnper megabyte overage charge,,I owed them 30,000 dollars. 
 (Laughter) 
 Needless to say,nI was able to leave my job. 
 [WAS LAID OFF] 
 (Laughter) 
 And, finally, you know, become freelance. 
 (Laughter) 
 [UNEMPLOYED] 
 But some people refer to me morenas, like, an Internet guru or -- 
 [JACKASS] 
 swami. 
 (Laughter) 
 I knew I had something.,I'd basically distilledna very difficult-to-explain,and complex philosophy,nwhich I won't get into here,,because it's a little too deepnfor all of you, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It's about what makes websites popular,nand, you know, it's -- 
 [DANCE LIKE AN IDIOTnAND DON'T SELL ANYTHING] 
 It's unfortunatenthat I don't have more time.,Maybe I can come back next year,nor something like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm obsessed with email.nI get a lot of it.,Four years later, I still get probablyntwo or three hundred emails a day,from people I don't know,,and it's been an amazing opportunity,to kind of get to knowndifferent cultures, you know?,It's like a microscopento the rest of the world.,You can kind of peerninto other people's lives.,And I also feel like I get a lotnof inspiration from the average user.,For example, somebody wrote,n"Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,,you should rock out with us,"nand I said, "Why wait?" 
 [rocking out] 
 (Video) (Music) 
 And they said,n"Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,,but I meant the kind of rocking outnwhere we'd be naked." 
 (Laughter) 
 And that was embarrassing.,But you know, it's kind of a collaborationnbetween me and the fans,,so I said, "Sure." 
 [rocking out naked] 
 (Video) (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 I hear a lot of you whispering. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I know what you're saying,,"Holy crap!,How is his presentation so smooth?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I have to saynthat it's not all me this year.,I guess Chris has to take some creditnhere, because in years past,,I guess there's beennsome sort of subpar speakers at TED.,I don't know. 
 And so, this year, Chris sent usna TED conference simulator. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which really allowed us as speakersnto get there, in the trenches,,and practice at home so that we would benready for this experience.,And I've got to say that, you know,nit's really, really great to be here. 
 (Pre-recorded applause) 
 I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. 
 (Pre-recorded applause and cheering) 
 Not just the good stuff, though.,You can do heckler mode.

 ZF: You get off the stage. 
 (Laughter) 
 Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Baby cooing) 
 (Huge crowd applauding) 
 In case you run over time. 
 (Heroic music) 
 Just one last thingnI'd like to say, I'd, really -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd like to thank all of younfor being here. 
 (Loud music) 
 (Laughter) 
 And frog mode. 
 (Singing) 
 (Sings) "Ah, the first time that I madenlove to a rock shrimp --" 
 (Laughter) 
 [Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes] 
 (Sighs) 
 It's true.,Some people say to me,,"Ze, you're doing all this stuff,nthis Internet stuff,,and you're not making any money." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm trying.",I don't know if you're all aware of this,,but the video game market,,kids are playing these video games,,but, supposedly, there's tons of money.,I mean, like, I think,n100,000 dollars or so a year,is being spent on these things.,So I decided to try my hand.,I came up with a few games. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is called "Atheist.",I figured it would be popularnwith the young kids.,OK.,Look, I'll move aroundnand say some things. 
 (Sighs) 
 [Game over. There is no replay.] 
 (Laughter) 
 So that didn't go over so well. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't really understandnwhy you're laughing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Should have done thisnbefore I tried to pitch it.,"Buddhist," of course, looksnvery, very similar to "Atheist." 
 (Laughter) 
 But you come back as a duck. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is great because,nyou know, for a quarter,,you can play this for a long time. 
 (Laughter) 
 And Chris had said in an email,that we should really bringnsomething new to TED,,something that we haven't shown anyone.,So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian.",It's the third in the series.,I'm hoping it's goingnto do well this year. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Laughter) 
 Do you have a preference? 
 (Laughter) 
 Good choice. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you can wait for the Second Coming, 
 which is a random numbernbetween one and 500 million. 
 (Laughter) 
 So really, what are we talking about here?,Oh, tech joy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Tech joy, to me, means something,nbecause I get a lot of joy out of tech.,And in fact, making thingsnusing technology --,and I'm being serious here,,even though I'm usingnmy sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.,Making things, you know --,making things actuallyndoes give me a lot of joy.,It's the process of creation that keeps me,sort of a bubble and a halfnabove perpetual anxiety in my life,,and it's that feeling of beingnabout 80 percent complete on a project --,where you know you still havensomething to do,,but it's not finished,nand you're not starting something --,that really fills my entire life. 
 And so, what I've done is, 
 I started getting interestednin creating online social spaces,to share that feeling,with people who don't considernthemselves artists.,We're in a culture of guru-ship.,It's so hard to use some softwarenbecause, you know, it's unapproachable,,people feel like they havento read the manual.,So I try to createnthese very minimal activities,that allow people to expressnthemselves, and, hopefully -- 
 ("The End" by The Doors) 
 Whoa! I'm like -- on the page,nbut it doesn't exist. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's, like -- seriously, though -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I try to create meaningful environmentsnfor people to express themselves. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here I created a contest called,n"When Office Supplies Attack,",which, I think, really resonatednwith the working population. 
 (Laughter) 
 Over 500 entries in three weeks.,Toilet paper fashion. 
 (Laughter) 
 Again, people from all over the country.,The watch is particularly incredible. 
 (Laughter) 
 Online drawing tools --nyou've probably seen a lot of them.,I think they're wonderful.,It's a chance for peoplento get to play with crayons,and all that kind of stuff.,But I'm interestednin the process of creating,,as the real event that I'm interested in.,And the problem is thatna lot of people suck at drawing,,and they get bummed out at this,nsort of, you know, stick figure,,awful little thing that they created.,And eventually, it just makes themnstop playing with it,,or they draw penises and things like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, the Scribbler is an attemptnto create a generative tool.,In other words, it's a helping tool.,You can draw your simple stick figure,,and it collaborates with you to creatensort of a post-war German etching. 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, it's tuned to be betternat drawing things that look worse.,So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.,So the idea is that you can really,,you know, partake in this process,,but watch somethingnreally crappy look beautiful.,And here are some of my favorites.,This is the little trap marionettenthat was submitted to me.,Very cool. 
 (Laughter) 
 Darling.,Beautiful stuff.,I mean this is incredible.,An 11-year-old girl drew thisnand submitted it.,It's just gorgeous. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm dead serious here.,This is not a joke. 
 (Laughter) 
 But, I think it's a really funnand wonderful thing.,So this is called the "Fiction Project.",This is an online space,,which is basicallyna refurbished message board,that encourages collaborativenfiction writing.,These are haikus.,None of the haikus were writtennby the same person.,In fact, each line is contributednby a different person,at a different time.,I think that the "now tied up, tied down,,mistress cruel approaches me,nnow tied down, it's up.",It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,,if you come home, and your spouse,nor whoever it is,,says, "Let's talk" --,That, like, chills you to the very core. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's peripheral activities like these,that allow people to get together,ndoing fun things.,They actually get to know each other,,and it's sort of like low-thresholdnperipheral activities,that I think are the key to bringing up,some of our bonding social capitalnthat we're lacking.,And very, very quickly --nI love puppets.,Here's a puppet.,It dances to music.,Lotte Reiniger, an amazingnshadow puppeteer in the 20s,,that started doing more elaborate things.,I became interested in puppets,,and I just want to shownone last thing to you.,Oh, this is how you make puppets. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Ladiesnand gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank. 
 (Applause)If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.,And that's not a joke, we really do.,So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster. 
 So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp,a few years ago because they make sound.,This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp,that's found off the coast of California.,And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,,it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.,And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,,or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.,And mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises,,which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,,well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,,to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.,And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,,work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell. 
 So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:,there are spearers and smashers.,And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.,And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.,So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,,this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --,recorded at 1,000 frames a second,,played back at 15 frames per second.,And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,,exploding upward to actually just catch,a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.,Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,,and these guys open up snails for a living.,And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I'll play it one more time.,He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.,And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.,So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,,or it can smash with the heel.,And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike. 
 And so the first question that came to mind was,,well, how fast does this limb move?,Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.,And I immediately came upon a problem.,Every single high-speed video system in the biology department,at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.,We simply couldn't capture it on video.,And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.,And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,,looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.,And so we struck up a deal.,I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system,that could capture these movements,,you guys can film us collecting the data.",And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter),So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology --,it just came out about a year ago --,that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.,And low light is a critical issue with filming animals,,because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter) 
 So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,,and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.,And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.,And the snail's wired to a stick,,so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah. 
 (Laughter) 
 I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,,and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.,And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast,slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.,The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards --,just a spectacular movement.,And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,,and we measured how fast the limb was moving,to get back to that original question.,And we were in for our first surprise.,So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving,at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second,all the way up to 23 meters per second.,And for those of you who prefer miles per hour,,that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.,In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point,on the extreme animal movement spectrum.,And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike,of any animal system. So our first surprise. 
 (Applause) 
 So that was really cool and very unexpected.,So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?,And actually, this work was done in the 1960s,by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.,And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use,what's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism.",And what this basically consists of is a large muscle,that takes a good long time to contract,,and a latch that prevents anything from moving.,So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.,And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up --,the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.,And that's basically what's called a "power amplification system.",It takes a long time for the muscle to contract,,and a very short time for the limb to fly out.,And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.,This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes. 
 But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.,And if any of you ever have a chance,,backstage of the National Museum of Natural History,is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what -- 
 (Laughter) 
 this is serious business for me. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,,whether it's a spearer or a smasher,,is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure,right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.,It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.,It's a very beautiful structure.,And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas,suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.,And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.,And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show,is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.,There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism,in order to generate the amount of force that we observe,,and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.,So we thought, OK, this must be a spring --,the saddle could very well be a spring.,And we went back to those high-speed videos again,,and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.,And I'll just do that one more time.,And then if you take a look at the video --,it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.,The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it,extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.,So, we've had very solid evidence showing,that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,,and does, in fact, function as a spring. 
 The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a "hyperbolic paraboloid surface,",or an "anticlastic surface.",And this is very well known to engineers and architects,,because it's a very strong surface in compression.,It has curves in two directions,,one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,,so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces,over the surface of this type of shape.,So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.,It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,,because it requires very little material,to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.,So if you're going to build a thin gold structure,,it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong. 
 Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects,is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.,And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built,that's 87 and a half feet spanwise.,It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.,And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --,he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure,that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.,And all of these are the same principles that apply,to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.,In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot,of extra material requirements for building it.,So, very interesting parallels between the biological,and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out --,the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first,described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.,That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting. 
 So the next and final question was, well, how much force,does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?,And so I wired up what's called a load cell.,A load cell measures forces, and this is actually,a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.,And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change,and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in.,So these animals are wonderfully aggressive,,and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do,was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,,and they'd smash away at it.,And so this is just a regular video of the animal,just smashing the heck out of this load cell.,And we were able to get some force measurements out.,And again, we were in for a surprise. 
 I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,,no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.,And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.,So these are actually some old data,where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,,and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds,generated by an animal about this big.,And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell,up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating,well over 200 pounds of force.,And again, I think this will be a world record.,I have to do a little bit more background reading,,but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced,by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces.,And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring,in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.,But that was not the end of the story. 
 Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.,And I got all these force measurements,,and then I went and looked at the force output of the system.,And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis,and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.,And that was what really got me puzzled.,The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.,But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,,and I didn't know what that was.,So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,,but not half a millisecond later.,Again, going back to those high-speed videos,,there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.,Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.,There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel,,and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.,And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,,on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.,And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light. 
 Audience: Wow. 
 Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there,at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.,And what that is, is cavitation.,And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon,which occurs when you have areas of water,moving at extremely different speeds.,And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,,which results in the water literally vaporizing.,And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,,and it's a very destructive process.,And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation,where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,,because it destroys boat propellers.,People have been struggling for years to try and design,a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate,and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,,just like these pictures show. 
 So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,,I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.,This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give,full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,,because I could never have done this in a million years --,one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.,You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,,and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.,So really, just an amazing image,,slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.,And again, we can see it in slightly different form there,,with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.,In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. 
 So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:,what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually,the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually,the collapse of the cavitation bubble.,And these animals may very well be making use of,not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,,but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be,making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.,So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals. 
 So, one question I often get after this talk --,so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?,Because obviously, if it's breaking snails,,the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.,That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,,and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away,their heel all the way to the flesh.,But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod,is that you have to molt. And every three months or so,these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.,Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem. 
 So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note. 
 (Laughter) 
 Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring --,has actually been well known to biologists for a long time,,not as a spring but as a visual signal.,And there's actually a spectacular colored dot,in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.,And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins,of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.,And I think one explanation for this could be,going back to the molting phenomenon. 
 So these animals go into a molting period where they're,unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft.,And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.,This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period,when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,,and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.,And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,,they just signal. They wave their legs around.,And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.,It's a well-established fact of these animals,that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.,And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots,in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information,about their ability to strike, or their strike force,,and something about the time period in the molting cycle.,So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure,right in the middle of their spring. 
 So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,,Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.,And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,,which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,,and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just,for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions,that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try,to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking,about with happiness is, what gives happiness --,or happiness, which I equate with joy in my,particular area, and I think there's something very,fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And,it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we,go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's,something about these things where our,expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing,way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected,twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and,you find a joyful experience. You look at those,sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what,you'd expect. And there's something joyful about,it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all,these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try,and do in my lecture is go a little bit further,and see if I can violate your expectations in a,pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that,are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try,to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,,so I can make the audience here happy. 
 So I'm going to show you some ways that we can,violate your expectations. First of all, I want to,show you the particular illusion here. I want you,first of all when it pops up on the screen to,notice that the two holes are perpendicular to,each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These,are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now,I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped,the film here so you can get a very interesting,experience. I want you to see how this illusion is,constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see,that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates,back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.,Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very,bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it,from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's,true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does,that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do,it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop,it from happening. No. It's difficult. 
 And we can violate your expectations in a whole,variety of ways about representation, about shape,,about color and so forth and it's very primal. And,it's an interesting question to ponder, why these,things -- we find these things joyful. Why would,we find them joyful? So, here's something that,Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of,little things like this. 
 Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what,you would see. In other words, it's not a camera,cut. It's a perceptual trick.,OK. We can violate your expectations about,shape.,We can violate your expectations on representation,-- what an image represents. What do you see here?,How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand,if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised,their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,,go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the,best example of priming by experience that I know.,If you are a child under the age of 10 who,haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this,image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults,here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?",But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground --,in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to,ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll,see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,,if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also,tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on,experience. 
 Now, something like this can be used because this,is after all talk about design, too. This was,done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got,away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at,this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of,provocative positions. But they got it passed, and,actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do,these things.,Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did,when the Florida ballot was going around. You,know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for,Bush; count 'em again ... 
 You can violate your expectations about,experience. Here is an outside water fountain that,I created with some friends of mine, but you can,stop the water in drops and -- actually make all,the drops levitate. This is something we're,building for, you know, amusement parks and that,kind of stuff.,Now let's take a static image. Can you see this?,Do you see the middle section moving down and the,outer sections moving up? It's completely static.,It's a static image. How many people see this,illusion? It's completely static.,Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we,look at an image we see, you know, color, depth,,texture. And you can look at this whole scene and,analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than,the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is,actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.,And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people,got irritated when they tried to talk to the,woman and she wouldn't respond. 
 Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this,building in New York. So that when you see it from,this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,,and when you walk around to the other side it,looks like the balconies go down. So there are,cases where you have mistakes in design that,incorporate illusions.,Or, you take this particular un-retouched,photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot,of emails from people who say, "Is there any,perceptual difference between males and females?",And I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate,through the world just as well as males can -- and,why wouldn't they? However, this is the one,illusion that women can consistently do better,than males: in matching which head because they,rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat. 
 Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show,design in illusions. I believe that the first,example of illusions being used purposely was by,da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So,that when you saw from one little angle was like,this. And this little technique got popular in the,16th century and the 17th century to disguise,hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and,see it from one little point of view like this.,But these are early incorporations of illusions,brought to -- sort of high point with Hans,Holbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked,for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you,could walk down from the stair and you can see,this hidden skull. 
 All right, now I'm going to show you some,designers who work with illusions to give that,element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott,Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions,for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one,here on TED and happiness.,OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is,going to be a delightful talk and he has some of,his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we,-- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur,Ganson. 
 Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that,was appropriate here.,And figure goes to ground.,And for the musicians.,And of course, since happiness -- we want "joy to the,world.",Now, another great designer -- he's very well,known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just,builds some fantastic things. This is simply,amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view,it from one particular angle, you see its,reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.,Pianist transforms to violinist.,This is really wild. This assemblage of forks,,knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded,together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn,something in the sort of thing that I do, which,is there are people out there with a lot of time,on their hands. 
 Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like,creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells --,un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging,them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after,all, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with,the universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched,keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John,Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil,cabinets. 
 Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running,[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've,created, some new type of illusions. I've done,something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So,you see these kids the same size here, running,down the hall. The two table tops of the same size.,They're looking out two directions at once. You,have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And,that's something for you to think about, all,right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within,smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which,is impossible. You can see the two kids are,looking out simultaneously out of two different,directions at once. Now can you believe these two,table tops are the same size and shape? They are.,So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,,those two figures are identical in size and shape.,And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort,of rendered fashion, how much stronger the,illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought,you a little joy and happiness, and if you're,interested in seeing more cool effects, see me,outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.(Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you! 
 (Applause continues) 
 Thank you very much.,Like the speaker before me --nI am a TED virgin, I guess.,I'm also the first time here, and ... 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know what to say! 
 (Applause) 
 I'm really happynthat Mr. Anderson invited me.,I'm really grateful that I get a chancento play for everyone.,And the song that I just playednwas by Josef Hofmann.,It's called "Kaleidoscope.",And Hofmann is a Polish pianistnand composer of the late 19th century,,and he's widely considerednone of the greatest pianists of all time. 
 I have another piecenthat I'd like to play for you.,It's called "Abegg Variations,"nby Robert Schumann,,a German 19th-century composer.,The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G,,and that's the main theme in the melody.,(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G),That comes from the last namenof one of Schumann's female friends. 
 (Laughter) 
 But he wrote that for his wife. 
 (Laughter) 
 So actually, if you listen carefully,,there are supposed to benfive variations on this Abegg theme.,It's written around 1834,,so even though it's old,nI hope you'll like it. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 Now comes the part that I hate.,Well, because Mr. Anderson told me,that this session is calledn"Sync and Flow,",I was wondering, "What do I knownthat these geniuses don't?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I'll talk about musical composition,,even though I don't know where to start. 
 How do I compose?,I think Yamaha does a really good jobnof teaching us how to compose.,What I do first is, I make a lotnof little musical ideas,you can just improvisenhere at the piano --,and I choose one of thosento become my main theme, my main melody,,like the Abegg that you just heard.,And once I choose my main theme,nI have to decide:,Out of all the styles in music,nwhat kind of style do I want?,And this year,nI composed a Romantic style.,So for inspiration,nI listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky,and all the great Romantic composers. 
 Next, I make the structurenof the entire piece with my teachers.,They help me plan out the whole piece.,And then the hard partnis filling it in with musical ideas,,because then you have to think. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then, when the piecentakes somewhat of a solified form --,solidified, excuse me -- solidified form,,you're supposed to actuallynpolish the piece, polish the details,,and then polish the overallnperformance of the composition. 
 And another thingnthat I enjoy doing is drawing.,Drawing, because I like to draw,nyou know, Japanese anime art.,I think that's a crazenamong teens right now.,And once I realized it,,there's a parallel between creatingnmusic and creating art,,because for your motive, or yournlittle initial idea for your drawing,,it's your character -- you wantnto decide who you want to draw,,or if you want to drawnan original character.,And then you want to decide:nHow are you going to draw the character?,Like, am I going to use one page?nAm I going to draw it on the computer?,Am I going to use a two-page spreadnlike a comic book?,For a more grandiose effect, I guess.,And then you have to donthe initial sketch of the character,,which is like your structure of a piece,,and then you add pen and pencil,nand whatever details that you need --,that's polishing the drawing. 
 And another thing that both of thesenhave in common is your state of mind,,because I know I'm one of those teenagersnthat are really easily distracted.,So if I'm trying to do homeworknand I don't feel like it,,I'll try to draw or,nyou know, waste my time.,And then what happens is,nsometimes I absolutely can't draw,or I can't compose at all,,and then it's likenthere's too much on your mind.,You can't focusnon what you're supposed to do.,And sometimes, if you manage to usenyour time wisely and work on it,,you'll get something out of it,nbut it doesn't come naturally. 
 What happens is,nif something magical happens,,if something natural happens to you,,you're able to producenall this beautiful stuff instantly,,and then that's what I consider "flow,",because that's when everything clicksnand you're able to do anything.,You feel like you're on top of your gamenand you can do anything you want. 
 I'm not going to playnmy own composition today because,,although I did finish it,nit's way too long.,Instead, I'd like to try somethingncalled "improvisation.",I have here seven note cards,,one with each notenof the musical alphabet.,And I'd like someone to come up herenand choose five --,anyone to come up here and choose five --,and then I can make itninto some sort of melody,,and I'll improvise it.,Wow. A volunteer, yay! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you. 
 Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five? 
 JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards. 
 GH: OK, one.nJL: OK. 
 GH: Two.nJL: Yes. 
 GH: Three. 
 GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar. 
 (Laughter) 
 JL: One more.nGH: OK. "E" for "effort." 
 JL: Would you mind reading them outnin the order that you chose them? 
 GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E. 
 JL: Thank you very much! 
 GH: You're welcome. And what about these? 
 JL: I won't use them. Thank you! 
 (Applause) 
 Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.,I'm going to try to put thatnin some sort of order. 
 (Plays notes) 
 OK, that's nice.,So, I'm going to have a moment to think,,and I'll try to make something out of it. 
 (Plays the five notes) 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 The next song, or the encorenthat I'm going to play,is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina. 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause)I think I was supposednto talk about my new book,,which is called "Blink,",and it's about snap judgmentsnand first impressions.,And it comes out in January,nand I hope you all buy it in triplicate. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I was thinking about this,,and I realized that althoughnmy new book makes me happy,,and I think would make my mother happy,,it's not really about happiness.,So I decided instead,nI would talk about someone,who I think has done as muchnto make Americans happy,as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,,a man who is a greatnpersonal hero of mine:,someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,,who is most famousnfor reinventing spaghetti sauce. 
 Howard's about this high, and he's round,,and he's in his 60s,nand he has big huge glasses,and thinning gray hair,,and he has a kind of wonderfulnexuberance and vitality,,and he has a parrot,nand he loves the opera,,and he's a great aficionadonof medieval history.,And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.,Now, I should tell you that I have no ideanwhat psychophysics is,,although at some point in my life,,I dated a girl for two years,who was gettingnher doctorate in psychophysics.,Which should tell you somethingnabout that relationship. 
 (Laughter) 
 As far as I know, psychophysicsnis about measuring things.,And Howard is very interestednin measuring things.,And he graduatednwith his doctorate from Harvard,,and he set up a little consulting shopnin White Plains, New York.,And one of his first clients was Pepsi.,This is many years ago,nback in the early 70s.,And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,,"You know, there's this newnthing called aspartame,,and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.,We'd like you to figure out,how much aspartame we should putnin each can of Diet Pepsi,in order to have the perfect drink.",Now that sounds like an incrediblynstraightforward question to answer,,and that's what Howard thought.,Because Pepsi told him,,"We're working with a bandnbetween eight and 12 percent.,Anything below eight percentnsweetness is not sweet enough;,anything above 12 percentnsweetness is too sweet.,We want to know: what's the sweetnspot between 8 and 12?",Now, if I gave you this problem to do,nyou would all say, it's very simple.,What we do is you make upna big experimental batch of Pepsi,,at every degree of sweetness --neight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,,all the way up to 12 --,and we try this outnwith thousands of people,,and we plot the results on a curve,,and we take the most popularnconcentration, right?,Really simple. 
 Howard does the experiment,nand he gets the data back,,and he plots it on a curve,,and all of a sudden he realizesnit's not a nice bell curve.,In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.,It's a mess. It's all over the place.,Now, most people in that business,nin the world of testing food and such,,are not dismayednwhen the data comes back a mess.,They think, "Well, you know,,figuring out what people thinknabout cola's not that easy.","You know, maybe we made an errornsomewhere along the way.","You know, let's justnmake an educated guess,",and they simply pointnand they go for 10 percent,,right in the middle.,Howard is not so easily placated.,Howard is a man of a certain degreenof intellectual standards.,And this was not good enough for him,,and this question bedeviled him for years.,And he would think it throughnand say, "What was wrong?,Why could we not make sensenof this experiment with Diet Pepsi?" 
 And one day, he was sittingnin a diner in White Plains,,about to go trying to dream upnsome work for Nescafé.,And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning,nthe answer came to him.,And that is, that when they analyzednthe Diet Pepsi data,,they were asking the wrong question.,They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,,and they should have beennlooking for the perfect Pepsis.,Trust me.,This was an enormous revelation.,This was one of the most brilliantnbreakthroughs in all of food science.,Howard immediately went on the road,,and he would go to conferencesnaround the country,,and he would stand up and say,,"You had been lookingnfor the perfect Pepsi.,You're wrong.,You should be lookingnfor the perfect Pepsis.",And people would look at himnblankly and say,,"What are you talking about? Craziness.",And they would say, "Move! Next!",Tried to get business,nnobody would hire him --,he was obsessed, though,,and he talked about itnand talked about it.,Howard loves the Yiddish expression,"To a worm in horseradish,nthe world is horseradish.",This was his horseradish. 
 (Laughter) 
 He was obsessed with it! 
 And finally, he had a breakthrough.,Vlasic Pickles came to him,,and they said, "Doctor Moskowitz,nwe want to make the perfect pickle.",And he said,,"There is no perfect pickle;nthere are only perfect pickles.",And he came back to them and he said,,"You don't just neednto improve your regular;,you need to create zesty.",And that's where we got zesty pickles.,Then the next person came to him:nCampbell's Soup.,And this was even more important. 
 In fact, Campbell's Soupnis where Howard made his reputation.,Campbell's made Prego,,and Prego, in the early 80s,nwas struggling next to Ragù,,which was the dominantnspaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.,In the industry -- I don'tnknow whether you care about this,,or how much time I have to go into this.,But it was, technically speakingn-- this is an aside --,Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.,The quality of the tomato pastenis much better;,the spice mix is far superior;,it adheres to the pastanin a much more pleasing way.,In fact, they would donthe famous bowl test,back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.,You'd have a plate of spaghetti,nand you would pour it on, right?,And the Ragù would all go to the bottom,nand the Prego would sit on top.,That's called "adherence.",And, anyway, despite the factnthat they were far superior in adherence,,and the quality of their tomato paste,,Prego was struggling. 
 So they came to Howard,nand they said, fix us.,And Howard lookednat their product line, and he said,,what you have is a dead tomato society.,So he said, this is what I want to do.,And he got togethernwith the Campbell's soup kitchen,,and he made 45 varietiesnof spaghetti sauce.,And he varied them accordingnto every conceivable way,that you can vary tomato sauce:,by sweetness, by level of garlic,,by tomatoey-ness,nby tartness, by sourness,,by visible solids --,my favorite termnin the spaghetti sauce business. 
 (Laughter) 
 Every conceivable waynyou can vary spaghetti sauce,,he varied spaghetti sauce.,And then he took this whole raftnof 45 spaghetti sauces,,and he went on the road.,He went to New York, to Chicago,,he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.,And he brought in peoplenby the truckload into big halls.,And he sat them down for two hours,,and over the course of that two hours,nhe gave them ten bowls.,Ten small bowls of pasta,,with a different spaghettinsauce on each one.,And after they ate each bowl,nthey had to rate, from 0 to 100,,how good they thoughtnthe spaghetti sauce was. 
 At the end of that process,nafter doing it for months and months,,he had a mountain of data,about how the American peoplenfeel about spaghetti sauce.,And then he analyzed the data.,Did he look for the most popularnvariety of spaghetti sauce?,No! Howard doesn't believenthat there is such a thing.,Instead, he lookednat the data, and he said,,let's see if we can group all thesendifferent data points into clusters.,Let's see if they congregatenaround certain ideas.,And sure enough, if you sit down,,and you analyze all this datanon spaghetti sauce,,you realize that all Americansnfall into one of three groups.,There are peoplenwho like their spaghetti sauce plain;,there are peoplenwho like their spaghetti sauce spicy;,and there are peoplenwho like it extra chunky. 
 And of those three facts,nthe third one was the most significant,,because at the time, in the early 1980s,,if you went to a supermarket,,you would not findnextra-chunky spaghetti sauce.,And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,,"You're telling menthat one third of Americans,crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce,and yet no one is servicing their needs?",And he said "Yes!" 
 (Laughter) 
 And Prego then went back,,and completely reformulatedntheir spaghetti sauce,,and came out with a line of extra chunkynthat immediately and completely,took over the spaghetti saucenbusiness in this country.,And over the next 10 years,nthey made 600 million dollars,off their line of extra-chunky sauces. 
 Everyone else in the industry lookednat what Howard had done, and they said,,"Oh my god! We've beennthinking all wrong!",And that's when you started to getnseven different kinds of vinegar,,and 14 different kinds of mustard,nand 71 different kinds of olive oil.,And then eventuallyneven Ragù hired Howard,,and Howard did the exact same thingnfor Ragù that he did for Prego.,And today, if you gonto a really good supermarket,,do you know how many Ragùs there are?,36!,In six varieties:,Cheese, Light,,Robusto, Rich & Hearty,,Old World Traditional --,Extra-Chunky Garden. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's Howard's doing.,That is Howard's giftnto the American people. 
 Now why is that important? 
 (Laughter) 
 It is, in fact, enormously important.,I'll explain to you why.,What Howard did is he fundamentallynchanged the way the food industry thinks,about making you happy.,Assumption number onenin the food industry used to be,that the way to find outnwhat people want to eat,,what will make people happy,nis to ask them.,And for years and years and years,,Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,,and they would sit you down,nand they would say,,"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?,Tell us what you wantnin a spaghetti sauce.",And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --,through all those focus group sessions,,no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.,Even though at least a third of them,ndeep in their hearts, actually did. 
 (Laughter) 
 People don't know what they want!,As Howard loves to say,,"The mind knows notnwhat the tongue wants.",It's a mystery! 
 (Laughter) 
 And a critically important step,in understandingnour own desires and tastes,is to realize that we cannot alwaysnexplain what we want, deep down.,If I asked all of you, for example,nin this room, what you want in a coffee,,you know what you'd say?,Every one of you would say,n"I want a dark, rich, hearty roast.",It's what people always saynwhen you ask them.,"What do you like?"n"Dark, rich, hearty roast!",What percentage of you actuallynlike a dark, rich, hearty roast?,According to Howard, somewherenbetween 25 and 27 percent of you.,Most of you like milky, weak coffee. 
 (Laughter) 
 But you will never, ever saynto someone who asks you what you want,that "I want a milky, weak coffee." 
 So that's number one thingnthat Howard did.,Number two thing that Howard didnis he made us realize --,it's another very critical point --,he made us realize the importance,of what he likes to calln"horizontal segmentation.",Why is this critical?,Because this is the way the food industrynthought before Howard.,What were they obsessed withnin the early 80s?,They were obsessed with mustard.,In particular, they were obsessednwith the story of Grey Poupon.,Used to be, there were two mustards:nFrench's and Gulden's.,What were they? Yellow mustard.,What's in it?,Yellow mustard seeds,nturmeric, and paprika.,That was mustard.,Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.,Right?,Much more volatile brown mustard seed,nsome white wine, a nose hit,,much more delicate aromatics.,And what do they do?,They put it in a little tiny glass jar,nwith a wonderful enameled label on it,,made it look French,,even though it's madenin Oxnard, California. 
 (Laughter) 
 And instead of charging a dollar fiftynfor the eight-ounce bottle,,the way that French's and Gulden's did,,they decided to charge four dollars.,And they had those ads.,With the guy in the Rolls Royce,neating the Grey Poupon.,Another pulls up, and says,n"Do you have any Grey Poupon?",And the whole thing, after they did that,nGrey Poupon takes off!,Takes over the mustard business! 
 And everyone's take-home lesson from that,was that the way to make people happy,is to give them somethingnthat is more expensive,,something to aspire to.,It's to make them turn their backnon what they think they like now,,and reach out for somethingnhigher up the mustard hierarchy. 
 (Laughter) 
 A better mustard!nA more expensive mustard!,A mustard of more sophisticationnand culture and meaning.,And Howard looked to thatnand said, "That's wrong!",Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.,Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce,non a horizontal plane.,There is no good mustard or bad mustard.,There is no perfect mustardnor imperfect mustard.,There are only different kinds of mustardsnthat suit different kinds of people.,He fundamentally democratizednthe way we think about taste.,And for that, as well, we owenHoward Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. 
 Third thing that Howard did,nand perhaps the most important,,is Howard confronted the notionnof the Platonic dish. 
 (Laughter) 
 What do I mean by that? 
 (Laughter) 
 For the longest time in the food industry,,there was a sense that there was one way,,a perfect way, to make a dish.,You go to Chez Panisse,,they give you the red-tail sashiminwith roasted pumpkin seeds,in a something something reduction.,They don't give you five optionsnon the reduction.,They don't say, "Do you wantnthe extra-chunky reduction, or ...?",No!,You just get the reduction. Why?,Because the chef at Chez Panisse,has a Platonic notionnabout red-tail sashimi.,"This is the way it ought to be.",And she serves it that wayntime and time again,,and if you quarrel with her, she will say,,"You know what? You're wrong!,This is the best way it ought to benin this restaurant." 
 Now that same idea fuelednthe commercial food industry as well.,They had a Platonic notionnof what tomato sauce was.,And where did that come from?nIt came from Italy.,Italian tomato sauce is what?,It's blended; it's thin.,The culture of tomato sauce was thin.,When we talked about "authenticntomato sauce" in the 1970s,,we talked about Italian tomato sauce,,we talked about the earliest Ragùs,,which had no visible solids, right?,Which were thin, you just put a little bit,and it sunk down to the bottomnof the pasta.,That's what it was.,And why were we attached to that?,Because we thoughtnthat what it took to make people happy,was to provide them with the mostnculturally authentic tomato sauce, A.,And B, we thought that if we gave themnthe culturally authentic tomato sauce,,then they would embrace it.,And that's what would pleasenthe maximum number of people. 
 In other words,,people in the cooking worldnwere looking for cooking universals.,They were looking for one waynto treat all of us.,And it's good reason for themnto be obsessed,with the idea of universals,,because all of science,,through the 19th centurynand much of the 20th,,was obsessed with universals.,Psychologists, medical scientists,neconomists,were all interestednin finding out the rules,that govern the way all of us behave.,But that changed, right?,What is the great revolutionnin science of the last 10, 15 years?,It is the movementnfrom the search for universals,to the understanding of variability.,Now in medical science,nwe don't want to know, necessarily,,just how cancer works,,we want to know how your cancernis different from my cancer.,I guess my cancer differentnfrom your cancer.,Genetics has opened the doornto the study of human variability.,What Howard Moskowitznwas doing was saying,,"This same revolution needs to happennin the world of tomato sauce.",And for that, we owe himna great vote of thanks. 
 I'll give you one lastnillustration of variability,,and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.,Howard not only believed that,nbut he took it a second step,,which was to say that when we pursuenuniversal principles in food,,we aren't just making an error;,we are actually doing ourselvesna massive disservice.,And the example he used was coffee.,And coffee is something he didna lot of work with, with Nescafé.,If I were to ask all of you to trynand come up with a brand of coffee --,a type of coffee, a brew --nthat made all of you happy,,and then I asked you to rate that coffee,,the average score in this room for coffeenwould be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.,If, however, you allowed mento break you into coffee clusters,,maybe three or four coffee clusters,,and I could make coffee justnfor each of those individual clusters,,your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.,The difference between coffeenat 60 and coffee at 78,is a difference between coffeenthat makes you wince,,and coffee that makes youndeliriously happy. 
 That is the final, and I thinknmost beautiful lesson,,of Howard Moskowitz:,that in embracing the diversitynof human beings,,we will find a surer waynto true happiness. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories,,only to find out that you're a performance artist. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm also a software engineer,,and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.,And I think the main thing that I'm interested in,is trying to find a way of,making the computer into a personal mode of expression.,And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,,and in a way those are my bane:,I think there's a great homogenizing force,that software imposes on people and limits the way they think,about what's possible on the computer.,Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible,,you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.,But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more,than what most people think, and my art has just been about,trying to find a personal way of using the computer,,and so I end up writing software to do that. 
 Chris has asked me to do a short performance,,and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes --,to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment,to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We've got about a minute left.,I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.,I did a performance with two singers,who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.,And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;,we repeated it in England.,And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them,with a large screen.,We used a computer vision tracking system,in order to know where they were.,And since we know where their heads are,,and we have a wireless mic on them,that we're processing the sound from,,we're able to create visualizations,which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.,This will take about 30 seconds or so.,He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound. 
 Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it. 
 Thanks very much. There's always lots more.,I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York,,you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,,and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.,And with that, I think I should give up the stage,,so, thank you so much."The Better Man." 
 I was the better at getting and keeping. 
 You were the better at spend and spend; 
 I was the better at grubbing and heaping, 
 But who was the better man in the end? 
 Yes, who was the better man, my friend? 
 You were the better with lords and ladies, 
 I was the better at pillaging Troy; 
 You were the better at kissing the babies, 
 I was the better at search and destroy. 
 But who was the better man, old boy? 
 Who was the better man? 
 I was the better at improvisation, 
 You were the better at spinning the plates; 
 I was the better at procrastination, 
 You were the better at quiet debate. 
 But who was the better man, old mate? 
 Who was the better man? 
 You were the better at rolling a reefer, 
 I was the better at coke and rum; 
 Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza? 
 The Maori twins,with the tattooed bum? 
 But who was the better man, old chum? 
 Who was the better man? 
 Now we come down to it, relatives grieving. 
 Out in the hall with their crocodile tears; 
 Now that you're out of it, now that you're leaving, 
 Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears, 
 What I've been meaning to tell you for years, 
 And years, and years, and years, old friend ... 
 Is that you were the better man, in the end; 
 You were the better man, 
 My friend. 
 (Applause) 
 I wrote this next poem for my mother.,Every one of us had a mother,,only one --,probably the most important person in your life,,if you're lucky enough to know them.,My mother was certainly the most important in mine.,Let me try and describe her to you.,She's 86 years old. She's frail.,White, platinum hair.,Why do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,,and make those helmets?,(Laughter),Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row.,Looks like a much prettier version,of Margaret Thatcher,,(Laughter),but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.,(Laughter),I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.,But my mother has lived by this creed,all her life. 
 "Never Go Back." 
 Never go back. Never go back. 
 Never return to the haunts of your youth. 
 Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 
 Memory holds all you need of the truth. 
 Never look back. Never look back. 
 Never succumb to the gorgon's stare. 
 Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 
 No-one is waiting and nothing is there. 
 Never go back. Never go back. 
 Never surrender the future you earned. 
 Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 
 Never return to the bridges you've burned. 
 Never look back. Never look back. 
 Never retreat to the 'glorious past.' 
 Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 
 Treat every day of your life as your last. 
 Never go back. Never go back. 
 Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair. 
 Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 
 No-one is waiting and nothing is there. 
 (Applause) 
 Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.,If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon,were tied end to end along a railroad track,,that would be me,,stoking the train,without a qualm in the world.,Ladies, don't do it.,Don't do it.,You think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.,Stop it.,Tell them to go to hell.,You bodies are wonderful as they are.,Just leave them alone. 
 "To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age." 
 Lady lady, do not weep. 
 What is gone is gone. Now sleep. 
 Turn your pillow. Dry your tears. 
 Count thy sheep and not thy years. 
 Nothing good can come of this. 
 Time rules all, my dearest. 
 'Tis but folly to be waging war 
 On one who never lost before. 
 Lady, this is all in vain. 
 Youth can never come again; 
 We have drunk the summer wine. 
 None can make a stitch in time. 
 Nip and tuck till crack of doom. 
 What is foretold in the womb 
 May not be foresworn with gold. 
 Nor may time be bought or sold. 
 Dearest, do I love thee less? 
 Do I shrink from thy caress? 
 Think you I could cease to care? 
 Never was there one so fair! 
 Lady lady, do not weep -- 
 What is gone is gone. Now sleep. 
 Lean against me, calm your fears, 
 Count thy blessings, not thy years. 
 (Applause) 
 America, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britain,ever has, or ever could have done.,I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.,Even when on its worst behavior,,I find myself automatically defending the USA,from the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles,playing their Greek card to Roman trumps.,America is an empire.,I hope you know that now.,All empires, by definition, are bumbling,,shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,,as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,,as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.,I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.,But it seems to be that the USA's sins,,compared to those of many previous empires,,are of a more moderate,,if more pervasive, kind.,Let me put this bluntly.,If Americans are so fat,,stupid and ignorant,,my dear friends from Birmingham,,how come they rule the world? 
 "Hail to the Gods of America." 
 Hail to the Gods of America! 
 Hail to the gods of the dream. 
 Invictus E Pluribus Unum. 
 But which of them reigns supreme? 
 Which is America's Jupiter? 
 The Brahmins of Capital Hill? 
 A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street? 
 They eye of a dollar bill? 
 Or is it celebrity status? 
 The worship of those we hate. 
 Or the cult of living forever, 
 If only we'd watch our weight. 
 What of the titans of media? 
 Or Hollywood's siren call? 
 What of the temples of justice, 
 Whose servants enslave us all? 
 What of the Brand and the Label? 
 What of the upstart Sport? 
 And what of the Constitution, 
 That bully of last resort? 
 Hail to the God of America, 
 Whose power the masses extol -- 
 Convenience rules America; 
 Convenience owns our soul. 
 Aye, that it does. 
 (Applause) 
 And if you would like to know why I am not a father --,I, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren --,the answer is in this poem,,which upsets me every time I read it. 
 "Love Came to Visit Me." 
 Love came to visit me,,shy as a fawn. 
 But finding me busy,,she fled, with the dawn. 
 At 20 the torch of resentment was lit. 
 My rage at injustice,waxed hot as the pits. 
 The flux of its lava cleared all in its path. 
 Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath. 
 Yet lovers grew wary, once novelty waned 
 To lie with a bloody man,,his terror unfeigned. 
 At 30 my powers seemed mighty to me. 
 The fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree. 
 By guile and by bluster,,by night and by day, 
 I battered and scattered the fools from my way. 
 And women grew willing to sham and to bluff. 
 Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough. 
 From 40 to 50, grown easy and sly, 
 I wined them and dined them, like pigs in a sty. 
 We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck, 
 Forgetting our peril, forgetting to duck, 
 Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives. 
 Grown sick to our stomachs,,and sick of our lives. 
 Love came to visit me,,shy as a fawn. 
 But finding me busy,,she fled with the dawn. 
 (Applause) 
 Um, there are --,I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun,in my businesses.,So poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.,A complete shock. I was a little ill.,Okay, I was ill.,Okay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.,I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.,I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.,So, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.,And from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.,And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.,That was in October of 2000. 
 I'm not an evil man.,But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.,I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,,who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.,But sometimes I try to put myself in that position.,(Laughter),Not with much success.,But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.,I love to think what they thought, what it was like. 
 Because although,many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,,although you guys can not only go to the moon,,you know, you're going to totally transform everything.,Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.,I don't know. You can do anything you want.,All you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all! 
 But human nature doesn't change, mate.,My friends, human nature is exactly the same as it was,when my ancestor --,probably it was my ancestor --,got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,,and battered the bastard to death.,You think we didn't do that?,Oh, we did.,We killed every single one of them.,Inch by inch we killed them.,We hunted them down wherever they were.,Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries.,We're still doing it,,with all of the genius assembled in this room.,Our natures haven't changed a single iota.,And they never will.,Even when we've got off this little planet,,and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets. 
 And I am as bad as you.,I spent eight years,running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.,And at seven o'clock every night,,I took me some more girls, already corrupted.,I never did anything to anyone that wasn't.,And I took crack cocaine,,every single night for seven years.,It was like Dante's "Inferno.",It was unbelievable.,One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection,for about four hours.,And you stay up for 12.,It was absolutely unbelievable.,Twenty-two godchildren I've got.,What do I say to them?,I only stopped because I thought if I got caught,,what would happen to my mother.,If you're a woman, remember that.,The love of your son,can utterly transform anything he does. 
 "Our Lady in White." 
 Pale she was, listless; 
 And soft to the touch. 
 A generous mistress Whom many loved much. 
 Shoulder to shoulder, Night after night, 
 We hoarded and sold her -- 
 Our Lady in White. 
 We breathed but to savor,her crystal caress. 
 We craved but to favor the hem of her dress. 
 We dabbled and babbled,,Denying our thirsts. 
 But always we scrabbled,to lie with her first. 
 Absent, we missed her,,grew haggard and limp. 
 Toyed with her sister,,or threatened her pimp. 
 Came word out of Babel, the lady returns! 
 And there on the table we took her, in turns. 
 Sensing the power that tyranny craves, 
 There in that hour, she made us her slaves. 
 Many there were, to covet her kiss. 
 My shame as a spur,,I fled the abyss. 
 But only just. 
 (Applause)You'll be happy to know thatnI'll be talking not about my own tragedy,,but other people's tragedy.,It's a lot easier to be lightheartednabout other people's tragedy,than your own,,and I want to keep itnin the spirit of the conference. 
 So, if you believe the media accounts,,being a drug dealer in the heightnof the crack cocaine epidemic,was a very glamorous life,nin the words of Virginia Postrel.,There was money,nthere was drugs, guns, women,,you know, you name it -- jewelry,nbling-bling -- it had it all. 
 What I'm going to tell you today is that,nin fact, based on 10 years of research,,a unique opportunitynto go inside a gang --,to see the actual books,nthe financial records of the gang --,that the answer turns out not to be,that being in the gangnwas a glamorous life.,But I think, more realistically,nthat being in a gang --,selling drugs for a gang -- is perhapsnthe worst job in all of America.,And that's what I'd likento convince you of today. 
 So there are three things I want to do.,First, I want to explainnhow and why crack cocaine,had such a profound influencenon inner-city gangs.,Secondly, I want to tell you,how somebody like mencame to be able to see,the inner workings of a gang --nan interesting story, I think.,And then third, I want to tell you,nin a very superficial way,,about some of the things we found,when we actually got to looknat the financial records,,the books, of the gang. 
 So before I do that, just one warning,,which is that this presentationnhas been rated 'R',by the Motion PicturenAssociation of America.,It contains adult themes, adult language.,Given who is up on the stage,nyou'll be delighted to know,that, in fact, there'll be no nudity -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside. 
 (Laughter) 
 So let me start by talkingnabout crack cocaine,,and how it transformed the gang.,To do that, you have to actually gonback to a time before crack cocaine,,in the early '80s, and look at itnfrom the perspective of a gang leader.,Being a gang leader in the inner citynwasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s --,the early '80s, let me say. 
 Now, you had a lot of power,nand you got to beat people up --,you got a lot of prestige,na lot of respect.,But the thing is,nthere was no money in it.,The gang had no way to make money.,You couldn't charge duesnto the people in the gang,,because the people in the gangndidn't have any money.,You couldn't really make any moneynselling marijuana --,marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.,You can't get rich selling marijuana.,You couldn't sell cocaine;,cocaine's a great product --npowdered cocaine --,but you've got to know rich white people.,And most of the inner-city gang membersndidn't know any rich white people,,so couldn't sell to that market.,You couldn't really donpetty crime, either.,Turns out, petty crime'sna terrible way to make a living. 
 As a result, as a gang leader,nyou had, you know, power --,it's a pretty good life --nbut the thing was, in the end,,you were living at home with your mother.,And so it wasn't really a career.,There were limits to how powerfulnand important you could be,if you had to live at homenwith your mother. 
 Then along comes crack cocaine.,And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,,crack cocaine was the extra-chunkynversion of tomato sauce,for the inner city. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because crack cocainenwas an unbelievable innovation.,I don't have time to talk about it today,nbut if you think about it,,I would say that in the last 25 years,,of every invention or innovationnthat's occurred in this country,,the biggest one in terms of impact,on the well-being of peoplenwho live in the inner city,,was crack cocaine.,And for the worse --nnot for the better, but for the worse.,It had a huge impact on life. 
 So what was it about crack cocaine?,It was a brilliant waynof getting the brain high.,Because you could smoke crack cocaine --nyou can't smoke powdered cocaine --,and smoking is a much more efficientnmechanism of delivering a high,than snorting it.,And it turned out there was this audiencenthat didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,,but when it came, it really did.,And it was a perfect drug;,you could buy the cocainenthat went into it for a dollar,,sell it for five dollars.,Highly addictive --nthe high was very short.,So for fifteen minutes,nyou get this great high,,and then when you come down,,all you want to do is get high again. 
 It created a wonderful market.,And for the people who were therenrunning the gang,,it was a great way, seemingly,nto make a lot of money.,At least for the people on the top. 
 So this is where we enter the picture.,Not really me -- I'm reallyna bit player in all this.,My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh,nis the main character.,He was a math major in collegenwho had a good heart,,and decided he wantednto get a sociology PhD,,came to the University of Chicago.,Now, the three monthsnbefore he came to Chicago,,he had spent following the Grateful Dead.,And in his own words,nhe "looked like a freak.",He's a South Asian --nvery dark-skinned South Asian.,Big man, and he had hair,nin his words, "down to his ass.",Defied all kinds of boundaries:,Was he black or white?nWas he man or woman?,He was really a curious sight to be seen. 
 So he showed upnat the University of Chicago,,and the famous sociologistnWilliam Julius Wilson,was doing a book that involvednsurveying people all across Chicago.,He took one look at Sudhir, who was goingnto go do some surveys for him,,and decided he knew exactlynthe place to send him,,which was to one of the toughest,nmost notorious housing projects,not just in Chicago,nbut in the entire United States. 
 So Sudhir, the suburban boy who had nevernreally been in the inner city,,dutifully took his clipboardnand walked down to this housing project,,gets to the first building.,The first building?nWell, there's nobody there.,But he hears some voicesnup in the stairwell,,so he climbs up the stairwell,ncomes around the corner,,and finds a group of youngnAfrican-American men playing dice. 
 This is about 1990,npeak of the crack epidemic.,This is a very dangerous job,nbeing in a gang.,You don't like to be surprised.,You don't like to be surprisednby people who come around the corner.,And the mantra was:nshoot first; ask questions later.,Now, Sudhir was lucky --nhe was such a freak,,and that clipboardnprobably saved his life,,because they figured no othernrival gang member,would be coming up to shootnat them with a clipboard. 
 (Laughter) 
 So his greeting was not particularlynwarm, but they did say,,well, OK -- let's hearnyour questions on your survey.,So -- I kid you not --,the first question on the surveynthat he was sent to ask was:,"How do you feel about beingnpoor and Black in America?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Makes you wonder about academics. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the choice of answers were: 
 [A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad] 
 (Laughter) 
 What Sudhir found out is, in fact,nthat the real answer was the following:,[A) Very Good B) Good C) BadnD) Very Bad E) Fuck you] 
 (Laughter) 
 The survey was not, in the end, goingnto be what got Sudhir off the hook.,He was held hostagenovernight in the stairwell.,There was a lot of gunfire,,there were a lot of philosophicalndiscussions he had with the gang members.,By morning, the gang leader arrived,,checked out Sudhir,ndecided he was no threat,,and they let him go home.,So Sudhir went home,ntook a shower, took a nap. 
 And you and I, probably, facednwith the situation, would think,,"I guess I'm going to writenmy dissertation on The Grateful Dead,,I've been following themnfor the last three months." 
 (Laughter) 
 Sudhir, on the other hand,,got right back, walkedndown to the housing project,,went up to the second floor,,and said: "Hey, guys, I had so much funnhanging out with you last night,,I wonder if I could do it again tonight.",And that was the beginning of what turnednout to be a beautiful relationship,that involved Sudhir living in the housingnproject on and off for 10 years,,hanging out in crack houses,ngoing to jail with the gang members,,having the windows shot out of his car,,having the police break into his apartmentnand steal his computer disks --,you name it.,But ultimately, the storynhas a happy ending for Sudhir,,who became one of the mostnrespected sociologists in the country.,And especially for me,,as I sat in my officenwith my Excel spreadsheet open,,waiting for Sudhir to come and delivernto me the latest load of data,that he would get from the gang. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was one of the most unequalnco-authoring relationships ever -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But I was glad to benthe beneficiary of it. 
 So what did we find?,What did we find in the gang?,Well, let me say one thing:,We really got accessnto everybody in the gang.,We got an inside look at the gang,nfrom the very bottom up to the very top.,They trusted Sudhir, in waysnthat really no academic has ever --,or really anybody, any outsider --nhas ever earned the trust of these gangs,,to the point where they actually opened up,what was most interestingnfor me -- their books,,the financial records they kept.,They made them available to us,nand we not only could study them,,but we could ask them questionsnabout what was in them. 
 So if I have to kind of summarizenvery quickly in the short time I have,what the bottom line of whatnI take away from the gang is,,it's that, if I had to drawna parallel between the gang,and any other organization,,it would be that the gangnis just like McDonald's,,in a lot of different respects --nthe restaurant McDonald's. 
 So first, in one way,,which isn't maybe the most interestingnway, but it's a good way to start --,is in the way it's organized,nthe hierarchy of the gang,,the way it looks.,So here's what the org chartnof the gang looks like.,I don't know if you know muchnabout org charts,,but if you were to assign a stripped-downnand simplified McDonald's org chart,,this is exactly what it would look like.,It's amazing, but the topnlevel of the gang,,they actually call themselvesnthe "Board of Directors." 
 (Laughter) 
 And Sudhir says,it's not like these guysnhad a very sophisticated view,of what happenednin American corporate life,,but they had seen moviesnlike "Wall Street,",and they had learned a little bitnabout what it was like,to be in the real world.,Now, below that board of directors,,you've got essentiallynwhat are regional VPs --,people who control, say, the South Sidenof Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago. 
 Sudhir got to know very well the guynwho had the unfortunate assignment,of trying to take the Iowa franchise,,which, it turned out, for this black gang,,was not one of the more brilliantnfinancial endeavors they undertook. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the thing that really makes the gangnseem like McDonald's is its franchisees.,The guys who are runningnthe local gangs --,the four-square-blocknby four-square-block areas --,they're just like the guys, in some sense,nwho are running the McDonald's.,They are the entrepreneurs.,They get the exclusive property rightsnto control the drug-selling.,They get the name of the gang behind them,nfor merchandising and marketing.,And they're the ones who basicallynmake the profit or lose a profit,,depending on how goodnthey are at running the business. 
 Now, the group I really want younto think about, though,,are the ones at the bottom --nthe foot soldiers.,These are the teenagers, typically,,who'd be standing out on the streetncorner, selling the drugs.,Extremely dangerous work.,And important to note is that almost allnof the weight, all of the people,in this organization are at the bottom --njust like McDonald's.,So in some sense, the foot soldiersnare a lot like the people,who are taking your order at McDonald's,,and it's not just by chancenthat they're like them.,In fact, in these neighborhoods,nthey'd be the same people.,So the same kids who are workingnin the gang were actually,,at the very same time,ntypically working part-time,at a place like McDonald's.,Which already foreshadowsnthe main result that I've talked about,,about what a crappy jobnit was, being in the gang.,Because obviously, if being in the gangnwere such a wonderful, lucrative job,,why in the world would these guysnmoonlight at McDonald's? 
 So what do the wages look like?nYou might be surprised.,But based on being able to talk to themnand to see their records,,this is what it looksnlike in terms of the wages.,The hourly wage the foot soldiersnwere earning was $3.50 an hour.,It was below the minimum wage.nAnd this is well-documented.,It's easy to see by the patternsnof consumption they have.,It really is not fiction -- it's fact.,There was very little money in the gang,nespecially at the bottom. 
 Now if you managed to rise up, say,nand be that local leader,,the guy who's the equivalentnof the McDonald's franchisee,,you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.,And that, in some ways,nwas the best job you could hope to get,if you were growing up in one of thesenneighborhoods as a young black male.,If you managed to rise to the very top,,200,000 or 400,000 dollars a yearnis what you'd hope to make.,Truly, you would be a great success story. 
 And one of the sad partsnof this is that, indeed,,among the many othernramifications of crack cocaine,is that the most talented individualsnin these communities --,this is what they were striving for.,They weren't trying to make itnin legitimate ways,,because there werenno legitimate channels out.,This was the best way out.,And it actually wasnthe right choice, probably,,to try to make it out this way. 
 You look at this,,the relationship to McDonald'snbreaks down here.,The money looks about the same.,Why is it such a bad job?,Well, the reason it's such a bad jobnis that there's somebody shooting at you,a lot of the time.,So, with shooting at you,nwhat are the death rates?,We found, in our gang --,and admittedly, this was not reallyna standard situation;,this was a time of intense violence,nof a lot of gang wars,,as this gang actuallynbecame quite successful.,But there were costs.,And so the death rate --,not to mention the rate of being arrested,nsent to prison, being wounded --,the death rate in our samplenwas seven percent per person per year.,You're in the gang for four years,,you expect to dienwith about a 25 percent likelihood.,That is about as high as you can get. 
 So for comparison's purposes,,let's think about some other walk of lifenyou may expect might be extremely risky.,Let's say that you were a murderer,and you were convicted of murder,nand you're sent to death row.,It turns out, the death rates on death rownfrom all causes, including execution:,two percent a year. 
 (Laughter) 
 So it's a lot safer being on death row,than it is selling drugsnout on the street. 
 That gives you some pause,nfor those of you who believe,that a death penalty's going to havenan enormous deterrent effect on crime.,To give you a sense of just how badnthe inner city was during crack --,and I'm not really focusingnon the negatives,,but really, there's another storynto tell you there --,if you look at the death ratesnjust of random, young black males,growing up in the inner citynin the United States,,the death rates during cracknwere about one percent.,That's extremely high.,And this is violent death --nit's unbelievable, in some sense. 
 To put it into perspective: if you comparenthis to the soldiers in Iraq,,for instance, right nownfighting the war: 0.5 percent.,So in some very literal way,,the young black men who werengrowing up in this country,were living in a war zone,,very much in the sense that the soldiersnover in Iraq are fighting in a war. 
 So why in the world, you might ask,,would anybody be willingnto stand out on a street corner,selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,,with a 25 percent chance of dyingnover the next four years?,Why would they do that?,And I think there are a couple answers. 
 I think the first onenis that they got fooled by history.,It used to be the gangnwas a rite of passage;,that the young people controlled the gang;,that as you got older,nyou dropped out of the gang.,So what happened was,,the people who happened to benin the right place at the right time --,the people who happened to be leadingnthe gang in the mid-to-late-'80s --,became very, very wealthy.,And so the logical thing to think,was that they are goingnto age out of the gang,like everybody else has,,and the next generation is goingnto take over and get the wealth. 
 There are striking similarities,nI think, to the Internet boom.,The first set of people in Silicon Valleyngot very, very rich.,And then all of my friends said,n"Maybe I should go do that, too.",And they were willing to work very cheapnfor stock options that never came.,In some sense,nthat's what happened, exactly,,to the set of people we were looking at.,They were willing to start at the bottom,,just like, say, a first-yearnlawyer at a law firm,is willing to start at the bottom,,work 80-hour weeksnfor not that much money,,because they thinknthey're going to make partner.,But the rules changed,nand they never got to make partner. 
 Indeed, the same people who were runningnall of the major gangs in the late 1980s,are still running the major gangsnin Chicago today.,They never passed on any of the wealth,,So everybody got stucknat that $3.50-an-hour job,,and it turned out to be a disaster. 
 The other thing the gang wasnvery good at was marketing and trickery.,And so for instance,none thing the gang would do is --,the gang leaders would havenbig entourages,,and they'd drive fancy carsnand have fancy jewelry.,So what Sudhir eventually realizednas he hung out with them more,,is that, really, they didn't ownnthose cars -- they just leased them,,because they couldn't affordnto own the fancy cars.,And they didn't really have gold jewelry,nthey had gold-plated jewelry.,It goes back to, you know,nthe real-real versus the fake-real. 
 And really, they did all sortsnof things to trick the young people,into thinking what a great dealnthe gang was going to be.,So for instance, they would givena 14-year-old kid,a whole roll of bills to hold.,That 14-year-old kidnwould say to his friends,,"Hey, look at all the moneynI got in the gang.",It wasn't his money -- until he spent it,,and then he was in debt to the gang,,and was sort of an indenturednservant for a while.,So I have a couple minutes. 
 Let me do one last thingnI hadn't thought I'd have time to do,,which is to talk about what we learnednmore generally about economics,,from the study of the gang. 
 So, economists tend to talknin technical words.,Often, our theories fail quite miserablynwhen we over the data,,but what's kind of interestingnis that in this setting,,it turned out thatnsome of the economic theories,that worked not so wellnin the real economy,worked very well in the drug economy,,in some sense, becausenit's unfettered capitalism.,Here's an economic principle.,This is one of the basic ideasnin labor economics,,called a "compensating differential.",It's the idea that the increment to wagesnthat a worker requires,to leave him indifferentnbetween performing two tasks,,one which is more unpleasantnthan the other.,Compensating differential -- it's whynwe think garbagemen might be paid more,than people who work in parks. 
 The words of one of the membersnof the gang, I think, make this clear.,So it turns out -- I'm sortnof getting ahead of myself --,it turns out, in the gang,nwhen there's a war going on,,they actually pay the foot soldiersntwice as much money.,It's exactly this concept.,Because they're not willing to be at risk.,And the words of a gang memberncapture it quite nicely, he says:,"Would you stand around here when allnthis shit ..." -- the shooting --,"... if all this shit'sngoing on? No, right?,So if I gonna be asked to put my lifenon the line, then front me the cash, man.",I think the gang member says itnmuch more articulately,than the economist, about what's going on. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's another one.,Economists talk about game theory,,that every two-person gamenhas a Nash equilibrium.,Here's the translationnyou get from the gang member.,They're talking about the decisionnof why they don't go shoot --,One thing that turns out to be a greatnbusiness tactic in the gang:,if you go and just shoot guns in the airnin the other gang's territory --,people are afraid to go buy drugs there,,they're going to comeninto your neighborhood. 
 Here's what he saysnabout why they don't do that:,"If we start shooting around there,nthe other gang's territory,,nobody, I mean, you dig it,nnobody gonna step on their turf.,But we gotta be careful,,'cause they can shoot around here toonand then we all fucked." 
 (Laughter) 
 So that's the same concept.,Then again, sometimesneconomists get it wrong.,One thing we observed in the datanis that it looked like --,the gang leader always got paid.,No matter how bad it was economically,nhe always got himself paid. 
 We had some theories related to cash flow,,and lack of access to capital markets,nand things like that.,Then we asked the gang member,,"Why is it you always get paidnand your workers don't always get paid?",His response is,,"You got all these niggers below younwho want your job, you dig?,If you start taking losses,nthey see you as weak and shit.",And I thought about it and said,,"CEOs often pay themselvesnmillion-dollar bonuses,,even when companiesnare losing a lot of money.,And it never would really occurnto an economist,that this idea of 'weak and shit'ncould really be important." 
 (Laughter) 
 Maybe "weak and shit" is an importantnhypothesis that needs more analysis. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)This machine, which we all have residing in our skulls,,reminds me of an aphorism, of a,comment of Woody Allen,to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.,And it's this machine.,And it's constructed for change. It's all about change.,It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today,,things today that we couldn't do yesterday.,And of course it's born stupid. 
 The last time you were in the presence of a baby --,this happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.,Isn't she fabulous?,(Laughter),But nonetheless when she popped out,despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing,in its development for several months before,on the basis of her experiences in the womb --,nonetheless she had very limited abilities,,as does every infant,at the time of normal, natural full-term birth.,If we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.,There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.,In fact there is little evidence that there is any,cognitive ability in a very young infant.,Infants don't respond to much.,There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.,(Laughter),And they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way,control their movements. 
 It would be several months before this infant,could do something as simple as reach out and grasp,under voluntary control an object and retrieve it,,usually to the mouth.,And it will be some months beforeward,,and we see a long steady progression,of the evolution from the first wiggles,,to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling,,standing, walking,,before we get to that magical point,in which we can motate in the world.,And yet, when we look forward in the brain,we see really remarkable advance.,By this age the brain can actually store.,It has stored, recorded,,can fastly retrieve,the meanings of thousands,,tens of thousands of objects,,actions, and their relationships in the world.,And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands,,potentially millions of ways.,By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.,And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.,This brain is very much a thinking machine.,And by this age there is absolutely no question,that this brain, it has a person on board.,And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.,And by this age we see a remarkable evolution,in its capacity to control movement. 
 Now movement has advanced to the point,where it can actually control movement simultaneously,,in a complex sequence, in complex ways,as would be required for example,for playing a complicated game,,like soccer.,Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.,And where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil,,about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.,You could go out into the community in Monterey,,and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.,And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.,(Laughter) 
 That's all another way of saying,that our individual skills and abilities,are very much shaped by our environments.,That environment extends into our contemporary culture,,the thing our brain is challenged with.,Because what we've done in our personal evolutions,is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities,that are specific to our own individual histories.,And in fact they result in a wonderful,differentiation in humankind,,in the way that, in fact, no two of us,are quite alike.,Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities,that all derive out of the plasticity,,the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.,In an adult brain of course we've built up,a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities,that we can perform more or less automatically from memory,,and that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures. 
 Now we study this,,as the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are,,by engaging the brains,of animals like rats, or monkeys,,or of this particularly curious creature --,one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth --,to engage them in learning new skills and abilities.,And we try to track the changes that occur,as the new skill or ability is acquired.,In fact we do this in individuals,of any age, in these different species --,that is to say from infancies,,infancy up to adulthood and old age.,So we might engage a rat, for example,,to acquire a new skill or ability,that might involve the rat using its paw,to master particular manual grasp behaviors,just like we might examine a child,and their ability to acquire the sub-skills,,or the general overall skill of accomplishing something,like mastering the ability to read.,Or you might look in an older individual,who has mastered a complex set of abilities,that might relate to reading musical notation,or performing the mechanical acts of performance,that apply to musical performance. 
 From these studies we defined two great epochs,of the plastic history of the brain.,The first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period.",And that is the period in which the brain is setting up,in its initial form its basic processing machinery.,This is actually a period of dramatic change,in which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive,the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.,All it takes for example in the sound domain,,is exposure to sound.,And the brain actually is at the mercy,of the sound environment in which it is reared.,So for example I can rear an animal,in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound,,a repertoire of sound that I make up,,that I make, just by exposure, artificially important,to the animal and its young brain.,And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up,its initial processing of that sound,in a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements,to represent it in an organized and orderly way.,The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal:,I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable,,like the sounds that simulate,the sounds of a native language of a child.,And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized --,specialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.,It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation,,in multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms. 
 Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound.,I can raise an animal under conditions,that would be equivalent to raising a baby,under a moderately loud ceiling fan,,in the presence of continuous noise.,And when I do that I actually specialize the brain,to be a master processor for that meaningless sound.,And I frustrate its ability,to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.,Such things in the early history of babies,occur in real babies.,And they account for, for example,the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor,in every normally developing baby.,And so they also account for,development of defective processing,in a substantial population of children,who are more limited, as a consequence,,in their language abilities at an older age. 
 Now in this early period of plasticity,the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.,I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.,The input doesn't really have to be meaningful.,I don't have to be in a behavioral context.,This is required so the brain sets up it's processing,so that it can act differentially,,so that it can act selectively,,so that the creature that wears it, that carries it,,can begin to operate on it in a selective way.,In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life,,the brain is actually refining its machinery,as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.,And in this epoch,,which extends from late in the first year of life to death;,it's actually doing this under behavioral control.,And that's another way of saying,the brain has strategies that define,the significance of the input to the brain.,And it's focusing on skill after skill,,or ability after ability,,under specific attentional control.,It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved,or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.,This is actually very powerful.,This lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change,,is powerfully expressed.,It is the basis of our real differentiation,,one individual from another.,You can look down in the brain of an animal,that's engaged in a specific skill,,and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels. 
 So here is a very simple experiment.,It was actually conducted about five years ago,in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence,in Marseilles.,It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained,in a task that involves it manipulating a tool,that's equivalent in its difficulty,to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.,The monkey actually mastered the task,in about 700 practice tries.,So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.,It had a success rate of about one in eight tries.,Those tries were elaborate.,Each attempt was substantially different from the other.,But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.,And 700 or so tries later,the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails.,He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.,At this point the task is being performed,in a beautifully stereotyped way:,very beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial. 
 We can look down in the brain of the monkey.,And we see that it's distorted.,We can track these changes, and have tracked these changes,in many such behaviors across time.,And here we see the distortion,reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.,Now this is a map, down in the surface of the brain,,in which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses,,location by location,,in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.,We see here a reconstruction of how,the hand is represented in the brain.,We've actually distorted the map by the exercise.,And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.,These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.,If we look at the selectivity of responses,in the cortex of the monkey,,we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics,which represents input from the skin,of the fingertips that are engaged.,In other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips,in this most organized of cortical areas,of the surface of the skin of the body.,Monkey has like you have.,And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.,The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.,And that is an unknown -- unsuspected, maybe, by you --,part of acquiring the skill or ability. 
 Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas,in the monkey learning this task.,And each one of them changes in ways that are specific,to the skill or ability.,So for example we can look to the cortical area,that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.,We look in cortical areas that control specific movements,,and the sequences of movements,that are required in the behavior, and so forth.,They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.,There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically,when you learn a simple skill like this.,And that represents in your brain, really massive change.,It represents the change in a reliable way,of the responses of tens of millions,,possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.,It represents changes,of hundreds of millions, possibly billions,of synaptic connections in your brain.,This is constructed by physical change.,And the level of construction that occurs is massive.,Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child,through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.,Or acquiring their native language abilities.,The changes are massive. 
 What it's all about is the selective representations,of things that are important to the brain.,Because in most of the life of the brain,this is under control of behavioral context.,It's what you pay attention to.,It's what's rewarding to you.,It's what the brain regards, itself,,as positive and important to you.,It's all about cortical processing,and forebrain specialization.,And that underlies your specialization.,That is why you, in your many skills and abilities,,are a unique specialist:,a specialist that's vastly different,in your physical brain in detail,than the brain of an individual 100 years ago;,enormously different in the details,from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.,Now, one of the characteristics of this change process,is that information is always related,to other inputs or information that is occurring,in immediate time, in context.,And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things,that are correlated in little moments of time,and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.,The brain is recording all information,and driving all change,in temporal context.,Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context,that's occurred in your brain is you.,Billions of events have occurred in your history,that are related in time to yourself,as the receiver,,or yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker,,yourself as the mover.,Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in,from the surface of your body,that are always associated with you as the receiver,,and that result in,the embodiment of you.,You are constructed, your self is constructed,from these billions of events.,It's constructed. It's created in your brain.,And it's created in the brain via physical change.,This is a marvelously constructed thing,that results in individual form,because each one of us has vastly different histories,,and vastly different experiences,,that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self,,of personhood. 
 Now we've used this research,to try to understand not just how a normal person develops,,and elaborates their skills and abilities,,but also try to understand,the origins of impairment,,and the origins of differences or variations,that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.,I'm going to talk about using these strategies,to actually design brain plasticity-based,approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child,that increases the competence of the child,as a language receiver and user,and, thereafter, as a reader.,And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve,actually using this brain science,,first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.,And then, by using it in a targeted approach,we're going to try to differentiate,the machinery to recover function in old age. 
 So the first example I'm going to talk about,relates to children with learning impairments.,We now have a large body of literature,that demonstrates that the fundamental,problem that occurs in the majority of children,that have early language impairments,,and that are going to struggle to learn to read,,is that their language processor,is created in a defective form.,And the reason that it rises in a defective form,is because early in the baby's brain's life,the machine process is noisy.,It's that simple.,It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?,And there are a lot of things that contribute to that.,There are numerous inherited faults,that could make the machine process noisier.,Now I might say the noise problem could also occur,on the basis of information provided,in the world from the ears. 
 If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know,that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate,was born with what we called mental retardation.,We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively;,we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities;,and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.,Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures.,That's disappeared. That no longer applies.,That inherited weakness, that inherited condition,has evaporated.,We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?,Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon,,about 35 years ago,,that if you simply fix the problem early enough,,when the brain is still in this initial plastic period,so it can set up this machinery adequately,,in this initial set up time in the critical period,,none of that happens.,What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?,You're basically opening up,the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears,,which have had them reliably full.,Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.,It's degraded.,The child's native language is such a case is not English.,It's not Japanese.,It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.,It's crap.,And the brain specializes for it.,It creates a representation of language crap.,And then the child is stuck with it. 
 Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.,It can also happen in the brain.,The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.,There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.,And the native language for a child with such a brain,is degraded.,It's not English. It's noisy English.,And that results in defective representations of sounds of words --,not normal -- a different strategy,,by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.,And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.,They are about an order of magnitude longer,,about 11 times longer in duration on average,,than in a normal child.,Space constants are about three times greater.,Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits,in this domain.,Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language,,they are receiving it and representing it,,and in information it's representing crap.,And they are going to have poor reading skills.,Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds,into this orthographic or visual,representational form.,If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds,that translation makes no sense.,And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology. 
 Then these children increasingly,in evaluation after evaluation,,in their operations in language, and their operations in reading --,we document that abnormal neurology.,The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.,A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine,the processing capacity of the machinery,by changing it.,Changing it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.,And we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.,Actually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.,And actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial. 
 So here we're looking at the normal distribution.,What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.,This is from about 3,000 children.,You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution,are moving into the middle or the right.,This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.,This is like an IQ test for language.,The impact in the distribution, if you trained every child,in the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right,and narrow the distribution.,This is a substantially large impact. 
 Think of a classroom of children in the language arts.,Think of the children on the slow side of the class.,We have the potential to move most of those children,to the middle or to the right side.,In addition to accurate language training,it also fixes memory and cognition,speech fluency and speech production.,And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training --,that is to say reading.,And to a large extent it fixes the brain.,You can look down in the brain of a child,in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford,,and MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.,And children operating in various language behaviors,,or in various reading behaviors,,you see for the most extent,,for most children, their neuronal responses,,complexly abnormal before you start,,are normalized by the training. 
 Now you can also take the same approach,to address problems in aging.,Where again the machinery is deteriorating now,from competent machinery, it's going south.,Noise is increasing in the brain.,And learning modulation and control is deteriorating.,And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual,and witness a change in the time constants and space constants,with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.,Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning,,it's going back into chaos in the end.,This results in declines in memory,in cognition, and in postural ability and agility.,It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual --,this is a small population of such individuals --,train equally intensively for about 30 hours.,These are 80- to 90-year-olds. 
 And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory,,of their ability to remember things after a delay,,of their ability to control their attention,,their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.,The overall neuropsychological index,of these trained individuals in this population,is about two standard deviations.,That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution,,and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities,,the average person has moved to the middle,or the right side of the distribution.,It means that most people who are at risk for senility,,more or less immediately,,are now in a protected position. 
 My issues are to try to get to rescuing,older citizens more completely and in larger numbers,,because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale --,and the same for kids.,My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.,I'm specifically interested in things like autism,,and cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.,And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism,,and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia. 
 Your issues as it relates to this science,,is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.,And of course, a well-ordered life,in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.,But also in your future is brain aerobics.,Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life,not too far in the future,,just like physical exercise,is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.,The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this,literature and the science that is important to you,is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.,Now that you know, now that science is telling us,that you are in charge,,that it's under your control,,that your happiness, your well-being,,your abilities, your capacities,,are capable of continuous modification,,continuous improvement,,and you're the responsible agent and party.,Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice.,It will be a long time before they really understand it.,(Laughter),Now that's another issue and not my fault.,Okay. Thank you.,(Applause)I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on,in the very fabric of the modern economy.,And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,,because in the beginning were commodities.,Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:,basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.,And then you extract them out of the ground,,and sell them on the open marketplace.,Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy,that lasted for millennia.,But then along came the industrial revolution,,and then goods became the predominant economic offering,,where we used commodities as a raw material,to be able to make or manufacture goods. 
 So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.,Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,,is that goods have become commoditized.,Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,,where people don't care who makes them.,They just care about three things and three things only:,price, price and price. 
 Now, there's an antidote to commoditization,,and that is customization.,My first book was called "Mass Customization" --,it came up a couple of times yesterday --,and how I discovered this progression of economic value,was realizing that customizing a good,automatically turned it into a service,,because it was done just for a particular person,,because it wasn't inventoried,,it was delivered on demand to that individual person. 
 So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.,But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that,services are being commoditized as well.,Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;,fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;,and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,,but services as well.,What that means is that it's time,to move to a new level of economic value.,Time to go beyond the goods and the services,,and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?,What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person --,that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?,Then you can't help but make them go "wow";,you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --,you can't help but turn it into an experience. 
 So we're shifting to an experience economy,,where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.,Now most places that I talk to,,when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney --,the world's premier experience-stager.,I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,,and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas --,the experience capital of the world.,But here, when you think about experiences,,think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.,Think about meaningful places.,Think about drinking wine,,about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.,Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.,The experience capital in the world of conferences.,All of these are experiences. 
 Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe,,and particularly in the Netherlands,,and whenever I talk about the experience economy there,,I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,,almost invariably.,And the question isn't really so much a question,as an accusation.,And the Dutch, when they usually put it,,it always starts with the same two words.,You know the words I mean?,You Americans.,They say, you Americans.,You like your fantasy environments,,your fake, your Disneyland experiences.,They say, we Dutch, we like real,,natural, authentic experiences.,So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,,which is: I point out that first of all,,you have to understand that there is no such thing,as an inauthentic experience.,Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.,It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.,So, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,,then every experience we have is authentic.,Now, there may be more or less natural or artificial,stimuli for the experience,,but even that is a matter of degree, not kind.,And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.,Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,,there is a company that manufactured the car,that delivered you to the edge of the woods;,there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have,to protect yourself from the ground of the woods.,There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have,in case you get lost in the woods.,Right? All of those are man-made,,artificiality brought into the woods by you,,and by the very nature of being there. 
 And then I always finish off,by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question,,particularly coming from the Dutch,,is that the Netherlands,is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.,(Laughter),And the Dutch, they always go ...,and they realize, I'm right!,There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country,that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,,or otherwise moved, modified and manicured,to look as if it had always been there.,It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.,(Laughter) 
 But nonetheless, not just the Dutch,,but everyone has this desire for the authentic.,And authenticity is therefore,becoming the new consumer sensibility --,the buying criteria by which consumers,are choosing who are they going to buy from,,and what they're going to buy.,Becoming the basis of the economy.,In fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,,that each one has their own business imperative,,matched with a consumer sensibility.,We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.,It's about supply and availability.,Getting the commodities to market. 
 With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs --,getting the costs down as low as possible,so we can offer them to the masses.,With the service economy, it is about,improving quality.,That has -- the whole quality movement has risen,with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years. 
 And now, with the experience economy,,it's about rendering authenticity.,Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering.",Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers --,as business people --,to percieve your offerings as authentic.,Because there is a basic paradox:,no one can have an inauthentic experience,,but no business can supply one.,Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;,all business is a matter of using machinery,,and all those things make something inauthentic.,So, how do you render authenticity,,is the question.,Are you rendering authenticity? 
 When you think about that, let me go back to,what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,,"Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 --,points to as the seminal point,at which authenticity entered the lexicon,,if you will.,And that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,,and in his play, Hamlet.,And there is one part in this play, Hamlet,,where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,,says something profoundly real.,At the end of a laundry list of advice,he's giving to his son, Laertes,,he says this:,And this above all: to thine own self be true.,And it doth follow, as night the day,,that thou canst not then be false to any man.,And those three verses are the core of authenticity.,There are two dimensions to authenticity:,one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.,Two, is other-directed:,being what you say you are to others.,And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,,I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!,All right? Anybody else like that, no?,Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get,a two-by-two.,Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.,As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing --,are they true to themselves?,And the other dimension is:,are they what they say they are to others?,If not, you have,,"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,",yielding a two-by-two matrix.,And of course, if you are both true to yourself,,and are what you say you are, then you're real real!,(Laughter) 
 The opposite, of course, is -- fake fake.,All right, now, there is value for fake.,There will always be companies around to supply the fake,,because there will always be desire for the fake.,Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;,if you do like it, it's faux.,(Laughter) 
 Now, the other two sides of the coin are:,being a real fake --,is what it says it is,,but is not true to itself,,or being a fake real:,is true to itself, but not what it says it is.,You can think about those two -- you know, both of these,better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.,You can contrast them by thinking about,Universal City Walk versus,Disney World, or Disneyland.,Universal City Walk is a real fake --,in fact, we got this very term,from Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America.",A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as --,you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,,right, because you can see behind the facade, right?,It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;,it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.,Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,,well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,,outside in this city.,But is it really true to itself?,Right? Is it really in the city?,Is it --,you can see behind all of it,,and see what is going on in the facades of it.,So she calls it a real fake. 
 Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,,or a fake reality.,Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.,(Laughter),But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --,(Laughter),-- sorry.,We won't talk about Santa Claus then.,(Laughter),But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.,Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.,When you are there you are just immersed,in this wonderful environment.,So, it's a fake real. 
 Now the easiest way,to fall down in this,,and not be real real,,right, the easiest way not to be true to yourself,is not to understand your heritage,,and thereby repudiate that heritage.,Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.,Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.,And what you have done in the past limits what you can do,,what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.,So, you have to understand that past. 
 Think about Disney again.,Disney,,10 or 15 years ago, right,,the Disney -- the company that is probably,best-known for family values out there,,Disney bought the ABC network.,The ABC network, affectionately known in the trade,as the T&A network, right --,that's not too much jargon, is it?,Right, the T&A network. Then it bought Miramax,,known for its NC-17 fare,,and all of a sudden, families everywhere,couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.,It was no longer true to its heritage;,no longer true to Walt Disney.,That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,,and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.,Because it is no longer true to itself.,So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future. 
 When it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make,is that they advertise,things that they are not.,That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company --,advertizing things that you're not.,Think about any hotel, any airline,,any hospital.,Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.,(Laughter),But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,,airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.,Then you have that perception that you are phony.,So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,,is to provide places for people to experience,who you are.,For people to experience who you are.,Right, it's not advertising does it. 
 That's why you have companies like Starbucks,,right, that doesn't advertise at all.,They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.,And think about the economic value they have provided,by that experience.,Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?,Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.,You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?,Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.,But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,,and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,,when you treat it as a good.,Take that same good,,and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,,in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,,you get 50 cents, maybe a buck,per cup of coffee.,But surround the brewing of that coffee,with the ambiance of a Starbucks,,with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,,and now, because of that authentic experience,,you can charge two, three, four, five dollars,for a cup of coffee.,So, authenticity is becoming,the new consumer sensibility. 
 Let me summarize it, for the business people in the audience,,with three rules, three basic rules.,One, don't say you're authentic,unless you really are authentic.,Two, it's easier to be authentic,if you don't say you're authentic.,And three, if you say you're authentic,,you better be authentic.,And then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,,let me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,,what we -- what will make us happy,,is spending our time and our money,satisfying the desire for authenticity.,Thank you.I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me,when I was between seven and 10 years old.,And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew,were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --,how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,,satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security,was destroyed by the war.,So I became interested in understanding,what contributed to a life that was worth living.,And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy,and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways,that I could see as a possible answer to that question.,And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance. 
 I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money,to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and,I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --,I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation,by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,,and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.,And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,,at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.,And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.,Instead of talking about little green men,,he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans,had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting,flying saucers into the sky.,He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion,were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain,some sense of order after the chaos of war.,And this seemed very interesting to me.,And I started reading his books after that lecture.,And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about. 
 Then I came to this country to study psychology,and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.,This is a typical result that many people have presented,,and there are many variations on it.,But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people,surveyed in the United States since 1956,say that their life is very happy.,And that hasn't changed at all.,Whereas the personal income,,on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,,has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.,But you find essentially the same results,,namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less,to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --,increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.,In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,,material resources, contributes to unhappiness,,but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness. 
 So my research has been focused more on --,after finding out these things that actually corresponded,to my own experience, I tried to understand:,where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience --,do we feel really happy?,And to start,those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people --,first artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand,what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life,doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,,but which made their life meaningful and worth doing. 
 This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.,And the interview was 40 pages long.,But this little excerpt is a very good summary,of what he was saying during the interview.,And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.,And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state. 
 Now, "ecstasy" in Greek meant,simply to stand to the side of something.,And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state,where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.,So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.,And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about,the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement --,whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,,or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them,is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.,We know the temples they built, where people could come,to experience a different reality.,We know about the circuses,,the arenas, the theaters.,These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went,to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form. 
 Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,,which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built,like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.,We are participating in a reality that is different,from that of the everyday life that we're used to.,But this man doesn't need to go there.,He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,,and as he does that, he can imagine sounds,that had not existed before in that particular combination.,So once he gets to that point of beginning to create,,like Jennifer did in her improvisation,,a new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --,he enters that different reality.,Now he says also that this is so intense an experience,that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.,And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.,But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing,more than about 110 bits of information per second.,And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,,you need to process about 60 bits per second.,That's why you can't hear more than two people.,You can't understand more than two people talking to you. 
 Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process,of creating something new, as this man is,,he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor,how his body feels, or his problems at home.,He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.,His body disappears,,his identity disappears from his consciousness,,because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,,to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,,and at the same time to feel that he exists.,So existence is temporarily suspended.,And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.,Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel,any awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter) 
 So what it's telling you here,is that obviously this automatic,,spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone,who is very well trained and who has developed technique.,And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity,that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years,of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.,Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long,to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better,than what was there before.,Now, when that happens,,he says the music just flows out.,And because all of these people I started interviewing --,this was an interview which is over 30 years old --,so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow,that I called this type of experience the "flow experience.",And it happens in different realms. 
 For instance, a poet describes it in this form.,This is by a student of mine who interviewed,some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.,And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling,that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.,This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --,a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave,as to how he imagined the forces of relativity,,when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.,But it happens in other activities.,For instance, this is another student of mine,,Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work,with some of the leading athletes in the world.,And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,,the same essential description of the phenomenology,of the inner state of the person.,You don't think; it goes automatically,,if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth. 
 It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,,called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs,who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful,and very ethical, very socially responsible.,You see that these people define success,as something that helps others and at the same time,makes you feel happy as you are working at it.,And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,,you can't have just one of these things be successful,if you want a meaningful and successful job.,Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.,She is the founder of Body Shop,,the natural cosmetics king.,It's kind of a passion that comes,from doing the best and having flow while you're working. 
 This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,,who was at that time starting out Sony without any money,,without a product -- they didn't have a product,,they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.,And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers,can feel the joy of technological innovation,,be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.,I couldn't improve on this as a good example,of how flow enters the workplace. 
 Now, when we do studies --,we have, with other colleagues around the world,,done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,,to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --,who enjoy their work.,And regardless of the culture,,regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions,that seem to be there when a person is in flow.,There's this focus that, once it becomes intense,,leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:,you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;,you get immediate feedback.,You know that what you need to do,is possible to do, even though difficult,,and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,,you feel part of something larger.,And once the conditions are present,,what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake. 
 In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.,And we can measure this very precisely, actually,,because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,,and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,,where you are, what you're thinking about.,And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge,people experience at that moment and the amount of skill,that they feel they have at that moment.,So for each person we can establish an average,,which is the center of the diagram.,That would be your mean level of challenge and skill,,which will be different from that of anybody else.,But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle. 
 If we know what that set point is,,we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,,and it will be when your challenges are higher than average,and skills are higher than average.,And you may be doing things very differently from other people,,but for everyone that flow channel, that area there,,will be when you are doing what you really like to do --,play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,,if work is what provides flow for you.,And then the other areas become less and less positive. 
 Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.,Your skills are not quite as high as they should be,,but you can move into flow fairly easily,by just developing a little more skill.,So, arousal is the area where most people learn from,,because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone,and to enter that -- going back to flow --,then they develop higher skills.,Control is also a good place to be,,because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.,It's not very challenging any more.,And if you want to enter flow from control,,you have to increase the challenges.,So those two are ideal and complementary areas,from which flow is easy to go into. 
 The other combinations of challenge and skill,become progressively less optimal.,Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.,Boredom begins to be very aversive,and apathy becomes very negative:,you don't feel that you're doing anything,,you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.,Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.,The largest single contributor to that experience,is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.,Even though sometimes watching television,about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,,but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch,and you get feedback from it. 
 So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time --,is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.,And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.,And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously,without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.,And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina.,She was 105 years old when I took this picture.,She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like,,"Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist.",(Laughter),She said, "Be good to your friends.,Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger.",(Laughter) 
 This is one of her songs.,Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.,And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.,Give him a big old hand.,(Applause) 
 One, two, three, four. 
 (Music) 
 Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy;,if I don't see her, I go crazy. 
 My true love lives up the river;,a few more jumps and I'll be with her. 
 Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!,Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey. 
 Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom, North Carolina.,I'd go up and learn these old songs from her.,She couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore.,And I'd pull her out on the front porch.,Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.,A double outhouse over here on the side.,And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy,,so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie." 
 Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!,Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey. 
 Well, she and I went blackberry picking.,She got mad; I took a licking. 
 Ducks on the millpond, geese in the ocean,,Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion. 
 Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!,Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey. 
 Let's have the banjo. 
 Well, we'll get married next Thanksgiving.,I'll lay around; she'll make a living. 
 She'll cook blackjacks, I'll cook gravy;,we'll have chicken someday, maybe. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey! 
 One more time now.,Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!,Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey. 
 (Applause),Thank you, Michael. 
 This is Ralph Stanley.,When I was going to college at University of California,at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies,,taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus.,This was in 1968, I guess it was.,And he played his bluegrass style of music,,but near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo picking,that came from Africa, along with the banjo.,It's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother.,I fell in love with that.,I went up to him and said, how can I learn that?,He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from,,or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina --,some place that has a lot of music.,Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style. 
 So I went back that very summer.,I just fell in love with the culture and the people.,And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees,and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.,You can imagine how excited they were. 
 So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures,I've taken of some of my mentors.,Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks. 
 And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley.,(Music) 
 (Applause),Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.,He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers.,The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this,,you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.,And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.,No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy. 
 And you can look at more pictures.,I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done,of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.,This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.,It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world,,and still played in the Southern mountains.,Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.,They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.,It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.,It sounds something like this. 
 (Music),Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy,about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys? 
 You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.,You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal. 
 Now, they were scouts in the rebels' army,,they were known both far and wide. 
 When the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide. 
 You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.,You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal. 
 Ain't that a sound?,(Applause) 
 Well, it was 1954, I guess it was.,We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas,,where I grew up in the early part of my life.,Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store.,My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat.,We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window.,We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields.,You see, we'd just been to the grocery store,,and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine,that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it.,And, buddy, that made us mad.,Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said,,"You boys! You think you can have anything you want.,You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.,You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives.,You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer." 
 She pulled the car over; she said, "Get out of the car.",My brother and I stepped out of the car.,We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.,There were about a hundred black folks out there picking.,My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field.,She went up to the foreman; she said,,"I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives.",Of course, we were just eight and 10.,(Laughter),She said, "Would you put them to work?",Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman:,put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field,in August in Texas -- it's hot.,So he gave us each a cotton sack,,about 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking.,Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers.,And if you don't know what you're doing,,your hands are bleeding in no time.,And my brother and I started to pick it,,and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then -- "Mom!",And Mom was just sitting by the car like this.,She wasn't going to give up. 
 Well, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess.,He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.,He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.,Don't want it to leave me behind.,Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.,Don't want it to leave me behind.",And from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang:,"Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,And I don't want it to leave me behind.",Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like that,in our whole lives. It was so beautiful.,We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining,,without crying, while they sang things like:,"Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water,",and "I done done," "This little light of mine." 
 Finally, by the end of the day,,we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.,But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar,,but my mother would never let us cash it.,I'm 57; still have the check.,Now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.,But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way.,No, we learned something else.,The first thing I learned that day,was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again.,(Laughter),And pretty much never did.,But I also learned that some people in this world,do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.,And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.,And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can. 
 Now, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day,when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field.,I wasn't even aware of music -- not even aware of it.,But that day in the cotton field out there picking,,when those people started singing,,I realized I was in the very heart of real music,,and that's where I've wanted to be ever since. 
 Try this old song with me. I sing:,Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. 
 You sing: Don't want it to leave me behind.,Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.,Don't want it to leave me behind. 
 Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,And I don't want it to leave me -- 
 It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton, isn't it?,Let's try it one more time. 
 There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.,Don't want it to leave me behind.,There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.,Don't want it to leave me behind. 
 Good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,And I don't want it to leave me behind. 
 It was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story,,and I told it at a concert.,My mom was in the audience.,After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself, of course,,but after the concert she came up and she said,,"David, I've got to tell you something.,I set that whole thing up.,I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land.,I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.,I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though." 
 Let's try. Good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,Good news: Chariot's coming.,And I don't want it to leave me behind.,(Applause) 
 Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument.,It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers,,who later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrument,with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from.,It's usually played flat on your lap.,It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s,,before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.,And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck,,just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well.,That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.,Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.,This instrument pretty much saved my life. 
 Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year,,my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident,,and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world.,And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was,by going through such unbelievable grief,,just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.,I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.,I had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go;,I was ready to check out of this world.,And you know, at the top of the list, of course,,were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents -- I didn't want to hurt them.,But then, when I thought about it beyond that,,it was very simple things.,I didn't care about -- I had a radio show,,I have a radio show on public radio, "Riverwalk,",I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything.,Nothing. Nothing.,On the list it would be stuff like,,seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay,,catching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand,,the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar,,listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon.,And for me, the sound of a steel guitar,,because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.,And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it,,but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.,And it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play,,that would really make that connection.,This is a song that came out of that. 
 (Music),Well, I hear you're having trouble.,Lord, I hate to hear that news.,If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through. 
 Words no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do.,I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues. 
 People say, "Oh, snap out of it!",Oh yeah, that's easier said than done.,While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun. 
 Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood,'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues. 
 Now, you can try to keep it all inside,with drink and drugs and cigarettes,,but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get. 
 But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose.,Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues.,Open up now.,(Applause) 
 Oh, I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor.,We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.,And he was working on gyroscopes;,he has a number of patents for that kind of thing.,And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney.,They were about my age.,John went on, and Michael did too,,to become some of the inventors of computer animation.,Michael's dad was working on something called the computer.,This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid;,I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one,,you know, what they were making. It was like a library,,just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see,,just floors and floors of these things,,and one of the engineers said,,some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket.,I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants!,(Laughter) 
 So that Christmas -- maybe I've got time for this --,that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set.,Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.,His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney,,the inventor of the cotton gin.,So we looked in that --,this was a commercial chemistry set.,It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see:,sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.,Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.,We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway,and we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great. 
 Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon.,So we went over into Michael's garage --,his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there,,and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe,,drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers,,pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there,,and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder,down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage.,(Laughter),We weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it.,We stood back, we lit that thing,,and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper.,Through the garage.,Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen.,(Laughter),We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.,That was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there. 
 Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.,He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.,They said they were going to beat us up,if we didn't make some gunpowder for them.,We said, well, what are you going to do with it?,They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.,(Laughter),Sure. We'll make you a big batch.,(Laughter),So we made them a big batch, and it was in my --,now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California.,Mom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin.,It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down.,Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen.,He said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.,No problem. Yeah, you know.",It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.,No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.,There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet;,the air was the just full of black smoke.,She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.,But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise,it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder. 
 So I like to invent things too,,and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.,When drum machines were new, I got to thinking,,why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms,,and combine it with the newest technology?,I call this Thunderwear.,At that time, drum triggers were new.,And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit.,I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday;,I'm going to be doing some of the same ones.,I have a trigger here, trigger here, here, here. Right there.,It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay.,Now, the drum triggers go out my tail here, into the drum machine,,and they can make various sounds, like drums.,So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the sounds,by stepping on this pedal right here, and --,let me just close out here by doing you a little,hambone solo or something like this. 
 Thank you, folks.,(Applause)A few words about how I got started,,and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.,When I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted,and very much to myself.,And, kind of as a way of surviving,,I would go into my own very personal space,,and I would make things.,I would make things for people,as a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.,I would go into these private places,,and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects --,and sort of learning how to speak with my hands.,So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects,is very much connected with not only the idea realm,,but also with very much the feeling realm.,And the ideas are very disparate. 
 I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,,and there's no real connection between one or the other,,except that they sort of come out of my brain,,and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered,by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,,and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things. 
 When I was a child, I started to explore motion.,I fell in love with the way things moved,,so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.,And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,,and I remember when I was doing this,,I was thinking about that little rock there,,and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,,and how the characters -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 would come shooting out of the car,,so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.,And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.,So, it has to end with this -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 gratuitous violence. 
 (Laughter) 
 So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,,and expressed it. 
 Now, when I went to college,,I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.,And this really came about,from having many different kinds of interests.,When I was in high school, I loved to program computers,,so I sort of liked the logical flow of events.,I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery,and becoming a surgeon,,because it meant working with my hands,in a very focused, intense way.,So, I started taking art courses,,and I found a way to make sculpture,that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,,with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.,And also, working with wire -- everything that I did,was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision,at the same time.,So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that. 
 Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.,And it's full of many little trivial end points,,like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles,and it doesn't really mean anything.,It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.,The connection I have with engineering,is the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.,I love to figure things out,,but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's pretty ambiguous. 
 (Laughter) 
 The next piece that is going to come up,is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.,I gave myself the problem.,Since I'm always liking to solve problems,,I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,,and solving all of the mechanical problems,for getting this little man to walk back and forth.,So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,,but I did have a sense of the gesture,,and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.,And then it was a matter of starting from one point,and sort of building to that final point.,That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.,And that's a little found object. 
 So a lot of the pieces that I've made,,they involve found objects.,And it really -- it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.,When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.,I imagine what can be said with them. 
 This next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,",it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.,You know, they say, never play with your food --,but I always play with things.,So, I had this wishbone, and I thought,,it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I started to make him walk across the table,,and I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that.",So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.,And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --,it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.,And that's the whole piece. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's about that big. 
 (Applause) 
 This kind of work is also very much like puppetry,,where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,,and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.,But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,,and it is able to achieve the action that I want. 
 The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,,and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair.",I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,,and I saw it explode up and out.,And --,so the way I saw this in my mind at first,,was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,,and the pieces would move far out,,and then they would begin to be pulled back,with a kind of a gravitational feel,,to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.,And they would coalesce for just a moment,,so you could perceive that there was a chair there.,For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,,and I wanted to express that.,Now, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,,because obviously you can't move physical matter,infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.,This whole thing is about four feet wide,,and the chair itself is only about a few inches. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,,and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock.",So, we have a motor here on the left,,and it goes through a gear train.,There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,,so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end,is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.,So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because it could run all the time. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, a completely different thought.,I'm always imagining myself in different situations.,I'm imagining myself as a machine.,What would I love?,I would love to be bathed in oil. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And it's really, just sort of --,for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then, I got a call from a friend,who wanted to have a show of erotic art,,and I didn't have any pieces.,But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.,So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.,And this one I call "Machine with Grease.",It's just continually ejaculating, and it's -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 this is a happy machine, I'll tell you. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's definitely happy. 
 From an engineering point of view,,this is just a little four-bar linkage.,And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.,And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,,and how simply could I state something.,And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear,but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant. 
 For me, the process is very important,,because I'm inventing machines,,but I'm also inventing tools to make machines,,and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.,So this is a little wire-bending tool.,After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,,I made that tool, and then I made this other tool,for sort of centering gears very quickly --,sort of developing my own little world of technology.,My life completely changed when I found a spot welder. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that was that tool.,It completely changed what I could do.,Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.,This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.,I just like, throw it in.,I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.,So, that's a finished gear. 
 When I moved to Boston,,I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show,pieces of sculpture on the street,,and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.,It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I made -- this is my first racing sculpture,,and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,,and I'm going to have it --,I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,',so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me,and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' ",So, that's what it does. 
 (Laughter) 
 But then in the end, what I decided,was every time you finish writing the word,,I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.,So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.,But I had a lot of fun. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this.,This is a piece that, for me, is in some ways,the most complete kind of piece.,Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.,And when I had this thought,,I was imagining that I would make --,I would have a whole machine theater evening,,where I would -- you would have an audience,,the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.,So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance,that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...,When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point,where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,,but also at the same time it's very ambiguous.,And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity,which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it. 
 And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces,start off in my own mind, in my heart,,and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,,and it always feels really crude.,It's always a struggle,,but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought,out into an object, and then it's there, OK.,It means nothing at all.,The object itself just means nothing.,Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,,then there's a cycle that has been completed.,And to me, that's the most important thing,because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.,And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,,out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.,So I'll just let this chair come down. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.
