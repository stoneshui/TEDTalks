I was 14 years old,inside of a bowling alley,,burglarizing an arcade game,,and upon exiting the building,a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.,I ran down the street,nand I jumped on top of a fence.,And when I got to the top,,the weight of 3,000 quartersnin my book bag,pulled me back down to the ground.,So when I came to, the security guardnwas standing on top of me,,and he said, "Next time you little punksnsteal something you can carry." 
 (Laughter) 
 I was taken to juvenile hall,and when I was releasedninto the custody of my mother,,the first words my uncle said was,n"How'd you get caught?",I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy.",He said, "Man, you weren't supposednto take all the quarters.",I said, "Man, they were small.nWhat am I supposed to do?",And 10 minutes later, he took mento burglarize another arcade game.,We needed gas money to get home.,That was my life. 
 I grew up in Oakland, California,,with my mother and membersnof my immediate family,addicted to crack cocaine.,My environment consistednof living with family, friends,,and homeless shelters.,Oftentimes, dinner was servednin breadlines and soup kitchens.,The big homey told me this:,money rules the world,and everything in it.,And in these streets, money is king.,And if you follow the money,,it'll lead you to the bad guynor the good guy. 
 Soon after, I committed my first crime,,and it was the first timenthat I was told that I had potential,and felt like somebody believed in me.,Nobody ever told menthat I could be a lawyer,,doctor or engineer.,I mean, how was I supposed to do that?nI couldn't read, write or spell.,I was illiterate.,So I always thoughtncrime was my way to go. 
 And then one day,I was talking to somebody,and he was telling menabout this robbery that we could do.,And we did it. 
 The reality was that I was growing up,in the strongestnfinancial nation in the world,,the United States of America,,while I watched my mothernstand in line at a blood bank,to sell her blood for 40 dollarsnjust to try to feed her kids.,She still has the needle marksnon her arms to day to show for that. 
 So I never cared about my community.,They didn't care about my life.,Everybody there was doing what theynwere doing to take what they wanted,,the drug dealers,nthe robbers, the blood bank.,Everybody was taking blood money.,So I got mine by any means necessary.,I got mine.,Financial literacynreally did rule the world,,and I was a child slave to it,following the bad guy. 
 At 17 years old, I was arrestednfor robbery and murder,and I soon learned that finances in prisonnrule more than they did on the streets,,so I wanted in.,One day, I rushed to grabnthe sports page of the newspaper,so my cellie could read it to me,,and I accidentallynpicked up the business section.,And this old man said,n"Hey youngster, you pick stocks?",And I said, "What's that?",He said, "That's the placenwhere white folks keep all their money." 
 (Laughter) 
 And it was the first timenthat I saw a glimpse of hope,,a future.,He gave me this brief descriptionnof what stocks were,,but it was just a glimpse.,I mean, how was I supposed to do it?,I couldn't read, write or spell.,The skills that I had developednto hide my illiteracy,no longer worked in this environment.,I was trapped in a cage,nprey among predators,,fighting for freedom I never had.,I was lost, tired,,and I was out of options. 
 So at 20 years old,,I did the hardest thingnI'd ever done in my life.,I picked up a book,,and it was the most agonizingntime of my life,,trying to learn how to read,,the ostracizing from my family,,the homeys.,It was rough, man.,It was a struggle.,But little did I know,I was receiving the greatest giftsnI had ever dreamed of:,self-worth,,knowledge, discipline.,I was so excited to be reading that I readneverything I could get my hands on:,candy wrappers, clothing logos,nstreet signs, everything.,I was just reading stuff! 
 (Applause) 
 Just reading stuff.,I was so excited to know how to readnand know how to spell.,The homey came up, said,n"Man, what you eating?",I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy." 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "Let me get some."nI said, "N-O. No." 
 (Laughter) 
 It was awesome.,I mean, I can actually nownfor the first time in my life read.,The feeling that I gotnfrom it was amazing. 
 And then at 22, feeling myself,,feeling confident,,I remembered what the OG told me.,So I picked up the business sectionnof the newspaper.,I wanted to find these rich white folks. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I looked for that glimpse.,As I furthered my career,in teaching others how tonfinancially manage money and invest,,I soon learned that I had to takenresponsibility for my own actions.,True, I grew upnin a very complex environment,,but I chose to commit crimes,,and I had to own up to that.,I had to take responsibilitynfor that, and I did.,I was building a curriculumnthat could teach incarcerated men,how to manage moneynthrough prison employments.,Properly managing our lifestylenwould provide transferrable tools,that we can use to manage moneynwhen we reenter society,,like the majority of people didnwho didn't commit crimes.,Then I discovered,that according to MarketWatch,,over 60 percent of the American population,has under 1,000 dollars in savings.,Sports Illustrated said thatnover 60 percent of NBA players,and NFL players go broke.,40 percent of marital problemsnderive from financial issues.,What the hell? 
 (Laughter) 
 You mean to tell menthat people worked their whole lives,,buying cars, clothes,nhomes and material stuff,but were living check to check?,How in the world were members of societyngoing to help incarcerated individuals,back into society,if they couldn't manage they own stuff?,We screwed. 
 (Laughter) 
 I needed a better plan.,This is not going to work out too well.,So ...,I thought.,I now had an obligationnto meet those on the path,and help,,and it was crazy becausenI now cared about my community.,Wow, imagine that.nI cared about my community. 
 Financial illiteracy is a disease,that has crippled minoritiesnand the lower class in our society,for generations and generations,,and we should be furious about that.,Ask yourselves this:,How can 50 percentnof the American population,be financially illiterate in a nationndriven by financial prosperity?,Our access to justice, our social status,,living conditions, transportation and food,are all dependent on moneynthat most people can't manage.,It's crazy!,It's an epidemic,and a bigger danger to public safetynthan any other issue. 
 According to the CalifornianDepartment of Corrections,,over 70 percent of those incarcerated,have committed or have been chargednwith money-related crimes:,robberies, burglaries,nfraud, larceny, extortion --,and the list goes on.,Check this out:,a typical incarcerated person,would enter the California prison system,with no financial education,,earn 30 cents an hour,,over 800 dollars a year,,with no real expenses and save no money.,Upon his parole, he will be givenn200 dollars gate money and told,,"Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble.nDon't come back to prison.",With no meaningful preparationnor long-term financial plan,,what does he do ... ?,At 60?,Get a good job,,or go back to the very criminal behaviornthat led him to prison in the first place?,You taxpayers, you choose.,Well, his educationnalready chose for him, probably. 
 So how do we cure this disease?,I cofounded a program,that we call Financial EmpowermentnEmotional Literacy.,We call it FEEL,,and it teaches how do you separatenyour emotional decisions,from your financial decisions,,and the four timeless rulesnto personal finance:,the proper way to save,,control your cost of living,,borrow money effectively,and diversify your financesnby allowing your money to work for you,instead of you working for it.,Incarcerated people need these life skillsnbefore we reenter society.,You can't have full rehabilitationnwithout these life skills.,This idea that only professionalsncan invest and manage money,is absolutely ridiculous,,and whoever told you that is lying. 
 (Applause) 
 A professional is a person,who knows his craft better than most,,and nobody knows how much moneynyou need, have or want better than you,,which means you are the professional.,Financial literacy is not a skill,nladies and gentlemen.,It's a lifestyle.,Financial stability is a byproductnof a proper lifestyle.,A financially sound incarcerated personncan become a taxpaying citizen,,and a financially soundntaxpaying citizen can remain one.,This allows us to create a bridgenbetween those people who we influence:,family, friends and those young people,who still believenthat crime and money are related.,So let's lose the fear and anxiety,of all the big financial words,and all that other nonsensenthat you've been out there hearing.,And let's get to the heartnof what's been crippling our society,from taking care of your responsibilitynto be better life managers.,And let's provide a simplenand easy to use curriculum,that gets to the heart, the heart,of what financial empowermentnand emotional literacy really is. 
 Now, if you're sitting out herenin the audience and you said,,"Oh yeah, well, that ain't menand I don't buy it,",then come take my class -- 
 (Laughter) 
 so I can show you how much moneynit costs you every time you get emotional. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 (Applause)How much do you get paid?,Don't answer that out loud.,But put a number in your head.,Now: How much do you think the personnsitting next to you gets paid?,Again, don't answer out loud. 
 (Laughter) 
 At work, how much do you think,the person sitting in the cubiclenor the desk next to you gets paid?,Do you know?,Should you know? 
 Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for mento even ask you those questions.,But admit it -- you kind of want to know.,Most of us are uncomfortable with the ideanof broadcasting our salary.,We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,,and we're definitely not supposednto tell our office neighbors.,The assumed reason is that if everybodynknew what everybody got paid,,then all hell would break loose.,There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,,there might even be a few people who quit.,But what if secrecy is actuallynthe reason for all that strife?,And what would happennif we removed that secrecy?,What if openness actually increasednthe sense of fairness and collaboration,inside a company?,What would happen if we hadntotal pay transparency? 
 For the past several years,,I've been studying the corporatenand entrepreneurial leaders,who question the conventional wisdomnabout how to run a company.,And the question of pay keeps coming up.,And the answers keep surprising. 
 It turns out that pay transparency --,sharing salaries openlynacross a company --,makes for a better workplacenfor both the employee,and for the organization.,When people don't know how their payncompares to their peers',,they're more likely to feel underpaid,and maybe even discriminated against.,Do you want to work at a placenthat tolerates the idea,that you feel underpaidnor discriminated against?,But keeping salaries secretndoes exactly that,,and it's a practicenas old as it is common,,despite the factnthat in the United States,,the law protects an employee's rightnto discuss their pay. 
 In one famous example from decades ago,,the management of Vanity Fair magazine,actually circulated a memo entitled:,"Forbidding Discussion AmongnEmployees of Salary Received.","Forbidding" discussion amongnemployees of salary received.,Now that memo didn't sit wellnwith everybody.,New York literary figuresnDorothy Parker,,Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,,all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,,decided to stand up for transparency,and showed up for work the next day,with their salary written on signsnhanging from their neck. 
 (Laughter) 
 Imagine showing up for work,with your salary just writtennacross your chest for all to see. 
 But why would a company even wantnto discourage salary discussions?,Why do some people go along with it,nwhile others revolt against it?,It turns out that in additionnto the assumed reasons,,pay secrecy is actually a waynto save a lot of money.,You see, keeping salaries secret,leads to what economists calln"information asymmetry.",This is a situation where,nin a negotiation,,one party has loads moreninformation than the other.,And in hiring or promotionnor annual raise discussions,,an employer can use that secrecynto save a lot of money.,Imagine how much betternyou could negotiate for a raise,if you knew everybody's salary. 
 Economists warn that information asymmetry,can cause markets to go awry.,Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,,and suddenly everybodynis shouting at each other.,In fact, they even warn,that information asymmetryncan lead to a total market failure.,And I think we're almost there.,Here's why:,first, most employees have no ideanhow their pay compares to their peers'.,In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,,two-thirds of everyone who is paidnat the market rate,said that they felt they were underpaid.,And of everybody who feltnthat they were underpaid,,60 percent saidnthat they intended to quit,,regardless of where they were --nunderpaid, overpaid,or right at the market rate.,If you were part of this survey,nwhat would you say?,Are you underpaid?,Well, wait -- how do you even know,,because you're not allowednto talk about it? 
 Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,,makes it easier to ignorenthe discrimination,that's already presentnin the market today.,In a 2011 report from the Institutenfor Women's Policy Research,,the gender wage gapnbetween men and women,was 23 percent.,This is where that 77 centsnon the dollar comes from.,But in the Federal Government,,where salaries are pinnednto certain levels,and everybody knowsnwhat those levels are,,the gender wage gapnshrinks to 11 percent --,and this is before controllingnfor any of the factors,that economists argue overnwhether or not to control for. 
 If we really want to closenthe gender wage gap,,maybe we should startnby opening up the payroll.,If this is what totalnmarket failure looks like,,then openness remainsnthe only way to ensure fairness. 
 Now, I realize that letting peoplenknow what you make,might feel uncomfortable,,but isn't it less uncomfortable,than always wonderingnif you're being discriminated against,,or if your wife or your daughternor your sister is being paid unfairly?,Openness remains the best waynto ensure fairness,,and pay transparency does that. 
 That's why entrepreneurial leadersnand corporate leaders,have been experimentingnwith sharing salaries for years.,Like Dane Atkinson.,Dane is a serial entrepreneurnwho started many companies,in a pay secrecy condition,and even used that conditionnto pay two equally qualified people,dramatically different salaries,,depending on how wellnthey could negotiate.,And Dane saw the strifenthat happened as a result of this.,So when he startednhis newest company, SumAll,,he committed to salary transparencynfrom the beginning.,And the results have been amazing.,And in study after study,,when people knownhow they're being paid,and how that pay compares to their peers',,they're more likely to work hardnto improve their performance,,more likely to be engaged,nand they're less likely to quit. 
 That's why Dane's not alone.,From technology start-ups like Buffer,,to the tens of thousandsnof employees at Whole Foods,,where not only is your salarynavailable for everyone to see,,but the performance datanfor the store and for your department,is available on the company intranet,for all to see. 
 Now, pay transparencyntakes a lot of forms.,It's not one size fits all.,Some post their salaries for all to see.,Some only keep it inside the company.,Some post the formula for calculating pay,,and others post the pay levels,and affix everybody to that level.,So you don't have to make signs,for all of your employeesnto wear around the office.,And you don't have to benthe only one wearing a sign,that you made at home.,But we can all take greater stepsntowards pay transparency.,For those of you that have the authority,to move forward towards transparency:,it's time to move forward.,And for those of younthat don't have that authority:,it's time to stand up for your right to. 
 So how much do you get paid?,And how does that comparento the people you work with?,You should know.,And so should they. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What if I told younthere was a new technology,that, when placed in the handsnof doctors and nurses,,improved outcomes for childrennand adults, patients of all ages;,reduced pain and suffering,,reduced time in the operating rooms,,reduced anesthetic times,,had the ultimate dose-response curve,that the more you did it,,the better it benefitted patients?,Here's a kicker: it has no side effects,,and it's available no matternwhere care is delivered.,I can tell you as an ICU doctornat Boston Children's Hospital,,this would be a game changer for me.,That technology is lifelike rehearsal.,This lifelike rehearsal is being deliverednthrough medical simulation. 
 I thought I would start with a case,,just to really describenthe challenge ahead,,and why this technology is not justngoing to improve health care,but why it's critical to health care.,This is a child that's born, young girl.,"Day of life zero," we call it,,the first day of life,njust born into the world.,And just as she's being born,,we notice very quicklynthat she is deteriorating.,Her heart rate is going up,nher blood pressure is going down,,she's breathing very, very fast.,And the reason for thisnis displayed in this chest X-ray. 
 That's called a babygram,,a full X-ray of a child's body,na little infant's body.,As you look on the top side of this,,that's where the heart and lungsnare supposed to be.,As you look at the bottom end,nthat's where the abdomen is,,and that's where the intestinesnare supposed to be.,And you can see hownthere's sort of that translucent area,that made its way up into the right sidenof this child's chest.,And those are the intestines --nin the wrong place.,As a result, they're pushing on the lungs,and making it very difficultnfor this poor baby to breathe. 
 The fix for this problem,is to take this child immediatelynto the operating room,,bring those intestinesnback into the abdomen,,let the lungs expand,and allow this child to breathe again.,But before she can gonto the operating room,,she must get whisked awaynto the ICU, where I work.,I work with surgical teams.,We gather around her,,and we place this childnon heart-lung bypass.,We put her to sleep,,we make a tinynlittle incision in the neck,,we place catheters into the majornvessels of the neck --,and I can tell you that these vesselsnare about the size of a pen,,the tip of a pen --,and then we have bloodndrawn from the body,,we bring it through a machine,nit gets oxygenated,,and it goes back into the body.,We save her life,,and get her safely to the operating room. 
 Here's the problem:,these disorders --,what is known is congenitalndiaphragmatic hernia --,this hole in the diaphragm that hasnallowed these intestines to sneak up --,these disorders are rare.,Even in the best hands in the world,,there is still a challengento get the volume --,the natural volume of these patients --,in order to get our expertisencurve at 100 percent.,They just don't present that often.,So how do you make the rare common? 
 Here's the other problem:,in the health care systemnthat I trained for over 20 years,,what currently exists,,the model of training is callednthe apprenticeship model.,It's been around for centuries.,It's based on this idea that you seena surgery maybe once,,maybe several times,,you then go do that surgery,,and then ultimately you teachnthat surgery to the next generation.,And implicit in this model --,I don't need to tell you this --,is that we practice on the very patientsnthat we are delivering care to.,That's a problem.,I think there's a better approach.,Medicine may very well be the lastnhigh-stakes industry,that does not practice prior to game time.,I want to describe to you a betternapproach through medical simulation. 
 Well, the first thing we did is we wentnto other high-stakes industries,that had been using this typenof methodology for decades.,This is nuclear power.,Nuclear power runs scenariosnon a regular basis,in order to practicenwhat they hope will never occur.,And as we're all very familiar,nthe airline industry --,we all get on planes now,ncomforted by the idea,that pilots and crews have trainednon simulators much like these,,training on scenariosnthat we hope will never occur,,but we know if they did,,they would be prepared for the worst.,In fact, the airline industry has gonenas far as to create fuselages,of simulation environments,,because of the importancenof the team coming together.,This is an evacuation drill simulator.,So again, if that ever were to happen,nthese rare, rare events,,they're ready to actnon the drop of a dime. 
 I guess the most compelling for menin some ways is the sports industry --,arguably high stakes.,You think about a baseball team:nbaseball players practice.,I think it's a beautiful examplenof progressive training.,The first thing they donis go out to spring training.,They go to a spring training camp,,perhaps a simulator in baseball.,They're not on the real field,nbut they're on a simulated field,,and they're playing in the pregame season.,Then they make their way to the fieldnduring the season games,,and what's the first thing they donbefore they start the game?,They go into the batting cagenand do batting practice for hours,,having different types of pitchesnbeing thrown at them,,hitting ball after ballnas they limber their muscles,,getting ready for the game itself.,And here's the mostnphenomenal part of this,,and for all of you who watchnany sport event,,you will see this phenomenon happen.,The batter gets into the batter's box,,the pitcher gets ready to pitch.,Right before the pitch is thrown,,what does that batter do?,The batter steps out of the box,and takes a practice swing.,He wouldn't do it any other way. 
 I want to talk to you about hownwe're building practice swings like this,in medicine.,We are building batting cagesnfor the patients that we care about,at Boston Children's.,I want to use this casenthat we recently built.,It's the case of a four-year-oldnwho had a progressively enlarging head,,and as a result,,had loss of developmental milestones,nneurologic milestones,,and the reason for this problem is here --,it's called hydrocephalus. 
 So, a quick study in neurosurgery.,There's the brain,,and you can see the craniumnsurrounding the brain.,What surrounds the brain,nbetween the brain and cranium,,is something calledncerebrospinal fluid or fluid,,which acts as a shock absorber.,In your heads right now,,there is cerebrospinal fluidnjust bathing your brains,and making its way around.,It's produced in one areanand flows through,,and then is re-exchanged.,And this beautiful flow patternnoccurs for all of us.,But unfortunately in some children,,there's a blockage of this flow pattern,,much like a traffic jam.,As a result, the fluid accumulates,,and the brain is pushed aside.,It has difficulty growing.,As a result, the child losesnneurologic milestones.,This is a devastating disease in children. 
 The cure for this is surgery.,The traditional surgery is to takena bit of the cranium off,,a bit of the skull,,drain this fluid out,nstick a drain in place,,and then eventually bringnthis drain internal to the body.,Big operation.,But some great news is that advancesnin neurosurgical care,have allowed us to developnminimally invasive approaches,to this surgery.,Through a small pinhole,na camera can be inserted,,led into the deep brain structure,,and cause a little hole in a membranenthat allows all that fluid to drain,,much like it would in a sink.,All of a sudden, the brainnis no longer under pressure,,can re-expand,and we cure the childnthrough a single-hole incision. 
 But here's the problem:,hydrocephalus is relatively rare.,And there are no good training methods,to get really good at gettingnthis scope to the right place.,But surgeons have been quite creativenabout this, even our own.,And they've come up with training models.,Here's the current training model. 
 (Laughter) 
 I kid you not.,This is a red pepper,nnot made in Hollywood;,it's real red pepper.,And what surgeons do is they stickna scope into the pepper,,and they do what is called a "seedectomy." 
 (Laughter) 
 They use this scope to remove seedsnusing a little tweezer.,And that is a way to get under their belts,the rudimentary componentsnof doing this surgery.,Then they head right intonthe apprenticeship model,,seeing many of themnas they present themselves,,then doing it, and then teaching it --,waiting for these patients to arrive.,We can do a lot better. 
 We are manufacturingnreproductions of children,in order for surgeons and surgicalnteams to rehearse,in the most relevant possible ways.,Let me show you this.,Here's my team,in what's called the SIM EngineeringnDivision of the Simulator Program.,This is an amazing team of individuals.,They are mechanical engineers;,you're seeing here, illustrators.,They take primary datanfrom CT scans and MRIs,,translate it into digital information,,animate it,,put it together into the componentsnof the child itself,,surface-scan elements of the childnthat have been casted as needed,,depending on the surgery itself,,and then take this digital datanand be able to output it,on state-of-the-art,nthree-dimensional printing devices,that allow us to print the components,exactly to the micron detail of whatnthe child's anatomy will look like.,You can see here,,the skull of this child being printed,in the hours beforenwe performed this surgery. 
 But we could not do this work,without our dear friends on the West Coastnin Hollywood, California.,These are individualsnthat are incredibly talented,at being able to recreate reality.,It was not a long leap for us.,The more we got into this field,,the more it became clear to usnthat we are doing cinematography.,We're doing filmmaking,,it's just that the actors are not actors.,They're real doctors and nurses.,So these are some photosnof our dear friends at Fractured FX,in Hollywood California,,an Emmy-Award-winningnspecial effects firm.,This is Justin Raleigh and his group --,this is not one of our patients -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but kind of the exquisite worknthat these individuals do.,We have now collaboratednand fused our experience,,bringing their groupnto Boston Children's Hospital,,sending our groupnout to Hollywood, California,and exchanging around this,to be able to developnthese type of simulators. 
 What I'm about to show younis a reproduction of this child.,You'll notice here that every hairnon the child's head is reproduced.,And in fact, this is alsonthat reproduced child --,and I apologize for any queasy stomachs,,but that is a reproduction and simulation,of the child they're about to operate on.,Here's that membrane we had talked about,,the inside of this child's brain.,What you're going to be seeing herenis, on one side, the actual patient,,and on the other side, the simulator.,As I mentioned, a scope, a little camera,nneeds to make its way down,,and you're seeing that here.,It needs to make a small holenin this membrane,and allow this fluid to seep out.,I won't do a quiz show to seenwho thinks which side is which,,but on the right is the simulator. 
 So surgeons can now producentraining opportunities,,do these surgeriesnas many times as they want,,to their heart's content,nuntil they feel comfortable.,And then, and only then,nbring the child into the operating room.,But we don't stop here.,We know that a key step to thisnis not just the skill itself,,but combining that skill with a teamnwho's going to deliver that care. 
 Now we turn to Formula One.,And here is an examplenof a technician putting on a tire,and doing that time and timenagain on this car.,But that is very quicklyngoing to be incorporated,within team-training experiences,,now as a full team orchestratingnthe exchange of tires,and getting this car back on the speedway.,We've done that step in health care,,so now what you're about to seenis a simulated operation.,We've taken the simulatornI just described to you,,we've brought it into the operating roomnat Boston Children's Hospital,,and these individuals --nthese native teams, operative teams --,are doing the surgery before the surgery.,Operate twice;,cut once.,Let me show that to you. 
 (Video) Surgical team member 1:nYou want the head down or head up? 
 STM 2: Can you lower it down to 10? 
 STM 3: And then lowernthe whole table down a little bit? 
 STM 4: Table coming down. 
 STM 3: All right, thisnis behaving like a vessel.,Could we have the scissors back, please? 
 STM 5: I'm taking my gloves,n8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in. 
 STM 6: Great! Thank you. 
 Peter Weinstock: It's really amazing.,The second step to this,nwhich is critical,,is we take these teams outnimmediately and debrief them.,We use the same technologies,that are used in Leannand Six Sigma in the military,,and we bring them outnand talk about what went right,,but more importantly,,we talk about what didn't go well,,and how we're going to fix it.,Then we bring them right back innand do it again.,Deliberative batting practicenin the moments when it matters most. 
 Let's go back to this case now.,Same child,,but now let me describenhow we care for this child,at Boston Children's Hospital.,This child was bornnat three o'clock in the morning.,At two o'clock in the morning,,we assembled the team,,and took the reproduced anatomy,that we would gainnout of scans and images,,and brought that teamnto the virtual bedside,,to a simulated bedside --,the same team that's going to operatenon this child in the hours ahead --,and we have them do the procedure.,Let me show you a moment of this.,This is not a real incision.,And the baby has not yet been born.,Imagine this. 
 So now the conversationsnthat I have with families,in the intensive care unitnat Boston Children's Hospital,are totally different.,Imagine this conversation:,"Not only do we take care of this disordernfrequently in our ICU,,and not only have we done surgeries,like the surgery we're goingnto do on your child,,but we have done your child's surgery.,And we did it two hours ago.,And we did it 10 times.,And now we're prepared to take themnback to the operating room." 
 So a new technology in health care:,lifelike rehearsal.,Practicing prior to game time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to talk about sex for money.,I'm not like most of the peoplenyou'll have heard speaking,about prostitution before.,I'm not a police officernor a social worker.,I'm not an academic,na journalist or a politician.,And as you'll probably havenpicked up from Maryam's blurb,,I'm not a nun, either. 
 (Laughter) 
 Most of those people would tell younthat selling sex is degrading;,that no one would ever choose to do it;,that it's dangerous;nwomen get abused and killed.,In fact, most of those people would say,,"There should be a law against it!",Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.,It sounded reasonable to menuntil the closing months of 2009,,when I was working two dead-end,nminimum-wage jobs.,Every month my wages would justnreplenish my overdraft.,I was exhausted and my lifenwas going nowhere.,Like many others before me,,I decided sex for moneynwas a better option.,Now don't get me wrong --,I would have lovednto have won the lottery instead.,But it wasn't goingnto happen anytime soon,,and my rent needed paying.,So I signed up for my firstnshift in a brothel. 
 In the years that have passed,,I've had a lot of time to think.,I've reconsidered the ideasnI once had about prostitution.,I've given a lot of thought to consent,and the nature of work under capitalism.,I've thought about gender inequality,and the sexual and reproductivenlabor of women.,I've experienced exploitationnand violence at work.,I've thought about what's needed,to protect other sex workersnfrom these things.,Maybe you've thought about them, too.,In this talk,,I'll take you throughnthe four main legal approaches,applied to sex work throughout the world,,and explain why they don't work;,why prohibiting the sex industrynactually exacerbates every harm,that sex workers are vulnerable to.,Then I'm going tell you about what we,nas sex workers, actually want. 
 The first approachnis full criminalization.,Half the world,,including Russia, South Africanand most of the US,,regulates sex work by criminalizingneveryone involved.,So that's seller, buyer and third parties.,Lawmakers in these countriesnapparently hope,that the fear of getting arrestednwill deter people from selling sex.,But if you're forced to choosenbetween obeying the law,and feeding yourself or your family,,you're going to do the work anyway,,and take the risk. 
 Criminalization is a trap.,It's hard to get a conventional jobnwhen you have a criminal record.,Potential employers won't hire you.,Assuming you still need money,,you'll stay in the more flexible,ninformal economy.,The law forces you to keep selling sex,,which is the exact oppositenof its intended effect.,Being criminalized leaves you exposednto mistreatment by the state itself.,In many places you may be coercedninto paying a bribe,or even into having sexnwith a police officer,to avoid arrest.,Police and prison guardsnin Cambodia, for example,,have been documentednsubjecting sex workers,to what can only be described as torture:,threats at gunpoint,,beatings, electric shocks, rape,and denial of food. 
 Another worrying thing:,if you're selling sex in placesnlike Kenya, South Africa or New York,,a police officer can arrest younif you're caught carrying condoms,,because condoms can legally be usednas evidence that you're selling sex.,Obviously, this increases HIV risk.,Imagine knowing if you're bustedncarrying condoms,,it'll be used against you.,It's a pretty strong incentivento leave them at home, right?,Sex workers working in these placesnare forced to make a tough choice,between risking arrestnor having risky sex.,What would you choose?,Would you pack condoms to go to work?,How about if you're worried,the police officer would rape younwhen he got you in the van? 
 The second approach to regulatingnsex work seen in these countries,is partial criminalization,,where the buying and sellingnof sex are legal,,but surrounding activities,,like brothel-keeping or solicitingnon the street, are banned.,Laws like these --,we have them in the UK and in France --,essentially say to us sex workers,,"Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,,just make sure it's donenbehind closed doors,and all alone.",And brothel-keeping, by the way,,is defined as just two or morensex workers working together.,Making that illegal meansnthat many of us work alone,,which obviously makes usnvulnerable to violent offenders.,But we're also vulnerable,if we choose to break the lawnby working together.,A couple of years ago,,a friend of mine was nervousnafter she was attacked at work,,so I said that she could see her clientsnfrom my place for a while.,During that time,,we had another guy turn nasty.,I told the guy to leavenor I'd call the police.,And he looked at the two of us and said,,"You girls can't call the cops.,You're working together,nthis place is illegal.",He was right.,He eventually leftnwithout getting physically violent,,but the knowledgenthat we were breaking the law,empowered that man to threaten us.,He felt confident he'd get away with it. 
 The prohibition of street prostitutionnalso causes more harm,than it prevents.,Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,,street workers take risksnto avoid detection,,and that means working alone,or in isolated locations like dark forests,where they're vulnerable to attack.,If you're caught selling sex outdoors,,you pay a fine.,How do you pay that finenwithout going back to the streets?,It was the need for moneynthat saw you in the streets,in the first place.,And so the fines stack up,,and you're caught in a vicious cycle,of selling sex to pay the finesnyou got for selling sex. 
 Let me tell you about Mariana Popanwho worked in Redbridge, East London.,The street workers on her patchnwould normally wait for clients in groups,for safety in numbers,and to warn each other about hownto avoid dangerous guys.,But during a police crackdownnon sex workers and their clients,,she was forced to work alonento avoid being arrested.,She was stabbed to deathnin the early hours of October 29, 2013.,She had been working later than usual,to try to pay off a finenshe had received for soliciting. 
 So if criminalizingnsex workers hurts them,,why not just criminalizenthe people who buy sex?,This is the aim of the third approach,I want to talk about --,the Swedish or Nordicnmodel of sex-work law.,The idea behind this law,is that selling sexnis intrinsically harmful,and so you're, in fact, helpingnsex workers by removing the option.,Despite growing support,for what's often describednas the "end demand" approach,,there's no evidence that it works.,There's just as much prostitutionnin Sweden as there was before.,Why might that be?,It's because people selling sex,often don't have other options for income.,If you need that money,,the only effect that a dropnin business is going have,is to force you to lower your prices,or offer more risky sexual services.,If you need to find more clients,,you might seek the help of a manager.,So you see, rather than putting a stop,to what's often descried as pimping,,a law like this actually gives oxygen,to potentially abusive third parties. 
 To keep safe in my work,,I try not to take bookings from someone,who calls me from a withheld number.,If it's a home or a hotel visit,,I try to get a full name and details.,If I worked under the Swedish model,,a client would be too scarednto give me that information.,I might have no other choice,but to accept a bookingnfrom a man who is untraceable,if he later turns out to be violent.,If you need their money,,you need to protectnyour clients from the police.,If you work outdoors,,that means working alonenor in isolated locations,,just as if you were criminalized yourself.,It might mean getting into cars quicker,,less negotiating timenmeans snap decisions.,Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?,Can you afford to take the risk?,Can you afford not to? 
 Something I'm often hearing is,,"Prostitution would be fine,if we made it legal and regulated it.",We call that approach legalization,,and it's used by countriesnlike the Netherlands, Germany,and Nevada in the US.,But it's not a greatnmodel for human rights.,And in state-controlled prostitution,,commercial sex can only happen,in certain legally-designatednareas or venues,,and sex workers are made to complynwith special restrictions,,like registrationnand forced health checks.,Regulation sounds great on paper,,but politicians deliberately makenregulation around the sex industry,expensive and difficult to comply with.,It creates a two-tiered system:nlegal and illegal work.,We sometimes call itn"backdoor criminalization.",Rich, well-connected brothel ownersncan comply with the regulations,,but more marginalized peoplenfind those hoops,impossible to jump through.,And even if it's possible in principle,,getting a license or proper venuentakes time and costs money.,It's not going to be an option,for someone who's desperatenand needs money tonight.,They might be a refugeenor fleeing domestic abuse.,In this two-tiered system,,the most vulnerable peoplenare forced to work illegally,,so they're still exposed to allnthe dangers of criminalization,I mentioned earlier. 
 So.,It's looking like all attempts to control,or prevent sex work from happening,makes things more dangerousnfor people selling sex.,Fear of law enforcement makes themnwork alone in isolated locations,,and allows clients and even cops,to get abusive in the knowledgenthey'll get away with it.,Fines and criminal records forcenpeople to keep selling sex,,rather than enabling them to stop.,Crackdowns on buyers drive sellersnto take dangerous risks,and into the armsnof potentially abusive managers. 
 These laws also reinforce stigmanand hatred against sex workers.,When France temporarily brought innthe Swedish model two years ago,,ordinary citizens took it as a cue,to start carrying out vigilante attacks,against people working on the street.,In Sweden, opinion surveys show,that significantly more people wantnsex workers to be arrested now,than before the law was brought in.,If prohibition is this harmful,,you might ask, why it so popular? 
 Firstly, sex work is and alwaysnhas been a survival strategy,for all kinds of unpopularnminority groups:,people of color,,migrants,,people with disabilities,,LGBTQ people,,particularly trans women.,These are the groups most heavily profiled,and punished through prohibitionist law.,I don't think this is an accident.,These laws have political support,precisely because they target people,that voters don't wantnto see or know about. 
 Why else might people support prohibition?,Well, lots of people havenunderstandable fears about trafficking.,Folks think that foreign womennkidnapped and sold into sexual slavery,can be saved by shuttingna whole industry down.,So let's talk about trafficking.,Forced labor does occurnin many industries,,especially those where the workersnare migrants or otherwise vulnerable,,and this needs to be addressed.,But it's best addressed with legislationntargeting those specific abuses,,not an entire industry.,When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants,drowned while picking cocklesnin Morecambe Bay in 2004,,there were no calls to outlawnthe entire seafood industry,to save trafficking victims.,The solution is clearly to givenworkers more legal protections,,allowing them to resist abuse,and report it to authoritiesnwithout fear of arrest. 
 The way the term traffickingnis thrown around,implies that all undocumentednmigration into prostitution is forced.,In fact, many migrantsnhave made a decision,,out of economic need,,to place themselves into the handsnof people smugglers.,Many do this with the full knowledge,that they'll be selling sexnwhen they reach their destination.,And yes, it can often be the case,that these people smugglersndemand exorbitant fees,,coerce migrants into worknthey don't want to do,and abuse them when they're vulnerable.,That's true of prostitution,,but it's also true of agricultural work,,hospitality work and domestic work.,Ultimately, nobody wantsnto be forced to do any kind of work,,but that's a risk many migrantsnare willing to take,,because of what they're leaving behind.,If people were allowed to migrate legally,they wouldn't have to place their livesninto the hands of people smugglers.,The problems arise,from the criminalization of migration,,just as they do from the criminalization,of sex work itself. 
 This is a lesson of history.,If you try to prohibit somethingnthat people want or need to do,,whether that's drinking alcoholnor crossing borders,or getting an abortion,or selling sex,,you create more problems than you solve.,Prohibition barely makes a difference,to the amount of peoplenactually doing those things.,But it makes a huge difference,as to whether or notnthey're safe when they do them. 
 Why else might people support prohibition?,As a feminist, I knownthat the sex industry is a site,of deeply entrenched social inequality.,It's a fact that most buyers of sexnare men with money,,and most sellers are women without.,You can agree with all that -- I do --,and still think prohibitionnis a terrible policy.,In a better, more equal world,,maybe there would be far fewernpeople selling sex to survive,,but you can't simply legislatena better world into existence.,If someone needs to sell sexnbecause they're poor,or because they're homeless,or because they're undocumentednand they can't find legal work,,taking away that optionndoesn't make them any less poor,or house them,or change their immigration status. 
 People worry that sellingnsex is degrading.,Ask yourself: is it more degradingnthan going hungry,or seeing your children go hungry?,There's no call to ban rich peoplenfrom hiring nannies,or getting manicures,,even though most of the peoplendoing that labor are poor, migrant women.,It's the fact of poor migrant womennselling sex specifically,that has some feminists uncomfortable.,And I can understand,why the sex industry provokesnstrong feelings.,People have all kindsnof complicated feelings,when it comes to sex.,But we can't make policynon the basis of mere feelings,,especially not overnthe heads of the people,actually effected by those policies.,If we get fixated onnthe abolition of sex work,,we end up worrying morenabout a particular manifestation,of gender inequality,,rather than about the underlying causes. 
 People get really hung up on the question,,"Well, would you wantnyour daughter doing it?",That's the wrong question.,Instead, imagine she is doing it.,How safe is she at work tonight?,Why isn't she safer? 
 So we've looked at full criminalization,,partial criminalization,nthe Swedish or Nordic Model,and legalization,,and how they all cause harm.,Something I never hear asked is:,"What do sex workers want?",After all, we're the onesnmost affected by these laws. 
 New Zealand decriminalizednsex work in 2003.,It's crucial to remember,that decriminalization and legalizationnare not the same thing.,Decriminalization meansnthe removal of laws,that punitively target the sex industry,,instead treating sex worknmuch like any other kind of work.,In New Zealand, peoplencan work together for safety,,and employers of sex workersnare accountable to the state.,A sex worker can refusento see a client at any time,,for any reason,,and 96 percent of street workers,report that they feel the lawnprotects their rights.,New Zealand hasn't actuallynseen an increase,in the amount of people doing sex work,,but decriminalizing itnhas made it a lot safer.,But the lesson from New Zealand,isn't just that its particularnlegislation is good,,but that crucially,,it was written in collaborationnwith sex workers;,namely, the New ZealandnProstitutes' Collective.,When it came to making sex work safer,,they were ready to hear it straightnfrom sex workers themselves. 
 Here in the UK,,I'm part of sex worker-led groupsnlike the Sex Worker Open University,and the English Collective of Prostitutes.,And we form part of a global movement,demanding decriminalizationnand self-determination.,The universal symbol of our movementnis the red umbrella.,We're supported in our demandsnby global bodies like UNAIDS,,the World Health Organization,and Amnesty International.,But we need more allies.,If you care about gender equality,or poverty or migration or public health,,then sex worker rights matter to you.,Make space for us in your movements.,That means not only listeningnto sex workers when we speak,but amplifying our voices.,Resist those who silence us,,those who say that a prostitutenis either too victimized,,too damaged to knownwhat's best for herself,,or else too privileged,and too removed from real hardship,,not representative of the millionsnof voiceless victims.,This distinction between victimnand empowered is imaginary.,It exists purely to discredit sex workers,and make it easy to ignore us. 
 No doubt many of you work for a living.,Well, sex work is work, too.,Just like you,,some of us like our jobs,,some of us hate them.,Ultimately, most of usnhave mixed feelings.,But how we feel about our work,isn't the point.,And how others feelnabout our work certainly isn't.,What's important is that we haventhe right to work safely,and on our own terms. 
 Sex workers are real people.,We've had complicated experiences,and complicated responsesnto those experiences.,But our demands are not complicated.,You can ask expensivenescorts in New York City,,brothel workers in Cambodia,nstreet workers in South Africa,and every girl on the rosternat my old job in Soho,,and they will all tell you the same thing.,You can speak to millions of sex workers,and countless sex work-led organizations.,We want full decriminalizationnand labor rights as workers. 
 I'm just one sex workernon the stage today,,but I'm bringing a messagenfrom all over the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I want to talknabout the meaning of words,,how we define them,and how they, almost as revenge,,define us. 
 The English languagenis a magnificent sponge.,I love the English language.nI'm glad that I speak it.,But for all that, it has a lot of holes.,In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism",which is the hunger for disaster.,You know, when you seena thunderstorm on the horizon,and you just find yourselfnrooting for the storm.,In Mandarin, they have a word "yù yī" --,I'm not pronouncing that correctly --,which means the longingnto feel intensely again,the way you did when you were a kid.,In Polish, they have a word "jouska",which is the kind ofnhypothetical conversation,that you compulsivelynplay out in your head.,And finally, in German,nof course in German,,they have a word called "zielschmerz",which is the dreadnof getting what you want. 
 (Laughter) 
 Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.,I'm German myself,nso I know exactly what that feels like. 
 Now, I'm not surenif I would use any of these words,as I go about my day,,but I'm really glad they exist.,But the only reason they existnis because I made them up. 
 I am the author of "The Dictionarynof Obscure Sorrows,",which I've been writingnfor the last seven years.,And the whole mission of the project,is to find holesnin the language of emotion,and try to fill them,so that we have a way of talkingnabout all those human peccadilloes,and quirks of the human condition,that we all feelnbut may not think to talk about,because we don't have the words to do it. 
 And about halfway through this project,,I defined "sonder,",the idea that we all think of ourselvesnas the main character,and everyone else is just extras.,But in reality,nwe're all the main character,,and you yourself are an extranin someone else's story.,And so as soon as I published that,,I got a lot of response from people,saying, "Thank you for giving voicento something I had felt all my life,but there was no word for that.",So it made them feel less alone.,That's the power of words,,to make us feel less alone. 
 And it was not long after that,that I started to notice sonder,being used earnestlynin conversations online,,and not long after I actually noticed it,,I caught it next to menin an actual conversation in person.,There is no stranger feelingnthan making up a word,and then seeing itntake on a mind of its own.,I don't have a wordnfor that yet, but I will. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm working on it. 
 I started to thinknabout what makes words real,,because a lot of people ask me,,the most common thingnI got from people is,,"Well, are these words made up?nI don't really understand.",And I didn't really know what to tell them,because once sonder started to take off,,who am I to say what wordsnare real and what aren't.,And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,nwho described his epiphany,as when he realized that most of us,nas we go through the day,,we just try to avoidnbouncing against the walls too much,and just sort of get on with things.,But once you realize that people --,that this world was builtnby people no smarter than you,,then you can reach outnand touch those walls,and even put your hand through them,and realize that you haventhe power to change it. 
 And when people ask me,n"Are these words real?",I had a variety of answersnthat I tried out.,Some of them made sense.nSome of them didn't.,But one of them I tried out was,,"Well, a word is realnif you want it to be real.",The way that this path is realnbecause people wanted it to be there. 
 (Laughter) 
 It happens on collegencampuses all the time.,It's called a "desire path." 
 (Laughter) 
 But then I decided,nwhat people are really asking,when they're asking if a word is real,nthey're really asking,,"Well, how many brainsnwill this give me access to?",Because I think that'sna lot of how we look at language.,A word is essentially a key,that gets us into certain people's heads.,And if it gets us into one brain,,it's not really worth it,,not really worth knowing.,Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is.,A million brains, OK, now we're talking.,And so a real word is one that gets younaccess to as many brains as you can.,That's what makes it worth knowing. 
 Incidentally, the realest word of allnby this measure is this. 
 [O.K.] 
 That's it.,The realest word we have.,That is the closest thing we havento a master key.,That's the most commonlynunderstood word in the world,,no matter where you are.,The problem with that is,,no one seems to knownwhat those two letters stand for. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which is kind of weird, right?,I mean, it could be a misspellingnof "all correct," I guess,,or "old kinderhook.",No one really seems to know,nbut the fact that it doesn't matter,says something aboutnhow we add meaning to words.,The meaning is notnin the words themselves.,We're the onesnthat pour ourselves into it. 
 And I think, when we're all searchingnfor meaning in our lives,,and searching for the meaning of life,,I think words havensomething to do with that.,And I think if you're lookingnfor the meaning of something,,the dictionary is a decent place to start.,It brings a sense of order,to a very chaotic universe.,Our view of things is so limited,that we have to come upnwith patterns and shorthands,and try to figure outna way to interpret it,and be able to get on with our day.,We need words to contain us,nto define ourselves. 
 I think a lot of us feel boxed in,by how we use these words.,We forget that words are made up.,It's not just my words.nAll words are made up,,but not all of them mean something.,We're all just sort ofntrapped in our own lexicons,that don't necessarily correlatenwith people who aren't already like us,,and so I think I feel us drifting apartna little more every year,,the more seriously we take words. 
 Because remember, words are not real.,They don't have meaning. We do. 
 And I'd like to leave you with a reading,from one of my favorite philosophers,,Bill Watterson, who createdn"Calvin and Hobbes.",He said,,"Creating a life that reflectsnyour values and satisfies your soul,is a rare achievement.,To invent your own life's meaning,is not easy,,but it is still allowed,,and I think you'll benhappier for the trouble." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to start by doing an experiment.,I'm going to play three videosnof a rainy day.,But I've replaced the audionof one of the videos,,and instead of the sound of rain,,I've added the sound of bacon frying.,So I want you think carefullynwhich one the clip with the bacon is. 
 (Rain falls) 
 (Rain falls) 
 (Rain falls) 
 All right.,Actually, I lied.,They're all bacon. 
 (Bacon sizzles) 
 (Applause) 
 My point here isn't reallynto make you hungry,every time you see a rainy scene,,but it's to show that our brainsnare conditioned to embrace the lies.,We're not looking for accuracy. 
 So on the subject of deception,,I wanted to quote onenof my favorite authors.,In "The Decay of Lying,"nOscar Wilde establishes the idea,that all bad art comes from copyingnnature and being realistic;,and all great art comesnfrom lying and deceiving,,and telling beautiful, untrue things.,So when you're watching a movie,and a phone rings,,it's not actually ringing.,It's been added laternin postproduction in a studio.,All of the sounds you hear are fake.,Everything, apart from the dialogue,,is fake.,When you watch a movie and you seena bird flapping its wings -- 
 (Wings flap) 
 They haven't really recorded the bird.,It sounds a lot more realisticnif you record a sheet,or shaking kitchen gloves. 
 (Flaps) 
 The burning of a cigarette up close -- 
 (Cigarette burns) 
 It actually sounds a lot more authentic,if you take a small Saran Wrap ball,and release it. 
 (A Saran Warp ball being released) 
 Punches? 
 (Punch) 
 Oops, let me play that again. 
 (Punch) 
 That's often done by stickingna knife in vegetables,,usually cabbage. 
 (Cabbage stabbed with a knife) 
 The next one -- it's breaking bones. 
 (Bones break) 
 Well, no one was really harmed.,It's actually ...,breaking celery or frozen lettuce. 
 (Breaking frozen lettuce or celery) 
 (Laughter) 
 Making the right soundsnis not always as easy,as a trip to the supermarket,and going to the vegetable section.,But it's often a lot morencomplicated than that.,So let's reverse-engineer together,the creation of a sound effect. 
 One of my favorite storiesncomes from Frank Serafine.,He's a contributor to our library,,and a great sound designer for "Tron"nand "Star Trek" and others.,He was part of the Paramount teamnthat won the Oscar for best sound,for "The Hunt for Red October.",In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,,they were asked to produce the soundnof the propeller of the submarine.,So they had a small problem:,they couldn't really findna submarine in West Hollywood.,So basically, what they did is,,they went to a friend's swimming pool,,and Frank performedna cannonball, or bomba.,They placed an underwater mic,and an overhead micnoutside the swimming pool.,So here's what the underwaternmic sounds like. 
 (Underwater plunge) 
 Adding the overhead mic,,it sounded a bit like this: 
 (Water splashes) 
 So now they took the soundnand pitched it one octave down,,sort of like slowing down a record. 
 (Water splashes at lower octave),And then they removedna lot of the high frequencies. 
 (Water splashes),And pitched it down another octave. 
 (Water splashes at lower octave),And then they addedna little bit of the splash,from the overhead microphone. 
 (Water splashes),And by looping and repeating that sound,,they got this: 
 (Propeller churns) 
 So, creativity and technology put togethernin order to create the illusion,that we're inside the submarine. 
 But once you've created your sounds,and you've synced them to the image,,you want those sounds to livenin the world of the story.,And one the best ways to donthat is to add reverb.,So this is the first audio toolnI want to talk about.,Reverberation, or reverb,nis the persistence of the sound,after the original sound has ended.,So it's sort of like the --,all the reflections from the materials,,the objects and the wallsnaround the sound. 
 Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.,The original sound is lessnthan half a second long. 
 (Gunshot),By adding reverb,,we can make it sound likenit was recorded inside a bathroom. 
 (Gunshot reverbs in bathroom),Or like it was recordedninside a chapel or a church. 
 (Gunshot reverbs church) 
 Or in a canyon. 
 (Gunshot reverbs in canyon) 
 So reverb gives us a lot of information,about the space between the listenernand the original sound source.,If the sound is the taste,,then reverb is sort of likenthe smell of the sound. 
 But reverb can do a lot more.,Listening to a soundnwith a lot less reverberation,than the on-screen action,is going to immediately signify to us,that we're listening to a commentator,,to an objective narrator that's notnparticipating in the on-screen action.,Also, emotionally intimatenmoments in cinema,are often heard with zero reverb,,because that's how it would soundnif someone was speaking inside our ear. 
 On the completely other side,,adding a lot of reverb to a voice,is going to make us thinknthat we're listening to a flashback,,or perhaps that we're insidenthe head of a character,or that we're listeningnto the voice of God.,Or, even more powerful in film,,Morgan Freeman. 
 (Laughter) 
 So -- 
 (Applause) 
 But what are some other tools or hacks,that sound designers use?,Well, here's a really big one.,It's silence.,A few moments of silencenis going to make us pay attention.,And in the Western world,,we're not really used to verbal silences.,They're considered awkward or rude.,So silence preceding verbal communication,can create a lot of tension.,But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,,where it's full of explosionsnand automatic guns.,Loud stops being loudnanymore, after a while.,So in a yin-yang way,,silence needs loudnessnand loudness needs silence,for either of them to have any effect. 
 But what does silence mean?,Well, it depends hownit's used in each film.,Silence can place us insidenthe head of a character,or provoke thought.,We often relate silences with ...,contemplation,,meditation,,being deep in thought.,But apart from having one meaning,,silence becomes a blank canvas,upon which the viewer is invitednto the paint their own thoughts. 
 But I want to make it clear:nthere is no such thing as silence.,And I know this sounds like the mostnpretentious TED Talk statement ever.,But even if you were to enterna room with zero reverberation,and zero external sounds,,you would still be able to hearnthe pumping of your own blood.,And in cinema, traditionally,nthere was never a silent moment,because of the sound of the projector.,And even in today's Dolby world,,there's not really any moment of silencenif you listen around you.,There's always some sort of noise. 
 Now, since there's no suchnthing as silence,,what do filmmakersnand sound designers use?,Well, as a synonym,nthey often use ambiences.,Ambiences are the unique background sounds,that are specific to each location.,Each location has a unique sound,,and each room has a unique sound,,which is called room tone.,So here's a recordingnof a market in Morocco. 
 (Voices, music) 
 And here's a recordingnof Times Square in New York. 
 (Traffic sounds, car horns, voices) 
 Room tone is the addition of allnthe noises inside the room:,the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.,Here's a recordingnof my apartment in Brooklyn. 
 (You can hear the ventilation, the boiler,nthe fridge and street traffic) 
 Ambiences work in a most primal way.,They can speak directlynto our brain subconsciously.,So, birds chirping outside your windownmay indicate normality,,perhaps because, as a species,,we've been used to that soundnevery morning for millions of years. 
 (Birds chirp),On the other hand, industrial soundsnhave been introduced to us,a little more recently.,Even though I really likenthem personally --,they've been used by onenof my heroes, David Lynch,,and his sound designer, Alan Splet --,industrial sounds often carrynnegative connotations. 
 (Machine noises) 
 Now, sound effects can tapninto our emotional memory.,Occasionally, they can be so significant,that they become a character in a movie.,The sound of thunder may indicatendivine intervention or anger. 
 (Thunder) 
 Church bells can remind usnof the passing of time,,or perhaps our own mortality. 
 (Bells ring) 
 And breaking of glass cannindicate the end of a relationship,or a friendship. 
 (Glass breaks) 
 Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,,for example, brass or windninstruments played very loud,,may remind us of animal howls in nature,and therefore create a sensenof irritation or fear. 
 (Brass and wind instruments play) 
 So now we've spokennabout on-screen sounds.,But occasionally, the sourcenof a sound cannot be seen.,That's what we call offscreen sounds,,or "acousmatic.",Acousmatic sounds --,well, the term "acousmatic" comesnfrom Pythagoras in ancient Greece,,who used to teach behindna veil or curtain for years,,not revealing himself to his disciples.,I think the mathematiciannand philosopher thought that,,in that way,,his students might focusnmore on the voice,,and his words and its meaning,,rather than the visual of him speaking.,So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,,or "1984's" Big Brother,,separating the voice from its source,,separating cause and effect,sort of creates a sensenof ubiquity or panopticism,,and therefore, authority. 
 There's a strong traditionnof acousmatic sound.,Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venicenused to sing in rooms,up in galleries close to the ceiling,,creating the illusion that we're listeningnto angels up in the sky.,Richard Wagner famouslyncreated the hidden orchestra,that was placed in a pitnbetween the stage and the audience.,And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin,nfamously hid in dark corners of clubs. 
 I think what all these masters knewnis that by hiding the source,,you create a sense of mystery.,This has been seennin cinema over and over,,with Hitchcock,nand Ridley Scott in "Alien.",Hearing a sound without knowing its source,is going to create some sort of tension.,Also, it can minimize certain visualnrestrictions that directors have,and can show somethingnthat wasn't there during filming.,And if all this soundsna little theoretical,,I wanted to play a little video. 
 (Toy squeaks) 
 (Typewriter) 
 (Drums) 
 (Ping-pong) 
 (Knives being sharpened) 
 (Record scratches) 
 (Saw cuts) 
 (Woman screams) 
 What I'm sort of tryingnto demonstrate with these tools,is that sound is a language.,It can trick us by transportingnus geographically;,it can change the mood;,it can set the pace;,it can make us laughnor it can make us scared. 
 On a personal level, I fellnin love with that language,a few years ago,,and somehow managed to make itninto some sort of profession.,And I think with our worknthrough the sound library,,we're trying to kind of expandnthe vocabulary of that language.,And in that way, we wantnto offer the right tools,to sound designers,,filmmakers,,and video game and app designers,,to keep telling even better stories,and creating even more beautiful lies. 
 So thanks for listening. 
 (Applause)Do you ever think about how importantnthe oceans are in our daily lives?,The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.,They provide half the oxygen we breathe.,They moderate our climate.,And they provide jobsnand medicine and food,including 20 percent of proteinnto feed the entire world population.,People used to thinknthat the oceans were so vast,that they wouldn't be affectednby human activities. 
 Well today I'm going to tell younabout a serious reality,that is changing our oceansncalled ocean acidification,,or the evil twin of climate change.,Did you know that the oceans have absorbedn25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide,that we have emitted to the atmosphere?,Now this is just another great servicenprovided by the oceans,since carbon dioxidenis one of the greenhouse gases,that's causing climate change.,But as we keep pumpingnmore and more and more,carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,more is dissolving into the oceans.,And this is what's changingnour ocean chemistry.,When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,,it undergoes a numbernof chemical reactions. 
 Now lucky for you,,I don't have time to get intonthe details of the chemistry for today.,But I'll tell you as morencarbon dioxide enters the ocean,,the seawater pH goes down.,And this basically means that therenis an increase in ocean acidity.,And this whole processnis called ocean acidification.,And it's happeningnalongside climate change.,Scientists have been monitoringnocean acidification for over two decades.,This figure is an importantntime series in Hawaii,,and the top line shows steadily increasingnconcentrations of carbon dioxide,,or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.,And this is directly as a resultnof human activities.,The line underneath shows the increasingnconcentrations of carbon dioxide,that is dissolvednin the surface of the ocean,which you can see is increasingnat the same rate,as carbon dioxide in the atmospherensince measurements began.,The line on the bottom showsnthen shows the change in chemistry.,As more carbon dioxidenhas entered the ocean,,the seawater pH has gone down,,which basically means there has beennan increase in ocean acidity.,Now in Ireland, scientists are alsonmonitoring ocean acidification --,scientists at the MarinenInstitute and NUI Galway.,And we, too, are seeingnacidification at the same rate,as these main ocean time-seriesnsites around the world.,So it's happening right at our doorstep. 
 Now I'd like to give you an examplenof just how we collect our data,to monitor a changing ocean.,Firstly we collect a lot of our samplesnin the middle of winter.,So as you can imagine,nin the North Atlantic,we get hit with some seriouslynstormy conditions --,so not for any of younwho get a little motion sickness,,but we are collectingnsome very valuable data.,So we lower this instrumentnover the side of the ship,,and there are sensorsnthat are mounted on the bottom,that can tell us information aboutnthe surrounding water,,such as temperaturenor dissolved oxygen.,And then we can collect our seawaternsamples in these large bottles.,So we start at the bottom,nwhich can be over four kilometers deep,just off our continental shelf,,and we take samples at regular intervalsnright up to the surface.,We take the seawater back on the deck,,and then we can eithernanalyze them on the ship,or back in the laboratorynfor the different chemicals parameters. 
 But why should we care?,How is ocean acidificationngoing to affect all of us?,Well, here are the worrying facts.,There has already been an increasenin ocean acidity of 26 percent,since pre-industrial times,nwhich is directly due to human activities.,Unless we can start slowing downnour carbon dioxide emissions,,we're expecting an increasenin ocean acidity of 170 percent,by the end of this century.,I mean this is withinnour children's lifetime.,This rate of acidificationnis 10 times faster,than any acidification in our oceansnfor over 55 million years.,So our marine life have never,never experienced,such a fast rate of change before.,So we literally could not knownhow they're going to cope. 
 Now there was a natural acidificationnevent millions of years ago,,which was much slowernthan what we're seeing today.,And this coincided with a mass extinctionnof many marine species.,So is that what we're headed for?,Well, maybe.,Studies are showingnsome species are actually doing quite well,but many are showing a negative response.,One of the big concerns isnas ocean acidity increases,,the concentration of carbonatenions in seawater decrease.,Now these ions are basicallynthe building blocks,for many marine speciesnto make their shells,,for example crabs or mussels, oysters. 
 Another example are corals.,They also need these carbonatenions in seawater,to make their coral structurenin order to build coral reefs.,As ocean acidity increases,and the concentrationnof carbonate ions decrease,,these species first find it more difficultnto make their shells.,And at even even lower levels,nthey can actually begin to dissolve. 
 This here is a pteropod,nit's called a sea butterfly.,And it's an important food sourcenin the ocean for many species,,from krill to salmon right up to whales.,The shell of the pteropodnwas placed into seawater,at a pH that we're expectingnby the end of this century.,After only 45 daysnat this very realistic pH,,you can see the shellnhas almost completely dissolved.,So ocean acidification could affectnright up through the food chain --,and right onto our dinner plates.,I mean who herenlikes shellfish? Or salmon?,Or many other fish species,whose food sourcenin the ocean could be affected? 
 These are cold-water corals.,And did you know we actually havencold-water corals in Irish waters,,just off our continental shelf?,And they support rich biodiversity,nincluding some very important fisheries.,It's projected thatnby the end of this century,,70 percent of all known cold-water coralsnin the entire ocean,will be surrounded by seawaternthat is dissolving their coral structure.,The last example I havenare these healthy tropical corals.,They were placed in seawater at a pHnwe're expecting by the year 2100.,After six months, the coralnhas almost completely dissolved.,Now coral reefs support,25 percent of all marine lifenin the entire ocean.,All marine life. 
 So you can see: oceannacidification is a global threat.,I have an eight-month-old baby boy.,Unless we start now to slow this down,,I dread to think what our oceansnwill look like when he's a grown man.,We will see acidification.,We have already put too muchncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere.,But we can slow this down.,We can prevent the worst-case scenario.,The only way of doing that,is by reducing ourncarbon dioxide emissions.,This is important for both you and I,nfor industry, for governments. 
 We need to work together,nslow down global warming,slow down ocean acidification,and help to maintain a healthy oceannand a healthy planet,for our generationnand for generations to come. 
 (Applause)Worldwide, over 1.5 billion peoplenexperience armed conflict.,In response, people are forcednto flee their country,,leaving over 15 million refugees.,Children, without a doubt,,are the most innocentnand vulnerable victims ...,but not just fromnthe obvious physical dangers,,but from the often unspoken effectsnthat wars have on their families.,The experiences of warnleave children at a real high risk,for the developmentnof emotional and behavioral problems.,Children, as we can only imagine,,will feel worried, threatened and at risk.,But there is good news.,The quality of carenthat children receive in their families,can have a more significantneffect on their well-being,than from the actual experiences of warnthat they have been exposed to.,So actually, children can be protected,by warm, secure parentingnduring and after conflict. 
 In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student,in the University of ManchesternSchool of Psychological Sciences.,Like many of you here,,I watched the crisis in Syrianunfold in front of me on the TV.,My family is originally from Syria,,and very early on,,I lost several family membersnin really horrifying ways.,I'd sit and I'd gather with my familynand watch the TV.,We've all seen those scenes:,bombs destroying buildings,,chaos, destruction,and people screaming and running.,It was always the people screamingnand running that really got me the most,,especially thosenterrified-looking children.,I was a mother to two young,ntypically inquisitive children.,They were five and six then,,at an age where they typicallynasked lots and lots of questions,,and expected real, convincing answers.,So, I began to wondernwhat it might be like,to parent my childrennin a war zone and a refugee camp.,Would my children change?,Would my daughter's bright,nhappy eyes lose their shine?,Would my son's really relaxed and carefreennature become fearful and withdrawn?,How would I cope?,Would I change? 
 As psychologists and parent trainers,,we know that arming parentsnwith skills in caring for their children,can have a huge effectnon their well-being,,and we call this parent training.,The question I had was,,could parent training programsnbe useful for families,while they were still in war zonesnor refugee camps?,Could we reach themnwith advice or training,that would help themnthrough these struggles?,So I approached my PhD supervisor,,Professor Rachel Calam,,with the idea of using my academic skillsnto make some change in the real world.,I wasn't quite surenwhat exactly I wanted to do.,She listened carefully and patiently,,and then to my joy she said,,"If that's what you want to do,nand it means so much to you,,then let's do it.,Let's find ways to see if parent programs,can be useful for familiesnin these contexts." 
 So for the past five years,nmyself and my colleagues --,Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright --,have been workingnon ways to support families,that have experiencednwar and displacement.,Now, to know how to help familiesnthat have been through conflict,support their children,,the first step must obviously bento ask them what they're struggling with,,right?,I mean, it seems obvious.,But it's often thosenthat are the most vulnerable,,that we're trying to support,,that we actually don't ask.,How many times have we just assumednwe know exactly the right thing,that's going to help someone or somethingnwithout actually asking them first? 
 So I travelled to refugee campsnin Syria and in Turkey,,and I sat with families, and I listened.,I listened to their parenting challenges,,I listened to their parenting struggles,and I listened to their call for help.,And sometimes that was just paused,,as all I could do was hold hands with them,and just join themnin silent crying and prayer.,They told me about their struggles,,they told me about the rough,nharsh refugee camp conditions,that made it hard to focusnon anything but practical chores,like collecting clean water.,They told me how they watchedntheir children withdraw;,the sadness, depression, anger,,bed-wetting, thumb-sucking,nfear of loud noises,,fear of nightmares --,terrifying, terrifying nightmares.,These families had been throughnwhat we had been watching on the TV.,The mothers --,almost half of themnwere now widows of war,,or didn't even knownif their husbands were dead or alive --,described how they feltnthey were coping so badly.,They watched their children changenand they had no idea how to help them.,They didn't know how to answerntheir children's questions. 
 What I found incredibly astonishingnand so motivational,was that these families werenso motivated to support their children.,Despite all these challenges they faced,,they were trying to help their children.,They were making attemptsnat seeking support from NGO workers,,from refugee camp teachers,,professional medics,,other parents.,One mother I met had only beennin a camp for four days,,and had already made two attempts,at seeking supportnfor her eight-year-old daughter,who was having terrifying nightmares.,But sadly, these attemptsnare almost always useless.,Refugee camp doctors, when available,,are almost always too busy,,or don't have the knowledge or the timenfor basic parenting supports.,Refugee camp teachers and other parentsnare just like them --,part of a new refugee communitynwho's struggling with new needs. 
 So then we began to think.,How could we help these families?,The families were struggling with thingsnmuch bigger than they could cope with.,The Syrian crisis made it clear,how incredibly impossible it would bento reach families on an individual level.,How else could we help them?,How would we reach familiesnat a population level,and low costs,in these terrifying, terrifying times? 
 After hours of speaking to NGO workers,,one suggested a fantastic innovative idea,of distributing parentingninformation leaflets via bread wrappers --,bread wrappers that were being deliverednto families in a conflict zone in Syria,by humanitarian workers.,So that's what we did.,The bread wrappers haven't changednat all in their appearance,,except for the additionnof two pieces of paper.,One was a parenting information leafletnthat had basic advice and information,that normalized to the parentnwhat they might be experiencing,,and what their childnmight be experiencing.,And information on how they couldnsupport themselves and their children,,such as information like spendingntime talking to your child,,showing them more affection,,being more patient with your child,,talking to your children.,The other piece of papernwas a feedback questionnaire,,and of course, there was a pen.,So is this simply leaflet distribution,,or is this actually a possible meansnof delivering psychological first aid,that provides warm,nsecure, loving parenting? 
 We managed to distributen3,000 of these in just one week.,What was incredible wasnwe had a 60 percent response rate.,60 percent of the 3,000nfamilies responded.,I don't know how manynresearchers we have here today,,but that kind of responsenrate is fantastic.,To have that in Manchesternwould be a huge achievement,,let alone in a conflict zone in Syria --,really highlighting how importantnthese kinds of messages were to families.,I remember how excited and eager we werenfor the return of the questionnaires.,The families had leftnhundreds of messages --,most incredibly positive and encouraging.,But my favorite has got to be,,"Thank you for not forgettingnabout us and our children.",This really illustratesnthe potential means,of the delivery of psychologicalnfirst aid to families,,and the return of feedback, too.,Just imagine replicating thisnusing other means,such as baby milk distribution,nor female hygiene kits,,or even food baskets. 
 But let's bring this closer to home,,because the refugee crisis,is one that is having an effectnon every single one of us.,We're bombarded with images dailynof statistics and of photos,,and that's not surprising,,because by last month,,over one million refugeesnhad reached Europe.,One million.,Refugees are joining our communities,,they're becoming our neighbors,,their children are attendingnour children's schools.,So we've adapted the leafletnto meet the needs of European refugees,,and we have them online, open-access,,in areas with a really highnrefugee influx.,For example, the Swedish healthcarenuploaded it onto their website,,and within the first 45 minutes,,it was downloaded 343 times --,really highlighting how important it is,for volunteers, practitionersnand other parents,to have open-access,npsychological first-aid messages. 
 In 2013, I was sitting on the cold,nhard floor of a refugee camp tent,with mothers sitting around menas I was conducting a focus group.,Across from me stood an elderly lady,with what seemed to bena 13-year-old girl lying beside her,,with her head on the elderly lady's knees.,The girl stayed quietnthroughout the focus group,,not talking at all,,with her kneesncurled up against her chest.,Towards the end of the focus group,,and as I was thankingnthe mothers for their time,,the elderly lady looked at menwhile pointing at the young girl,,and said to me, "Can you help us with...?",Not quite sure what she expected me to do,,I looked at the young girl and smiled,,and in Arabic I said,,"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?","What's your name?",She looked at me reallynconfused and unengaged,,but then said, "Halul.",Halul is the pet's namenfor the Arabic female name, Hala,,and is only really usednto refer to really young girls.,At that point I realized that actuallynHala was probably much older than 13.,It turns out Hala was a 25-year-oldnmother to three young children.,Hala had been a confident,nbright, bubbly, loving, caring mother,to her children,,but the war had changed all of that.,She had lived through bombsnbeing dropped in her town;,she had lived through explosions.,When fighter jetsnwere flying around their building,,dropping bombs,,her children would be screaming,nterrified from the noise.,Hala would frantically grab pillowsnand cover her children's ears,to block out the noise,,all the while screaming herself.,When they reached the refugee camp,and she knew they were finallynin some kind of safety,,she completely withdrewnto acting like her old childhood self.,She completely rejected her family --,her children, her husband.,Hala simply could no longer cope. 
 This is a parenting strugglenwith a really tough ending,,but sadly, it's not uncommon.,Those who experiencenarmed conflict and displacement,will face serious emotional struggles.,And that's something we can all relate to.,If you have been throughna devastating time in your life,,if you have lost someonenor something you really care about,,how would you continue to cope?,Could you still be ablento care for yourself and for your family? 
 Given that the first yearsnof a child's life are crucial,for healthy physicalnand emotional development,,and that 1.5 billion peoplenare experiencing armed conflict --,many of whom are nownjoining our communities --,we cannot afford to turn a blind eye,to the needs of thosenwho are experiencing war and displacement.,We must prioritizenthese families' needs --,both those who are internally displaced,nand those who are refugees worldwide.,These needs must be prioritizednby NGO workers, policy makers,,the WHO, the UNHCRnand every single one of us,in whatever capacity it isnthat we function in our society. 
 When we begin to recognizenthe individual faces of the conflict,,when we begin to noticenthose intricate emotions on their faces,,we begin to see them as humans, too.,We begin to seenthe needs of these families,,and these are the real human needs.,When these family needs are prioritized,,interventions for childrennin humanitarian settings,will prioritize and recognize the primarynrole of the family in supporting children.,Family mental healthnwill be shouting loud and clear,in global, international agenda.,And children will be less likelynto enter social service systems,in resettlement countries,because their familiesnwould have had support earlier on.,And we will be more open-minded,,more welcoming, more caring,and more trusting to thosenwho are joining our communities. 
 We need to stop wars.,We need to build a world where childrenncan dream of planes dropping gifts,,and not bombs.,Until we stop armed conflictsnraging throughout the world,,families will continue to be displaced,,leaving children vulnerable.,But by improving parentingnand caregiver support,,it may be possible to weaken the linksnbetween war and psychological difficulties,in children and their families. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There are times when I feelnreally quite ashamed,to be a European.,In the last year,,more than a million peoplenarrived in Europe in need of our help,,and our response,nfrankly, has been pathetic. 
 There are just so many contradictions.,We mourn the tragic death,of two-year-old Alan Kurdi,,and yet, since then,nmore than 200 children,have subsequently drownednin the Mediterranean.,We have international treaties,that recognize that refugeesnare a shared responsibility,,and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon,hosts more Syriansnthan the whole of Europe combined.,We lament the existencenof human smugglers,,and yet we make that the only viable route,to seek asylum in Europe.,We have labor shortages,,and yet we exclude people who fitnour economic and demographic needs,from coming to Europe.,We proclaim our liberal valuesnin opposition to fundamentalist Islam,,and yet --,we have repressive policies,that detain child asylum seekers,,that separate childrennfrom their families,,and that seize property from refugees. 
 What are we doing?,How has the situation come to this,,that we've adopted such an inhumanenresponse to a humanitarian crisis? 
 I don't believenit's because people don't care,,or at least I don't want to believenit's because people don't care.,I believe it's becausenour politicians lack a vision,,a vision for how to adaptnan international refugee system,created over 50 years ago,for a changing and globalized world.,And so what I want to donis take a step back,and ask two really fundamental questions,,the two questions we all need to ask.,First, why is the currentnsystem not working?,And second, what can we do to fix it? 
 So the modern refugee regime,was created in the aftermathnof the Second World War by these guys.,Its basic aim is to ensure,that when a state fails,nor worse, turns against its own people,,people have somewhere to go,,to live in safety and dignitynuntil they can go home.,It was created precisely for situationsnlike the situation we see in Syria today.,Through an international conventionnsigned by 147 governments,,the 1951 Conventionnon the Status of Refugees,,and an international organization, UNHCR,,states committed to reciprocallynadmit people onto their territory,who flee conflict and persecution. 
 But today, that system is failing.,In theory, refugeesnhave a right to seek asylum.,In practice, our immigration policiesnblock the path to safety.,In theory, refugees have a rightnto a pathway to integration,,or return to the countrynthey've come from.,But in practice, they get stucknin almost indefinite limbo.,In theory, refugeesnare a shared global responsibility.,In practice, geography meansnthat countries proximate the conflict,take the overwhelming majoritynof the world's refugees.,The system isn't brokennbecause the rules are wrong.,It's that we're not applying themnadequately to a changing world,,and that's what we need to reconsider. 
 So I want to explain to you a little bitnabout how the current system works.,How does the refugee regime actually work?,But not from a top-downninstitutional perspective,,rather from the perspective of a refugee.,So imagine a Syrian woman.,Let's call her Amira.,And Amira to me representsnmany of the people I've met in the region.,Amira, like around 25 percentnof the world's refugees,,is a woman with children,,and she can't go homenbecause she comes from this city,that you see before you, Homs,,a once beautiful and historic city,now under rubble.,And so Amira can't go back there.,But Amira also has no hopenof resettlement to a third country,,because that's a lottery ticket,only available to less than one percentnof the world's refugees. 
 So Amira and her family,face an almost impossible choice.,They have three basic options.,The first option is that Amirancan take her family to a camp.,In the camp, she might get assistance,,but there are very few prospectsnfor Amira and her family.,Camps are in bleak, arid locations,,often in the desert.,In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,,you can hear the shellsnacross the border in Syria at nighttime.,There's restricted economic activity.,Education is often of poor quality.,And around the world,,some 80 percent of refugeesnwho are in camps,have to stay for at least five years.,It's a miserable existence,,and that's probably why, in reality,,only nine percent of Syriansnchoose that option. 
 Alternatively, Amira can headnto an urban area,in a neighboring country,nlike Amman or Beirut.,That's an option that about 75 percentnof Syrian refugees have taken.,But there, there'sngreat difficulty as well.,Refugees in such urban areasndon't usually have the right to work.,They don't usually getnsignificant access to assistance.,And so when Amira and her familynhave used up their basic savings,,they're left with very littlenand likely to face urban destitution. 
 So there's a third alternative,,and it's one that increasingnnumbers of Syrians are taking.,Amira can seek some hope for her family,by risking their livesnon a dangerous and perilous journey,to another country,,and it's that which we're seeingnin Europe today. 
 Around the world, we present refugeesnwith an almost impossible choice,between three options:,encampment, urban destitutionnand dangerous journeys.,For refugees, that choice isnthe global refugee regime today.,But I think it's a false choice.,I think we can reconsider that choice.,The reason why we limit those options,is because we think,that those are the only optionsnthat are available to refugees,,and they're not.,Politicians frame the issuenas a zero-sum issue,,that if we benefit refugees,nwe're imposing costs on citizens.,We tend to have a collective assumption,that refugees are an inevitable costnor burden to society.,But they don't have to.nThey can contribute. 
 So what I want to argue,is there are ways in which we cannexpand that choice set,and still benefit everyone else:,the host states and communities,,our societies and refugees themselves.,And I want to suggest four ways,we can transform the paradigmnof how we think about refugees.,All four ways have one thing in common:,they're all ways in which we takenthe opportunities of globalization,,mobility and markets,,and update the way we thinknabout the refugee issue. 
 The first one I want to think about,is the idea of enabling environments,,and it starts fromna very basic recognition,that refugees are human beingsnlike everyone else,,but they're justnin extraordinary circumstances.,Together with my colleagues in Oxford,,we've embarked onna research project in Uganda,looking at the economic lives of refugees.,We chose Uganda not becausenit's representative of all host countries.,It's not. It's exceptional.,Unlike most host countriesnaround the world,,what Uganda has done,is give refugees economic opportunity.,It gives them the right to work.nIt gives them freedom of movement.,And the results of that are extraordinary,both for refugees and the host community.,In the capital city, Kampala,,we found that 21 percent of refugeesnown a business that employs other people,,and 40 percent of those employees,are nationals of the host country.,In other words, refugees are making jobs,for citizens of the host country.,Even in the camps,nwe found extraordinary examples,of vibrant, flourishingnand entrepreneurial businesses. 
 For example, in a settlementncalled Nakivale,,we found examples of Congolese refugees,running digital music exchange businesses.,We found a Rwandannwho runs a business that's available,to allow the youth to play computer games,on recycled games consolesnand recycled televisions.,Against the odds of extreme constraint,,refugees are innovating,,and the gentleman you see before younis a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.,Demou-Kay arrivednin the settlement with very little,,but he wanted to be a filmmaker.,So with friends and colleagues,nhe started a community radio station,,he rented a video camera,,and he's now making films.,He made two documentary films,with and for our team,,and he's making a successful businessnout of very little.,It's those kinds of examples,that should guidenour response to refugees.,Rather than seeing refugees,as inevitably dependentnupon humanitarian assistance,,we need to provide themnwith opportunities for human flourishing. 
 Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food,are all important in the emergency phase,,but we need to also look beyond that.,We need to provide opportunitiesnto connectivity, electricity,,education, the right to work,,access to capital and banking.,All the ways in which we take for granted,that we are plugged innto the global economy,can and should apply to refugees. 
 The second idea I want to discussnis economic zones.,Unfortunately, not everynhost country in the world,takes the approach Uganda has taken.,Most host countries don't open upntheir economies to refugees,in the same way.,But there are still pragmaticnalternative options that we can use. 
 Last April, I traveled to Jordannwith my colleague,,the development economist Paul Collier,,and we brainstormed an ideanwhile we were there,with the international communitynand the government,,an idea to bring jobs to Syrians,while supporting Jordan'snnational development strategy.,The idea is for an economic zone,,one in which we could potentiallynintegrate the employment of refugees,alongside the employmentnof Jordanian host nationals.,And just 15 minutes awaynfrom the Zaatari refugee camp,,home to 83,000 refugees,,is an existing economic zone,called the King HusseinnBin Talal Development Area.,The government has spentnover a hundred million dollars,connecting it to the electricity grid,nconnecting it to the road network,,but it lacked two things:,access to labor and inward investment.,So what if refugeesnwere able to work there,rather than being stuck in camps,,able to support their families and developnskills through vocational training,before they go back to Syria?,We recognized thatnthat could benefit Jordan,,whose development strategynrequires it to make the leap,as a middle income countrynto manufacturing.,It could benefit refugees,nbut it could also contribute,to the postconflictnreconstruction of Syria,by recognizing that we neednto incubate refugees,as the best sourcenof eventually rebuilding Syria. 
 We published the ideanin the journal Foreign Affairs.,King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.,It was announced at the LondonnSyria Conference two weeks ago,,and a pilot will begin in the summer. 
 (Applause) 
 The third idea that I want to put to you,is preference matchingnbetween states and refugees,to lead to the kinds of happy outcomesnyou see here in the selfie,featuring Angela Merkelnand a Syrian refugee.,What we rarely do is ask refugeesnwhat they want, where they want to go,,but I'd argue we can do that,and still make everyone better off.,The economist Alvin Roth has developednthe idea of matching markets,,ways in which the preference rankingnof the parties shapes an eventual match.,My colleagues Will Jonesnand Alex Teytelboym,have explored ways in which that ideancould be applied to refugees,,to ask refugees to rankntheir preferred destinations,,but also allow states to ranknthe types of refugees they want,on skills criteria or language criteria,and allow those to match.,Now, of coursenyou'd need to build in quotas,on things like diversitynand vulnerability,,but it's a way of increasingnthe possibilities of matching.,The matching ideanhas been successfully used,to match, for instance,nstudents with university places,,to match kidney donors with patients,,and it underlies the kind of algorithmsnthat exist on dating websites.,So why not apply thatnto give refugees greater choice? 
 It could also be usednat the national level,,where one of the great challenges we face,is to persuade local communitiesnto accept refugees.,And at the moment,nin my country, for instance,,we often send engineers to rural areasnand farmers to the cities,,which makes no sense at all.,So matching markets offer a potential waynto bring those preferences together,and listen to the needs and demandsnof the populations that host,and the refugees themselves. 
 The fourth idea I want to put to younis of humanitarian visas.,Much of the tragedy and chaosnwe've seen in Europe,was entirely avoidable.,It stems from a fundamental contradictionnin Europe's asylum policy,,which is the following:,that in order to seek asylum in Europe,,you have to arrive spontaneouslynby embarking on those dangerous journeys,that I described.,But why should those journeys be necessarynin an era of the budget airline,and modern consular capabilities?,They're completely unnecessary journeys,,and last year, they led to the deathsnof over 3,000 people,on Europe's bordersnand within European territory. 
 If refugees were simply allowed,to travel directlynand seek asylum in Europe,,we would avoid that,,and there's a way of doing that,through somethingncalled a humanitarian visa,,that allows peoplento collect a visa at an embassy,or a consulate in a neighboring country,and then simply pay their own way,through a ferry or a flight to Europe.,It costs around a thousand euros,to take a smugglernfrom Turkey to the Greek islands.,It costs 200 euros to take a budgetnairline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.,If we allowed refugees to do that,nit would have major advantages.,It would save lives,,it would undercutnthe entire market for smugglers,,and it would remove the chaosnwe see from Europe's front line,in areas like the Greek islands.,It's politics that prevents us doing thatnrather than a rational solution. 
 And this is an idea that has been applied.,Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach,where over 2,000 Syriansnhave been able to get humanitarian visas,,enter Brazil, and claim refugee statusnon arrival in Brazil.,And in that scheme,nevery Syrian who has gone through it,has received refugee statusnand been recognized as a genuine refugee. 
 There is a historical precedentnfor it as well.,Between 1922 and 1942,,these Nansen passportsnwere used as travel documents,to allow 450,000 Assyrians,nTurks and Chechens,to travel across Europe,and claim refugee statusnelsewhere in Europe.,And the NansennInternational Refugee Office,received the Nobel Peace Prize,in recognition of thisnbeing a viable strategy. 
 So all four of these ideasnthat I've presented you,are ways in which we can expandnAmira's choice set.,They're ways in which we can havengreater choice for refugees,beyond those basic,nimpossible three options,I explained to you,and still leave others better off. 
 In conclusion,nwe really need a new vision,,a vision that enlargesnthe choices of refugees,but recognizes that theyndon't have to be a burden.,There's nothing inevitablenabout refugees being a cost.,Yes, they are a humanitariannresponsibility,,but they're human beingsnwith skills, talents, aspirations,,with the ability to makencontributions -- if we let them. 
 In the new world,,migration is not going to go away.,What we've seen in Europenwill be with us for many years.,People will continue to travel,,they'll continue to be displaced,,and we need to find rational,nrealistic ways of managing this --,not based on the old logicsnof humanitarian assistance,,not based on logics of charity,,but building on the opportunities,offered by globalization,nmarkets and mobility.,I'd urge you all to wake upnand urge our politicians,to wake up to this challenge. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)1.3 billion years ago,,in a distant, distant galaxy,,two black holes locked into a spiral,,falling inexorably towards each other,and collided,,converting three Suns' worth of stuff,into pure energy in a tenth of a second.,For that brief moment in time,,the glow was brighter than all the stars,in all the galaxies,in all of the known Universe.,It was a very,big,bang. 
 But they didn't releasentheir energy in light.,I mean, you know, they're black holes.,All that energy was pumpedninto the fabric of space and time itself,,making the Universe explodenin gravitational waves. 
 Let me give you a sensenof the timescale at work here.,1.3 billion years ago,,Earth had just managed to evolvenmulticellular life.,Since then, Earth has made and evolved,corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, peoplenand even -- God save us -- the Internet.,And about 25 years ago,,a particularly audacious set of people --,Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thornenand Ronald Drever at Caltech --,decided that it would be really neat,to build a giant laser detector,with which to searchnfor the gravitational waves,from things like colliding black holes. 
 Now, most people thought they were nuts.,But enough people realizednthat they were brilliant nuts,that the US National Science Foundationndecided to fund their crazy idea.,So after decades of development,,construction and imagination,and a breathtaking amount of hard work,,they built their detector, called LIGO:,The Laser InterferometernGravitational-Wave Observatory. 
 For the last several years,,LIGO's been undergoingna huge expansion in its accuracy,,a tremendous improvementnin its detection ability.,It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result. 
 In early September of 2015,,LIGO turned on for a final test run,while they sorted outna few lingering details.,And on September 14 of 2015,,just days after the detectornhad gone live,,the gravitational wavesnfrom those colliding black holes,passed through the Earth.,And they passed through you and me.,And they passed through the detector. 
 (Audio) Scott Hughes:nThere's two moments in my life,more emotionally intense than that.,One is the birth of my daughter.,The other is when I had to say goodbyento my father when he was terminally ill.,You know, it was the payoffnof my career, basically.,Everything I'd been working on --nit's no longer science fiction! (Laughs) 
 Allan Adams: So that's my very good friendnand collaborator, Scott Hughes,,a theoretical physicist at MIT,,who has been studyingngravitational waves from black holes,and the signals that they could impartnon observatories like LIGO,,for the past 23 years. 
 So let me take a moment to tell younwhat I mean by a gravitational wave.,A gravitational wave is a ripple,in the shape of space and time.,As the wave passes by,,it stretches space and everything in it,in one direction,,and compresses it in the other.,This has led to countless instructorsnof general relativity,doing a really silly dance to demonstratenin their classes on general relativity.,"It stretches and expands,nit stretches and expands." 
 So the trouble with gravitational waves,is that they're very weak;nthey're preposterously weak.,For example, the waves that hit usnon September 14 --,and yes, every single one of younstretched and compressed,under the action of that wave --,when the waves hit, they stretchednthe average person,by one part in 10 to the 21.,That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,,and a one.,That's why everyone thoughtnthe LIGO people were nuts.,Even with a laser detector five kilometersnlong -- and that's already crazy --,they would have to measurenthe length of those detectors,to less than one thousandthnof the radius of the nucleus,of an atom.,And that's preposterous. 
 So towards the endnof his classic text on gravity,,LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne,described the huntnfor gravitational waves as follows:,He said, "The technical difficultiesnto be surmounted,in constructing such detectors,are enormous.,But physicists are ingenious,,and with the supportnof a broad lay public,,all obstacles will surely be overcome.",Thorne published that in 1973,,42 years before he succeeded. 
 Now, coming back to LIGO,,Scott likes to say that LIGOnacts like an ear,more than it does like an eye.,I want to explain what that means.,Visible light has a wavelength, a size,,that's much smallernthan the things around you,,the features on people's faces,,the size of your cell phone.,And that's really useful,,because it lets you make an imagenor a map of the things around you,,by looking at the lightncoming from different spots,in the scene about you. 
 Sound is different.,Audible sound has a wavelengthnthat can be up to 50 feet long.,And that makes it really difficult --,in fact, in practical purposes,nimpossible -- to make an image,of something you really care about.,Your child's face.,Instead, we use soundnto listen for features like pitch,and tone and rhythm and volume,to infer a story behind the sounds.,That's Alice talking.,That's Bob interrupting.,Silly Bob. 
 So, the same is truenof gravitational waves.,We can't use them to make simple imagesnof things out in the Universe.,But by listening to changes,in the amplitude and frequencynof those waves,,we can hear the storynthat those waves are telling.,And at least for LIGO,,the frequencies that it can hearnare in the audio band.,So if we convert the wave patternsninto pressure waves and air, into sound,,we can literally hearnthe Universe speaking to us.,For example, listening to gravity,njust in this way,,can tell us a lot about the collisionnof two black holes,,something my colleague Scott has spentnan awful lot of time thinking about. 
 (Audio) SH: If the two black holesnare non-spinning,,you get a very simple chirp: whoop!,If the two bodies are spinningnvery rapidly, I have that same chirp,,but with a modulation on top of it,,so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!,It's sort of the vocabulary of spinnimprinted on this waveform. 
 AA: So on September 14, 2015,,a date that's definitelyngoing to live in my memory,,LIGO heard this: 
 [Whirring sound] 
 So if you know how to listen,nthat is the sound of -- 
 (Audio) SH: ... two black holes,neach of about 30 solar masses,,that were whirling around at a rate,comparable to what goes onnin your blender. 
 AA: It's worth pausing herento think about what that means.,Two black holes, the densest thingnin the Universe,,one with a mass of 29 Suns,and one with a mass of 36 Suns,,whirling around each othern100 times per second,before they collide.,Just imagine the power of that.,It's fantastic.,And we know it because we heard it. 
 That's the lasting importance of LIGO.,It's an entirely new waynto observe the Universe,that we've never had before.,It's a way that lets us hear the Universe,and hear the invisible. 
 And there's a lot out therenthat we can't see --,in practice or even in principle.,So supernova, for example:,I would love to know why very massivenstars explode in supernovae.,They're very useful;,we've learned a lotnabout the Universe from them.,The problem is, all the interestingnphysics happens in the core,,and the core is hidden behindnthousands of kilometers,of iron and carbon and silicon.,We'll never see through it,nit's opaque to light.,Gravitational waves go through ironnas if it were glass --,totally transparent.,The Big Bang: I would lovento be able to explore,the first few moments of the Universe,,but we'll never see them,,because the Big Bang itselfnis obscured by its own afterglow.,With gravitational waves,,we should be able to seenall the way back to the beginning.,Perhaps most importantly,,I'm positive that therenare things out there,that we've never seen,that we may never be able to see,and that we haven't even imagined --,things that we'll onlyndiscover by listening. 
 And in fact, evennin that very first event,,LIGO found things that we didn't expect.,Here's my colleague and one of the keynmembers of the LIGO collaboration,,Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT,naddressing exactly that: 
 (Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of starsnwhich produce the black holes,that we observed here,are the dinosaurs of the Universe.,They're these massive thingsnthat are old, from prehistoric times,,and the black holes are kind of likenthe dinosaur bones,with which we do this archeology.,So it lets us really getna whole nother angle,on what's out there in the Universe,and how the stars came to be,nand in the end, of course,,how we came to be out of this whole mess. 
 AA: Our challenge now,is to be as audacious as possible.,Thanks to LIGO, we know hownto build exquisite detectors,that can listen to the Universe,,to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.,Our job is to dream up and buildnnew observatories --,a whole new generation of observatories --,on the ground, in space.,I mean, what could be more gloriousnthan listening to the Big Bang itself?,Our job now is to dream big.,Dream with us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've got a confession.,I love looking through people's garbage.,Now, it's not some creepy thing.,I'm usually just lookingnfor old electronics,,stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.,I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.,Each one's got three different motors,,so now you can build things that move.,There's switches so you cannturn things on and off.,There's even a freaking laser,,so you can make a cool robotninto an awesome robot. 
 Now, I've builtna lot of stuff out of garbage,,and some of these thingsnhave even been kind of useful.,But here's the thing,,for me, garbage is just a chance to play,,to be creative and build thingsnto amuse myself.,This is what I love doing,nso I just made it part of my day job.,I lead a university-basednbiological research lab,,where we value curiositynand exploration above all else.,We aren't focusednon any particular problem,,and we're not trying to solvenany particular disease.,This is just a place where people can come,and ask fascinating questionsnand find answers.,And I realized a long time ago,that if I challenge peoplento build the equipment they need,out of the garbage I find,,it's a great way to foster creativity.,And what happened,was that artists and scientistsnfrom around the world,started coming to my lab.,And it's not just becausenwe value unconventional ideas,,it's because we test and validate them,with scientific rigor. 
 So one day I was hacking something,nI was taking it apart,,and I had this sudden idea:,Could I treat biology like hardware?,Could I dismantle a biological system,,mix and match the parts,and then put it back togethernin some new and creative way?,My lab started working on this,,and I want to show you the result. 
 Can any of you guysntell me what fruit this is? 
 Audience: Apple! 
 Andrew Pelling:nThat's right -- it's an apple.,Now, I actually want you to notice as well,that this is a lot reddernthan most apples.,And that's becausenwe grew human cells into it.,We took a totally innocentnMacintosh apple,,removed all the apple cells and DNA,and then implanted human cells.,And what we're left withnafter removing all the apple cells,is this cellulose scaffold.,This is the stuff that gives plantsntheir shape and texture.,And these little holes that you can see,,this is where allnthe apple cells used to be.,So then we come along,,we implant some mammalian cellsnthat you can see in blue.,What happens is,nthese guys start multiplying,and they fill up this entire scaffold. 
 As weird as this is,,it's actually really reminiscentnof how our own tissues are organized.,And we found in our pre-clinical work,that you can implantnthese scaffolds into the body,,and the body will send in cellsnand a blood supply,and actually keep these things alive.,This is the pointnwhen people started asking me,,"Andrew, can you makenbody parts out of apples?",And I'm like, "You've comento the right place." 
 (Laughter) 
 I actually brought this up with my wife.,She's a musical instrument maker,,and she does a lotnof wood carving for a living.,So I asked her,,"Could you, like,nliterally carve some ears,out of an apple for us?",And she did.,So I took her ears to the lab.,We then started preparing them.,Yeah, I know. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a good lab, man. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then we grew cells on them.,And this is the result. 
 Listen, my lab is notnin the ear-manufacturing business.,People have actually been workingnon this for decades.,Here's the issue:,commercial scaffolds can benreally expensive and problematic,,because they're sourcednfrom proprietary products,,animals or cadavers.,We used an apple and it cost pennies. 
 What's also really cool here,is it's not that hardnto make these things.,The equipment you needncan be built from garbage,,and the key processing stepnonly requires soap and water.,So what we did was put allnthe instructions online as open source.,And then we foundedna mission-driven company,,and we're developing kitsnto make it easier,for anyone with a sinknand a soldering iron,to make these things at home.,What I'm really curiousnabout is if one day,,it will be possible to repair, rebuildnand augment our own bodies,with stuff we make in the kitchen. 
 Speaking of kitchens,,here's some asparagus.,They're tasty, and they makenyour pee smell funny. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I was in my kitchen,nand I was noticing,that when you look downnthe stalks of these asparagus,,what you can seenare all these tiny little vessels.,And when we image them in the lab,,you can see how the cellulosenforms these structures.,This image reminds me of two things:,our blood vessels,and the structure and organizationnof our nerves and spinal cord. 
 So here's the question:,Can we grow axons and neuronsndown these channels?,Because if we can,,then maybe we can use asparagusnto form new connections,between the ends of damagednand severed nerves.,Or maybe even a spinal cord.,Don't get me wrong --,this is exceptionally challenging,and really hard work to do,,and we are not the only onesnworking on this.,But we are the only ones using asparagus. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right now, we've gotnreally promising pilot data.,And we're working with tissue engineers,and neurosurgeons,to find out what's actually possible. 
 So listen, all of the work I've shown you,,the stuff that I've builtnthat's all around me on this stage,and the other projectsnmy lab is involved in,are all a direct resultnof me playing with your garbage.,Play -- play is a key partnof my scientific practice.,It's how I train my mindnto be unconventional and to be creative,and to decide to make human apple ears. 
 So, the next time any of younare looking at some old,,broken-down, malfunctioning,npiece-of-crap technology,,I want you to think of me.,Because I want it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Seriously, please find any waynto get in touch with me,,and let's see what we can build. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So this is my niece.,Her name is Yahli.,She is nine months old.,Her mum is a doctor,nand her dad is a lawyer.,By the time Yahli goes to college,,the jobs her parents donare going to look dramatically different. 
 In 2013, researchers at Oxford Universityndid a study on the future of work.,They concluded that almost onenin every two jobs have a high risk,of being automated by machines.,Machine learning is the technology,that's responsible for mostnof this disruption.,It's the most powerful branchnof artificial intelligence.,It allows machines to learn from data,and mimic some of the thingsnthat humans can do.,My company, Kaggle, operatesnon the cutting edge of machine learning.,We bring togethernhundreds of thousands of experts,to solve important problemsnfor industry and academia.,This gives us a unique perspectivenon what machines can do,,what they can't do,and what jobs they mightnautomate or threaten. 
 Machine learning started making its wayninto industry in the early '90s.,It started with relatively simple tasks.,It started with things like assessingncredit risk from loan applications,,sorting the mail by readingnhandwritten characters from zip codes.,Over the past few years, we have madendramatic breakthroughs.,Machine learning is now capablenof far, far more complex tasks.,In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community,to build an algorithmnthat could grade high-school essays.,The winning algorithmsnwere able to match the grades,given by human teachers.,Last year, we issuednan even more difficult challenge.,Can you take images of the eyenand diagnose an eye disease,called diabetic retinopathy?,Again, the winning algorithmsnwere able to match the diagnoses,given by human ophthalmologists. 
 Now, given the right data,nmachines are going to outperform humans,at tasks like this.,A teacher might read 10,000 essaysnover a 40-year career.,An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.,A machine can read millions of essaysnor see millions of eyes,within minutes.,We have no chance of competingnagainst machines,on frequent, high-volume tasks. 
 But there are things we can donthat machines can't do.,Where machines have madenvery little progress,is in tackling novel situations.,They can't handle thingsnthey haven't seen many times before.,The fundamental limitationsnof machine learning,is that it needs to learnnfrom large volumes of past data.,Now, humans don't.,We have the ability to connectnseemingly disparate threads,to solve problems we've never seen before. 
 Percy Spencer was a physicistnworking on radar during World War II,,when he noticed the magnetronnwas melting his chocolate bar.,He was able to connect his understandingnof electromagnetic radiation,with his knowledge of cooking,in order to invent -- any guesses? --nthe microwave oven. 
 Now, this is a particularly remarkablenexample of creativity.,But this sort of cross-pollinationnhappens for each of us in small ways,thousands of times per day.,Machines cannot compete with us,when it comes to tacklingnnovel situations,,and this puts a fundamental limitnon the human tasks,that machines will automate. 
 So what does this meannfor the future of work?,The future state of any single job liesnin the answer to a single question:,To what extent is that job reduciblento frequent, high-volume tasks,,and to what extent does it involventackling novel situations?,On frequent, high-volume tasks,nmachines are getting smarter and smarter.,Today they grade essays.nThey diagnose certain diseases.,Over coming years,nthey're going to conduct our audits,,and they're going to read boilerplatenfrom legal contracts.,Accountants and lawyers are still needed.,They're going to be needednfor complex tax structuring,,for pathbreaking litigation.,But machines will shrink their ranks,and make these jobs harder to come by. 
 Now, as mentioned,,machines are not making progressnon novel situations.,The copy behind a marketing campaignnneeds to grab consumers' attention.,It has to stand out from the crowd.,Business strategy meansnfinding gaps in the market,,things that nobody else is doing.,It will be humans that are creatingnthe copy behind our marketing campaigns,,and it will be humans that are developingnour business strategy. 
 So Yahli, whatever you decide to do,,let every day bring you a new challenge.,If it does, then you will staynahead of the machines. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I come from one of the most liberal,,tolerant, progressive placesnin the United States,,Seattle, Washington.,And I grew up with a familynof great Seattlites.,My mother was an artist,nmy father was a college professor,,and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,,because I always felt completelyncomfortable designing my life,exactly as I saw fit. 
 And in point of fact,,I took a route that was not exactlynwhat my parents had in mind.,When I was 19, I dropped out of college --,dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I went on the roadnas a professional French horn player,,which was my lifelong dream.,I played chamber musicnall over the United States and Europe,,and I toured for a couple of years,with a great jazz guitar playernnamed Charlie Bird.,And by the end of my 20s,,I wound up as a member of the BarcelonanSymphony Orchestra in Spain.,What a great life. 
 And you know, my parents never complained.,They supported me all the way through it.,It wasn't their dream.,They used to tellntheir neighbors and friends,,"Our son, he's taking a gap decade." 
 (Laughter) 
 And --,There was, however, one awkwardnconversation about my lifestyle,that I want to tell you about.,I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,,and I was visitingnmy parents for Christmas,,and I was cooking dinner with my mother,nand we were alone in the kitchen.,And she was quiet, too quiet.,Something was wrong.,And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?",And she said, "Your dad and Inare really worried about you.",And I said, "What?"nI mean, what could it be, at this point?,And she said, "I want you to bencompletely honest with me:,have you been voting for Republicans?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the truth is,,I wasn't really political,nI was just a French horn player.,But I had a bit of an epiphany,,and they had detected it,nand it was causing some confusion.,You see, I had becomenan enthusiast for capitalism,,and I want to tell you why that is.,It stems from a lifelong interest of mine,in, believe it or not, poverty. 
 See, when I was a kidngrowing up in Seattle,,I remember the first timenI saw real poverty.,We were a lower middle class family,nbut that's of course not real poverty.,That's not even close.,The first time I saw poverty,nand poverty's face,,was when I was sixnor seven years old, early 1970s.,And it was like a lot of you,nkind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.,It was a picture in the NationalnGeographic Magazine,of a kid who was my age in East Africa,,and there were flies on his facenand a distended belly.,And he wasn't going to make it,nand I knew that, and I was helpless.,Some of you remember that picture,,not exactly that picture,none just like it.,It introduced the Westnto grinding poverty around the world.,Well, that vision kind of haunted menas I grew up and I went to school,and I dropped out and dropped in,and started my family.,And I wondered, what happened to that kid?,Or to people just like himnall over the world?,And so I started to study,neven though I wasn't in college,,I was looking for the answer:,what happened to the world'snpoorest people?,Has it gotten worse?nHas it gotten better? What? 
 And I found the answer,nand it changed my life,,and I want to share it with you. 
 See --,most Americans believenthat poverty has gotten worse,since we were children,nsince they saw that vision.,If you ask Americans, "Has povertyngotten worse or better around the world?",,70 percent will say that hungernhas gotten worse since the early 1970s.,But here's the truth.,Here's the epiphany that I hadnthat changed my thinking.,From 1970 until today,,the percentage of the world's population,living in starvation levels,,living on a dollar a day or less,nobviously adjusted for inflation,,that percentage has declined,by 80 percent.,There's been an 80 percent declinenin the world's worst poverty,since I was a kid.,And I didn't even know about it.,This, my friends, that's a miracle.,That's something we ought to celebrate.,It's the greatest antipoverty achievementnin the history of mankind,,and it happened in our lifetimes. 
 (Applause) 
 So when I learned this, I asked,nwhat did that? What made it possible?,Because if you don't know why,nyou can't do it again.,If you want to replicate it,and get the next two billionnpeople out of poverty,,because that's what we're talking about:nsince I was a kid,,two billion of the least of these,nour brothers and sisters,,have been pulled out of poverty.,I want the next two billion,nso I've got to know why.,And I went in search of an answer.,And it wasn't a political answer,nbecause I didn't care.,You know what, I still don't care.,I wanted the best answernfrom mainstream economists,left, right and center. 
 And here it is.,Here are the reasons.,There are five reasons that two billionnof our brothers and sisters,have been pulled out of povertynsince I was a kid.,Number one: globalization.,Number two: free trade.,Number three: property rights.,Number four: rule of law.,Number five: entrepreneurship.,It was the free enterprise systemnspreading around the world,after 1970 that did that. 
 Now, I'm not naive.,I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,,and I know that free enterprisenisn't everything we need,to build a better world.,But that is great.,And that's beyond politics.,Here's what I learned.nThis is the epiphany.,Capitalism is not just about accumulation.,At its best, it's about aspiration,,which is what so many peoplenon this stage talk about,,is the aspiration that comes from dreams,that are embeddednin the free enterprise system.,And we've got to share itnwith more people. 
 Now, I want to tell younabout a second epiphany,that's related to that first one,that I think can bring us progress,nnot just around the world,,but right here at home.,The best quote I've ever heard,to summarize the thoughtsnthat I've just given you,about pulling people out of poverty,is as follows:,"Free markets have created more wealthnthan any system in history.,They have lifted billions out of poverty." 
 Who said it?,It sounds like Milton Friedmannor Ronald Reagan.,Wrong.,President Barack Obama said that.,Why do I know it by heart?,Because he said it to me.,Crazy.,And I said, "Hallelujah.",But more than that, I said,,"What an opportunity." 
 You know what I was thinking?,It was at an eventnthat we were doing on the subject,at Georgetown University in May of 2015.,And I thought, this is the solution,to the biggest problemnfacing America today. What?,It's coming together around these ideas,,liberals and conservatives,,to help people who need us the most. 
 Now, I don't have to tell anybodynin this room that we're in a crisis,,in America and many countries aroundnthe world with political polarization.,It's risen to critical, crisis levels.,It's unpleasant. It's not right.,There was an article last year,in the Proceedingsnof the National Academy of Sciences,,which is one of the mostnprestigious scientific journals,published in the West.,And it was an article in 2014,on political motive asymmetry.,What's that? That's what psychologistsncall the phenomenon,of assuming that your ideologynis based in love,but your opponents' ideologynis based in hate.,It's common in world conflict.,You expect to see this betweennPalestinians and Israelis, for example.,What the authors of this article found,was that in America today,na majority of Republicans and Democrats,suffer from political motive asymmetry.,A majority of people in our country todaynwho are politically active believe,that they are motivated by lovenbut the other side is motivated by hate.,Think about it. Think about it.,Most people are walking around saying,,"You know, my ideologynis based on basic benevolence,,I want to help people,,but the other guys,nthey're evil and out to get me.",You can't progress as a societynwhen you have this kind of asymmetry.,It's impossible. 
 How do we solve it?,Well, first, let's be honest:nthere are differences.,Let's not minimize the differences.nThat would be really naïve.,There's a lot of good research on this.,A veteran of the TED stagenis my friend Jonathan Haidt.,He's a psychology professornat New York University.,He does work on the ideologynand values and morals of different people,to see how they differ.,And he's shown, for example,nthat conservatives and liberals,have a very different emphasisnon what they think is important.,For example, Jon Haidt has shown,that liberals care about poverty,59 percent more than they carenabout economic liberty.,And conservativesncare about economic liberty,28 percent morenthan they care about poverty. 
 Irreconcilable differences, right?,We'll never come together. Wrong.,That is diversitynin which lies our strength.,Remember what pulled up the poor.,It was the obsession with poverty,,accompanied by the methodnof economic freedom,spreading around the world.,We need each other, in other words,,if we want to help people and get the nextntwo billion people out of poverty.,There's no other way. 
 Hmm.,How are we going to get that?,It's a tricky thing, isn't it.,We need innovative thinking.,A lot of it's on this stage.,Social entrepreneurship.nYeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.,We need investment overseas,in a sustainable, responsible,nethical and moral way. Yes. Yes. 
 But you know what we really need?,We need a new day in flexible ideology.,We need to be less predictable.,Don't we?,Do you ever feel like your own ideologynis starting to get predictable?,Kinda conventional?,Do you ever feel like you're alwaysnlistening to people who agree with you?,Why is that dangerous?,Because when we talknin this country about economics,,on the right, conservatives,,you're always talking about taxesnand regulations and big government.,And on the left, liberals,nyou're talking about economics,,it's always about income inequality.,Right? Now those are important things,,really important to me,nreally important to you.,But when it comes to lifting people up,who are starving and need us today,nthose are distractions.,We need to come togethernaround the best ways,to mitigate povertynusing the best tools at our disposal,,and that comes only when conservativesnrecognize that they need liberals,and their obsession with poverty,,and liberals need conservativesnand their obsession with free markets.,That's the diversity in which liesnthe future strength of this country,,if we choose to take it. 
 So how are we going to do it?nHow are we going to do it together?,I've got to have some action items,nnot just for you but for me.,Number one. Action item number one:,remember, it's not good enoughnjust to tolerate people who disagree.,It's not good enough.,We have to remember that we neednpeople who disagree with us,,because there are peoplenwho need all of us,who are still waiting for these tools.,Now, what are you going to do?nHow are you going to express that?,Where does this start? It starts here.,You know, all of usnin this room, we're blessed.,We're blessed with peoplenwho listen to us.,We're blessed with prosperity.nWe're blessed with leadership.,When people hear us,nwith the kind of unpredictable ideology,,then maybe people will listen.,Maybe progress will start at that point.,That's number one. Number two.,Number two: I'm asking younand I'm asking me,to be the person specificallynwho blurs the lines,,who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.,If you're a conservative,,be the conservativenwho is always going on about poverty,and the moral obligationnto be a warrior for the poor.,And if you're a liberal,nbe a liberal who is always talking,about the beauty of free marketsnto solve our problems,when we use them responsibly. 
 If we do that, we get two things.,Number one: we get to startnto work on the next two billion,and be the solutionnthat we've seen so much of in the past,and we need to see more of in the future.nThat's what we get.,And the second isnthat we might just be able,to take the ghastly holy war of ideologynthat we're suffering under in this country,and turn it into a competition of ideas,based on solidarity and mutual respect.,And then maybe, just maybe,,we'll all realize that our big differences,aren't really that big after all. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In 1962 at Rice University,,JFK told the country about a dream he had,,a dream to put a person on the moonnby the end of the decade.,The eponymous moonshot. 
 No one knew if it was possible to do,but he made sure a plan was put in placento do it if it was possible.,That's how great dreams are.,Great dreams aren't just visions,,they're visions coupled to strategiesnfor making them real. 
 I have the incredible good fortunento work at a moonshot factory.,At X -- formerly called Google X --,you'll find an aerospace engineernworking alongside a fashion designer,and former military ops commandersnbrainstorming with laser experts.,These inventors, engineers and makersnare dreaming up technologies,that we hope can make the worldna wonderful place. 
 We use the word "moonshots"nto remind us to keep our visions big --,to keep dreaming.,And we use the word "factory"nto remind ourselves,that we want to have concrete visions --,concrete plans to make them real. 
 Here's our moonshot blueprint.,Number one:,we want to findna huge problem in the world,that affects many millions of people.,Number two:,we want to find or propose a radicalnsolution for solving that problem.,And then number three:,there has to be some reason to believe,that the technologynfor such a radical solution,could actually be built. 
 But I have a secret for you.,The moonshot factory is a messy place.,But rather than avoid the mess,,pretend it's not there,,we've tried to make that our strength.,We spend most of our time breaking things,and trying to prove that we're wrong.,That's it, that's the secret.,Run at all the hardestnparts of the problem first.,Get excited and cheer,,"Hey! How are we goingnto kill our project today?" 
 We've got this interesting balance going,where we allow our uncheckednoptimism to fuel our visions.,But then we also harnessnenthusiastic skepticism,to breathe life, breathe realityninto those visions. 
 I want to show you a few of the projects,that we've had to leave behindnon the cutting room floor,,and also a few of the gems,that at least so far,nhave not only survived that process,,but have been accelerated by it. 
 Last year we killed a projectnin automated vertical farming.,This is some of the lettuce that we grew.,One in nine people in the worldnsuffers from undernourishment.,So this is a moonshotnthat needs to happen.,Vertical farming uses 10 times less water,and a hundred times less landnthan conventional farming.,And because you can grow the foodnclose to where it's consumed,,you don't have tontransport it large distances.,We made progress in a lot of the areas,like automated harvestingnand efficient lighting.,But unfortunately,,we couldn't get staple cropsnlike grains and rice to grow this way.,So we killed the project. 
 Here's another huge problem.,We pay enormous costs in resourcesnand environmental damage,to ship goods worldwide.,Economic developmentnof landlocked countries,is limited by lacknof shipping infrastructure.,The radical solution?,A lighter-than-air,nvariable-buoyancy cargo ship.,This has the potential to lower,,at least overall,,the cost, time and carbonnfootprint of shipping,without needing runways.,We came up with this clever setnof technical breakthroughs,that together might make it possiblenfor us to lower the cost enough,that we could actually make these ships --,inexpensively enough in volume.,But however cheap they wouldnhave been to make in volume,it turned out that it was going to costnclose to 200 million dollars,to design and build the first one. 
 200 million dollarsnis just way too expensive.,Because X is structurednwith these tight feedback loops,of making mistakesnand learning and new designs,,we can't spend 200 million dollars,to get the first data point,about whether we'renon the right track or not.,If there's an Achilles' heelnin one our projects,,we want to know it now, up front,nnot way down the road.,So we killed this project, too. 
 Discovering a major flaw in a project,doesn't always meannthat it ends the project.,Sometimes it actually gets usnonto a more productive path. 
 This is our fully self-drivingnvehicle prototype,,which we built withoutna steering wheel or break pedal.,But that wasn't actuallynour goal when we started. 
 With 1.2 million people dyingnon the roads globally every year,,building a car that drives itselfnwas a natural moonshot to take.,Three and a half years ago,,when we had these Lexus,nretrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,,they were doing so well,nwe gave them out to other Googlers,to find out what they thoughtnof the experience.,And what we discovered,was that our plan to have the carsndo almost all the driving,and just hand over to the usersnin case of emergency,was a really bad plan.,It wasn't safe,because the users didn't do their job.,They didn't stay alert,in case the car needednto hand control back to them. 
 This was a major crisis for the team.,It sent them back to the drawing board.,And they came upnwith a beautiful, new perspective.,Aim for a car wherenyou're truly a passenger.,You tell the car where you want to go,,you push a button,and it takes younfrom point A to point B by itself. 
 We're really grateful,that we had this insightnas early on in the project as we did.,And it's shaped everythingnwe've done since then.,And now our cars have self-drivennmore than 1.4 million miles,,and they're out everyday,on the streets of Mountain View,nCalifornia and Austin, Texas. 
 The cars team shifted their perspective.,This is one of X's mantras.,Sometimes shifting your perspectivenis more powerful than being smart. 
 Take wind energy.,It's one of my favorite examplesnof perspective shifting.,There's no way that we're going to build,a better standard wind turbinenthan the experts in that industry.,But we found a waynto get up higher into the sky,,and so get access to faster,nmore consistent winds,,and so more energy without needingnhundreds of tons of steel to get there. 
 Our Makani energy kitenrises up from its perch,by spinning up thosenpropellers along its wing.,And it pulls out a tether as it rises,,pulling energy up through the tether.,Once the tether's all the way out,,it goes into crosswind circles in the sky.,And now those propellers that lifted it upnhave become flying turbines.,And that sends energynback down the tether. 
 We haven't yet foundna way to kill this project.,And the longer it survives that pressure,nthe more excited we get,that this could becomena cheaper and more deployable form,of wind energy for the world. 
 Probably the craziest sounding projectnwe have is Project Loon.,We're trying to makenballoon-powered Internet.,A network of balloons in the stratosphere,that beam an internet connection downnto rural and remote areas of the world.,This could bring onlinenas many as four billion more people,,who today have littlenor no internet connection. 
 But you can't just take a cell tower,,strap it to a balloonnand stick it in the sky.,The winds are too strong,nit would be blown away.,And the balloons are too high upnto tie it to the ground. 
 Here comes the crazy moment.,What if, instead,,we let the balloons drift,and we taught them how to sail the windsnto go where the needed to go?,It turns out the stratosphere has winds,that are going in quite differentnspeeds and directions in thin strata.,So we hoped that using smart algorithmsnand wind data from around the world,,we could maneuver the balloons a bit,,getting them to go up and downnjust a tiny bit in the stratosphere,to grab those winds goingnin those different directions and speeds.,The idea is to have enough balloons,so as one balloon floats out of your area,,there's another balloonnready to float into place,,handing off the internet connection,,just like your phonenhands off between cell towers,as you drive down the freeway. 
 We get how crazy that vision sounds --,there's the name of the projectnto remind us of that.,So since 2012,,the Loon team has prioritizednthe work that seems the most difficult,and so the most likelynto kill their project. 
 The first thing that they did,was try to get a Wi-Fi connectionnfrom a balloon in the stratosphere,down to an antenna on the ground.,It worked.,And I promise you there were betsnthat it wasn't going to.,So we kept going. 
 Could we get the balloonnto talk directly to handsets,,so that we didn't need the antennanas an intermediary receiver?,Yeah. 
 Could we get the balloonnbandwidth high enough,so it was a real Internet connection?,So that people could havensomething more than just SMS?,The early tests weren't evenna megabit per second,,but now we can donup to 15 megabits per second.,Enough to watch a TED Talk. 
 Could we get the balloonsnto talk to each other through the sky,so that we could reach our signalndeeper into rural areas?,Check. 
 Could we get balloons the size of a housento stay up for more than 100 days,,while costing less than five percent,of what traditional, long-lifenballoons have cost to make?,Yes. In the end.,But I promise you, you name it,nwe had to try it to get there.,We made round, silvery balloons.,We made giant pillow-shaped balloons.,We made balloons the size of a blue whale.,We busted a lot of balloons. 
 (Laughter) 
 Since one of the things that wasnmost likely to kill the Loon project,was whether we could guidenthe balloons through the sky,,one of our most important experimentsnwas putting a balloon inside a balloon. 
 So there are two compartments here,none with air and then one with helium.,The balloon pumps air innto make itself heavier,,or lets air out to make it lighter.,And these weight changesnallow it to rise or fall,,and that simple movement of the balloonnis its steering mechanism.,It floats up or down,,hoping to grab winds going in the speednand direction that it wants. 
 But is that good enoughnfor it to navigate through the world?,Barely at first,,but better all the time. 
 This particular balloon,nour latest balloon,,can navigate a two-milenvertical stretch of sky,and can sail itself to within 500 metersnof where it wants to go,from 20,000 kilometers away. 
 We have lots more to do,in terms of fine-tuningnthe system and reducing costs.,But last year,na balloon built inexpensively,went around the worldn19 times over 187 days.,So we're going to keep going. 
 (Applause) 
 Our balloons today,are doing pretty much everythingna complete system needs to do.,We're in discussionsnwith telcos around the world,,and we're going to flynover places like Indonesia,for real service testing this year. 
 This probably all soundsntoo good to be true,,and you're right.,Being audacious,and working on big, risky things,makes people inherently uncomfortable. 
 You cannot yell at peoplenand force them to fail fast.,People resist. They worry.,"What will happen to me if I fail?,Will people laugh at me?,Will I be fired?" 
 I started with our secret.,I'm going to leave younwith how we actually make it happen.,The only way to get peoplento work on big, risky things --,audacious ideas --,and have them run at allnthe hardest parts of the problem first,,is if you make that the pathnof least resistance for them. 
 We work hard at X to make it safe to fail.,Teams kill their ideasnas soon as the evidence is on the table,because they're rewarded for it.,They get applause from their peers.,Hugs and high fivesnfrom their manager, me in particular.,They get promoted for it.,We have bonused every single personnon teams that ended their projects,,from teams as small as twonto teams of more than 30. 
 We believe in dreamsnat the moonshot factory.,But enthusiastic skepticism,is not the enemy of boundless optimism.,It's optimism's perfect partner.,It unlocks the potential in every idea.,We can create the futurenthat's in our dreams. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I am holding something remarkably old.,It is older than any human artifact,,older than life on Earth,,older than the continentsnand the oceans between them.,This was formednover four billion years ago,in the earliest days of the solar system,while the planets were still forming.,This rusty lump of nickel and ironnmay not appear special,,but when it is cut open ...,you can see that it is differentnfrom earthly metals.,This pattern reveals metallic crystalsnthat can only form out in space,where molten metalncan cool extremely slowly,,a few degrees every million years.,This was once partnof a much larger object,,one of millions left overnafter the planets formed.,We call these objects asteroids. 
 Asteroids are our oldestnand most numerous cosmic neighbors.,This graphic shows near-Earth asteroidsnorbiting around the Sun,,shown in yellow,,and swinging close to the Earth's orbit,,shown in blue.,The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroidsnhave been greatly exaggerated,so you can see them clearly.,Teams of scientists across the globenare searching for these objects,,discovering new ones every day,,steadily mapping near-Earth space.,Much of this work is funded by NASA.,I think of the search for these asteroidsnas a giant public works project,,but instead of building a highway,nwe're charting outer space,,building an archiventhat will last for generations. 
 These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroidsndiscovered just last year.,And these are all of the knownnnear-Earth asteroids,,which at last count was 13,733.,Each one has been imaged, cataloged,and had its pathnaround the Sun determined.,Although it variesnfrom asteroid to asteroid,,the paths of most asteroidsncan be predicted for dozens of years.,And the paths of some asteroids can benpredicted with incredible precision.,For example, scientistsnat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,predicted where the asteroid Toutatisnwas going to be four years in advance,to within 30 kilometers.,In those four years,,Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.,That's a fractional precision,of 0.000000004. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the reason I haventhis beautiful asteroid fragment,is because, like all neighbors,,asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly. 
 (Laughter) 
 Three years ago today,,a small asteroid explodednover the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.,That object was about 19 meters across,,or about as big as a convenience store.,Objects of this size hit the Earthnevery 50 years or so. 
 66 million years ago,,a much larger object hit the Earth,,causing a massive extinction.,75 percent of plantnand animal species were lost,,including, sadly, the dinosaurs.,That object wasnabout 10 kilometers across,,and 10 kilometers is roughlynthe cruising altitude of a 747 jet.,So the next time you're in an airplane,,snag a window seat, look outnand imagine a rock so enormous,that resting on the ground,,it just grazes your wingtip.,It's so wide that it takes your planenone full minute to fly past it.,That's the size of the asteroidnthat hit the Earth. 
 It has only been within my lifetime,that asteroids have been consideredna credible threat to our planet.,And since then, there's beenna focused effort underway,to discover and catalog these objects.,I am lucky enoughnto be part of this effort.,I'm part of a team of scientistsnthat use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.,Now, NEOWISE was notndesigned to find asteroids.,It was designed to orbit the earthnand look far beyond our solar system,to seek out the coldest starsnand the most luminous galaxies.,And it did that very wellnfor its designed lifetime of seven months.,But today, six years later,nit's still going.,We've repurposed itnto discover and study asteroids.,And although it'sna wonderful little space robot,,these days it's kind of like a used car.,The cryogen that used to refrigeratenits sensors is long gone,,so we joke thatnits air-conditioning is broken.,It's got 920 million milesnon the odometer,,but it still runs great,and reliably takes a photographnof the sky every 11 seconds.,It's taken 23 photosnsince I began speaking to you. 
 One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable,is that it sees the skynin the thermal infrared.,That means that instead of seeingnthe sunlight that asteroids reflect,,NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.,This is a vital capabilitynsince some asteroids are as dark as coal,and can be difficult or impossiblento spot with other telescopes.,But all asteroids, light or dark,nshine brightly for NEOWISE. 
 Astronomers are usingnevery technique at their disposal,to discover and study asteroids.,In 2010, a historic milestone was reached.,The community, together, discoverednover 90 percent of asteroids,bigger than one kilometer across --,objects capablenof massive destruction to Earth.,But the job's not done yet.,An object 140 meters or biggerncould decimate a medium-sized country.,So far, we've only foundn25 percent of those. 
 We must keep searching the skynfor near-Earth asteroids.,We are the only speciesnable to understand calculus,or build telescopes.,We know how to find these objects.,This is our responsibility.,If we found a hazardous asteroidnwith significant early warning,,we could nudge it out of the way.,Unlike earthquakes, hurricanesnor volcanic eruptions,,an asteroid impactncan be precisely predicted,and prevented.,What we need to do nownis map near-Earth space.,We must keep searching the sky. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What do you think when you look at me?,A woman of faith? An expert?,Maybe even a sister.,Or oppressed,,brainwashed,,a terrorist.,Or just an airport security line delay.,That one's actually true. 
 (Laughter) 
 If some of your perceptions were negative,nI don't really blame you.,That's just how the medianhas been portraying,people who look like me.,One study found,that 80 percent of news coveragenabout Islam and Muslims is negative.,And studies show that Americansnsay that most don't know a Muslim.,I guess people don't talknto their Uber drivers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, for those of younwho have never met a Muslim,,it's great to meet you.,Let me tell you who I am.,I'm a mom, a coffee lover --,double espresso, cream on the side.,I'm an introvert.,I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.,And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.,But not like Lady Gaga says,nbecause baby, I wasn't born this way.,It was a choice. 
 When I was 17, I decided to come out.,No, not as a gay personnlike some of my friends,,but as a Muslim,,and decided to start wearingnthe hijab, my head covering.,My feminist friends were aghast:,"Why are you oppressing yourself?",The funny thing was,,it was actually at that timena feminist declaration of independence,from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,,to conform to a perfectnand unattainable standard of beauty.,I didn't just passively acceptnthe faith of my parents.,I wrestled with the Quran.,I read and reflectednand questioned and doubted,and, ultimately, believed.,My relationship with God --nit was not love at first sight.,It was a trust and a slow surrender,that deepened with everynreading of the Quran.,Its rhythmic beautynsometimes moves me to tears.,I see myself in it.nI feel that God knows me.,Have you ever felt like someone sees you,ncompletely understands you,and yet loves you anyway?,That's how it feels. 
 And so later, I got married,,and like all good Egyptians,,started my career as an engineer. 
 (Laughter) 
 I later had a child,nafter getting married,,and I was living essentiallynthe Egyptian-American dream. 
 And then that terrible morningnof September, 2001.,I think a lot of you probably remembernexactly where you were that morning.,I was sitting in my kitchennfinishing breakfast,,and I look up on the screennand see the words "Breaking News.",There was smoke,nairplanes flying into buildings,,people jumping out of buildings.,What was this?,An accident?,A malfunction?,My shock quickly turned to outrage.,Who would do this?,And I switch the channel and I hear, 
 "... Muslim terrorist ...,","... in the name of Islam ...,","... Middle-Eastern descent ...,","... jihad ...,","... we should bomb Mecca.",Oh my God. 
 Not only had my country been attacked,,but in a flash,,somebody else's actionsnhad turned me from a citizen,to a suspect. 
 That same day, we had to drivenacross Middle America,to move to a new citynto start grad school.,And I remember sittingnin the passenger seat,as we drove in silence,,crouched as low as I could go in my seat,,for the first time in my life,nafraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. 
 We moved into our apartmentnthat night in a new town,in what felt likena completely different world.,And then I was hearingnand seeing and reading,warnings from nationalnMuslim organizations,saying things like,n"Be alert," "Be aware,","Stay in well-lit areas,"n"Don't congregate." 
 I stayed inside all week.,And then it was Friday that same week,,the day that Muslimsncongregate for worship.,And again the warnings were,n"Don't go that first Friday,,it could be a target.",And I was watching the news,nwall-to-wall coverage.,Emotions were so raw, understandably,,and I was also hearingnabout attacks on Muslims,,or people who were perceivednto be Muslim, being pulled out,and beaten in the street.,Mosques were actually firebombed.,And I thought, we should just stay home. 
 And yet, something didn't feel right.,Because those peoplenwho attacked our country,attacked our country.,I get it that people were angrynat the terrorists.,Guess what? So was I.,And so to have to explain yourselfnall the time isn't easy.,I don't mind questions. I love questions.,It's the accusations that are tough. 
 Today we hear people actuallynsaying things like,,"There's a problem in this country,nand it's called Muslims.,When are we going to get rid of them?",So, some people want to ban Muslimsnand close down mosques.,They talk about my communitynkind of like we're a tumor,in the body of America.,And the only question is,nare we malignant or benign?,You know, a malignant tumornyou extract altogether,,and a benign tumornyou just keep under surveillance. 
 The choices don't make sense,nbecause it's the wrong question.,Muslims, like all other Americans,naren't a tumor in the body of America,,we're a vital organ. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Muslims are inventors and teachers,,first responders and Olympic athletes. 
 Now, is closing down mosquesngoing to make America safer?,It might free up some parking spots,,but it will not end terrorism.,Going to a mosque regularlynis actually linked,to having more tolerant viewsnof people of other faiths,and greater civic engagement.,And as one police chiefnin the Washington, DC area,recently told me,,people don't actuallynget radicalized at mosques.,They get radicalized in their basementnor bedroom, in front of a computer.,And what you findnabout the radicalization process,is it starts online,,but the first thing that happens,is the person gets cut offnfrom their community,,from even their family,,so that the extremist groupncan brainwash them,into believing that they,nthe terrorists, are the true Muslims,,and everyone else who abhorsntheir behavior and ideology,are sellouts or apostates.,So if we want to prevent radicalization,,we have to keep peoplengoing to the mosque. 
 Now, some will still arguenIslam is a violent religion.,After all, a group like ISISnbases its brutality on the Quran.,Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,nas a human being,,I think we need to do everything we cannto stop a group like ISIS.,But we would be giving innto their narrative,if we cast them as representativesnof a faith of 1.6 billion people. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 ISIS has as much to do with Islam,as the Ku Klux Klan has to donwith Christianity. 
 (Applause) 
 Both groups claim to basentheir ideology on their holy book.,But when you look at them,nthey're not motivated,by what they read in their holy book.,It's their brutality that makes themnread these things into the scripture. 
 Recently, a prominent imamntold me a story that really took me aback.,He said that a girl came to him,because she was thinkingnof going to join ISIS.,And I was really surprised and asked him,,had she been in contactnwith a radical religious leader?,And he said the problemnwas quite the opposite,,that every cleric that she hadntalked to had shut her down,and said that her rage,nher sense of injustice in the world,,was just going to get her in trouble.,And so with nowhere to channelnand make sense of this anger,,she was a prime target to be exploited,by extremists promising her a solution.,What this imam did was to connect hernback to God and to her community.,He didn't shame her for her rage --ninstead, he gave her constructive ways,to make real change in the world.,What she learned at that mosquenprevented her from going to join ISIS. 
 I've told you a little bit,about how Islamophobianaffects me and my family.,But how does it impact ordinary Americans?,How does it impact everyone else?,How does consuming fear 24 hours a daynaffect the health of our democracy,,the health of our free thought? 
 Well, one study -- actually,nseveral studies in neuroscience --,show that when we're afraid,nat least three things happen.,We become more acceptingnof authoritarianism,,conformity and prejudice.,One study showed that when subjectsnwere exposed to news stories,that were negative about Muslims,,they became more acceptingnof military attacks on Muslim countries,and policies that curtail the rightsnof American Muslims. 
 Now, this isn't just academic.,When you look at whennanti-Muslim sentiment spiked,between 2001 and 2013,,it happened three times,,but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.,It was in the run up to the Iraq Warnand during two election cycles.,So Islamophobia isn't justnthe natural response to Muslim terrorism,as I would have expected.,It can actually be a toolnof public manipulation,,eroding the very foundationnof a free society,,which is rationalnand well-informed citizens.,Muslims are like canariesnin the coal mine.,We might be the first to feel it,,but the toxic air of fearnis harming us all. 
 (Applause) 
 And assigning collective guilt,isn't just about havingnto explain yourself all the time.,Deah and his wife Yusornwere a young married couple,living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,,where they both went to school.,Deah was an athlete.,He was in dental school,ntalented, promising ...,And his sister would tell menthat he was the sweetest,,most generous human being she knew.,She was visiting him therenand he showed her his resume,,and she was amazed.,She said, "When did my baby brothernbecome such an accomplished young man?",Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visitnto her brother and his new wife,,their neighbor,,Craig Stephen Hicks,,murdered them,,as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,nwho was visiting for the afternoon,,in their apartment,,execution style,,after posting anti-Muslim statementsnon his Facebook page.,He shot Deah eight times.,So bigotry isn't just immoral,nit can even be lethal. 
 So, back to my story.,What happened after 9/11?,Did we go to the mosquenor did we play it safe and stay home?,Well, we talked it over,,and it might seem likena small decision, but to us,,it was about what kind of Americanwe wanted to leave for our kids:,one that would control us by fear,or one where we were practicingnour religion freely.,So we decided to go to the mosque.,And we put my son in his car seat,,buckled him in, and we drove silently,nintensely, to the mosque.,I took him out, I took off my shoes,nI walked into the prayer hall,and what I saw made me stop.,The place was completely full.,And then the imam made an announcement,,thanking and welcoming our guests,,because half the congregation,were Christians, Jews,nBuddhists, atheists,,people of faith and no faith,,who had come not to attack us,nbut to stand in solidarity with us. 
 (Applause) 
 I just break down at this time.,These people were there because they chosencourage and compassion,over panic and prejudice. 
 What will you choose?,What will you choosenat this time of fear and bigotry?,Will you play it safe?,Or will you join those who say,we are better than that? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you so much. 
 Helen Walters: So Dalia,nyou seem to have struck a chord.,But I wonder,,what would you say to thosenwho might argue,that you're giving a TED Talk,,you're clearly a deep thinker,,you work at a fancy think tank,,you're an exception, you're not the rule.,What would you say to those people? 
 Dalia Mogahed: I would say,ndon't let this stage distract you,,I'm completely ordinary.,I'm not an exception.,My story is not unusual.,I am as ordinary as they come.,When you look at Muslimsnaround the world --,and I've done this, I've donenthe largest study ever done,on Muslims around the world --,people want ordinary things.,They want prosperity for their family,,they want jobs,and they want to live in peace.,So I am not in any way an exception.,When you meet people who seemnlike an exception to the rule,,oftentimes it's that the rule is broken,,not that they're an exception to it. 
 HW: Thank you so much.nDalia Mogahed. 
 (Applause)When I think about dreams,,like many of you,,I think about this picture.,I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong,step off the Lunar Modulenonto the surface of the Moon.,I had never seen anything like it before,,and I've never seennanything like it since. 
 We got to the Moon for one simple reason:,John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.,And in the absence of that deadline,,we would still be dreaming about it.,Leonard Bernstein said two thingsnare necessary for great achievement:,a plan and not quite enough time. 
 (Laughter) 
 Deadlines and commitments,are the great and fadingnlessons of Apollo.,And they are what give the wordn"moonshot" its meaning.,And our world is in desperate neednof political leaders,willing to set bold deadlines,for the achievement of daring dreamsnon the scale of Apollo again. 
 When I think about dreams,,I think about the drag queensnof LA and Stonewall,and millions of other peoplenrisking everything,to come out when thatnwas really dangerous,,and of this picture of the White Housenlit up in rainbow colors,,yes -- 
 (Applause) -- 
 celebrating America's gay and lesbianncitizens' right to marry.,It is a picture that in my wildest dreamsnI could never have imagined,when I was 18,and figuring out that I was gay,and feeling estranged from my country,and my dreams because of it. 
 I think about this picture of my family,that I never dreamed I could ever have -- 
 (Applause) -- 
 and of our children holding this headline,I never dreamed could ever be printednabout the Supreme Court ruling. 
 We need more of the couragenof drag queens and astronauts. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But I want to talknabout the need for us to dream,in more than one dimension,,because there was something about Apollonthat I didn't know when I was 8,,and something about organizingnthat the rainbow colors over.,Of the 30 astronauts in the originalnMercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,,only seven marriages survived.,Those iconic images of the astronautsnbouncing on the Moon,obscure the alcoholismnand depression on Earth. 
 Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk,,asked during the time of Apollo,,"What can we gain by sailing to the moon,if we are not able to cross the abyssnthat separates us from ourselves?",And what can we gain by the right to marry,if we are not able to cross the acrimony,and emotional distancenthat so often separates us from our love?,And not just in marriage.,I have seen the most hurtful, destructive,,tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS,and breast cancer and non-profit activism,,all in the name of love. 
 Thomas Merton also wrotenabout wars among saints,and that "there is a pervasive formnof contemporary violence,to which the idealistnmost easily succumbs:,activism and overwork.,The frenzy of our activismnneutralizes our work for peace.,It destroys our ownninner capacity for peace.",Too often our dreams becomenthese compartmentalized fixations,on some future,that destroy our ability to be presentnfor our lives right now.,Our dreams of a better lifenfor some future humanity,or some other humanity in another country,alienate us from the beautifulnhuman beings sitting next to us,at this very moment. 
 Well, that's just the pricenof progress, we say.,You can go to the Moon,or you can have stabilitynin your family life.,And we can't conceive of dreamingnin both dimensions at the same time.,And we don't set the barnmuch higher than stability,when it comes to our emotional life.,Which is why our technologynfor talking to one another,has gone vertical,,our ability to listennand understand one another,has gone nowhere.,Our access to informationnis through the roof,,our access to joy, grounded.,But this idea, that our presentnand our future are mutually exclusive,,that to fulfill our potential for doingnwe have to surrender,our profound potential for being,,that the number of transistorsnon a circuit can be doubled and doubled,,but our capacity for compassionnand humanity and serenity and love,is somehow limited,is a false and suffocating choice. 
 Now, I'm not suggesting,simply the uninspiring ideanof more work-life balance.,What good is it for me to spendnmore time with my kids at home,if my mind is always somewhere elsenwhile I'm doing it?,I'm not even talking about mindfulness.,Mindfulness is all of a sudden becomingna tool for improving productivity. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? 
 I'm talking about dreaming,as boldly in the dimension of our being,as we do about industry and technology.,I'm talking aboutnan audacious authenticity,that allows us to cry with one another,,a heroic humility that allows usnto remove our masks and be real.,It is our inabilitynto be with one another,,our fear of crying with one another,nthat gives rise to so many,of the problems we are franticallyntrying to solve in the first place,,from Congressional gridlocknto economic inhumanity. 
 (Applause) 
 I'm talking about what Jonas Salkncalled an Epoch B,,a new epoch in which we becomenas excited about and curious about,and scientific aboutnthe development of our humanity,as we are about the developmentnof our technology. 
 We should not shrink from this opportunity,simply becausenwe don't really understand it.,There was a timenwhen we didn't understand space.,Or because we're more usednto technology and activism.,That is the very definitionnof being stuck in a comfort zone.,We are now very comfortable imaginingnunimaginable technological achievement.,In 2016, it is the dimensionnof our being itself,that cries out for its fair sharenof our imagination. 
 Now, we're all here to dream,,but maybe if we're honest about it,,each of us chasing our own dream.,You know, looking at the name tagsnto see who can help me with my dream,,sometimes looking right throughnone another's humanity.,I can't be bothered with you right now.nI have an idea for saving the world.,Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Years ago, once upon a time,nI had this beautiful company,that created these long journeysnfor heroic civic engagement.,And we had this mantra:,"Human. Kind. Be Both.",And we encouraged people to experimentnoutrageously with kindness.,Like, "Go help everybodynset up their tents.",And there were a lot of tents. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Go buy everybody Popsicles.","Go help people fix their flat tires,even though you knownthe dinner line is going to get longer." 
 And people really took us up on this,,so much so that if you gotna flat tire on the AIDS ride,,you had trouble fixing it, because therenwere so many people there asking you,if you needed help. 
 For a few days,nfor tens of thousands of people,,we created these worlds,that everybody said were the waynthey wish the world could always be.,What if we experimentednwith creating that kind of world,these next few days?,And instead of going up to someonenand asking them, "What do you do?",ask them, "So what are your dreams?",or "What are your broken dreams?",You know, "TED."nTend to Each other's Dreams. 
 (Applause) 
 Maybe it's "I want to stay sober",or "I want to buildna tree house with my kid.",You know, instead of going upnto the person everybody wants to meet,,go up to the person who is all alone,and ask them if they wantnto grab a cup of coffee. 
 I think what we fear most,is that we will be denied the opportunitynto fulfill our true potential,,that we are born to dream,and we might dienwithout ever having the chance. 
 Imagine living in a world,where we simply recognizenthat deep, existential fear in one another,and love one another boldlynbecause we know,that to be humannis to live with that fear.,It's time for us to dreamnin multiple dimensions simultaneously,,and somewhere that transcendsnall of the wondrous things,we can and will and must do,lies the domain of allnthe unbelievable things we could be. 
 It's time we set foot into that dimension,and came out about the factnthat we have dreams there, too.,If the Moon could dream,,I think that would be its dream for us.,It's an honor to be with you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Hannah is excited to be going to college.,She couldn't waitnto get out of her parents' house,,to prove to them that she's an adult,,and to prove to her new friendsnthat she belongs. 
 She heads to a campus party,where she sees a guynthat she has a crush on.,Let's call him Mike.,The next day, Hannah wakes upnwith a pounding headache.,She can only remembernthe night in flashes.,But what she does remember is,throwing up in the hallnoutside Mike's room,and staring at the wall silentlynwhile he was inside her,,wanting it to stop,,then shakily stumbling home.,She doesn't feel good about what happened,,but she thinks, "Maybe this is justnwhat sex in college is?" 
 One in five women and one in 13 mennwill be sexually assaulted,at some point during their college careernin the United States.,Less than 10 percent will ever reportntheir assault to their school,or to the police.,And those who do, on average,nwait 11 months to make the report. 
 Hannah initially just feels like dealingnwith what happened on her own.,But when she sees Mikentaking girls home from parties,,she's worried about them. 
 After graduation, Hannah learns,that she was one of five womennwho Mike did the exact same thing to.,And this is not an unlikely scenario,because 90 percent of sexual assaults,are committed by repeat offenders.,But with such low reporting rates,,it's fairly unlikely that evennrepeat perpetrators will be reported,,much less anything happen if they are. 
 In fact, only six percentnof assaults reported to the police,end with the assailantnspending a single day in prison.,Meaning, there's a 99 percent chancenthat they'll get away with it.,This means there's practicallynno deterrent to assault,in the United States. 
 Now, I'm an infectious diseasenepidemiologist by training.,I'm interested in systems and networks,and where we can concentratenour resources to do the most good.,So this, to me, is a tragicnbut a solvable problem. 
 So when the issue of campus assaultnstarted hitting the news a few years ago,,it felt like a unique opportunitynto make a change.,And so we did.,We started by talkingnto college survivors.,And what they wish they'd hadnin college is pretty simple;,they wanted a website,,one they could usenat the time and place,that felt safest to them,with clearly written informationnabout their reporting options,,with the ability to electronicallynreport their assault,,rather than having the first step,to go in and talk to someonenwho may or may not believe them.,With the option to createna secure, timestamped document,of what happened to them,,preserving evidenceneven if they don't want to report yet.,And lastly, and perhaps most critically,,with the ability to report their assault,only if someone elsenreported the same assailant.,You see, knowing that you weren'tnthe only one changes everything.,It changes the waynyou frame your own experience,,it changes the waynyou think about your perpetrator,,it means that if you do come forward,,you'll have someone else's backnand they'll have yours. 
 We created a websitenthat actually does this,and we launched it [...] in August,,on two college campuses. 
 And we included a unique matching system,where if Mike's first victimnhad come forward,,saved her record,nentered into the matching system,and named Mike,,and Mike's second victimnhad done the same thing,a few months later,,they would have matched,and the verified contact informationnof both survivors,would have been sentnto the authorities at the same time,for investigation and follow up. 
 If a system like this had existednfor Hannah and her peers,,it's more likelynthat they would have reported,,that they would have been believed,,and that Mike would have beennkicked off campus,,gone to jail, or at leastngotten the help that he needed.,And if we were able to stopnrepeat offenders like Mike,after just their second assaultnfollowing a match,,survivors like Hannahnwould never even be assaulted,in the first place.,We could preventn59 percent of sexual assaults,just by stoppingnrepeat perpetrators earlier on.,And because we're creatingna real deterrent to assault,,for perhaps the first time,,maybe the Mikes of the worldnwould never even try to assault anyone. 
 The type of system I'm describing,,the type of system that survivors want,is a type of information escrow,,meaning an entity that holds onnto information for you,and only releases it to a third party,when certain pre-agreed uponnconditions are met,,such as a match.,The application that we builtnis for college campuses.,But the same type of systemncould be used in the military,or even the workplace. 
 We don't have to live in a world,where 99 percent of rapistsnget away with it.,We can create one,where those who do wrongnare held accountable,,where survivors get the supportnand justice they deserve,,where the authoritiesnget the information they need,,and where there's a real deterrent,to violating the rightsnof another human being. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)At Free America, we've donena listening and learning tour.,We visited not only with prosecutors,but with legislators,,with inmates in our statenand local prisons.,We've gone to immigrationndetention centers.,We've met a lot of people.,And we've seen that redemptionnand transformation can happen,in our prisons, our jailsnand our immigration detention centers,,giving hope to thosenwho want to create a better life,after serving their time. 
 Imagine if we also considerednthe front end of this prison pipeline.,What would it look likenif we intervened,,with rehabilitation as a core value --,with love and compassion as core values?,We would have a society that is safer,,healthier,and worthy of raising our children in. 
 I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.,James served 12 yearsnin the San Quentin State Prison,and is being released in 18 months.,Now James, like you and me,,is more than the worst thing he's done.,He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.,He committed a crime;,he's paying his debt,,and working hard to build the skills,to make the transition backnto a productive life,when he enters the civiliannpopulation again. 
 Now James, like millionsnof people behind bars,,is an example of what happens,if we believe that our failingsndon't define who we are,,that we are all worthy of redemption,and if we support those impactednby mass incarceration,,we can all heal together. 
 I'd like to introduce younto James right now,,and he's going to sharenhis journey of redemption,through spoken word. 
 James Cavitt: Thanks, John.,TED, welcome to San Quentin.,The talent is abundantnbehind prison walls.,Future software engineers,,entrepreneurs,,craftsmen,,musicians,and artists.,This piece is inspirednby all of the hard work,that men and women are doing on the inside,to create better livesnand futures for themselves,after they serve their time. 
 This piece is entitled, "Where I Live." 
 I live in a world where most peoplenare too afraid to go.,Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,,steel bars,,where razor wire have a way,of cutting away at the hopesnfor a brighter tomorrow. 
 I live in a world,that kill people who kill people,in order to teach people,that killing people is wrong.,Imagine that. 
 Better yet,,imagine a world where healed peoplenhelped hurt people heal,and become strong.,Maybe then we would allnbe singin' "Redemption Song." 
 I live in a world thatnhas been called "hell on Earth",by those trapped inside.,But I've come to the stark realization,that prison --,it really is what you make it.,You see, in spitenof the harshness of my reality,,there is a silver lining.,I knew that my freedom was gonna come,,it was just a matter of time.,And so I treated my first stepsnas if they were my last mile,,and I realized that youndon't have to be free,in order to experience freedom. 
 And just because you're free,,doesn't mean that you have freedom.,Many of us, for years,nhave been battling our inner demons.,We walk around smilingnwhen inside we're really screamin':,freedom! 
 Don't you get it?,We're all serving time;,we're just in different places.,As for me,,I choose to be freenfrom the prisons I've created.,The key:,forgiveness.,Action's my witness.,If we want freedom,,then we gotta think different.,Because freedom ...,it isn't a place.,It's a mind setting. 
 Thank you.

 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As a little Hawaiian,,my mom and auntie always told menstories about Kalaupapa --,the Hawaiian leper colony,surrounded by the highestnsea cliffs in the world --,and Father Damien,,the Belgian missionary who gave his lifenfor the Hawaiian community.,As a young nurse,,my aunt trained the nunsncaring for the remaining lepers,almost a 100 years afternFather Damien died of leprosy.,I remember stories she told,about traveling downnswitchback cliff paths on a mule,,while my uncle playednher favorite hula songs on the ukulele,all the way down to Kalaupapa. 
 You see, as a youngster,,I was always curious about a few things.,First was why a Belgian missionarynchose to live in complete isolation,in Kalaupapa,,knowing he would inevitablyncontract leprosy,from the community of peoplenhe sought to help.,And secondly,,where did the leprosy bacteria come from?,And why were Kānaka Maoli,,the indigenous people of Hawaii,,so susceptible to developingnleprosy, or "mai Pake?" 
 This got my curious about whatnmakes us unique as Hawaiians --,namely, our genetic makeup.,But it wasn't until high school,,through the Human Genome Project,,that I realized I wasn't alone,in trying to connectnour unique genetic ancestry,to our potential health,nwellness and illness.,You see,,the 2.7 billion-dollar project,promised an era of predictivenand preventative medicine,based on our unique genetic makeup.,So to me it always seemed obvious,that in order to achieve this dream,,we would need to sequencena diverse cohort of people,to obtain the full spectrumnof human genetic variation on the planet.,That's why 10 years later,,it continues to shock me,,knowing that 96 percent of genome studies,associating common genetic variationnwith specific diseases,have focused exclusivelynon individuals of European ancestry. 
 Now you don't need a PhD,to see that that leaves four percentnfor the rest of diversity.,And in my own searching,,I've discovered that far lessnthan one percent,have actually focused on indigenousncommunities, like myself.,So that begs the question:,Who is the Human GenomenProject actually for?,Just like we havendifferent colored eyes and hair,,we metabolize drugs differently,based on the variation in our genomes.,So how many of younwould be shocked to learn,that 95 percent of clinical trials,have also exclusively featurednindividuals of European ancestry? 
 This bias,and systematic lack of engagementnof indigenous people,in both clinical trialsnand genome studies,is partially the resultnof a history of distrust.,For example,,in 1989, researchersnfrom Arizona State University,obtained blood samplesnfrom Arizona's Havasupai tribe,,promising to alleviate the burdennof type 2 diabetes,that was plaguing their community,,only to turn around and usenthose exact same samples --,without the Havasupai's consent --,to study ratesnof schizophrenia, inbreeding,,and challengenthe Havasupai's origin story.,When the Havasupai found out,,they sued successfully for $700,000,,and they banned ASU from conductingnresearch on their reservation.,This culminated in a sort of domino effect,with local tribes in the Southwest --,including the Navajo Nation,,one of the largestntribes in the country --,putting a moratorium on genetic research. 
 Now despite this history of distrust,,I still believe that indigenous peoplencan benefit from genetic research.,And if we don't do something soon,,the gap in health disparitiesnis going to continue to widen.,Hawaii, for example,,has the longest life expectancynon average of any state in the US,,yet native Hawaiians like myself,die a full decadenbefore our non-native counterparts,,because we have somenof the highest rates of type 2 diabetes,,obesity,,and the number one and numberntwo killers in the US:,cardiovascular disease and cancer. 
 So how do we ensure,the populations of peoplenthat need genome sequencing the most,are not the last to benefit?,My vision is to makengenetic research more native,,to indigenize genomensequencing technology. 
 Traditionally, genomesnare sequenced in laboratories.,Here's an image of your classicngenome sequencer.,It's huge.,It's the size of a refrigerator.,There's this obvious physical limitation.,But what if you could sequencengenomes on the fly?,What if you could fit a genomensequencer in your pocket?,This nanopore-based sequencer,is one 10,000th the sizenof your traditional genome sequencer.,It doesn't have the samenphysical limitations,,in that it's not tethered to a lab benchnwith extraneous cords,,large vats of chemicalsnor computer monitors.,It allows us to de-black box genomensequencing technology development,in a way that's immersivenand collaborative,,activating and empoweringnindigenous communities ...,as citizen scientists. 
 100 years later in Kalaupapa,,we now have the technology to sequencenleprosy bacteria in real time,,using mobile genome sequencers,,remote access to the Internet,and cloud computation.,But only if that's whatnHawaiian people want.,In our space,,on our terms. 
 IndiGenomics is about sciencenfor the people by the people.,We'll be starting with a tribalnconsultation resource,,focused on educatingnindigenous communities,on the potential use and misusenof genetic information.,Eventually we'd like to have our ownnIndiGenomics research institute,to conduct our own experiments,and educate the next generationnof indigenous scientists. 
 In the end,,indigenous people need to be partners innand not subjects of genetic research.,And for those on the outside,,just as Father Damien did,,the research community needsnto immerse itself in indigenous culture,or die trying. 
 Mahalo. 
 (Applause)By raising your hand,,how many of you knownat least one person on the screen?,Wow, it's almost a full house.,It's true, they are very famousnin their fields.,And do you know whatnall of them have in common?,They all died of pancreatic cancer.,However, although it's very,nvery sad this news,,it's also thanks to their personal stories,that we have raised awarenessnof how lethal this disease can be. 
 It's become the third causenof cancer deaths,,and only eight percent of the patientsnwill survive beyond five years.,That's a very tiny number,,especially if you compare itnwith breast cancer,,where the survival ratenis almost 90 percent.,So it doesn't really come as a surprise,that being diagnosednwith pancreatic cancer,means facing an almostncertain death sentence.,What's shocking, though,nis that in the last 40 years,,this number hasn't changed a bit,,while much more progress has been made,with other types of tumors.,So how can we make pancreatic cancerntreatment more effective?,As a biomedical entrepreneur,,I like to work on problemsnthat seem impossible,,understanding their limitations,and trying to find new,ninnovative solutions,that can change their outcome. 
 The first piece of bad newsnwith pancreatic cancer,is that your pancreas is in the middlenof your belly, literally.,It's depicted in orange on the screen.,But you can barely see it,until I remove all the othernorgans in front.,It's also surroundednby many other vital organs,,like the liver, the stomach,nthe bile duct.,And the ability of the tumornto grow into those organs,is the reason why pancreatic cancer,is one of the most painful tumor types.,The hard-to-reach locationnalso prevents the doctor,from surgically removing it,,as is routinely donenfor breast cancer, for example.,So all of these reasons leavenchemotherapy as the only option,for the pancreatic cancer patient. 
 This brings us to the secondnpiece of bad news.,Pancreatic cancer tumors havenvery few blood vessels.,Why should we carenabout the blood vessel of a tumor?,Let's think for a secondnhow chemotherapy works.,The drug is injected in the vein,and it navigates throughout the bodynuntil it reaches the tumor site.,It's like driving on a highway,ntrying to reach a destination.,But what if your destinationndoesn't have an exit on the highway?,You will never get there.,And that's exactly the same problem,for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.,The drugs navigatenthroughout all of your body.,They will reach healthy organs,,resulting in high toxic effectnfor the patients overall,,but very little will go to the tumor.,Therefore, the efficacy is very limited. 
 To me, it seems very counterintuitivento have a whole-body treatment,to target a specific organ.,However, in the last 40 years,,a lot of money, researchnand effort have gone towards,finding new, powerful drugsnto treat pancreatic cancer,,but nothing has been donenin changing the way,we deliver them to the patient. 
 So after two pieces of bad news,,I'm going to give youngood news, hopefully.,With a collaborator at MIT,and the MassachusettsnGeneral Hospital in Boston,,we have revolutionizednthe way we treat cancer,by making localizedndrug delivery a reality.,We are basically parachuting younon top of your destination,,avoiding your having to drivenall around the highway.,We have embedded the drugninto devices that look like this one.,They are flexible enoughnthat they can be folded,to fit into the catheter,,so the doctor can implant itndirectly on top of the tumor,with minimally invasive surgery.,But they are solid enoughnthat once they are positioned,on top of the tumor,,they will act as a cage.,They will actuallynphysically prevent the tumor,from entering other organs,,controlling the metastasis. 
 The devices are also biodegradable.,That means that once in the body,,they start dissolving,,delivering the drug only locally,nslowly and more effectively,than what is done with the currentnwhole-body treatment.,In pre-clinical study,nwe have demonstrated,that this localized approach,is able to improve by 12 timesnthe response to treatment. 
 So we took a drug that is already known,and by just delivering it locallynwhere it's needed the most,,we allow a responsenthat is 12 times more powerful,,reducing the systemic toxic effect.,We are working relentlessly to bringnthis technology to the next level.,We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing,and the animal model requirednprior to asking the FDA for approval,for clinical trials. 
 Currently, the majority of patientsnwill die from pancreatic cancer.,We are hoping that one day,,we can reduce their pain,nextend their life,and potentially make pancreatic cancer,a curable disease. 
 By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,,we don't only make itnmore powerful and less toxic,,we are also opening the doornto finding new innovative solutions,for almost all other impossible problems,in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,,like all of you.,And I'm also a social justice comedian,,something that I insist is an actual job. 
 To explain what that is,nlet me tell you how I got here.,I've performed all over the country.,And let me tell you,nAmerica is majestic, right?,It's got breathtaking nature,,waffle houses,and diabetes as far as the eye can see.,It is really something. 
 Now, the American populationncan be broken up,into three main categories:,there's mostly wonderful people,,haters,and Florida. 
 (Laughter) 
 Besides Florida, the most troublingncategory here are the Haters.,They are a minority,,but they overcompensatenby being extra loud.,They have the Napoleon complexnof demographics,,and yes, some of the men do wear heels. 
 As a social justice comedian,,it's my goal to convert these haters,,because they hate a lot of things,nwhich leads to negative outcomes,,like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.,This is not an exhaustive list;,I'm probably missing 3-7 items. 
 But the point is,,we have to reckon with the haters.,But there's variance within this group,and it's not efficient to gonafter all of them, right?,So what I've done is createdna highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.,I basically took all of the haters,,I put them in a petri dish,nlike a scientist,,and this is what I found. 
 (Laughter) 
 First off, we have the trolls.,These are your garden-varietyndigital haters.,They're the people who quit their jobs,so they can post on YouTubenvideos all day long.,There's also the drive-by haters.,Now, these people will be at a stoplight,,they'll wait for the light to turn green,and when it does, they yell,n"Go back to your own country!",Now back in the day, they would'venactually gotten out of their cars,and hated you to your face.,But they just don't make themnlike they used to --,which is another signnof the decline in America. 
 (Laughter) 
 The next category,is the mission-oriented-bigot-nwhose-group-affiliation-,gives-them-cover-for-hating hater.,These guys like to hatenvia a seemingly nice organization,,like a church or a nonprofit,,and they oftentimes like to speaknin an old-timey voice. 
 But the group I'm mostninterested in is the swing hater.,The swing hater is sisternto the swing voter --,they just can't decide!,They're like ideological sluts,who move from hating to not hating.,And they do it because they don't havenenough information.,This is the group I like to targetnwith social justice comedy.,Why comedy?,Because on a scale of comedy to brochure,,the average American prefers comedy,nas you can see from this graph. 
 (Laughter) 
 Comedy is very popular.,And by the way,,this is a mathematically accurate graph,,generated from fake numbers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the question is:,Why does social justice comedy work?,Because, first off, it makes you laugh.,And when you're laughing,nyou enter into a state of openness.,And in that moment of openness,,a good social justice comedianncan stick in a whole bunch of information,,and if they're really skilled,,a rectal exam. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here are some ground rulesnfor social justice comedy:,first off, it's not partisan.,This isn't political comedy,nthis is about justice,,and no one is against justice.,Two, it's inviting and warm,,it makes you feel like you're sittingninside of a burrito.,Three, it's funny but sneaky,,like you could be hearingnan interesting treatise,on income inequality,,that's encased in a reallynsophisticated poop joke. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's how I seensocial justice comedy working.,A few years ago, I rounded up a bunchnof Muslim-American comedians --,in a non-violent way -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And we went around the country,to places like Alabama, Arizona,nTennessee, Georgia --,places where they love the Muzzies --,and we did stand-up shows.,We called the tourn"The Muslims Are Coming!" 
 (Laughter) 
 We turned this into a movie,,and then after the movie came out,,a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars,on an anti-Muslim poster campaign,with the MTA -- that'snthe New York City subway system.,Now, the posters were truly offensive,,not to mentioned poorly designed --,I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,,you might as well use a better font. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we decided, why not launchnour own poster campaign,that says nice things about Muslims,,while promoting the movie.,So myself and fellow comediannDean Obeidallah,decided to launch the fighting-bigotry-nwith-delightful-posters campaign.,We raised the money, workednwith the MTA for over 5 months,,got the posters approved,,and two days after theynwere supposed to go up,,the MTA decided to ban the posters,,citing political content. 
 Let's take a looknat a couple of those posters.,Here's one.,Facts about Muslims:,Muslims inventednthe concept of a hospital.,OK.,Fact: Grown-up Muslims can donmore push-ups than baby Muslims. 
 (Laughter) 
 Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's take a look at another one.,The ugly truth about Muslims:,they have great frittata recipes. 
 Now clearly, frittatas are considerednpolitical by the MTA.,Either that, or the mere mentionnof Muslims in a positive light,was considered political -- but it isn't.,It's about justice.,So we decided to change,our fighting-bigortry-nwith-delightful-posters campaign,and turn it into the fighting-bigotry-nwith-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign. 
 (Laughter) 
 So basically, what I'm sayingnis a couple of dirt-bag comedians,took on a major New York City agency,and the comedians won. 
 (Applause and cheers) 
 Thank you.,Victory was a very weird feeling.,I was like, "Is this whatnblonde girls feel like all the time?,'Cause this is amazing!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's another example.,I'm asked everywhere I go:n"Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?",We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.,So I decided to launchnthedailydenouncer.com.,It's a website that denouncesnterrorism every day of the week,,while taking the weekends off.,Let's take a look at an example.,They generally appearnas single-panel cartoons,,"I denounce terrorism! I also denouncenpeople who never fill the paper tray!",The point of the websitenis that it denounces terrorism,while recognizing that it's ridiculous,that we have to constantlyndenounce terrorism. 
 But if bigotry isn't your thing,,social justice comedy is usefulnfor all sorts of issues.,For example, myself and fellowncomedian Lee Camp,went to the Cayman Islandsnto investigate offshore banking.,Now, the United States losesnsomething like 300 billion dollars a year,in these offshore tax havens.,Not to brag,,but at the end of every month,,I have something like 5-15 dollarsnin disposable income.,So we walked into these banksnin the Cayman Islands,and asked if we couldnopen up a bank account,with eight dollars and 27 cents. 
 (Laughter) 
 The bank managers would indulge usnfor 30-45 seconds before calling security.,Security would come out,nbrandish their weapons,,and then we would squealnwith fear and run away,,because -- and this is the lastnrule of social justice comedy --,sometimes it makes you wantnto take a dump in your pants. 
 Most of my work is meant to be fun.,It's meant to generatena connection and laughter.,But yes, sometimes I getnrun off the grounds by security.,Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.,Sometimes I get voice mails sayingnthat if I continue telling my jokes,,they'll kill menand they'll kill my family.,And those death threatsnare definitely not funny. 
 But despite the occasional danger,,I still think that social justice comedynis one of our best weapons.,I mean, we've triedna lot of approaches to social justice,,like war and competitive ice dancing.,But still, a lot of thingsnare still kind of awful.,So I think it's time we try and tellna really good poop joke. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Ichthyology,,the study of fishes.,It looks like a big, boring word,,but it's actually quite exciting,,because ichthyology is the only "ology",with "YOLO" in it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, to the cool kids in the audience,,you already know, YOLO stands forn"you only live once,",and because I only have one life,,I'm going to spend it doingnwhat I always dreamt of doing:,seeing the hidden wonders of the worldnand discovering new species.,And that's what I get to do. 
 Now, in recent years, I really focusednon caves for finding new species.,And it turns out, there's lots of newncavefish species out there.,You just have to know where to look,,and to maybe be a little thin. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, cavefishes can tell mena lot about biology and geology.,They can tell me how the landmassesnaround them have changed and moved,by being stuck in these little holes,,and they can tell me aboutnthe evolution of sight, by being blind. 
 Now, fish have eyesnthat are essentially the same as ours.,All vertebrates do, and each timena fish species starts to adapt,to this dark, cold, cave environment,,over many, many generations,nthey lose their eyes and their eyesight,until the end up like an eyelessncavefish like this one here.,Now, each cavefish speciesnhas evolved in a slightly different way,,and each one has a unique geologicalnand biological story to tell us,,and that's why it's so excitingnwhen we find a new species. 
 So this is a new speciesnwe described, from southern Indiana.,We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri,nthe Hoosier cavefish. 
 (Laughter) 
 Its closest relativesnare cavefishes in Kentucky,,in the Mammoth Cave system.,And they start to divergenwhen the Ohio River split them,a few million years ago.,And in that time they developednthese subtle differences,in the genetic architecturenbehind their blindness.,There's this gene called rhodopsinnthat's super-critical for sight.,We have it, and these species have it too,,except one species has lostnall function in that gene,,and the other one maintains it.,So this sets up this beautifulnnatural experiment,where we can look at the genesnbehind our vision,,and at the very roots of how we can see. 
 But the genes in these cavefishes,can also tell usnabout deep geological time,,maybe no more sonthan in this species here.,This is a new speciesnwe described from Madagascar,that we named Typhleotris mararybe.,That means "big sickness" in Malagasy,,for how sick we got tryingnto collect this species.,Now, believe it or not,,swimming around sinkholesnfull of dead things,and cave full of bat poop,isn't the smartest thing you couldnbe doing with your life,,but YOLO. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I love this species despite the factnthat it tried to kill us,,and that's becausenthis species in Madagascar,,its closest relativesnare 6,000 kilometers away,,cavefishes in Australia.,Now, there's no way a three-inch-longnfreshwater cavefish,can swim across the Indian Ocean,,so what we found when we comparednthe DNA of these species,is that they've been separatednfor more than 100 million years,,or about the time that the southernncontinents were last together.,So in fact, these speciesndidn't move at all.,It's the continents that moved them.,And so they give us, through their DNA,,this precise model and measure,of how to date and timenthese ancient geological events. 
 Now, this species here is so new,I'm not even allowednto tell you its name yet,,but I can tell younit's a new species from Mexico,,and it's probably already extinct.,It's probably extinct becausenthe only known cave system it's from,was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.,Unfortunately for cavefishes,,their groundwater habitat,is also our main source of drinking water. 
 Now, we actually don't knownthis species' closest relative, yet.,It doesn't appear to benanything else in Mexico,,so maybe it's something in Cuba,,or Florida, or India.,But whatever it is, it might tell usnsomething new about the geology,of the Caribbean, or the biologynof how to better diagnose,certain types of blindness.,But I hope we discover this speciesnbefore it goes extinct too. 
 And I'm going to spend my one life,as an ichthyologistntrying to discover and save,these humble little blind cavefishes,that can tell us so muchnabout the geology of the planet,and the biology of how we see. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I'm an artist,,but a little bit of a peculiar one.,I don't paint.,I can't draw.,My shop teacher in high schoolnwrote that I was a menace,on my report card.,You probably don't reallynwant to see my photographs.,But there is one thing I know how to do:,I know how to program a computer.,I can code. 
 And people will tell menthat 100 years ago,,folks like me didn't exist,,that it was impossible,,that art made with data is a new thing,,it's a product of our age,,it's something that's really important,to think of as somethingnthat's very "now.",And that's true. 
 But there is an art formnthat's been around for a very long time,that's really about using information,,abstract information,,to make emotionally resonant pieces.,And it's called music.,We've been making musicnfor tens of thousands of years, right?,And if you think about what music is --,notes and chords and keysnand harmonies and melodies --,these things are algorithms.,These things are systems,that are designed to unfold over time,,to make us feel.,I came to the arts through music.,I was trained as a composer,,and about 15 years ago,nI started making pieces,that were designed to looknat the intersection,between sound and image,,to use an image to unveilna musical structure,or to use a sound to show younsomething interesting,about something that's usually pictorial. 
 So what you're seeing on the screennis literally being drawn,by the musical structurenof the musicians onstage,,and there's no accidentnthat it looks like a plant,,because the underlyingnalgorithmic biology of the plant,is what informed the musical structurenin the first place.,So once you know how to do this,nonce you know how to code with media,,you can do some pretty cool stuff. 
 This is a project I didnfor the Sundance Film Festival.,Really simple idea: you takenevery Academy Award Best Picture,,you speed it up to one minute each,and string them all together.,And so in 75 minutes, I can show younthe history of Hollywood cinema.,And what it really shows younis the history of editing,in Hollywood cinema.,So on the left, we've got Casablanca;non the right, we've got Chicago.,And you can see that Casablancanis a little easier to read.,That's because the average lengthnof a cinematic shot in the 1940s,was 26 seconds,,and now it's around six seconds. 
 This is a project that was inspired,by some work that was fundednby the US Federal Government,in the early 2000s,,to look at video footage and findna specific actor in any video.,And so I repurposed this codento train a system on one person,in our culture who would never neednto be surveilled in that manner,,which is Britney Spears.,I downloaded 2,000 paparazzinphotos of Britney Spears,and trained my computer to find her face,and her face alone.,I can run any footage of her through itnand will center her eyes in the frame,,and this sort of is a littlendouble commentary,about surveillance in our society.,We are very fraught with anxietynabout being watched,,but then we obsess over celebrity. 
 What you're seeing on the screen herenis a collaboration I did,with an artist named Lián Amaris.,What she did is very simplento explain and describe,,but very hard to do.,She took 72 minutes of activity,,getting ready for a night out on the town,,and stretched it over three days,and performed it on a traffic islandnin slow motion in New York City.,I was there, too, with a film crew.,We filmed the whole thing,,and then we reversed the process,nspeeding it up to 72 minutes again,,so it looks like she's moving normally,and the whole world is flying by. 
 At a certain point, I figured out,that what I was doingnwas making portraits.,When you think about portraiture,nyou tend to think about stuff like this.,The guy on the leftnis named Gilbert Stuart.,He's sort of the first real portraitistnof the United States.,And on the right is his portraitnof George Washington from 1796.,This is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.,And if you look at this painting,nthere's a lot of symbolism, right?,We've got a rainbow out the window.nWe've got a sword.,We've got a quill on the desk.,All of these things are meant to evoke,George Washingtonnas the father of the nation. 
 This is my portrait of George Washington.,And this is an eye chart,,only instead of letters, they're words.,And what the words are is the 66 words,in George Washington'snState of the Union addresses,that he uses morenthan any other president.,So "gentlemen" has its own symbolismnand its own rhetoric.,And it's really kind of significantnthat that's the word he used the most.,This is the eye chart for George W. Bush,,who was president when I made this piece.,And how you get there,,from "gentlemen" to "terror"nin 43 easy steps,,tells us a lot about American history,,and gives you a different insight,than you would havenlooking at a series of paintings.,These pieces provide a history lessonnof the United States,through the politicalnrhetoric of its leaders.,Ronald Reagan spent a lot of timentalking about deficits.,Bill Clinton spent a lot of time,talking about the century in whichnhe would no longer be president,,but maybe his wife would be.,Lyndon Johnson was the first President,to give his State of the Union addressesnon prime-time television;,he began every paragraphnwith the word "tonight.",And Richard Nixon,nor more accurately, his speechwriter,,a guy named William Safire,,spent a lot of timenthinking about language,and making sure that his bossnportrayed a rhetoric of honesty. 
 This project is shownnas a series of monolithic sculptures.,It's an outdoor series of light boxes.,And it's important to notenthat they're to scale,,so if you stand 20 feet back and you cannread between those two black lines,,you have 20/20 vision. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a portrait.nAnd there's a lot of these.,There's a lot of waysnto do this with data.,I started looking for a way,to think about how I can dona more democratic form of portraiture,,something that's more aboutnmy country and how it works.,Every 10 years, we make a censusnin the United States.,We literally count people,,find out who lives where,nwhat kind of jobs we've got,,the language we speak at home.,And this is important stuff --nreally important stuff.,But it doesn't really tell us who we are.,It doesn't tell us about our dreamsnand our aspirations. 
 And so in 2010, I decidednto make my own census.,And I started looking for a corpus of data,that had a lot of descriptionsnwritten by ordinary Americans.,And it turns out,that there is such a corpus of data,that's just sitting there for the taking.,It's called online dating. 
 So in 2010, I joined 21 differentnonline dating services,,as a gay man, a straight man,na gay woman and a straight woman,,in every zip code in America,and downloaded aboutn19 million people's dating profiles --,about 20 percent of the adult populationnof the United States.,I have obsessive-compulsive disorder.,This is going to becomenreally freaking obvious. Just go with me. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what I did was I sortednall this stuff by zip code.,And I looked at word analysis.,These are some dating profiles from 2010,with the word "lonely" highlighted.,If you look at these thingsntopographically,,if you imagine dark colors to light colorsnare more use of the word,,you can see that Appalachianis a pretty lonely place.,You can also seenthat Nebraska ain't that funny.,This is the kinky map,nso what this is showing you,is that the women in Alaskanneed to get together,with the men in southern New Mexico,,and have a good time.,And I have thisnat a pretty granular level,,so I can tell you that the mennin the eastern half of Long Island,are way more interested in being spanked,than men in the western halfnof Long Island.,This will be your one takeawaynfrom this whole conference.,You're going to remembernthat fact for, like, 30 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 When you bring this downnto a cartographic level,,you can make maps and do the same tricknI was doing with the eye charts.,You can replace the namenof every city in the United States,with the word people use morenin that city than anywhere else.,If you've ever dated anyonenfrom Seattle, this makes perfect sense.,You've got "pretty."nYou've got "heartbreak.",You've got "gig." You've got "cigarette.",They play in a band and they smoke.,And right above that you can see "email.",That's Redmond, Washington,,which is the headquartersnof the Microsoft Corporation.,Some of these you can guess --nso, Los Angeles is "acting",and San Francisco is "gay.",Some are a little bit more heartbreaking.,In Baton Rouge, they talknabout being curvy;,downstream in New Orleans,nthey still talk about the flood.,Folks in the American capitalnwill say they're interesting.,People in Baltimore, Maryland,nwill say they're afraid.,This is New Jersey.,I grew up somewherenbetween "annoying" and "cynical." 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 And New York City'snnumber one word is "now,",as in, "Now I'm working as a waiter,nbut actually I'm an actor." 
 (Laughter) 
 Or, "Now I'm a professor of engineeringnat NYU, but actually I'm an artist.",If you go upstate, you see "dinosaur.",That's Syracuse.,The best place to eatnin Syracuse, New York,,is a Hell's Angels barbecue jointncalled Dinosaur Barbecue.,That's where you wouldntake somebody on a date.,I live somewhere between "unconditional"nand "midsummer," in Midtown Manhattan.,And this is gentrified North Brooklyn,,so you've got "DJ" and "glamorous"nand "hipsters" and "urbane.",So that's maybena more democratic portrait.,And the idea was, what if we madenred-state and blue-state maps,based on what we want to donon a Friday night? 
 This is a self-portrait.,This is based on my email,,about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.,You can think of thisnas a quantified selfie.,So what I'm doing is runningna physics equation,based on my personal data.,You have to imagine everybodynI've ever corresponded with.,It started out in the middlenand it exploded with a big bang.,And everybody has gravity to one another,,gravity based on how muchnthey've been emailing,,who they've been emailing with.,And it also does sentimental analysis,,so if I say "I love you,"nyou're heavier to me.,And you attract to my emailnaddresses in the middle,,which act like mainline stars.,And all the names are handwritten. 
 Sometimes you do this datanand this work with real-time data,to illuminate a specific problemnin a specific city.,This is a Walther PPK 9mmnsemiautomatic handgun,that was used in a shootingnin the French Quarter of New Orleans,about two years ago on Valentine's Daynin an argument over parking.,Those are my cigarettes.,This is the housenwhere the shooting took place.,This project involvedna little bit of engineering.,I've got a bike chainnrigged up as a cam shaft,,with a computer driving it.,That computer and the mechanismnare buried in a box.,The gun's on top welded to a steel plate.,There's a wire goingnthrough to the trigger,,and the computer in the box is online.,It's listening to the 911 feednof the New Orleans Police Department,,so that anytime there's a shootingnreported in New Orleans, 
 (Gunshot sound) 
 the gun fires.,Now, there's a blank,nso there's no bullet.,There's big light, big noise,and most importantly, there's a casing.,There's about five shootingsna day in New Orleans,,so over the four monthsnthis piece was installed,,the case filled up with bullets.,You guys know what this is --nyou call this "data visualization.",When you do it right, it's illuminating.,When you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.,It reduces people to numbers.,So watch out. 
 One last piece for you.,I spent the last summernas the artist in residence,for Times Square.,And Times Square in New Yorknis literally the crossroads of the world.,One of the thingsnpeople don't notice about it,is it's the most Instagrammednplace on Earth.,About every five seconds,nsomeone commits a selfie,in Times Square.,That's 17,000 a day, and I have them all. 
 (Laughter) 
 These are some of themnwith their eyes centered. 
 Every civilization,,will use the maximum levelnof technology available to make art.,And it's the responsibilitynof the artist to ask questions,about what that technology means,and how it reflects our culture. 
 So I leave you with this:nwe're more than numbers.,We're people, and we havendreams and ideas.,And reducing us to statisticsnis something that's done,at our peril. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)What started as a platform for hobbyists,is poised to becomena multibillion-dollar industry.,Inspection, environmental monitoring,nphotography and film and journalism:,these are some of the potentialnapplications for commercial drones,,and their enablersnare the capabilities being developed,at research facilities around the world. 
 For example, before aerialnpackage delivery,entered our social consciousness,,an autonomous fleet of flying machinesnbuilt a six-meter-tall tower,composed of 1,500 bricks,in front of a live audiencenat the FRAC Centre in France,,and several years ago,nthey started to fly with ropes.,By tethering flying machines,,they can achieve high speedsnand accelerations in very tight spaces.,They can also autonomously buildntensile structures.,Skills learned include how to carry loads,,how to cope with disturbances,,and in general, how to interactnwith the physical world. 
 Today we want to show you somennew projects that we've been working on.,Their aim is to push the boundarynof what can be achieved,with autonomous flight. 
 Now, for a system to functionnautonomously,,it must collectively know the locationnof its mobile objects in space.,Back at our lab at ETH Zurich,,we often use external camerasnto locate objects,,which then allows us to focus our efforts,on the rapid developmentnof highly dynamic tasks.,For the demos you will see today, however,,we will use new localization technologyndeveloped by Verity Studios,,a spin-off from our lab.,There are no external cameras.,Each flying machine uses onboard sensorsnto determine its location in space,and onboard computationnto determine what its actions should be.,The only external commandsnare high-level ones,such as "take off" and "land." 
 This is a so-called tail-sitter.,It's an aircraft that triesnto have its cake and eat it.,Like other fixed-wing aircraft,nit is efficient in forward flight,,much more so than helicoptersnand variations thereof.,Unlike most othernfixed-wing aircraft, however,,it is capable of hovering,,which has huge advantagesnfor takeoff, landing,and general versatility.,There is no free lunch, unfortunately.,One of the limitations with tail-sitters,is that they're susceptiblento disturbances such as wind gusts.,We're developing new controlnarchitectures and algorithms,that address this limitation.,The idea is for the aircraft to recover,no matter what state it finds itself in,,and through practice,nimprove its performance over time. 
 (Applause) 
 OK. 
 When doing research,,we often ask ourselvesnfundamental abstract questions,that try to get at the heart of a matter.,For example, one such question would be,,what is the minimum number of moving partsnneeded for controlled flight?,Now, there are practical reasons,why you may want to knownthe answer to such a question.,Helicopters, for example,,are affectionately knownnas machines with a thousand moving parts,all conspiring to do you bodily harm.,It turns out that decades ago,,skilled pilots were able to flynremote-controlled aircraft,that had only two moving parts:,a propeller and a tail rudder.,We recently discoverednthat it could be done with just one. 
 This is the monospinner,,the world's mechanically simplestncontrollable flying machine,,invented just a few months ago.,It has only one moving part, a propeller.,It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,,no other actuators,nno other control surfaces,,just a simple propeller.,Even though it's mechanically simple,,there's a lot going onnin its little electronic brain,to allow it to fly in a stable fashionnand to move anywhere it wants in space.,Even so, it doesn't yet have,the sophisticated algorithmsnof the tail-sitter,,which means that in ordernto get it to fly,,I have to throw it just right.,And because the probabilitynof me throwing it just right is very low,,given everybody watching me,,what we're going to do instead,is show you a videonthat we shot last night. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 If the monospinnernis an exercise in frugality,,this machine here, the omnicopter,nwith its eight propellers,,is an exercise in excess.,What can you do with all this surplus?,The thing to noticenis that it is highly symmetric.,As a result, it is ambivalentnto orientation.,This gives it an extraordinary capability.,It can move anywhere it wants in space,irrespective of where it is facing,and even of how it is rotating.,It has its own complexities,,mainly having to donwith the interacting flows,from its eight propellers.,Some of this can be modeled,nwhile the rest can be learned on the fly.,Let's take a look. 
 (Applause) 
 If flying machines are goingnto enter part of our daily lives,,they will need to becomenextremely safe and reliable.,This machine over here,is actually two separatentwo-propeller flying machines.,This one wants to spin clockwise.,This other one wantsnto spin counterclockwise.,When you put them together,,they behave like onenhigh-performance quadrocopter.,If anything goes wrong, however --,a motor fails, a propeller fails,nelectronics, even a battery pack --,the machine can still fly,nalbeit in a degraded fashion.,We're going to demonstrate this to you nownby disabling one of its halves. 
 (Applause) 
 This last demonstration,is an exploration of synthetic swarms.,The large number of autonomous,ncoordinated entities,offers a new palettenfor aesthetic expression.,We've taken commercially availablenmicro quadcopters,,each weighing lessnthan a slice of bread, by the way,,and outfitted themnwith our localization technology,and custom algorithms.,Because each unitnknows where it is in space,and is self-controlled,,there is really no limit to their number. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause) 
 Hopefully, these demonstrationsnwill motivate you to dream up,new revolutionary rolesnfor flying machines.,That ultrasafe one over there for example,has aspirations to becomena flying lampshade on Broadway. 
 (Laughter) 
 The reality is that it isndifficult to predict,the impact of nascent technology.,And for folks like us, the real rewardnis the journey and the act of creation.,It's a continual reminder,of how wonderful and magicalnthe universe we live in is,,that it allows creative, clever creatures,to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.,The fact that this technology,has such huge commercialnand economic potential,is just icing on the cake. 
 Thank you.

 That was a song based onnnumerous work songs,,and it was arranged by Odetta,,a hero of mine.,And this next song, well,,I do a lot of historical music,,starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops,and continuing on in my solo endeavors.,And I believe that knowingnyour history as a musician,is super important --,it's important as a person,,it's important as a country,,it's important as a people. 
 So I read a lot about wherenthe music comes from,and where this country comes from.,I've been reading a lotnabout the Civil War,and about slavery.,And it's really tough.,You know?,It's really tough reading.,And so as an artist,nwhat I do with all that emotion,,reading these people's stories,,not just, "Oh, slavery was terrible.",Yes, it was.,But it's reading individual narrativesnof how it was for these people.,You know?,Then it's like, "Yeah,nthat could've been me.",And it is people now. You know?,So what you do with all that emotion,is you've got to do something with it.,As an artist, I write.,So I wrote a song based onnsome of those narratives that I read,,and it's called, "Come Love Come.",We're going to do it for you now.

 So, with the darknyou have to have the light.,And in the African-American community,,it's been the work of manynhundreds of years,to find a way to lift ourselves up.,So I'm going to end with a couplenof tunes from Sister Rosetta Tharpe,,one of the more influentialnAmerican music figures,that most of you probably never heard of.,If you have, I'm so happy.,She's one of the innovatorsnof rock 'n' roll guitar,,and one of the first crossover artistsnfrom gospel to secular.,She's an incredibly important figure,,and I'm going to talk about hernwhenever I can.,So these are a couple of her tunes.,And don't worry -- you're going to getnyour chance to sing.

 (Applause and cheers) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause)For the next 16 minutes,nI'm going to take you on a journey,that is probablynthe biggest dream of humanity:,to understand the code of life. 
 So for me, everything startednmany, many years ago,when I met the first 3D printer.,The concept was fascinating.,A 3D printer needs three elements:,a bit of information, somenraw material, some energy,,and it can produce any objectnthat was not there before. 
 I was doing physics,nI was coming back home,and I realized that I actuallynalways knew a 3D printer.,And everyone does.,It was my mom. 
 (Laughter) 
 My mom takes three elements:,a bit of information, which is betweennmy father and my mom in this case,,raw elements and energynin the same media, that is food,,and after several months, produces me.,And I was not existent before. 
 So apart from the shock of my momndiscovering that she was a 3D printer,,I immediately got mesmerizednby that piece,,the first one, the information.,What amount of information does it take,to build and assemble a human?,Is it much? Is it little?,How many thumb drives can you fill? 
 Well, I was studying physicsnat the beginning,and I took this approximation of a humannas a gigantic Lego piece.,So, imagine that the buildingnblocks are little atoms,and there is a hydrogen here,na carbon here, a nitrogen here.,So in the first approximation,,if I can list the number of atomsnthat compose a human being,,I can build it.,Now, you can run some numbers,and that happens to benquite an astonishing number.,So the number of atoms,,the file that I will save in my thumbndrive to assemble a little baby,,will actually fill an entire Titanicnof thumb drives --,multiplied 2,000 times.,This is the miracle of life.,Every time you see from now onna pregnant lady,,she's assembling the biggestnamount of information,that you will ever encounter.,Forget big data, forgetnanything you heard of.,This is the biggest amountnof information that exists. 
 (Applause) 
 But nature, fortunately, is much smarternthan a young physicist,,and in four billion years, managednto pack this information,in a small crystal we call DNA.,We met it for the first time in 1950nwhen Rosalind Franklin,,an amazing scientist, a woman,,took a picture of it.,But it took us more than 40 yearsnto finally poke inside a human cell,,take out this crystal,,unroll it, and read it for the first time.,The code comes out to bena fairly simple alphabet,,four letters: A, T, C and G.,And to build a human,nyou need three billion of them.,Three billion.,How many are three billion?,It doesn't really makenany sense as a number, right? 
 So I was thinking hownI could explain myself better,about how big and enormous this code is.,But there is -- I mean,nI'm going to have some help,,and the best person to help menintroduce the code,is actually the first mannto sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.,So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter. 
 (Applause) 
 Not the man in the flesh,,but for the first time in history,,this is the genome of a specific human,,printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:,262,000 pages of information,,450 kilograms, shippednfrom the United States to Canada,thanks to Bruno Bowden,nLulu.com, a start-up, did everything.,It was an amazing feat. 
 But this is the visual perceptionnof what is the code of life.,And now, for the first time,nI can do something fun.,I can actually poke inside it and read.,So let me take an interestingnbook ... like this one.,I have an annotation;nit's a fairly big book.,So just to let you seenwhat is the code of life.,Thousands and thousands and thousands,and millions of letters.,And they apparently make sense.,Let's get to a specific part.,Let me read it to you: 
 (Laughter) 
 "AAG, AAT, ATA." 
 To you it sounds like mute letters,,but this sequence givesnthe color of the eyes to Craig.,I'll show you another part of the book.,This is actually a littlenmore complicated. 
 Chromosome 14, book 132: 
 (Laughter) 
 As you might expect. 
 (Laughter) 
 "ATT, CTT, GATT." 
 This human is lucky,,because if you miss justntwo letters in this position --,two letters of our three billion --,he will be condemnednto a terrible disease:,cystic fibrosis.,We have no cure for it,nwe don't know how to solve it,,and it's just two lettersnof difference from what we are. 
 A wonderful book, a mighty book,,a mighty book that helped me understand,and show you something quite remarkable.,Every one of you -- what makesnme, me and you, you --,is just about five million of these,,half a book.,For the rest,,we are all absolutely identical.,Five hundred pagesnis the miracle of life that you are.,The rest, we all share it.,So think about that againnwhen we think that we are different.,This is the amount that we share. 
 So now that I have your attention,,the next question is:,How do I read it?,How do I make sense out of it?,Well, for however good you can benat assembling Swedish furniture,,this instruction manualnis nothing you can crack in your life. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,,Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,,decided to assemble a new company.,Human Longevity was born,,with one mission:,trying everything we can try,and learning everythingnwe can learn from these books,,with one target --,making real the dreamnof personalized medicine,,understanding what thingsnshould be done to have better health,and what are the secrets in these books. 
 An amazing team, 40 data scientistsnand many, many more people,,a pleasure to work with.,The concept is actually very simple.,We're going to use a technologyncalled machine learning.,On one side, we have genomes --nthousands of them.,On the other side, we collectednthe biggest database of human beings:,phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR --neverything you can think of.,Inside there, on these two opposite sides,,there is the secret of translation.,And in the middle, we build a machine.,We build a machinenand we train a machine --,well, not exactly one machine,nmany, many machines --,to try to understand and translatenthe genome in a phenotype.,What are those letters,nand what do they do?,It's an approach that cannbe used for everything,,but using it in genomicsnis particularly complicated.,Little by little we grew and we wantednto build different challenges.,We started from the beginning,nfrom common traits.,Common traits are comfortablenbecause they are common,,everyone has them. 
 So we started to ask our questions:,Can we predict height?,Can we read the booksnand predict your height?,Well, we actually can,,with five centimeters of precision.,BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,,but we still can, we get in the ballpark,neight kilograms of precision.,Can we predict eye color?,Yeah, we can.,Eighty percent accuracy.,Can we predict skin color?,Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.,Can we predict age?,We can, because apparently,nthe code changes during your life.,It gets shorter, you lose pieces,nit gets insertions.,We read the signals, and we make a model. 
 Now, an interesting challenge:,Can we predict a human face?,It's a little complicated,,because a human face is scatterednamong millions of these letters.,And a human face is notna very well-defined object.,So, we had to build an entire tier of it,to learn and teachna machine what a face is,,and embed and compress it.,And if you're comfortablenwith machine learning,,you understand what the challenge is here. 
 Now, after 15 years -- 15 years afternwe read the first sequence --,this October, we startednto see some signals.,And it was a very emotional moment.,What you see here is a subjectncoming in our lab.,This is a face for us.,So we take the real face of a subject,nwe reduce the complexity,,because not everything is in your face --,lots of features and defectsnand asymmetries come from your life.,We symmetrize the face,nand we run our algorithm.,The results that I show you right now,,this is the prediction we havenfrom the blood. 
 (Applause) 
 Wait a second.,In these seconds, your eyes are watching,nleft and right, left and right,,and your brain wantsnthose pictures to be identical.,So I ask you to donanother exercise, to be honest.,Please search for the differences,,which are many.,The biggest amount of signalncomes from gender,,then there is age, BMI,nthe ethnicity component of a human.,And scaling up over that signalnis much more complicated.,But what you see here,neven in the differences,,lets you understandnthat we are in the right ballpark,,that we are getting closer.,And it's already giving you some emotions. 
 This is another subjectnthat comes in place,,and this is a prediction.,A little smaller face, we didn't getnthe complete cranial structure,,but still, it's in the ballpark.,This is a subject that comes in our lab,,and this is the prediction.,So these people have never been seennin the training of the machine.,These are the so-called "held-out" set.,But these are people that you willnprobably never believe.,We're publishing everythingnin a scientific publication,,you can read it. 
 But since we are onstage,nChris challenged me.,I probably exposed myselfnand tried to predict,someone that you might recognize.,So, in this vial of blood --nand believe me, you have no idea,what we had to do to haventhis blood now, here --,in this vial of blood is the amountnof biological information,that we need to do a full genome sequence.,We just need this amount.,We ran this sequence,nand I'm going to do it with you.,And we start to layer upnall the understanding we have.,In the vial of blood,nwe predicted he's a male.,And the subject is a male.,We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.,The subject is a meter and 77 cm.,So, we predicted that he's 76;nthe subject is 82.,We predict his age, 38.,The subject is 35.,We predict his eye color.,Too dark.,We predict his skin color.,We are almost there.,That's his face. 
 Now, the reveal moment:,the subject is this person. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I did it intentionally.,I am a very particularnand peculiar ethnicity.,Southern European, Italians --nthey never fit in models.,And it's particular -- that ethnicitynis a complex corner case for our model.,But there is another point.,So, one of the things that we usena lot to recognize people,will never be written in the genome.,It's our free will, it's how I look.,Not my haircut in this case,nbut my beard cut.,So I'm going to show you, I'm going to,nin this case, transfer it --,and this is nothing morenthan Photoshop, no modeling --,the beard on the subject.,And immediately, we getnmuch, much better in the feeling. 
 So, why do we do this?,We certainly don't do itnfor predicting height,or taking a beautiful picturenout of your blood.,We do it because the same technologynand the same approach,,the machine learning of this code,,is helping us to understand how we work,,how your body works,,how your body ages,,how disease generates in your body,,how your cancer grows and develops,,how drugs work,and if they work on your body. 
 This is a huge challenge.,This is a challenge that we share,with thousands of othernresearchers around the world.,It's called personalized medicine.,It's the ability to movenfrom a statistical approach,where you're a dot in the ocean,,to a personalized approach,,where we read all these books,and we get an understandingnof exactly how you are.,But it is a particularlyncomplicated challenge,,because of all these books, as of today,,we just know probably two percent:,four books of more than 175. 
 And this is not the topic of my talk,,because we will learn more.,There are the best mindsnin the world on this topic.,The prediction will get better,,the model will get more precise.,And the more we learn,,the more we willnbe confronted with decisions,that we never had to face before,about life,,about death,,about parenting. 
 So, we are touching the veryninner detail on how life works.,And it's a revolutionnthat cannot be confined,in the domain of science or technology.,This must be a global conversation.,We must start to think of the futurenwe're building as a humanity.,We need to interact with creatives,nwith artists, with philosophers,,with politicians.,Everyone is involved,,because it's the future of our species.,Without fear, but with the understanding,that the decisionsnthat we make in the next year,will change the course of history forever. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I used to have this recurring dream,where I'd walk into a roomful of people,,and I'd try not to makeneye contact with anyone.,Until someone notices me,,and I just panic.,And the person walks up to me,,and says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.,And what is your name?",And I'm just quiet, unable to respond.,After some awkward silence, he goes,,"Have you forgotten your name?",And I'm still quiet.,And then, slowly, all the other peoplenin the room begin to turn toward me,and ask, almost in unison, 
 (Voice-over, several voices)n"Have you forgotten your name?",As the chant gets louder,nI want to respond, but I don't. 
 I'm a visual artist.,Some of my work is humorous,,and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.,And one thing that I really enjoy doing,is making these little animations,where I get to do the voice-overnfor all kinds of characters.,I've been a bear. 
 (Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi. 
 (Laughter) 
 Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale. 
 (Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi. 
 (Laughter) 
 SS: I've been a greeting card. 
 (Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi. 
 (Laughter) 
 SS: And my personal favoritenis Frankenstein's monster. 
 (Video) Frankenstein's monstern(SS's voice): (Grunts) 
 (Laughter) 
 SS: I just had to gruntna lot for that one. 
 A few years ago,nI made this educational video,about the history of video games.,And for that one, I got to donthe voice of Space Invader. 
 (Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi. 
 SS: A dream come true, really, 
 (Laughter),And when that video was posted online,,I just sat there on the computer,nhitting "refresh,",excited to see the response.,The first comment comes in. 
 (Video) Comment: Great job.,SS: Yes!,I hit "refresh." 
 (Video) Comment: Excellent video.nI look forward to the next one. 
 SS: This was just the firstnof a two-part video.,I was going to worknon the second one next.,I hit "refresh." 
 (Video) Comment: Where is part TWO?nWHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P 
 (Laughter) 
 SS: People other than my momnwere saying nice things about me,,on the Internet!,It felt like I had finally arrived.,I hit "refresh." 
 (Video) Comment: His voicenis annoying. No offense. 
 SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh. 
 (Video) Comment: Could you remake thisnwithout peanut butter in your mouth? 
 SS: OK, at least the feedbacknis somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh." 
 (Video) Comment: Please don't usenthis narrator again,u can barely understand him. 
 SS: Refresh. 
 (Video) Comment: Couldn't follownbecause of the Indian accent. 
 SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.,Number one, I don't have an Indian accent,,I have a Pakistani accent, OK?,And number two, I clearlynhave a Pakistani accent. 
 (Laughter) 
 But comments like that kept coming in,,so I figured I should just ignore them,and start workingnon the second part of the video.,I recorded my audio,,but every time I sat down to edit,,I just could not do it.,Every single time, it would take menback to my childhood,,when I had a much harder time speaking. 
 I've stuttered for as longnas I can remember.,I was the kid in class,who would never raise his handnwhen he had a question --,or knew the answer.,Every time the phone rang,,I would run to the bathroomnso I would not have to answer it.,If it was for me, my parentsnwould say I'm not around.,I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.,And I hated introducing myself,,especially in groups.,I'd always stutter on my name,nand there was usually someone who'd go,,"Have you forgotten your name?",And then everybody would laugh.,That joke never got old. 
 (Laughter) 
 I spent my childhoodnfeeling that if I spoke,,it would become obviousnthat there was something wrong with me,,that I was not normal.,So I mostly stayed quiet.,And so you see, eventually for me to evennbe able to use my voice in my work,was a huge step for me.,Every time I record audio,,I fumble my way through sayingneach sentence many, many times,,and then I go back in,and pick the onesnwhere I think I suck the least. 
 (Voice-over) SS: Audio editingnis like Photoshop for your voice.,I can slow it down, speed it up,nmake it deeper, add an echo.,And if I stutter along the way,nand if I stutter along the way,,I just go back in and fix it.,It's magic. 
 SS: Using my highly editednvoice in my work,was a way for mento finally sound normal to myself.,But after the comments on the video,,it no longer made me feel normal.,And so I stoppednusing my voice in my work.,Since then, I've thought a lotnabout what it means to be normal.,And I've come to understand,that "normal" has a lot to donwith expectations. 
 Let me give you an example.,I came across this story,about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.,Now, Homer mentionsnvery few colors in his writing.,And even when he does,,he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.,For example, the seanis described as wine red,,people's faces are sometimes greennand sheep are purple.,But it's not just Homer.,If you look at allnof the ancient literature --,Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian,and even the original Hebrew Bible --,they all mention very few colors.,And the most popular theorynfor why that might be the case,is that cultures beginnto recognize a color,only once they have the abilitynto make that color.,So basically, if you can make a color,,only then can you see it.,A color like red, which was fairly easynfor many cultures to make --,they began to see that colornfairly early on.,But a color like blue,nwhich was much harder to make --,many cultures didn't begin to learnnhow to make that color,until much later.,They didn't begin to see itnuntil much later as well.,So until then, even thoughna color might be all around them,,they simply did not haventhe ability to see it.,It was invisIble.,It was not a part of their normal. 
 And that story has helpednput my own experience into context.,So when I first readnthe comments on the video,,my initial reaction was to take itnall very personally.,But the people commenting did not know,how self-conscious I am about my voice.,They were mostly reacting to my accent,,that it is not normalnfor a narrator to have an accent. 
 But what is normal, anyway?,We know that reviewers will findnmore spelling errors in your writing,if they think you're black.,We know that professors are less likelynto help female or minority students.,And we know that resumesnwith white-sounding names,get more callbacks than resumesnwith black-sounding names.,Why is that?,Because of our expectationsnof what is normal.,We think it is normal,when a black student has spelling errors.,We think it is normal,when a female or minority studentndoes not succeed.,And we think it is normal,that a white employeenis a better hire than a black employee.,But studies also shownthat discrimination of this kind,,in most cases, is simply favoritism,,and it results more from wantingnto help people that you can relate to,than the desire to harm peoplenthat you can't relate to. 
 And not relating to peoplenstarts at a very early age.,Let me give you an example.,One library that keeps track of characters,in the children's bookncollection every year,,found that in 2014,nonly about 11 percent of the books,had a character of color.,And just the year before,nthat number was about eight percent,,even though half of American childrenntoday come from a minority background.,Half. 
 So there are two big issues here.,Number one, children are toldnthat they can be anything,,they can do anything,,and yet, most storiesnthat children of color consume,are about people who are not like them.,Number two is that majority groupsndon't get to realize,the great extent to whichnthey are similar to minorities --,our everyday experiences, our hopes,,our dreams, our fears,and our mutual love for hummus.,It's delicious! 
 (Laughter) 
 Just like the color bluenfor Ancient Greeks,,minorities are not a partnof what we consider normal,,because normal is simply a constructionnof what we've been exposed to,,and how visible it is around us. 
 And this is where thingsnget a bit difficult.,I can accept the preexisting notionnof normal -- that normal is good,,and anything outside of that verynnarrow definition of normal is bad.,Or I can challengenthat preexisting notion of normal,with my work,and with my voice,and with my accent,and by standing here onstage,,even though I'm scared shitlessnand would rather be in the bathroom. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Video) Sheep (SS's voice):nI'm now slowly starting to use my voice,in my work again.,And it feels good.,It does not mean I won't have a breakdown,the next time a couple dozennpeople say that I talk,(Mumbling) like I have peanutnbutter in my mouth. 
 (Laughter) 
 SS: It just means I now havena much better understanding,of what's at stake,,and how giving up is not an option. 
 The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake upnone day and realize,that the sky was blue.,It took centuries, even, for humansnto realize what we had been ignoring,for so long.,And so we must continuously challengenour notion of normal,,because doing so is goingnto allow us as a society,to finally see the sky for what it is. 
 (Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you.nThank you. Thank you. Thank you.,Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts) 
 (Laughter) 
 SS: Thank you. 
 (Applause)As a conceptual artist,,I'm constantly looking for creative waysnto spark challenging conversations.,I do this though painting, sculpture,nvideo and performance.,But regardless of the format,,two of my favorite materialsnare history and dialogue. 
 In 2007, I created "Lotus,",a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,,600-pound glass depictionnof a lotus blossom.,In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbolnfor transcendence,and for purity of mind and spirit.,But a closer look at this lotus,reveals each petalnto be the cross-section of a slave ship.,This iconic diagram was takennfrom a British slaving manual,and later used by abolitionists to shownthe atrocities of slavery.,In America, we don't likento talk about slavery,,nor do we look at it as a global industry.,But by using this Buddhist symbol,,I hope to universalize and transcend,the history and trauma of black America,and encourage discussionsnabout our shared past. 
 To create "Lotus,"nwe carved over 6,000 figures.,And this later led to a commissionnby the City of New York,to create a 28-foot version in steel,as a permanent installationnat the Eagle Academy for Young Men,,a school for black and latino students,,the two groups most affectednby this history.,The same two groups are very affectednby a more recent phenomenon,,but let me digress. 
 I've been collectingnwooden African figures,from tourist shops and flea marketsnaround the world.,The authenticity and originnof them is completely debatable,,but people believe thesento be imbued with power,,or even magic.,Only recently have I figured outnhow to use this in my own work. 
 (Gun shots) 
 Since 2012, the world has witnessednthe killings of Trayvon Martin,,Michael Brown, Eric Garner,nSandra Bland, Tamir Rice,and literally countless othernunarmed black citizens,at the hands of the police,,who frequently walk awaynwith no punishment at all.,In consideration of these victims,and the several times that even I,,a law-abiding, Ivy League professor,,have been targeted and harassednat gunpoint by the police.,I created this body of worknsimply entitled "BAM." 
 It was important to erasenthe identity of each of these figures,,to make them all look the samenand easier to disregard.,To do this, I dip them in a thick,nbrown wax,before taking them to a shooting range,where I re-sculpted them using bullets.,And it was fun,,playing with big guns andnhigh-speed video cameras.,But my reverence for these figuresnkept me from actually pulling the trigger,,somehow feeling as if I wouldnbe shooting myself.,Finally, my cameraman, Raul,nfired the shots.,I then took the fragments of these,and created molds,nand cast them first in wax,,and finally in bronzenlike the image you see here,,which bears the marksnof its violent creation,like battle wounds or scars. 
 When I showed this work recently in Miami,,a woman told me she feltnevery gun shot to her soul.,But she also felt that these artworks,memorialized the victims of these killings,as well as other victims ofnracial violence throughout US history. 
 But "Lotus" and "BAM" are largernthan just US history.,While showing in Berlin last year,,a philosophy student asked menwhat prompted these recent killings.,I showed him a photonof a lynching postcard,from the early 1900s,and reminded him that these killingsnhave been going on for over 500 years.,But it's only through questions like his,and more thoughtful dialoguenabout history and race,can we evolve as individuals and society. 
 I hope my artwork creates a safe space,for this type of honest exchange,and an opportunity for peoplento engage one another,in real and necessary conversation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As an archaeologist,,I'm most often askednwhat my favorite discovery is.,The answer's easy:,my husband, Greg. 
 (Laughter) 
 We met in Egypt on my first dig.,It was my first lesson in findingnunexpected, wonderful things.,This began an incrediblenarchaeological partnership.,Years later, I proposed to himnin front of our favorite pair statue,of the Prince and PrincessnRahotep and Nofret,,in the Cairo Museum,,dating to 4,600 years ago. 
 I thought if I was going to ask Gregnto spend the rest of this life with me,,then I should ask himnin front of two people,who had pledgednto be together for eternity.,These symbols endurenbecause when we look at them,,we're looking at mirrors.,They are powerful reminders,that our common humanity has not changed. 
 The thrill of archaeological discoverynis as powerful as love,,because ancient history is the mostnseductive mistress imaginable.,Many archaeologistsnhave devoted their lives,to unraveling the mysteries of the past,under hot suns,and Arctic winds,and in dense rainforests.,Many seek.,Some discover.,All worship at the temple of possibility,that one discovery might change history. 
 On my first day in Egypt,nI worked at a site,in the Northeast Egyptian Deltancalled Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,,in a cemetery.,That's a picture of me --,I'm just in my bliss.,On the dig, surroundednby emerald green rice paddies,,I discovered an intact pot.,Flipping it over,,I discovered a human thumbprintnleft by whoever made the vessel.,For a moment, time stood still.,I didn't know where I was.,It was because at that moment I realized,,when we dig,,we're digging for people,,not things. 
 Never are we so present as whennwe are in the midst of the great past.,I can't tell you how many times I've stoodnin front of the Pyramids of Giza,,and they leave me speechless.,I feel like the luckiestnperson in the world.,They're a monument to our human brilliancenand everything that is possible.,Many cannot processntheir brilliance as human --,they think aliens built them.,But this is ridiculous.,All you need to donis get up close and personal,,and see the hidden hand of man,in the chisel marks leftnby the tools that built them.,The Great Pyramid of Gizanwas built one stone at a time,with 2.3 million blocks,,with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.,It is not the pyramidsnthat stand the test of time;,it is human ingenuity.,That is our shared human brilliance.,History may be cyclical,,but we are singular. 
 I love what I do,,because I learn that we haven't changed.,I get to read about mother-in-lawnjokes from Mesopotamia,from 3,500 years ago. 
 (Laughter) 
 I get to hear about neighborsncursing each other,from 4,600 years ago in Egypt.,And my absolute favorite,nfrom 3,300 years ago in Luxor:,an inscription that describes schoolboysnwho cut class to go drinking. 
 (Laughter) 
 Kids these days. 
 (Laughter) 
 I get to see the mostnincredible architecture,,see stunning sculptures --,I mean, this is basicallyna selfie in stone --,and see that we've alwaysnrocked serious bling.,And also, we've been posting on walls,and obsessing about cats -- 
 (Laughter) 
 for thousands of years. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Archaeologists are the culturalnmemory preservers,and the spokespeople,for the billions of peoplenand the thousands of cultures,that came before us. 
 Good science, imaginationnand a leap of faith,are the trifecta we use to raise the dead.,In the last year,,archaeologists have madenincredible discoveries, including:,new human ancestors from South Africa;,tools from 3.3 million years ago --,these are the oldest toolsnever discovered --,in Kenya.,And this, from a seriesnof medical implements found,from Blackbeard's ship from 1718.,What you're looking at is a medical toolnused to treat syphilis.,Ouch! 
 (Laughter) 
 For each of these,,there are thousands of othernincredibly important discoveries,made by my colleagues,,that do not make headlines.,However, I believe that the mostnimportant thing we do as archaeologists,is acknowledge that past people existed,and lived lives worth learning about.,Can you even imaginenwhat the world would be like today,if we acknowledged allnhuman beings in this way? 
 So, on a dig, we have a challenge:,it often looks like this.,You can't see anything.,Where are we going to start digging?,This is from a site south of Cairo.,Let's have a look from space.,Again, you can't really see much.,What you're looking atnis a WorldView-3 satellite image,,which has a .3 meter resolution.,That's 10 inches.,This means that you can zoom innfrom 400 miles in space,and see your tablets.,How do I know about this?,It's because I'm a space archaeologist.,Let me repeat that.,I am a space archaeologist.,This means -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 This means I use satellite imagesnand process them using algorithms,,and look at subtle differencesnin the light spectrum,that indicate buried thingsnunder the ground,that I get to go excavate and survey.,By the way --,NASA has a Space Archaeology program,,so it's a real job. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, let's have a look again.,We're back at the sitenjust south of Cairo.,You can't see anything.,Keep your eye on the red rectangle.,When we process the imagenusing algorithms --,think like a space-based CAT scan --,this is what you see.,This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb,that is previously unknownnand unexcavated,,and you all are the first peoplento see it in thousands of years. 
 (Applause) 
 I believe we have barelynscratched the surface,in terms of what's left to discover.,In the Egyptian Delta alone,,we've excavated lessnthan one-1000th of one percent,of the total volume of Egyptian sites.,When you add to thatnthe thousands of other sites,my team and I have discovered,,what we thought we knewnpales in comparison,to what we have left to discover.,When you look at the incredible work,that my colleagues are doingnall around the world,and what they're finding,,I believe that there are millionsnof undiscovered archaeological sites,left to find.,Discovering them will do nothing less,than unlock the full potentialnof our existence. 
 But we have a challenge.,Over the last year,,we've seen horrible headlines,of incredible destruction going onnto archaeological sites,,and massive looting by people like ISIL.,ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.,Who blows up a temple?,They've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.,And we've seen lootingnat sites so rampant,,it looks like craters of the moon.,Knowing ISIL's desire to destroynmodern human lives,,it's a natural extension for themnto destroy cultural identity as well.,Countless invading armiesnhave done the same throughout history. 
 We know that ISIL is profitingnfrom the looting of sites,,but we don't know the scale.,This means that any objectnpurchased on the market today,from the Middle East,could potentially be funding terrorism.,When a site is looted,,it's as if a puzzle already missingn90 percent of it pieces,has had the rest obscurednbeyond recognition.,This is ancient identity theft writ large.,We know that there are two kindsnof looting going on:,looting by criminal elements like ISIL,,and then more local lootingnby those that are desperate for money.,We would all do the samento feed our families;,I don't blame the local looters.,I blame the middlemen,nthe unethical traffickers,and an international art market,that exploits often ambiguousnor even completely nonexistent laws. 
 We know looting is going onnon a global scale and it's increasing,,but presently we don't havenany tools to stop it.,This is beginning to change.,My team and I have just completed a studynlooking at looting in Egypt.,We looked at open-source data,and mapped the entiretynof looting across Egypt,from 2002 to 2013.,We found evidence of lootingnand site destruction at 267 sites,,and mapped over 200,000 looting pits.,It's astonishing.,And putting that data together --,you can see the looting pits marked here.,At one site, the looting got badnfrom 2009, 2011, 2012 --,hundreds and hundreds of pits. 
 Putting all the data together,,what we found is that,ncontrary to popular opinion,,looting did not start to get worsenin Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring,,but in 2009, after the global recession.,Thus, we've shown with big data,that looting is fundamentallynan economic issue.,If we do nothing to stop the problem,,all of Egypt's sites will be affectednby looting by 2040.,Thus, we are at a tipping point.,We are the generation with all the toolsnand all the technologies,to stop looting,,but we're not working fast enough. 
 Sometimes an archaeological sitencan surprise you with its resilience.,I am just back from the field,,where I co-led a joint missionnwith Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities,at a site called Lisht.,This site dates to the Middle Kingdomnof Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.,The Middle Kingdom was AncientnEgypt's Renaissance period.,After a time of intense internal strifenand environmental challenges,,Egypt rebounded,with an incredible resurgencenof art, architecture and literature.,It's a favorite period of timento study in Egypt,,because it teaches us so muchnabout how we can survive and thrive,after great disasters. 
 Now at this site, we had already mappedncountless looting pits.,Lisht is a royal site;,there would have been thousandsnof people buried there,who lived and workednat the court of Pharaoh.,You can see this before and after;nyou see dozens of looting pits.,North Lisht.,This is in South Lisht, before and after.,When we first visited the site,,we could see the tombsnof many high-ranking officials,that had been looted.,Let me put into perspectivenfor you what was taken.,Imagine a two meter by two meter areanfull of coffins, jewelry,and incredible statuary.,Multiply that times over a thousand.,That's what was taken. 
 So, when we started work,,my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef,napproached me and said,,"We must work at this one particular tomb.,It's been attacked by looters.,If we don't do anything, they'll be back.",Of course I agreed,nbut I didn't think we'd find anything.,I thought the lootersnhad stolen everything.,What we started to findnwere the most incredible reliefs.,Look at this painting --nit's just stunning.,We started finding engraved inscriptions.,And even the titles of the tomb owner --,he had titles like,n"Overseer of the Army,","Overseer of the Treasury.",I began to have hope.,Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.,For the ancient Egyptians, havingntheir name last for eternity,was their goal.,And then one day,,this appeared.,This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.,You can see it written outnhere, in hieroglyphs.,Working together with my Egyptian team,,we had restored someone's namenfrom 3,900 years ago. 
 (Applause) 
 Working togethernwith my Egyptian colleagues,,we celebrated this momentnof shared discovery.,What we were doing togethernwas right and true.,We found this incrediblenfalse door, mostly intact.,On it we read about Intefnand his inscriptions.,You can actually even see him seated here.,What I realized is that everythingnI had assumed about looted sites,had been proven wrong. 
 Every day on site we workedntogether with 70 Egyptians,as colleagues and friends.,In the face of so muchnhatred and ignorance,against those in the Middle East,,every moment on site felt likena protest for peace.,When you work with thosenthat don't look like you,,or think like you, or speak like you,,your shared missionnof archaeological discovery,erases all superficial differences.,What I learned this season,is that archaeologynisn't about what you find.,It's about what you can prove possible. 
 Sometimes when you travel,nyou end up finding long-lost family --,not those with whom you share genes,,but a shared entry in the book of life.,This is Omer Farrouk, my brother.,Omer's a Gufti from a villagenjust North of Luxor, called Guft.,Guftis are part of a celebratedntradition in Egyptology.,They help with diggingnand work crew organization.,Omer is my COO and CFO.,I simply couldn't do work without him.,One day many years ago,nwhen I was a young graduate student,and Omer was a young Guftinwho couldn't speak much English,,we learned, completely randomly,,that we were born in the same year,,the same month,and the same day, six hours apart.,Twins. 
 (Laughter) 
 Separated by an ocean,nbut forever connected,for Ancient Egypt is our mother.,I knew then we'd always work together --,not in my brain,,but in the part of your soul that knowsnnot everything can be explained. 
 (Arabic) Omer by brother,,I will always love you. 
 (English) Omer my brother,nI will always love you. 
 So, just before my first dig in Egypt,,my mentor, the very famous EgyptologistnProfessor William Kelly Simpson,,called me into his office.,He handed me a check for $2,000,,and said, "This is to cover your expenses.,Have a glorious adventure this summer.,Someday you will do thisnfor someone else.",Thus, my TED Prize wishnis partial payback, plus interest -- 
 (Laughter) 
 for a great human being'sngenerosity and kindness. 
 So, my wish.,I wish for us to discover the millionsnof unknown archaeological sites,around the world.,By creating a 21st-century armynof global explorers,,we'll find and protectnthe world's hidden heritage,,which contains cluesnto humankind's collective resilience,and creativity. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So how are we going to do this?,We are going to buildnwith the TED Prize money,an online, crowdsource,ncitizen science platform,to allow anyone in the worldnto engage with discovering,archaeological sites.,There are only a couple hundred of usnspace archaeologists around the world.,It is my dream to engage the world,with helping to find sitesnand protect them.,What you'll do is sign in,ncreate a username --,note that this particular usernamenis already taken. 
 (Laughter) 
 You'll take a tutorialnand you'll start work.,I want to note at the outset,that in no way will be sharingnGPS data or mapping data for sites.,We want to treat themnlike human patient data,,and not reveal their locations.,You'll then be dealt a card from a deck --n20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters,,and you'll be looking for features.,My team and I will have batch-processed,large amounts of satellite datanusing algorithms,in order for you to find things,,so you'll be doing really good science. 
 You'll then be starting to look.,What do you see? Do you see a temple?,Do you see a tomb? Do you see a pyramid?,Do you see any potentialnsite damage or site looting?,You'll then begin to mark what's there.,And off to the side are alwaysngoing to be rich examples,of exactly what you're seeing,nto help guide you.,All the data that you help us collectnwill be shared with vetted authorities,,and will help createna new global alarm system,to help protect sites.,But it's not just going to stop there.,All the archaeologists with whomnwe share your discoveries,will take you with themnas they begin to excavate them,,by using Periscope, Google Plusnand social media. 
 A hundred years ago,narchaeology was for the rich.,Fifty years ago,,it was for men.,Now it's primarily for academics.,Our goal is to democratize the processnof archaeological discovery,,and allow anyone to participate.,Ninety-four years ago,,Howard Carter discoverednthe tomb of King Tut.,Who is the next Howard Carter?,It might be you. 
 By creating this platform,,we will find the millions of placesnoccupied by the billions of people,that came before us.,If we want to answernthe big questions about who we are,and where we've come from,,the answers to those questionsndo not lie in pyramids or palaces,,but in the cities and villagesnof those that came before us.,If we want to learn about the past,,it's time we inverted the pyramids.,Acknowledging that the pastnis worth saving,means so much more.,It means that we're worth saving, too.,And the greatest story ever told,is the story of our shared human journey.,But the only way we're goingnto be able to write it,is if we do it together.,Come with me. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How much do you neednto know about a person,before you'd feel comfortablenmaking a loan? 
 Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars,to the person sitting two rows behind you.,What would you need to knownabout that person,before you'd feel comfortable? 
 My mom came to the US from Indianin her late thirties.,She's a doctor in Brooklyn,,and she often lets friends and neighborsncome to see her for health services,,whether they can pay right away or not.,I remember running into her patientsnwith her at the grocery store,or on the sidewalk,,and sometimes they would comenand pay her right on the spot,for previous appointments.,She would thank them,,and ask them about their familiesnand their health.,She gave them creditnbecause she trusted them. 
 Most of us are like my mom.,We would give credit to someone we know,or that we live next to.,But most of us are probably notngoing to lend to a stranger,unless we know a littlensomething about them. 
 Banks, credit card companiesnand other financial institutions,don't know us on a personal level,,but they do have a way of trusting us,,and that's through our credit scores.,Our credit scores have been created,through an aggregation and analysisnof our public consumer credit data.,And because of them, we havenpretty much easy access,to all of the goodsnand services that we need,,from getting electricity to buying a home,,or taking a risk and starting a business. 
 But ...,there are 2.5 billion peoplenaround the world,that don't have a credit score.,That's a third of the world's population.,They don't have a score,because there are no formalnpublic records on them --,no bank accounts,,no credit histories,and no social security numbers.,And because they don't have a score,,they don't have accessnto the credit or financial products,that can improve their lives.,They are not trusted. 
 So we wanted to find a way to build trust,and to open up financial accessnfor these 2.5 billion.,So we created a mobile application,that builds credit scores for themnusing mobile data.,There are currently over one billionnsmartphones in emerging markets.,And people are using themnthe same way that we do.,They're texting their friends,nthey're looking up directions,,they're browsing the Internet,and they're even makingnfinancial transactions. 
 Over time, this data is gettingncaptured on our phones,,and it provides a really rich picturenof a person's life.,Our customers give us access to this data,and we capture itnthrough our mobile application.,It helps us understandnthe creditworthiness,of people like Jenipher,na small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.,Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decadesnhas been running a food stall,in the central business district.,She has three sons who she putnthrough vocational school,,and she's also the leadernof her local chama,,or savings group. 
 Jenipher's food stall does well.,She makes just enough every daynto cover her expenses.,But she's not financially secure.,Any emergency could force her into debt.,And she has no discretionary income,to improve her family's way of living,,for emergencies,,or for investingninto growing her business.,If Jenipher wants credit,nher options are limited.,She could get a microloan,,but she'd have to form a groupnthat could help vouch for her credibility.,And even then, the loan sizesnwould be way too small,to really have an impact on her business,,averaging around 150 dollars.,Loan sharks are always an option,,but with interest ratesnthat are well above 300 percent,,they're financially risky.,And because Jenipher doesn't havencollateral or a credit history,,she can't walk into a banknand ask for a business loan. 
 But one day,,Jenipher's son convinced hernto download our application,and apply for a loan.,Jenipher answered a fewnquestions on her phone,and she gave us access to a fewnkey data points on her device. 
 And here's what we saw.,So, bad news first.,Jenipher had a low savings balancenand no previous loan history.,These are factors,that would have thrown upna red flag to a traditional bank.,But there were other pointsnin her history that showed us,a much richer picture of her potential.,So for one,,we saw that she made regularnphone calls to her family in Uganda.,Well, it turns out that the data shows,a four percent increase in repayment,among people who consistentlyncommunicate with a few close contacts.,We could also see,that though she travelednaround a lot throughout the day,,she actually had prettynregular travel patterns,,and she was either at homenor at her food stall.,And the data showsna six percent increase in repayment,among customers who are consistent,with where they spend most of their time. 
 We could also seenthat she communicated a lot,with many different peoplenthroughout the day,and that she had a strong support network.,Our data shows,that people who communicatenwith more than 58 different contacts,tend to be more likelynto be good borrowers.,In Jenipher's case,,she communicatednwith 89 different individuals,,which showed a nine percentnincrease in her repayment. 
 These are just some of the thousandsnof different data points,that we look at to understandna person's creditworthiness.,And after analyzing allnof these different data points,,we took the first risk,and gave Jenipher a loan.,This is data that would notnbe found on a paper trail,or in any formal financial record.,But it proves trust.,By looking beyond income,,we can see that people in emerging markets,that may seem riskynand unpredictable on the surface,are actually willing and haventhe capacity to repay. 
 Our credit scores have helped us delivernover 200,000 loans in Kenya,in just the past year.,And our repayment ratesnare above 90 percent --,which, by the way, is in linenwith traditional bank repayment rates. 
 With something as simplenas a credit score,,we're giving people the powernto build their own futures.,Our customers have usedntheir loans for family expenses,,emergencies, travel,and for investing backninto growing their businesses.,They're now building betterneconomies and communities,where more people can succeed. 
 Over the past two yearsnof using our product,,Jenipher has increasednher savings by 60 percent.,She's also startedntwo additional food stalls,and is now making plansnfor her own restaurant.,She's applying for a small-business loannfrom a commercial bank,,because she now has the credit historynto prove she deserves it. 
 I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,,and she told me how excitednshe was to get started.,She said,,"Only my son believed I could do this.nI didn't think this was for me.",She's lived her whole life,believing that there was a partnof the world that was closed off to her. 
 Our job now is to opennthe world to Jenipher,and the billions like hernthat deserve to be trusted. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So a while ago, I tried an experiment.,For one year, I would say yesnto all the things that scared me.,Anything that made me nervous,ntook me out of my comfort zone,,I forced myself to say yes to.,Did I want to speak in public?,No, but yes.,Did I want to be on live TV?,No, but yes.,Did I want to try acting?,No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes. 
 And a crazy thing happened:,the very act of doingnthe thing that scared me,undid the fear,,made it not scary.,My fear of public speaking,nmy social anxiety, poof, gone.,It's amazing, the power of one word.,"Yes" changed my life.,"Yes" changed me.,But there was one particular yes,that affected my lifenin the most profound way,,in a way I never imagined,,and it started with a questionnfrom my toddler. 
 I have these three amazing daughters,nHarper, Beckett and Emerson,,and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicablynrefers to everyone as "honey.",as though she's a Southern waitress. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Honey, I'm gonna need some milknfor my sippy cup." 
 (Laughter) 
 The Southern waitress asked mento play with her one evening,when I was on my way somewhere,nand I said, "Yes.",And that yes was the beginningnof a new way of life for my family.,I made a vow that from now on,,every time one of my childrennasks me to play,,no matter what I'm doingnor where I'm going,,I say yes, every single time.,Almost. I'm not perfect at it,nbut I try hard to practice it.,And it's had a magical effect on me,,on my children, on our family.,But it's also had a stunning side effect,,and it wasn't until recentlynthat I fully understood it,,that I understood that saying yesnto playing with my children,likely saved my career. 
 See, I have what most peoplenwould call a dream job.,I'm a writer. I imagine.nI make stuff up for a living.,Dream job.,No.,I'm a titan.,Dream job.,I create television.nI executive produce television.,I make television,na great deal of television.,In one way or another, this TV season,,I'm responsible for bringing aboutn70 hours of programming to the world.,Four television programs,n70 hours of TV -- 
 (Applause) 
 Three shows in productionnat a time, sometimes four.,Each show creates hundreds of jobsnthat didn't exist before.,The budget for one episodenof network television,can be anywherenfrom three to six million dollars.,Let's just say five.,A new episode made every nine daysntimes four shows,,so every nine days that'sn20 million dollars worth of television,,four television programs, 70 hours of TV,,three shows in production at a time,nsometimes four,,16 episodes going on at all times:,24 episodes of "Grey's,"n21 episodes of "Scandal,",15 episodes ofn"How To Get Away With Murder,",10 episodes of "The Catch,"nthat's 70 hours of TV,,that's 350 million dollars for a season.,In America, my television shows,are back to back to backnon Thursday night.,Around the world, my shows airnin 256 territories in 67 languages,for an audience of 30 million people.,My brain is global,,and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TVnare shows I personally created,and not just produced,nso on top of everything else,,I need to find time,nreal quiet, creative time,,to gather my fans around the campfire,and tell my stories.,Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,,three shows in production at a time,,sometimes four, 350 million dollars,ncampfires burning all over the world.,You know who else is doing that?,Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.,Dream job. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.,I tell you this because I know what younthink of when you hear the word "writer.",I tell you this so that all of younout there who work so hard,,whether you run a companynor a country or a classroom,or a store or a home,,take me seriouslynwhen I talk about working,,so you'll get that I don'tnpeck at a computer and imagine all day,,so you'll hear me when I say,that I understand that a dream jobnis not about dreaming.,It's all job, all work, all reality,nall blood, all sweat, no tears.,I work a lot, very hard, and I love it. 
 When I'm hard at work,nwhen I'm deep in it,,there is no other feeling.,For me, my work is at all timesnbuilding a nation out of thin air.,It is manning the troops.nIt is painting a canvas.,It is hitting every high note.nIt is running a marathon.,It is being Beyoncé.,And it is all of those thingsnat the same time.,I love working.,It is creative and mechanicalnand exhausting and exhilarating,and hilarious and disturbingnand clinical and maternal,and cruel and judicious,,and what makes it all so good is the hum.,There is some kind of shift inside menwhen the work gets good.,A hum begins in my brain,,and it grows and it growsnand that hum sounds like the open road,,and I could drive it forever.,And a lot of people,nwhen I try to explain the hum,,they assume that I'm talkingnabout the writing,,that my writing brings me joy.,And don't get me wrong, it does.,But the hum --,it wasn't until I startednmaking television,that I started working, working and making,and building and creatingnand collaborating,,that I discovered this thing,nthis buzz, this rush, this hum.,The hum is more than writing.,The hum is action and activity.nThe hum is a drug.,The hum is music.nThe hum is light and air.,The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.,And when you have a hum like that,,you can't help but strive for greatness.,That feeling, you can't helpnbut strive for greatness at any cost.,That's called the hum.,Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic. 
 (Laughter) 
 Maybe it's called genius.,Maybe it's called ego.,Maybe it's just fear of failure.,I don't know.,I just know thatnI'm not built for failure,,and I just know that I love the hum.,I just know that I wantnto tell you I'm a titan,,and I know thatnI don't want to question it. 
 But here's the thing:,the more successful I become,,the more shows, the more episodes,nthe more barriers broken,,the more work there is to do,,the more balls in the air,,the more eyes on me,nthe more history stares,,the more expectations there are.,The more I work to be successful,,the more I need to work.,And what did I say about work?,I love working, right?,The nation I'm building,nthe marathon I'm running,,the troops, the canvas,nthe high note, the hum,,the hum, the hum.,I like that hum. I love that hum.,I need that hum. I am that hum.,Am I nothing but that hum? 
 And then the hum stopped.,Overworked, overused,,overdone, burned out.,The hum stopped. 
 Now, my three daughtersnare used to the truth,that their mothernis a single working titan.,Harper tells people,,"My mom won't be there,nbut you can text my nanny.",And Emerson says, "Honey,nI'm wanting to go to ShondaLand.",They're children of a titan.,They're baby titans.,They were 12, 3, and 1nwhen the hum stopped.,The hum of the engine died.,I stopped loving work.nI couldn't restart the engine.,The hum would not come back.,My hum was broken.,I was doing the same thingsnI always did, all the same titan work,,15-hour days, workingnstraight through the weekends,,no regrets, never surrender,na titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,,full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.,But there was no hum.,Inside me was silence.,Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,nthree shows in production at a time,,sometimes four.,Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,nthree shows in production at a time ...,I was the perfect titan.,I was a titan you couldntake home to your mother.,All the colors were the same,nand I was no longer having any fun.,And it was my life.,It was all I did.,I was the hum, and the hum was me.,So what do you do when the thing you do,,the work you love,nstarts to taste like dust? 
 Now, I know somebody's out there thinking,,"Cry me a river,nstupid writer titan lady." 
 (Laughter) 
 But you know, you do,,if you make, if you work,nif you love what you do,,being a teacher, being a banker,nbeing a mother, being a painter,,being Bill Gates,,if you simply love another personnand that gives you the hum,,if you know the hum,,if you know what the hum feels like,nif you have been to the hum,,when the hum stops, who are you?,What are you?,What am I?,Am I still a titan?,If the song of my heart ceases to play,ncan I survive in the silence? 
 And then my Southern waitress toddlernasks me a question.,I'm on my way out the door,nI'm late, and she says,,"Momma, wanna play?" 
 And I'm just about to say no,nwhen I realize two things.,One, I'm supposednto say yes to everything,,and two, my Southern waitressndidn't call me "honey.",She's not calling everyonen"honey" anymore.,When did that happen?,I'm missing it, being a titannand mourning my hum,,and here she is changingnright before my eyes.,And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?",And I say, "Yes.",There's nothing special about it.,We play, and we're joined by her sisters,,and there's a lot of laughing,,and I give a dramatic readingnfrom the book Everybody Poops.,Nothing out of the ordinary. 
 (Laughter) 
 And yet, it is extraordinary,,because in my pain and my panic,,in the homelessness of my humlessness,,I have nothing to do but pay attention.,I focus.,I am still.,The nation I'm building,nthe marathon I'm running,,the troops, the canvas,nthe high note does not exist.,All that exists are sticky fingers,and gooey kissesnand tiny voices and crayons,and that song about letting go,of whatever it is that Frozen girlnneeds to let go of. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's all peace and simplicity.,The air is so rare in this place for menthat I can barely breathe.,I can barely believe I'm breathing.,Play is the opposite of work.,And I am happy.,Something in me loosens.,A door in my brain swings open,,and a rush of energy comes.,And it's not instantaneous,nbut it happens, it does happen.,I feel it.,A hum creeps back.,Not at full volume, barely there,,it's quiet, and I have to staynvery still to hear it, but it is there.,Not the hum, but a hum. 
 And now I feel like I knowna very magical secret.,Well, let's not get carried away.,It's just love. That's all it is.,No magic. No secret. It's just love.,It's just something we forgot.,The hum, the work hum,nthe hum of the titan,,that's just a replacement.,If I have to ask you who I am,,if I have to tell you who I am,,if I describe myself in terms of shows,and hours of televisionnand how globally badass my brain is,,I have forgotten what the real hum is.,The hum is not powernand the hum is not work-specific.,The hum is joy-specific.,The real hum is love-specific.,The hum is the electricitynthat comes from being excited by life.,The real hum is confidence and peace.,The real hum ignores the stare of history,,and the balls in the air,nand the expectation, and the pressure.,The real hum is singular and original.,The real hum is God's whisper in my ear,,but maybe God was whisperingnthe wrong words,,because which one of the godsnwas telling me I was the titan? 
 It's just love.,We could all use a little more love,,a lot more love.,Any time my child asks me to play,,I will say yes.,I make it a firm rule for one reason,,to give myself permission,,to free me from allnof my workaholic guilt.,It's a law, so I don't have a choice,,and I don't have a choice,,not if I want to feel the hum. 
 I wish it were that easy,,but I'm not good at playing.,I don't like it.,I'm not interested in doing itnthe way I'm interested in doing work.,The truth is incredibly humblingnand humiliating to face.,I don't like playing.,I work all the timenbecause I like working.,I like working morenthan I like being at home.,Facing that factnis incredibly difficult to handle,,because what kind of personnlikes working more than being at home? 
 Well, me.,I mean, let's be honest,nI call myself a titan.,I've got issues. 
 (Laughter) 
 And one of those issuesnisn't that I am too relaxed. 
 (Laughter) 
 We run around the yard,nup and back and up and back.,We have 30-second dance parties.,We sing show tunes. We play with balls.,I blow bubbles and they pop them.,And I feel stiff and deliriousnand confused most of the time.,I itch for my cell phone always.,But it is OK.,My tiny humans show me how to livenand the hum of the universe fills me up.,I play and I play until I begin to wonder,why we ever stop playingnin the first place. 
 You can do it too,,say yes every timenyour child asks you to play.,Are you thinking that maybenI'm an idiot in diamond shoes?,You're right, but you can still do this.,You have time.,You know why? Because you're not Rihannanand you're not a Muppet.,Your child does not thinknyou're that interesting. 
 (Laughter) 
 You only need 15 minutes.,My two- and four-year-oldnonly ever want to play with me,for about 15 minutes or so,before they think to themselvesnthey want to do something else.,It's an amazing 15 minutes,nbut it's 15 minutes.,If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy,nI'm invisible after 15 minutes. 
 (Laughter) 
 And my 13-year-old, if I can getna 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes,I'm Parent of the Year. 
 (Laughter) 
 15 minutes is all you need.,I can totally pull off 15 minutesnof uninterrupted time on my worst day.,Uninterrupted is the key.,No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.,You have a busy life.nYou have to get dinner on the table.,You have to force them to bathe.nBut you can do 15 minutes.,My kids are my happy place,nthey're my world,,but it doesn't have to be your kids,,the fuel that feeds your hum,,the place where lifenfeels more good than not good.,It's not about playing with your kids,,it's about joy.,It's about playing in general.,Give yourself the 15 minutes.,Find what makes you feel good.,Just figure it out and play in that arena. 
 I'm not perfect at it.nIn fact, I fail as often as I succeed,,seeing friends, reading books,nstaring into space.,"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthandnfor indulging myself,in ways I'd given up on right aroundnthe time I got my first TV show,,right around the timenI became a titan-in-training,,right around the time I startedncompeting with myself for ways unknown.,15 minutes? What could be wrongnwith giving myself my full attention,for 15 minutes?,Turns out, nothing.,The very act of not working has made itnpossible for the hum to return,,as if the hum's enginencould only refuel while I was away.,Work doesn't work without play. 
 It takes a little time,nbut after a few months,,one day the floodgates open,and there's a rush, and I find myselfnstanding in my office,filled with an unfamiliar melody,nfull on groove inside me,,and around me, and it sends menspinning with ideas,,and the humming road is open,nand I can drive it and drive it,,and I love working again.,But now, I like that hum,nbut I don't love that hum.,I don't need that hum.,I am not that hum. That hum is not me,,not anymore.,I am bubbles and sticky fingersnand dinners with friends.,I am that hum.,Life's hum.,Love's hum.,Work's hum is still a piece of me,nit is just no longer all of me,,and I am so grateful.,And I don't give a crapnabout being a titan,,because I have never once seen a titannplay Red Rover, Red Rover. 
 I said yes to less work and more play,nand somehow I still run my world.,My brain is still global.nMy campfires still burn.,The more I play, the happier I am,nand the happier my kids are.,The more I play,nthe more I feel like a good mother.,The more I play,nthe freer my mind becomes.,The more I play, the better I work.,The more I play, the more I feel the hum,,the nation I'm building,nthe marathon I'm running,,the troops, the canvas,nthe high note, the hum, the hum,,the other hum, the real hum,,life's hum.,The more I feel that hum,,the more this strange,nquivering, uncocooned,,awkward, brand new,,alive non-titan feels like me.,The more I feel that hum,nthe more I know who I am.,I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.,That part of the job,nthat's living the dream.,That's the dream of the job.,Because a dream jobnshould be a little bit dreamy. 
 I said yes to less work and more play.,Titans need not apply. 
 Wanna play? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I wanted to --nwell, this morning --,I want to talk about the futurenof human-driven transportation;,about how we can cut congestion,npollution and parking,by getting more people into fewer cars;,and how we can do itnwith the technology that's in our pockets.,And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...,not self-driving cars. 
 But to get started we've gotnto go back over 100 years.,Because it turns outnthere was an Uber way before Uber.,And if it had survived,,the future of transportationnwould probably already be here. 
 So let me introduce you to the jitney.,In 1914 it was created or inventednby a guy named LP Draper.,He was a car salesman from LA,nand he had an idea.,Well, he was cruising aroundndowntown Los Angeles,,my hometown,,and he saw trolleys,with long lines of people tryingnto get to where they wanted to go.,He said, well, why don'tnI just put a sign on my car,that takes people wherevernthey want to go for a jitney --,that was slang for a nickel. 
 And so people jumped on board,,and not just in Los Angelesnbut across the country.,And within one year,,by 1915,,there were 50,000nrides per day in Seattle,,45,000 rides per day in Kansas,and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.,To give you some perspective,,Uber in Los Angeles,is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...,100 years later. 
 And so these are the trolley guys,,the existing transportationnmonopoly at the time.,They were clearly not happynabout the jitney juggernaut.,And so they got to work,and they went to cities across the country,and got regulations put in placento slow down the growth of the jitney. 
 And there were all kinds of regulations.,There were licenses --noften they were pricey.,In some cities,,if you were a jitney driver,,you were required to benin the jitney for 16 hours a day.,In other cities,,they required two jitneyndrivers for one jitney.,But there was a reallyninteresting regulation,which was they had tonput a backseat light --,install it in every Jitney --,to stop a new pernicious innovationnwhich they called spooning. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right. So what happened?,Well, within a yearnthis thing had taken off.,But the jitney, by 1919, was regulatedncompletely out of existence. 
 That's unfortunate ...,because, well, when you can't share a car,nthen you have to own one.,And car ownership skyrocketed,and it's no wonder that by 2007,,there was a car for every man,nwoman and child in the United States.,And that phenomenon had gone global.,In China by 2011,,there were more car salesnhappening in China than in the US. 
 Now, all this private ownershipnof course had a public cost.,In the US, we spendn7 billion hours a year,,wasted, sitting in traffic.,160 billion dollars in lost productivity,,of course also sitting in traffic,,and one-fifth of allnof our carbon footprint,is spewed out in the airnby those cars that we're sitting in. 
 Now, that's only four percentnof our problem though.,Because if you have to own a car,then that means 96 percent of the timenyour car is sitting idle.,And so, up to 30 percentnof our land and our space,is used storing these hunks of steel.,We even have skyscrapers built for cars.,That's the world we live in today. 
 Now, cities have been dealingnwith this problem for decades.,It's called mass transit.,And even in a city like New York City,,one of the most denselynpopulated in the world,and one of the most sophisticatednmass transit systems in the world,,there are still 2.5 million carsnthat go over those bridges every day.,Why is that?,Well, it's because mass transitnhasn't yet figured out,how to get to everybody's doorstep.,And so back in San Francisco,nwhere I live,,the situation's much worse,,in fact, much worse around the world. 
 And so the beginningnof Uber in 2010 was --,well, we just wantednto push a button and get a ride.,We didn't have any grand ambitions.,But it just turned out,that lots of people wantednto push a button and get a ride,,and ultimately what we started to seenwas a lot of duplicate rides.,We saw a lot of people,pushing the same button at the same time,going essentially to the same place. 
 And so we started thinking about,,well, how do we make those two tripsnand turn them into one.,Because if we did,nthat ride would be a lot cheaper --,up to 50 percent cheaper --,and of course for the city,you've got a lot more peoplenand a lot fewer cars. 
 And so the big question for us was:,would it work?,Could you have a cheaper ride,cheap enough that peoplenwould be willing to share it?,And the answer, fortunately,nis a resounding yes. 
 In San Francisco,,before uberPOOL, we had --,well, everybody would take their carnwherever the heck they wanted.,And the bright colorsnis where we have the most cars.,And once we introduced uberPOOL,,well, you see there's notnas many bright colors.,More people getting aroundnthe city in fewer cars,,taking cars off the road.,It looks like uberPOOL is working. 
 And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles,eight months ago.,And since then, we've takenn7.9 million miles off the roads,and we've taken 1.4 thousandnmetric tons of CO2 out of the air.,But the part that I'm really -- 
 (Applause) 
 But my favorite statistic --,remember, I'm from LA,,I spent years of my life,sitting behind the wheel,ngoing, "How do we fix this?" --,my favorite partnis that eight months later,,we have added 100,000 new peoplenthat are carpooling every week. 
 Now, in China everything is supersized,,and so we're doing 15 millionnuberPOOL trips per month,,that's 500,000 per day.,And of course we're seeingnthat exponential growth happen.,In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.,And when I talk to my team,nwe don't talk about,,"Hey, well, 100,000 peoplencarpooling every week and we're done.",How do we get that to a million?,And in China, well,nthat could be several million. 
 And so uberPOOL is a very greatnsolution for urban carpooling.,But what about the suburbs? 
 This is the streetnwhere I grew up in Los Angeles,,it's actually a suburbncalled Northridge, California,,and, well --,look, those mailboxes,nthey kind of just go on forever.,And every morning at about the same time,,cars roll of out their driveway,,most of them, one person in the car,,and they go to work,nthey go to their place of work.,So the question for us is:,well, how do we turn,all of these commuter cars --,and literally there'sntens of millions of them --,how do we turn all thesencommuter cars into shared cars? 
 Well, we have something for this that wenrecently launched called uberCOMMUTE.,You get up in the morning,nget ready for work, get your coffee,,go to your car,and you light up the Uber app,,and all of a sudden,,you become an Uber driver.,And we'll match you upnwith one of your neighbors,on your way to work,and it's a really great thing. 
 There's just one hitch ...,it's called regulation.,So 54 cents a mile, what is that?,Well, that is what the US government,has determined that the costnof owning a car is per mile.,You can pick up anybodynin the United States,and take them wherever they want to gonat a moment's notice,,for 54 cents a mile or less.,But if you charge 60 cents a mile,nyou're a criminal.,But what if for 60 cents a mile,we could get half a million more peoplencarpooling in Los Angeles?,And what if at 60 cents a mile,we could get 50 million peoplencarpooling in the United States?,If we could,,it's obviously something we should do. 
 And so it goes backnto the lesson of the jitney.,If by 1915 this thing was taking off,,imagine withoutnthe regulations that happened,,if that thing could just keep going.,How would our cities be different today?,Would we have parksnin the place of parking lots?,Well, we lost that chance.,But technology has given usnanother opportunity. 
 Now, I'm as excited as anybody elsenabout self-driving cars,but do we have to really waitnfive, 10 or even 20 years,to make our new cities a reality?,With the technology in our pockets today,,and a little smart regulation,,we can turn every car into a shared car,,and we can reclaim our citiesnstarting today. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you. 
 Travis Kalanick: Thank you. 
 CA: You know -- I mean the companynyou've built is absolutely astounding.,You only just talkednabout a small part of it here --,a powerful part --,the idea of turning carsninto public transport like that,,it's cool.,But I've got a couple other questions,because I know they'renout there on people's minds. 
 So first of all, last week I think it was,,I switched on my phonenand tried to book an Uber,and I couldn't find the app.,You had this very radical,nvery bold, brave redesign. 
 TK: Sure. 
 CA: How did it go?,Did you notice other peoplennot finding the app that day?,Are you going to win people overnfor this redesign? 
 TK: Well, first I shouldnprobably just say,,well, what we were trying to accomplish.,And I think if you knowna little bit about our history,,it makes a lot more sense.,Which is, when we first got started,,it was just black cars.,It was literally you push a buttonnand get an S-Class.,And so what we did,was almost what I would callnan immature version of a luxury brand,that looked like a badge on a luxury car. 
 And as we've gone worldwide,and gone from S-Classesnto auto rickshaws in India,,it became somethingnthat was important for us,to be more accessible,,to be more hyperlocal,,to be about the cities we were in,and that's what you seenwith the patterns and colors.,And to be more iconic,,because a U doesn't meannanything in Sanskrit,,and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.,And so that wasna little bit what it was about. 
 Now, when you firstnroll out something like that,,I mean, your hands are sweating,,you've got --,you know, you're a little worried.,What we saw is a lot of people --,actually, at the beginning,nwe saw a lot more people opening the app,because they were curiousnwhat they would find when they opened it.,And our numbers were slightly upnfrom what we expected. 
 CA: OK, that's cool. 
 Now, so you, yourself,nare something of an enigma, I would say.,Your supporters and investors,nwho have been with you the whole way,,believe that the only chance,of sort of taking onnthe powerful, entrenched interests,of taxi industry and so forth,,is to have someone who isna fierce, relentless competitor,,which you've certainly proved to be. 
 Some people feel you've almostntaken that culture too far,,and you know --nlike a year or two ago,there was a huge controversynwhere a lot of women got upset.,How did it feel likeninside the company during that period?,Did you notice a loss of business?,Did you learn anything from that? 
 TK: Well, look, I think --,I've been an entrepreneurnsince I've been in high school,and you have --,In various different waysnan entrepreneur will see hard times,and for us,,it was about a year and a half ago,,and for us it was hard times, too. 
 Now, inside, we felt like --,I guess at the end of the day,we felt like we werengood people doing good work,,but on the outside that wasn't evident.,And so there was a lot that we had to do,to sort of --,We'd gone from a very small company --,I mean if you go literallyntwo and a half years ago,,our company was 400 people,,and today it's 6,500.,And so when you go through that growth,,you have to sort of cementnyour cultural values,and talk about them all of the time.,And make sure that peoplenare constantly checking,to say, "Are we good peoplendoing good work?",And if you check those boxes,,the next part of thatnis making sure you're telling your story.,And I think we learned a lot of lessons,but I think at the end of itnwe came out stronger.,But it was certainly a difficult period. 
 CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,,you're facing peoplenwho occasionally give you a hard time.,Some Uber driversnin New York and elsewhere,are mad as hell nownbecause you changed the fees,and they can barely -- they claim --nbarely afford the deal anymore. 
 How --,You know, you saidnthat you started this originally --,just the coolness of pressing a buttonnand summoning a ride.,This thing's taken off,,you're affecting the whole globalneconomy, basically, at this point.,You're being forced to be,nwhether you want it or not,,a kind of global visionarynwho's changing the world.,I mean -- who are you?,Do you want that?,Are you ready to go with thatnand be what that takes? 
 TK: Well, there's a few thingsnpacked in that question, so -- 
 (Laughter) 
 First is on the pricing side --,I mean, keep in mind, right?,UberX, when we first started,,was literally 10 or 15 percent cheapernthan our black car product.,It's now,in many cities, half the price of a taxi.,And we have all the data to show,that the divers are making more per hournthan they would as taxi drivers. 
 What happens is when the price goes down,,people are more likely to take Uber,at different times of the daynthan they otherwise would have,,and they're more likely to use itnin places they wouldn't have before.,And what that means for a drivernis wherever he or she drops somebody off,,they're much more likelynto get a pickup and get back in.,And so what that meansnis more trips per hour,,more minutes of the hournwhere they're productive,and actually, earnings come up. 
 And we have cities where we've donenliterally five or six price cuts,and have seen those price cutsngo up over time.,So even in New York --,We have a blog postnwe call "4 Septembers" --,compare the earnings,September after September after September.,Same month every year.,And we see the earnings going up over time,as the price comes down.,And there's a perfect price point --nyou can't go down forever.,And in those placesnwhere we bring the price down,but we don't see those earnings pop,,we bring the prices back up. 
 So that addresses that first part.,And then the enigma and all of this --,I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am,is one that gets really excitednabout solving hard problems.,And the way I like to describe itnis it's kind of like a math professor.,You know? If a math professorndoesn't have hard problems to solve,,that's a really sad math professor.,And so at Uber we like the hard problems,and we like getting excitednabout those and solving them.,But we don't want just any math problem,,we want the hardest onesnthat we can possibly find,,and we want the one that if you solve it,,there's a little bit of a wow factor. 
 CA: In a couple years' time --,say five years' time, I don't know when --,you roll out your incrediblenself-driving cars,,at probably a lower costnthan you currently pay for an Uber ride.,What do you say to your armynof a million drivers plus at that time? 
 TK: Explain that again --nat which time? 
 CA: At the time whennself-driving cars are coming -- 
 TK: Sure, sure, sure.nSorry, I missed that. 
 CA: What do you say to a driver?,TK: Well, look, I thinknthe first part is it's going to take --,it's likely going to take a lot longer,than I think some of the hypenor media might expect.,That's part one. 
 Part two is it's going to also take --,there's going to be a long transition.,These cars will worknin certain places and not in others. 
 For us it's an interestingnchallenge, right?,Because, well --,Google's been investingnin this since 2007,,Tesla's going to be doing it,nApple's going to be doing it,,the manufacturersnare going to be doing it.,This is a world that's going to exist,nand for good reason.,A million people die a year in cars.,And we already looked at the billionsnor even trillions of hours worldwide,that people are spending sitting in them,ndriving frustrated, anxious.,And think about the qualitynof life that improves,when you give people their time back,and it's not so anxiety-ridden.,So I think there's a lot of good. 
 And so the way we think about itnis that it's a challenge,,but one for optimistic leadership,,Where instead of resisting --,resisting technology,,maybe like the taxi industry,nor the trolley industry --,we have to embrace itnor be a part of the future. 
 But how do we optimisticallynlead through it?,Are there ways to partner with cities?,Are there ways to have education systems,nvocational training, etc.,,for that transition period.,It will take a lot longernthan I think we all expect,,especially that transition period.,But it is a world that's going to exist,,and it is going to be a better world. 
 CA: Travis, what you're buildingnis absolutely incredible,and I'm hugely grateful to younfor coming to TED and sharing so openly. 
 Thank you so much.nTK: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So this is James Risen.,You may know him as thenPulitzer Prize-winning reporter,for The New York Times.,Long before anybody knewnEdward Snowden's name,,Risen wrote a book in whichnhe famously exposed,that the NSA was illegally wiretappingnthe phone calls of Americans.,But it's another chapter in that book,that may have an even more lasting impact.,In it, he describes a catastrophicnUS intelligence operation,in which the CIA quite literallynhanded over blueprints,of a nuclear bomb to Iran.,If that sounds crazy, go read it.,It's an incredible story. 
 But you know who didn't like that chapter?,The US government.,For nearly a decade afterwards,,Risen was the subjectnof a US government investigation,in which prosecutors demandednthat he testify,against one of his alleged sources.,And along the way, he became the facenfor the US government's recent pattern,of prosecuting whistleblowersnand spying on journalists. 
 You see, under the First Amendment,,the press has the right to publishnsecret information in the public interest.,But it's impossible to exercise that rightnif the media can't also gather that news,and protect the identitiesnof the brave men and women,who get it to them.,So when the government came knocking,,Risen did what many brave reportersnhave done before him:,he refused,and said he'd rather go to jail.,So from 2007 to 2015,,Risen lived under the specternof going to federal prison. 
 That is, until just days before the trial,nwhen a curious thing happened.,Suddenly, after years of claimingnit was vital to their case,,the government dropped their demandsnto Risen altogether.,It turns out, in the agenof electronic surveillance,,there are very few placesnreporters and sources can hide.,And instead of trying and failingnto have Risen testify,,they could have his digital trailntestify against him instead.,So completely in secretnand without his consent,,prosecutors got Risen's phone records.,They got his email records,nhis financial and banking information,,his credit reports,,even travel records with a listnof flights he had taken.,And it was among this information thatnthey used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,,Risen's alleged sourcenand CIA whistleblower. 
 Sadly, this is only one case of many.,President Obama ran on a promisento protect whistleblowers,,and instead, his Justice Departmentnhas prosecuted more,than all other administrations combined.,Now, you can see how thisncould be a problem,,especially because the governmentnconsiders so much of what it does secret.,Since 9/11, virtually every importantnstory about national security,has been the result of a whistleblowerncoming to a journalist.,So we risk seeing the pressnunable to do their job,that the First Amendmentnis supposed to protect,because of the government'snexpanded ability to spy on everyone. 
 But just as technology has allowednthe government,to circumvent reporters' rights,,the press can also use technology,to protect their sourcesneven better than before.,And they can start from the momentnthey begin speaking with them,,rather than on the witness standnafter the fact.,Communications software now exists,that wasn't availablenwhen Risen was writing his book,,and is much more surveillance-resistantnthan regular emails or phone calls.,For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,,an open-source whistleblowernsubmission system,that was originally created by the latenInternet luminary Aaron Swartz,,and is now developednat the non-profit where I work,,Freedom of the Press Foundation.,Instead of sending an email,,you go to a news organization's website,,like this one here on The Washington Post.,From there, you can upload a documentnor send information,much like you wouldnon any other contact form.,It'll then be encryptednand stored on a server,that only the news organizationnhas access to.,So the government can no longernsecretly demand the information,,and much of the informationnthey would demand,wouldn't be available in the first place. 
 SecureDrop, though, is reallynonly a small part of the puzzle,for protecting press freedomnin the 21st century.,Unfortunately, governmentsnall over the world,are constantly developingnnew spying techniques,that put us all at risk.,And it's up to us going forwardnto make sure,that it's not justnthe tech-savvy whistleblowers,,like Edward Snowden, who havenan avenue for exposing wrongdoing.,It's just as vital that we protect thennext veteran's health care whistleblower,alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,,or the next environmental worker,sounding the alarmnabout Flint's dirty water,,or a Wall Street insider,warning us of the next financial crisis.,After all, these tools weren't just builtnto help the brave men and women,who expose crimes,,but are meant to protectnall of our rights under the Constitution. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Seven years ago, a student came to menand asked me to invest in his company.,He said, "I'm working with three friends,,and we're going to try to disruptnan industry by selling stuff online.",And I said, "OK, you guys spentnthe whole summer on this, right?","No, we all took internshipsnjust in case it doesn't work out.","All right, but you're going tongo in full time once you graduate.","Not exactly. We've allnlined up backup jobs.",Six months go by,,it's the day before the company launches,,and there is stillnnot a functioning website.,"You guys realize,nthe entire company is a website.,That's literally all it is.",So I obviously declined to invest. 
 And they ended upnnaming the company Warby Parker. 
 (Laughter),They sell glasses online.,They were recently recognizednas the world's most innovative company,and valued at over a billion dollars.,And now? My wife handles our investments.,Why was I so wrong? 
 To find out, I've been studying peoplenthat I come to call "originals.",Originals are nonconformists,,people who not only have new ideas,but take action to champion them.,They are peoplenwho stand out and speak up.,Originals drive creativitynand change in the world.,They're the people you want to bet on.,And they look nothing like I expected.,I want to show you todaynthree things I've learned,about recognizing originals,and becoming a little bit more like them. 
 So the first reasonnthat I passed on Warby Parker,was they were really slowngetting off the ground.,Now, you are all intimately familiarnwith the mind of a procrastinator.,Well, I have a confession for you.nI'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.,Yes, that's an actual term.,You know that panic you feelna few hours before a big deadline,when you haven't done anything yet.,I just feel thatna few months ahead of time. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this started early: when I was a kid,nI took Nintendo games very seriously.,I would wake up at 5am,,start playing and not stopnuntil I had mastered them.,Eventually it got so out of handnthat a local newspaper came,and did a story on the dark sidenof Nintendo, starring me. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. 
 (Laughter) 
 But this served me well in college,,because I finished my senior thesisnfour months before the deadline.,And I was proud of that,nuntil a few years ago.,I had a student named Jihae,nwho came to me and said,,"I have my most creative ideasnwhen I'm procrastinating.",And I was like, "That's cute,nwhere are the four papers you owe me?" 
 (Laughter) 
 No, she was onenof our most creative students,,and as an organizational psychologist,nthis is the kind of idea that I test.,So I challenged her to get some data.,She goes into a bunch of companies.,She has people fill out surveysnabout how often they procrastinate.,Then she gets their bosses to ratenhow creative and innovative they are.,And sure enough,nthe precrastinators like me,,who rush in and do everything early,are rated as less creative,than people who procrastinate moderately.,So I want to know what happensnto the chronic procrastinators.,She was like, "I don't know.nThey didn't fill out my survey." 
 (Laughter) 
 No, here are our results.,You actually do see that the peoplenwho wait until the last minute,are so busy goofing offnthat they don't have any new ideas.,And on the flip side,nthe people who race in,are in such a frenzy of anxiety that theyndon't have original thoughts either.,There's a sweet spotnwhere originals seem to live.,Why is this?,Maybe original peoplenjust have bad work habits.,Maybe procrastinatingndoes not cause creativity. 
 To find out, we designed some experiments.,We asked peoplento generate new business ideas,,and then we get independent readers,to evaluate how creativenand useful they are.,And some of them are askednto do the task right away.,Others we randomly assignnto procrastinate,by dangling Minesweeper in front of them,for either five or 10 minutes.,And sure enough,nthe moderate procrastinators,are 16 percent more creativenthan the other two groups.,Now, Minesweeper is awesome,nbut it's not the driver of the effect,,because if you play the game firstnbefore you learn about the task,,there's no creativity boost.,It's only when you're told that you'rengoing to be working on this problem,,and then you start procrastinating,,but the task is still activenin the back of your mind,,that you start to incubate.,Procrastination gives you timento consider divergent ideas,,to think in nonlinear ways,nto make unexpected leaps. 
 So just as we were finishingnthese experiments,,I was starting to writena book about originals,,and I thought, "This is the perfect timento teach myself to procrastinate,,while writing a chapternon procrastination.",So I metaprocrastinated,,and like any self-respectingnprecrastinator,,I woke up early the next morning,and I made a to-do listnwith steps on how to procrastinate. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I worked diligently,toward my goal of not makingnprogress toward my goal.,I started writingnthe procrastination chapter,,and one day -- I was halfway through --,I literally put it away in mid-sentence,for months.,It was agony.,But when I came back to it,nI had all sorts of new ideas.,As Aaron Sorkin put it,,"You call it procrastinating.nI call it thinking.",And along the way I discovered,that a lot of great originalsnin history were procrastinators.,Take Leonardo da Vinci.,He toiled on and off for 16 years,on the Mona Lisa.,He felt like a failure.,He wrote as much in his journal.,But some of the diversionsnhe took in optics,transformed the way that he modeled light,and made him into a much better painter.,What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?,The night beforenthe biggest speech of his life,,the March on Washington,,he was up past 3am, rewriting it.,He's sitting in the audiencenwaiting for his turn to go onstage,,and he is still scribbling notesnand crossing out lines.,When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,,he leaves his prepared remarks,to utter four wordsnthat changed the course of history:,"I have a dream.",That was not in the script.,By delaying the task of finalizingnthe speech until the very last minute,,he left himself opennto the widest range of possible ideas.,And because the text wasn't set in stone,,he had freedom to improvise. 
 Procrastinating is a vicenwhen it comes to productivity,,but it can be a virtue for creativity.,What you see with a lot of great originals,is that they are quick to startnbut they're slow to finish.,And this is what I missednwith Warby Parker.,When they were draggingntheir heels for six months,,I looked at them and said,,"You know, a lot of other companiesnare starting to sell glasses online.",They missed the first-mover advantage.,But what I didn't realize wasnthey were spending all that time,trying to figure out how to get people,to be comfortable ordering glasses online.,And it turns out the first-movernadvantage is mostly a myth.,Look at a classic studynof over 50 product categories,,comparing the first moversnwho created the market,with the improvers who introducednsomething different and better.,What you see is that the first moversnhad a failure rate of 47 percent,,compared with only 8 percentnfor the improvers.,Look at Facebook,nwaiting to build a social network,until after Myspace and Friendster.,Look at Google, waiting for yearsnafter Altavista and Yahoo.,It's much easier to improvenon somebody else's idea,than it is to creatensomething new from scratch.,So the lesson I learned is thatnto be original you don't have to be first.,You just have to be different and better. 
 But that wasn't the only reasonnI passed on Warby Parker.,They were also full of doubts.,They had backup plans lined up,,and that made me doubtnthat they had the courage to be original,,because I expected that originalsnwould look something like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, on the surface,,a lot of original people look confident,,but behind the scenes,,they feel the same fear and doubtnthat the rest of us do.,They just manage it differently.,Let me show you: this is a depiction,of how the creative processnworks for most of us. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, in my research, I discoverednthere are two different kinds of doubt.,There's self-doubt and idea doubt.,Self-doubt is paralyzing.,It leads you to freeze.,But idea doubt is energizing.,It motivates you to test,nto experiment, to refine,,just like MLK did.,And so the key to being original,is just a simple thing,of avoiding the leapnfrom step three to step four.,Instead of saying, "I'm crap,",you say, "The first few draftsnare always crap,,and I'm just not there yet.",So how do you get there?,Well, there's a clue, it turns out,,in the Internet browser that you use.,We can predict your job performancenand your commitment,just by knowing what web browser you use.,Now, some of you are notngoing to like the results of this study -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But there is good evidencenthat Firefox and Chrome users,significantly outperformnInternet Explorer and Safari users.,Yes. 
 (Applause) 
 They also stay in their jobsn15 percent longer, by the way.,Why? It's not a technical advantage.,The four browser groupsnon average have similar typing speed,and they also have similar levelsnof computer knowledge.,It's about how you got the browser.,Because if you usenInternet Explorer or Safari,,those came preinstalled on your computer,,and you accepted the default optionnthat was handed to you.,If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,nyou had to doubt the default,and ask, is therena different option out there,,and then be a little resourcefulnand download a new browser.,So people hear about this studynand they're like,,"Great, if I want to get better at my job,nI just need to upgrade my browser?" 
 (Laughter) 
 No, it's about being the kind of person,who takes the initiativento doubt the default,and look for a better option.,And if you do that well,,you will open yourself upnto the opposite of déjà vu.,There's a name for it.nIt's called vuja de. 
 (Laughter) 
 Vuja de is when you look at somethingnyou've seen many times before,and all of a suddennsee it with fresh eyes.,It's a screenwriternwho looks at a movie script,that can't get the green lightnfor more than half a century.,In every past version,nthe main character has been an evil queen.,But Jennifer Lee starts to questionnwhether that makes sense.,She rewrites the first act,,reinvents the villain as a tortured hero,and Frozen becomesnthe most successful animated movie ever.,So there's a simple messagenfrom this story.,When you feel doubt, don't let it go. 
 (Laughter) 
 What about fear?,Originals feel fear, too.,They're afraid of failing,,but what sets them apartnfrom the rest of us,is that they're even morenafraid of failing to try.,They know you can failnby starting a business that goes bankrupt,or by failing to start a business at all.,They know that in the long run,nour biggest regrets are not our actions,but our inactions.,The things we wish we could redo,nif you look at the science,,are the chances not taken. 
 Elon Musk told me recently,nhe didn't expect Tesla to succeed.,He was sure the first few SpaceX launches,would fail to make it to orbit,nlet alone get back,,but it was too important not to try.,And for so many of us,nwhen we have an important idea,,we don't bother to try.,But I have some good news for you.,You are not going to get judgednon your bad ideas.,A lot of people think they will.,If you look across industries,and ask people about their biggest idea,ntheir most important suggestion,,85 percent of them stayed silentninstead of speaking up.,They were afraid of embarrassingnthemselves, of looking stupid.,But guess what? Originalsnhave lots and lots of bad ideas,,tons of them, in fact.,Take the guy who invented this.,Do you care that he came upnwith a talking doll so creepy,that it scared not only kidsnbut adults, too?,No. You celebrate Thomas Edisonnfor pioneering the light bulb. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you look across fields,,the greatest originalsnare the ones who fail the most,,because they're the ones who try the most.,Take classical composers,nthe best of the best.,Why do some of them get more pagesnin encyclopedias than others,and also have their compositionsnrerecorded more times?,One of the best predictors,is the sheer volumenof compositions that they generate.,The more output you churn out,nthe more variety you get,and the better your chancesnof stumbling on something truly original.,Even the three icons of classical music --nBach, Beethoven, Mozart --,had to generate hundredsnand hundreds of compositions,to come up with a much smallernnumber of masterpieces.,Now, you may be wondering,,how did this guy become greatnwithout doing a whole lot?,I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.,But for most of us,nif we want to be more original,,we have to generate more ideas. 
 The Warby Parker founders, when theynwere trying to name their company,,they needed something sophisticated,nunique, with no negative associations,to build a retail brand,,and they tested over 2,000 possibilities,before they finally put together,Warby and Parker.,So if you put all this together,nwhat you see is that originals,are not that differentnfrom the rest of us.,They feel fear and doubt.nThey procrastinate.,They have bad ideas.,And sometimes, it's not in spitenof those qualities but because of them,that they succeed. 
 So when you see those things,ndon't make the same mistake I did.,Don't write them off.,And when that's you,ndon't count yourself out either.,Know that being quick to startnbut slow to finish,can boost your creativity,,that you can motivate yourselfnby doubting your ideas,and embracing the fear of failing to try,,and that you need a lot of bad ideasnin order to get a few good ones. 
 Look, being original is not easy,,but I have no doubt about this:,it's the best waynto improve the world around us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There's this fact that I loventhat I read somewhere once,,that one of the things that's contributednto homo sapiens' success,as a species,is our lack of body hair --,that our hairlessness, our nakedness,combined with our invention of clothing,,gives us the ability to modulatenour body temperature,and thus be able to survivenin any climate we choose.,And now we've evolved to the pointnwhere we can't survive without clothing.,And it's more than just utility,,now it's a communication.,Everything that we choosento put on is a narrative,,a story about where we've been,,what we're doing,,who we want to be. 
 I was a lonely kid.,I didn't have an easy timenfinding friends to play with,,and I ended up makingna lot of my own play.,I made a lot of my own toys.,It began with ice cream.,There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,,and they served ice creamnfrom behind the counter,in these giant, five-gallon,ncardboard tubs.,And someone told me --nI was eight years old --,someone told me that whennthey were done with those tubs,,they washed them outnand kept them in the back,,and if you asked they would give you one.,It took me a couple of weeksnto work up the courage,,but I did, and they did.,They gave me one -- I went homenwith this beautiful cardboard tub.,I was trying to figure out whatnI could do with this exotic material --,metal ring, top and bottom.,I started turning it over in my head,nand I realized, "Wait a minute --,my head actually fits inside this thing." 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, I cut a hole out,,I put some acetate in there,and I made myself a space helmet. 
 (Laughter) 
 I needed a place to wear the space helmet,,so I found a refrigerator boxna couple blocks from home.,I pushed it home,,and in my parents' guest room closet,,I turned it into a spaceship.,I started with a control panelnout of cardboard.,I cut a hole for a radar screen,and put a flashlightnunderneath it to light it.,I put a view screen up,nwhich I offset off the back wall --,and this is where I thoughtnI was being really clever --,without permission, I paintednthe back wall of the closet black,and put a star field,,which I lit up with some Christmas lightsnI found in the attic,,and I went on some space missions. 
 A couple years later,,the movie "Jaws" came out.,I was way too young to see it,nbut I was caught up in "Jaws" fever,,like everyone else in America at the time.,There was a store in my townnthat had a "Jaws" costume in their window,,and my mom must have overheardnme talking to someone,about how awesomenI thought this costume was,,because a couple days before Halloween,,she blew my freaking mindnby giving me this "Jaws" costume. 
 Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope,for people of a certain age to complain,that kids these days have no ideanhow good they have it,,but let me just show you a random sampling,of entry-level kids' costumesnyou can buy online right now ...,... and this is the "Jaws" costumenmy mom bought for me. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a paper-thin shark face,and a vinyl bib with the posternof "Jaws" on it. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I loved it. 
 A couple years later,,my dad took me to a filmncalled "Excalibur.",I actually got him to take me to it twice,,which is no small thing,nbecause it is a hard, R-rated film.,But it wasn't the bloodnand guts or the boobs,that made me want to go see it again.,They helped -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It was the armor.,The armor in "Excalibur"nwas intoxicatingly beautiful to me.,These were literally knightsnin shining, mirror-polished armor.,And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur"nwear their armor everywhere.,All the time -- they wear it at dinner,nthey wear it to bed. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was like, "Are they reading my mind?,I want to wear armor all the time!" 
 (Laughter) 
 So I went back to my favorite material,,the gateway drug for making,,corrugated cardboard,,and I made myself a suit of armor,,replete with the neck shieldsnand a white horse.,Now that I've oversold it,,here's a picture of the armor that I made. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, this is only the firstnsuit of armor I made,inspired by "Excalibur.",A couple of years later,,I convinced my dad to embarknon making me a proper suit of armor.,Over about a month,,he graduated me from cardboardnto roofing aluminum called flashing,and still, one of my all-time favoritenattachment materials,,POP rivets.,We carefully, over that month,,constructed an articulated suitnof aluminum armor,with compound curves.,We drilled holes in the helmetnso that I could breathe,,and I finished just in timenfor Halloween and wore it to school.,Now, this is the one thing in this talk,that I don't have a slide to show you,,because no photo exists of this armor.,I did wear it to school,,there was a yearbook photographernpatrolling the halls,,but he never found me, for reasonsnthat are about to become clear. 
 There were things I didn't anticipate,about wearing a complete suitnof aluminum armor to school.,In third period math,nI was standing in the back of class,,and I'm standing in the back of class,because the armor did notnallow me to sit down. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is the first thingnI didn't anticipate.,And then my teacher looks at mensort of concerned,about halfway through the classnand says, "Are you feeling OK?",I'm thinking, "Are you kidding?nAm I feeling OK?,I'm wearing a suit of armor!nI am having the time of my --",And I'm just about to tell hernhow great I feel,,when the classroomnstarts to list to the left,and disappear down this long tunnel,,and then I woke up in the nurse's office.,I had passed out from heat exhaustion,,wearing the armor.,And when I woke up,,I wasn't embarrassed about havingnpassed out in front of my class,,I was wondering, "Who took my armor?nWhere's my armor?" 
 OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,,some colleagues and I get hirednto make a show for Discovery Channel,,called "MythBusters.",And over 14 years,,I learn on the job how to buildnexperimental methodologies,and how to tell storiesnabout them for television.,I also learn early on,that costuming can play a key rolenin this storytelling. 
 I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color,and narrative claritynto the stories we're telling.,And then we do an episodencalled "Dumpster Diving,",and I learn a little bit more,about the deeper implicationsnof what costuming means to me.,In the episode "Dumpster Diving,",the question we were trying to answer is:,Is jumping into a dumpster as safe,as the movies would lead you to believe? 
 (Laughter) 
 The episode was going to haventwo distinct parts to it.,One was where we get trainednto jump off buildings by a stuntman,into an air bag.,And the second was the graduationnto the experiment:,we'd fill a dumpster full of materialnand we'd jump into it.,I wanted to visually separatenthese two elements,,and I thought,,"Well, for the first part we're training,nso we should wear sweatsuits --,Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee'non the back of the sweatsuits.,That's for the training.",But for the second part, I wantednsomething really visually striking --,"I know! I'll dress as Neonfrom 'The Matrix.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 So I went to Haight Street.,I bought some beautifulnknee-high, buckle boots.,I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.,I got sunglasses, which I had to wearncontact lenses in order to wear.,The day of the experiment shoot comes up,,and I step out of my car in this costume,,and my crew takes a look at me ...,and start suppressingntheir church giggles.,They're like,n"(Laugh sound).",And I feel two distinct thingsnat this moment.,I feel total embarrassment,over the fact thatnit's so nakedly clear to my crew,that I'm completelyninto wearing this costume. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the producer in my mind reminds myself,that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,,that flowing coat is going to looknbeautiful behind me. 
 (Laughter) 
 Five years into the "MythBusters" run,,we got invited to appearnat San Diego Comic-Con.,I'd known about Comic-Con for yearsnand never had time to go.,This was the big leagues --nthis was costuming mecca.,People fly in from all over the world,to show their amazing creationsnon the floor in San Diego.,And I wanted to participate.,I decided that I would put togethernan elaborate costume,that covered me completely,,and I would walk the floornof San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.,The costume I chose?,Hellboy.,That's not my costume,,that's actually Hellboy. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I spent months,assembling the most screen-accuratenHellboy costume I could,,from the boots to the belt to the pants,to the right hand of doom.,I found a guy who madena prosthetic Hellboy head and chest,and I put them on.,I even had contact lenses madenin my prescription.,I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con,and I can't even tell younhow balls hot it was in that costume. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sweating! I should've remembered this.,I'm sweating bucketsnand the contact lenses hurt my eyes,,and none of it mattersnbecause I'm totally in love. 
 (Laughter) 
 Not just with the process of puttingnon this costume and walking the floor,,but also with the communitynof other costumers.,It's not called costuming at Cons,,it's called "cosplay.",Now ostensibly, cosplay meansnpeople who dress up,as their favorite charactersnfrom film and television,and especially anime,,but it is so much more than that.,These aren't just peoplenwho find a costume and put it on --,they mash them up.,They bend them to their will.,They change them to be the charactersnthey want to be in those productions.,They're super clever and genius.,They let their freak flag flynand it's beautiful. 
 (Laughter) 
 But more than that,,they rehearse their costumes.,At Comic-Con or any other Con,,you don't just take picturesnof people walking around.,You go up and say,,"Hey, I like your costume,ncan I take your picture?",And then you give them timento get into their pose.,They've worked hard on their pose,to make their costume lookngreat for your camera.,And it's so beautiful to watch.,And I take this to heart.,At subsequent Cons,,I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walknas the Joker from "The Dark Knight.",I learn how to be a scary Ringwraithnfrom "Lord of the Rings,",and I actually frighten some children.,I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --,that head laugh that Chewbacca does. 
 And then I dressed up asnNo-Face from "Spirited Away.",If you don't know about "Spirited Away"nand its director, Hayao Miyazaki,,first of all, you're welcome. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a masterpiece,nand one of my all-time favorite films.,It's about a young girl named Chihironwho gets lost in the spirit world,in an abandoned Japanese theme park.,And she finds her way back out again,with the help of a couplenof friends she makes --,a captured dragon named Haku,and a lonely demon named No-Face.,No-Face is lonelynand he wants to make friends,,and he thinks the way to do itnis by luring them to him,and producing gold in his hand.,But this doesn't go very well,,and so he ends up goingnon kind of a rampage,until Chihiro saves him,,rescues him. 
 So I put together a No-Face costume,,and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.,And I very carefully practicednNo-Face's gestures.,I resolved I would not speaknin this costume at all.,When people asked to take my picture,,I would nod,and I would shyly stand next to them.,They would take the picture,and then I would secret outnfrom behind my robe,a chocolate gold coin.,And at the end of the photo process,nI'd make it appear for them.,Ah, ah ah! -- like that. 
 And people were freaking out.,"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face!nOh my god, this is so cool!",And I'm feeling and I'm walkingnthe floor and it's fantastic.,And about 15 minutes in something happens.,Somebody grabs my hand,,and they put a coin back into it.,And I think maybe they're giving mena coin as a return gift,,but no, this is one of the coinsnthat I'd given away.,I don't know why.,And I keep on going,nI take some more pictures.,And then it happens again.,Understand, I can't see anythingninside this costume.,I can see through the mouth --,I can see people's shoes.,I can hear what they're sayingnand I can see their feet.,But the third time someonengives me back a coin,,I want to know what's going on.,So I sort of tilt my head backnto get a better view,,and what I see is someone walkingnaway from me going like this.,And then it hits me:,it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.,In the film "Spirited Away,",bad luck befalls thosenwho take gold from No-Face. 
 This isn't a performer-audiencenrelationship; this is cosplay.,We are, all of us on that floor,,injecting ourselves into a narrativenthat meant something to us.,And we're making it our own.,We're connecting with somethingnimportant inside of us.,And the costumesnare how we reveal ourselves,to each other. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What an intriguingngroup of individuals you are ...,to a psychologist. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've had the opportunitynover the last couple of days,of listening in on somenof your conversations,and watching you interact with each other.,And I think it's fair to say, already,,that there are 47 people in this audience,,at this moment,,displaying psychological symptomsnI would like to discuss today. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I thought you mightnlike to know who you are. 
 (Laughter) 
 But instead of pointing at you,,which would be gratuitous and intrusive,,I thought I would tell youna few facts and stories,,in which you may catchna glimpse of yourself. 
 I'm in the field of researchnknown as personality psychology,,which is part of a largernpersonality science,which spans the full spectrum,nfrom neurons to narratives.,And what we try to do,,in our own way,,is to make sense of how each of us --,each of you --,is, in certain respects,,like all other people,,like some other people,and like no other person. 
 Now, already you maynbe saying of yourself,,"I'm not intriguing.,I am the 46th most boring personnin the Western Hemisphere.",Or you may say of yourself,,"I am intriguing,,even if I am regarded by most peoplenas a great, thundering twit." 
 (Laughter) 
 But it is your self-diagnosed boringnessnand your inherent "twitiness",that makes me, as a psychologist,nreally fascinated by you.,So let me explain why this is so. 
 One of the most influential approachesnin personality science,is known as trait psychology,,and it aligns you along five dimensionsnwhich are normally distributed,,and that describe universally held aspectsnof difference between people.,They spell out the acronym OCEAN.,So, "O" stands for "open to experience,",versus those who are more closed.,"C" stands for "conscientiousness,",in contrast to those with a morenlackadaisical approach to life.,"E" -- "extroversion," in contrastnto more introverted people.,"A" -- "agreeable individuals,",in contrast to thosendecidedly not agreeable.,And "N" -- "neurotic individuals,",in contrast to those who are more stable. 
 All of these dimensions havenimplications for our well-being,,for how our life goes.,And so we know that, for example,,openness and conscientiousnessnare very good predictors of life success,,but the open people achieve that successnthrough being audacious,and, occasionally, odd.,The conscientious peoplenachieve it through sticking to deadlines,,to persevering, as well asnhaving some passion.,Extroversion and agreeablenessnare both conducive,to working well with people.,Extroverts, for example,nI find intriguing.,With my classes, I sometimesngive them a basic fact,that might be revealingnwith respect to their personality:,I tell them that it is virtuallynimpossible for adults,to lick the outside of their own elbow. 
 (Laughter) 
 Did you know that?,Already, some of you have triednto lick the outside of your own elbow.,But extroverts amongst you,are probably thosenwho have not only tried,,but they have successfullynlicked the elbow,of the person sitting next to them. 
 (Laughter) 
 Those are the extroverts. 
 Let me deal in a bit more detailnwith extroversion,,because it's consequentialnand it's intriguing,,and it helps us understandnwhat I call our three natures.,First, our biogenic nature --nour neurophysiology.,Second, our sociogenic or second nature,,which has to do with the culturalnand social aspects of our lives.,And third, what makes younindividually you -- idiosyncratic --,what I call your "idiogenic" nature. 
 Let me explain.,One of the things that characterizesnextroverts is they need stimulation.,And that stimulation can be achievednby finding things that are exciting:,loud noises, partiesnand social events here at TED --,you see the extrovertsnforming a magnetic core.,They all gather together.,And I've seen you.,The introverts are more likelynto spend time in the quiet spaces,up on the second floor,,where they are ablento reduce stimulation --,and may be misconstruednas being antisocial,,but you're not necessarily antisocial.,It may be that you simply realizenthat you do better,when you have a chancento lower that level of stimulation. 
 Sometimes it's an internalnstimulant, from your body.,Caffeine, for example, works much betternwith extroverts than it does introverts.,When extroverts come into the officenat nine o'clock in the morning,and say, "I really need a cup of coffee,",they're not kidding --,they really do.,Introverts do not do as well,,particularly if the tasksnthey're engaged in --,and they've had some coffee --,if those tasks are speeded,,and if they're quantitative,,introverts may give the appearancenof not being particularly quantitative.,But it's a misconstrual. 
 So here are the consequencesnthat are really quite intriguing:,we're not always what seem to be,,and that takes me to my next point.,I should say, before getting to this,,something about sexual intercourse,,although I may not have time.,And so, if you would like me to --,yes, you would?,OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are studies done,on the frequency with whichnindividuals engage in the conjugal act,,as broken down by male, female;nintrovert, extrovert.,So I ask you:,How many times per minute --,oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- 
 (Laughter) 
 How many times per month,do introverted men engage in the act?,3.0.,Extroverted men?,More or less?,Yes, more.,5.5 -- almost twice as much.,Introverted women: 3.1.,Extroverted women?,Frankly, speaking as an introverted male,,which I will explain later --,they are heroic.,7.5.,They not only handlenall the male extroverts,,they pick up a few introverts as well. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We communicate differently,nextroverts and introverts.,Extroverts, when they interact,,want to have lots of social encounternpunctuated by closeness.,They'd like to stand closenfor comfortable communication.,They like to have a lot of eye contact,,or mutual gaze.,We found in some research,that they use more diminutive termsnwhen they meet somebody.,So when an extrovert meets a Charles,,it rapidly becomes "Charlie,"nand then "Chuck,",and then "Chuckles Baby." 
 (Laughter) 
 Whereas for introverts,,it remains "Charles," until he's givenna pass to be more intimate,by the person he's talking to.,We speak differently.,Extroverts prefer black-and-white,nconcrete, simple language.,Introverts prefer --nand I must again tell you,that I am as extreme an introvertnas you could possibly imagine --,we speak differently.,We prefer contextually complex,,contingent,,weasel-word sentences -- 
 (Laughter) 
 More or less. 
 (Laughter) 
 As it were. 
 (Laughter) 
 Not to put too fine a point upon it --,like that. 
 When we talk,,we sometimes talk past each other.,I had a consulting contractnI shared with a colleague,who's as different from menas two people can possibly be.,First, his name is Tom.,Mine isn't. 
 (Laughter) 
 Secondly, he's six foot five.,I have a tendency not to be. 
 (Laughter) 
 And thirdly, he's as extrovertedna person as you could find.,I am seriously introverted.,I overload so much,,I can't even have a cup of coffeenafter three in the afternoon,and expect to sleep in the evening. 
 We had seconded to this projectna fellow called Michael.,And Michael almost broughtnthe project to a crashing halt.,So the person who seconded himnasked Tom and me,,"What do you make of Michael?",Well, I'll tell younwhat Tom said in a minute.,He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese.",And here is how extroverted earsnheard what I said,,which is actually pretty accurate.,I said, "Well Michael does havena tendency at times,of behaving in a waynthat some of us might see,as perhaps more assertiventhan is normally called for." 
 (Laughter) 
 Tom rolled his eyes and he said,,"Brian, that's what I said:,he's an asshole!" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, as an introvert,,I might gently allude to certainn"assholic" qualities,in this man's behavior,,but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the extrovert says,,"If he walks like one, if he talksnlike one, I call him one.",And we go past each other. 
 Now is this somethingnthat we should be heedful of?,Of course.,It's important that we know this.,Is that all we are?,Are we just a bunch of traits?,No, we're not.,Remember, you're like some other people,and like no other person.,How about that idiosyncratic you?,As Elizabeth or as George,,you may share your extroversionnor your neuroticism.,But are there some distinctivelynElizabethan features of your behavior,,or Georgian of yours,,that make us understand younbetter than just a bunch of traits?,That make us love you?,Not just because you'rena certain type of person. 
 I'm uncomfortable puttingnpeople in pigeonholes.,I don't even think pigeonsnbelong in pigeonholes.,So what is it that makes us different?,It's the doings that we havenin our life -- the personal projects.,You have a personal project right now,,but nobody may know it here.,It relates to your kid --,you've been back three timesnto the hospital,,and they still don't know what's wrong.,Or it could be your mom.,And you'd been acting out of character.,These are free traits.,You're very agreeable,nbut you act disagreeably,in order to break down those barriersnof administrative torpor,in the hospital,,to get somethingnfor your mom or your child. 
 What are these free traits?,They're where we enact a script,in order to advancena core project in our lives.,And they are what matters.,Don't ask people what type you are;,ask them, "What are your corenprojects in your life?",And we enact those free traits.,I'm an introvert,,but I have a core project,nwhich is to profess.,I'm a professor.,And I adore my students,,and I adore my field.,And I can't wait to tell themnabout what's new, what's exciting,,what I can't wait to tell them about.,And so I act in an extroverted way,,because at eight in the morning,,the students need a little bit of humor,,a little bit of engagementnto keep them going,in arduous days of study. 
 But we need to be very careful,when we act protractedly out of character.,Sometimes we may findnthat we don't take care of ourselves.,I find, for example, after a periodnof pseudo-extroverted behavior,,I need to repair somewhere on my own.,As Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book,,in a chapter that featurednthe strange Canadian professor,who was teaching at the time at Harvard,,I sometimes go to the men's room,to escape the slings and arrowsnof outrageous extroverts. 
 (Laughter) 
 I remember one particular daynwhen I was retired to a cubicle,,trying to avoid overstimulation.,And a real extrovert camenin beside me -- not right in my cubicle,,but in the next cubicle over --,and I could hear variousnevacuatory noises,,which we hate -- even our own,,that's why we flushnduring as well as after. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I heardnthis gravelly voice saying,,"Hey, is that Dr. Little?" 
 (Laughter) 
 If anything is guaranteednto constipate an introvert for six months,,it's talking on the john. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's where I'm going now.,Don't follow me. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What is it that French peoplendo better than all the others?,If you would take polls,,the top three answers might be:,love, wine and whining. 
 (Laughter) 
 Maybe.,But let me suggest a fourth one:,mathematics.,Did you know that Parisnhas more mathematicians,than any other city in the world?,And more streetsnwith mathematicians' names, too.,And if you look at the statisticsnof the Fields Medal,,often called the Nobel Prizenfor mathematics,,and always awarded to mathematiciansnbelow the age of 40,,you will find that France has morenFields medalists per inhabitant,than any other country. 
 What is it that we find so sexy in math?,After all, it seems to bendull and abstract,,just numbers and computationsnand rules to apply.,Mathematics may be abstract,,but it's not dull,and it's not about computing.,It is about reasoning,and proving our core activity.,It is about imagination,,the talent which we most praise.,It is about finding the truth.,There's nothing like the feelingnwhich invades you,when after months of hard thinking,,you finally understand the rightnreasoning to solve your problem.,The great mathematiciannAndré Weil likened this --,no kidding --,to sexual pleasure.,But noted that this feelingncan last for hours, or even days. 
 The reward may be big.,Hidden mathematical truthsnpermeate our whole physical world.,They are inaccessible to our senses,but can be seennthrough mathematical lenses.,Close your eyes for moment,and think of what is occurringnright now around you.,Invisible particles from the airnaround are bumping on you,by the billions and billionsnat each second,,all in complete chaos.,And still,,their statistics can be accuratelynpredicted by mathematical physics.,And open your eyes now,to the statistics of the velocitiesnof these particles. 
 The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,,or the Law of Errors --,of deviations with respectnto the mean behavior.,This curve tells about the statisticsnof velocities of particles,in the same way as a demographic curve,would tell about the statisticsnof ages of individuals.,It's one of the mostnimportant curves ever.,It keeps on occurring again and again,,from many theories and many experiments,,as a great example of the universality,which is so dear to us mathematicians. 
 Of this curve,,the famous scientist Francis Galton said,,"It would have been deified by the Greeksnif they had known it.,It is the supreme law of unreason.",And there's no better way to materializenthat supreme goddess than Galton's Board.,Inside this board are narrow tunnels,through which tiny ballsnwill fall down randomly,,going right or left, or left, etc.,All in complete randomness and chaos.,Let's see what happens when we looknat all these random trajectories together. 
 (Board shaking) 
 This is a bit of a sport,,because we need to resolvensome traffic jams in there.,Aha.,We think that randomnessnis going to play me a trick on stage. 
 There it is.,Our supreme goddess of unreason.,the Gauss Curve,,trapped here inside this transparent boxnas Dream in "The Sandman" comics.,For you I have shown it,,but to my students I explain whynit could not be any other curve.,And this is touchingnthe mystery of that goddess,,replacing a beautiful coincidencenby a beautiful explanation. 
 All of science is like this.,And beautiful mathematical explanationsnare not only for our pleasure.,They also change our vision of the world.,For instance,,Einstein,,Perrin,,Smoluchowski,,they used the mathematical analysisnof random trajectories,and the Gauss Curve,to explain and prove that ournworld is made of atoms. 
 It was not the first time,that mathematics was revolutionizingnour view of the world.,More than 2,000 years ago,,at the time of the ancient Greeks,,it already occurred.,In those days,,only a small fraction of the worldnhad been explored,,and the Earth might have seemed infinite.,But clever Eratosthenes,,using mathematics,,was able to measure the Earthnwith an amazing accuracy of two percent. 
 Here's another example.,In 1673, Jean Richer noticed,that a pendulum swings slightlynslower in Cayenne than in Paris.,From this observation alone,nand clever mathematics,,Newton rightly deduced,that the Earth is a wee bitnflattened at the poles,,like 0.3 percent --,so tiny that you wouldn't evennnotice it on the real view of the Earth. 
 These stories show that mathematics,is able to make us go out of our intuition,measure the Earth which seems infinite,,see atoms which are invisible,or detect an imperceptiblenvariation of shape.,And if there is just one thing that younshould take home from this talk,,it is this:,mathematics allows usnto go beyond the intuition,and explore territoriesnwhich do not fit within our grasp. 
 Here's a modern examplenyou will all relate to:,searching the Internet.,The World Wide Web,,more than one billion web pages --,do you want to go through them all?,Computing power helps,,but it would be useless withoutnthe mathematical modeling,to find the informationnhidden in the data. 
 Let's work out a baby problem.,Imagine that you're a detectivenworking on a crime case,,and there are many peoplenwho have their version of the facts.,Who do you want to interview first?,Sensible answer:,prime witnesses.,You see,,suppose that there is person number seven,,tells you a story,,but when you ask where he got if from,,he points to personnnumber three as a source.,And maybe person number three, in turn,,points at person number onenas the primary source.,Now number one is a prime witness,,so I definitely wantnto interview him -- priority.,And from the graph,we also see that personnnumber four is a prime witness.,And maybe I even wantnto interview him first,,because there are morenpeople who refer to him. 
 OK, that was easy,,but now what about if you havena big bunch of people who will testify?,And this graph,,I may think of it as all peoplenwho testify in a complicated crime case,,but it may just as well be web pagesnpointing to each other,,referring to each other for contents.,Which ones are the most authoritative?,Not so clear. 
 Enter PageRank,,one of the early cornerstones of Google.,This algorithm uses the lawsnof mathematical randomness,to determine automaticallynthe most relevant web pages,,in the same way as we used randomnessnin the Galton Board experiment.,So let's send into this graph,a bunch of tiny, digital marbles,and let them go randomlynthrough the graph.,Each time they arrive at some site,,they will go out through some linknchosen at random to the next one.,And again, and again, and again.,And with small, growing piles,,we'll keep the record of how manyntimes each site has been visited,by these digital marbles. 
 Here we go.,Randomness, randomness.,And from time to time,,also let's make jumps completelynrandomly to increase the fun. 
 And look at this:,from the chaos will emerge the solution.,The highest pilesncorrespond to those sites,which somehow are betternconnected than the others,,more pointed at than the others.,And here we see clearly,which are the web pagesnwe want to first try.,Once again,,the solution emerges from the randomness.,Of course, since that time,,Google has come up with much morensophisticated algorithms,,but already this was beautiful. 
 And still,,just one problem in a million.,With the advent of digital area,,more and more problems lendnthemselves to mathematical analysis,,making the job of mathematicianna more and more useful one,,to the extent that a few years ago,,it was ranked number onenamong hundreds of jobs,in a study about the best and worst jobs,published by the Wall StreetnJournal in 2009. 
 Mathematician --,best job in the world.,That's because of the applications:,communication theory,,information theory,,game theory,,compressed sensing,,machine learning,,graph analysis,,harmonic analysis.,And why not stochastic processes,,linear programming,,or fluid simulation?,Each of these fields havenmonster industrial applications.,And through them,,there is big money in mathematics.,And let me concede,that when it comes to makingnmoney from the math,,the Americans are by a long shotnthe world champions,,with clever, emblematic billionairesnand amazing, giant companies,,all resting, ultimately,non good algorithm. 
 Now with all this beauty,nusefulness and wealth,,mathematics does look more sexy.,But don't you think,that the life a mathematicalnresearcher is an easy one.,It is filled with perplexity,,frustration,,a desperate fight for understanding. 
 Let me evoke for you,one of the most striking daysnin my mathematician's life.,Or should I say,,one of the most striking nights.,At that time,,I was staying at the Institutenfor Advanced Studies in Princeton --,for many years, the homenof Albert Einstein,and arguably the most holy placenfor mathematical research in the world.,And that night I was workingnand working on an elusive proof,,which was incomplete.,It was all about understanding,the paradoxical stabilitynproperty of plasmas,,which are a crowd of electrons.,In the perfect world of plasma,,there are no collisions,and no friction to providenthe stability like we are used to.,But still,,if you slightly perturbna plasma equilibrium,,you will find that thenresulting electric field,spontaneously vanishes,,or damps out,,as if by some mysterious friction force. 
 This paradoxical effect,,called the Landau damping,,is one of the most importantnin plasma physics,,and it was discoverednthrough mathematical ideas.,But still,,a full mathematical understandingnof this phenomenon was missing.,And together with my former studentnand main collaborator Clément Mouhot,,in Paris at the time,,we had been working for monthsnand months on such a proof.,Actually,,I had already announced by mistakenthat we could solve it.,But the truth is,,the proof was just not working.,In spite of more than 100 pagesnof complicated, mathematical arguments,,and a bunch discoveries,,and huge calculation,,it was not working.,And that night in Princeton,,a certain gap in the chain of argumentsnwas driving me crazy.,I was putting in there all my energynand experience and tricks,,and still nothing was working.,1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,,not working.,Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.,Then a few hours later,,waking up and go,,"Ah, it's time to getnthe kids to school --",What is this?,There was this voice in my head, I swear.,"Take the second term to the other side,,Fourier transform and invert in L2." 
 (Laughter) 
 Damn it,,that was the start of the solution! 
 You see,,I thought I had taken some rest,,but really my brain hadncontinued to work on it.,In those moments,,you don't think of your careernor your colleagues,,it's just a complete battlenbetween the problem and you. 
 That being said,,it does not harm when you do getna promotion in reward for your hard work.,And after we completed our hugenanalysis of the Landau damping,,I was lucky enough,to get the most coveted Fields Medal,from the hands of the President of India,,in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 --,an honor that mathematiciansnnever dare to dream,,a day that I will remember until I live. 
 What do you think,,on such an occasion?,Pride, yes?,And gratitude to the many collaboratorsnwho made this possible.,And because it was a collective adventure,,you need to share it,nnot just with your collaborators.,I believe that everybody can appreciatenthe thrill of mathematical research,,and share the passionate storiesnof humans and ideas behind it.,And I've been working with my staffnat Institut Henri Poincaré,,together with partners and artistsnof mathematical communication worldwide,,so that we can found our own,nvery special museum of mathematics there. 
 So in a few years,,when you come to Paris,,after tasting the great, crispynbaguette and macaroon,,please come and visit usnat Institut Henri Poincaré,,and share the mathematical dream with us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The most complex problems in our time,can be solved with simple techniques,,if we are able to dream. 
 As a child, I discoverednthat creativity is the key,to cross from dreams to reality.,I learned this from my grandmother,,Dr. Ruth Tichauer,,a Jewish refugee that settlednin the heart of the Andes.,That is how I grew up:,encouraged to see beyond any limitation.,So part of my educationnincluded helping her,in remote, indigenous communities.,I cherish those memories,,because they helped mento understand life outside the city,,a life with a lot of possibilities,,without barriers, as language or culture. 
 During those trips, my grandmothernused to recite a Kipling poem:,"Something hidden. Go and find it.,Go and look behind the Mountains.,Something lost behind the mountains.,Lost and waiting for you. Go!" 
 In the coming years,nI became a medical student.,One of every hundrednchildren born worldwide,has some kind of heart disease.,There's a part of this problemnI think I can solve --,the part of this problemnI have spent my life working on. 
 The problem starts,during pregnancy.,The fetus needs to surviveninside the mother.,Survival depends on communication,between the systemicnand the pulmonary blood.,At the moment of birth,,this communication needs to stop.,If it doesn't close, the babynhas a hole in the heart.,It is caused by prematuritynand genetic conditions.,But what we know today,is that a lack of oxygennis also one of the causes.,As you can see in the chart,,the frequency of this kind of hole,dramatically increases with altitude. 
 Video: (Baby crying) 
 When you look at patientsnwith this condition,,they seem desperate to breathe.,To close the hole, major surgerynused to be the only solution. 
 One night, my friend Malte,nwere camping in the Amazon region.,The only thing that would not burnnin the fire was a green avocado branch.,Then came a moment of inspiration.,So we used the branch as a moldnfor our first invention.,The holes in children's heartsncan be closed with it.,A coil is a piece of wirenwrapped onto itself.,It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now,,but that was our first successful attempt,to create a device for this major problem.,In this video, we can seenhow a very tiny catheter,takes the coil to the heart.,The coil then closes the hole.,After that moment of inspiration,,there came a very long time of effort,developing a prototype.,In vitro and in vivo studies tooknthousands of hours of work in the lab.,The coil, if it works, can save lives. 
 I returned from Germany to Bolivia,,thinking that wherever we go,,we have the opportunitynto make a difference.,With my wife and partner,nDr. Alexandra Heath,,we started to see patients.,After successfully treatingnpatients with our coil,,we felt really enthusiastic.,But we live in a place,that is 12,000 feet high.,And,,the patients there need a special devicento solve their heart condition.,The hole in altitudenpatients is different,,because the orificenbetween the arteries is larger.,Most patients cannot affordnto be treated on time,,and they die.,The first coil could successfully treat,only half of the patients in Bolivia.,The search started again.,We went back to the drawing board. 
 After many trials,,and with the help of my grandmother'snindigenous friends in the mountains,,we obtained a new device.,For centuries, indigenous womenntold stories by weaving complex patterns,on looms,,and an unexpected skillnhelped us for the new device.,We take this traditional method of weaving,and make a design made by a smart material,that records shape.,It seems this time,,the weaving allows usnto create a seamless device,that doesn't rust,because it's made of only one piece.,It can change by itselfninto very complex structures,by a procedure that tookndecades to develop. 
 As you can see, the device enters the body,through the natural channels.,Doctors have only to closenthe catheter through the hole.,Our device expands, places itself,and closes the hole.,We have this beautiful delivery system,that is so simple to use,because it works by itself.,No open surgery was necessary. 
 (Applause) 
 As doctors, we fight with diseases,that take a long timenand effort to heal -- if they do.,This is the child from before,,after the procedure.,As you can see -- 
 (Applause) 
 As you can see,nonce the device is in place,,the patient is 100 percent healed.,From start to finish,,the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.,That's very rewarding from the medicalnand human point of view.,We are so proud that somenof our former patients,are part of our team --,a team, thanks to added close interaction,with patients that work with us.,Together, we have only one idea:,the best solutions need to be simple.,We lost the fearnof creating something new. 
 The path, it's not easy.,Many obstacles arise all the time.,But we receive strength from our patients.,Their resilience and courage,inspire our creativity.,Our goal is to make sure,that no child is left behind,,not because of cost or access. 
 So we have to start a foundation,with a one-to-one model.,We will give one device for free,to make sure that every child is treated.,We are in many countries now,,but we need to be everywhere.,This whole thing began,with one impossible idea,as will continue it, really:,No child is left behind. 
 Muchas gracias. 
 (Applause)I'm here to talk to you today,about a story that we have allnbeen conditioned to believe,is not possible.,It's a story about a living,nbreathing start-up,flourishing in an unlikely environment:,the United States government.,Now, this start-up is fundamentallynbeginning to disrupt,the way government doesnbusiness from the inside out.,But before I get there,nlet's start with the problem. 
 For me, the problem beginsnwith a number: 137.,137 is the average number of days,a veteran has to wait to have benefitsnprocessed by the VA.,137 days.,Now, in order to file that applicationnin the first place,,she has to navigatenover 1,000 different websites,and over 900 different call-in numbers,,all owned and operatednby the United States government. 
 Now, we live in timesnof incredible change.,The private sector is constantly changing,and improving itself all the time.,For that matter, it's removingnevery single inconvenience in my life,that I could possibly think of.,I could be sitting on my couchnin my apartment,,and from my phone, I can orderna warm, gluten-free meal,that can arrive at my doornin less than 10 minutes.,But meanwhile, a working mothernwho depends on food stamps,to support her family,has to complete an arduous,ncomplicated application,which she might not evennbe able to do online.,And the inability of her to do that samenwork from her couch means,that she might be having to takendays or hours off of work,that she can't spare.,And this growing dichotomy,between the beneficiariesnof the tech revolution,and those it's left behind,is one of the greatestnchallenges of our time -- 
 (Applause) 
 Because government's failurento deliver digital services that work,is disproportionately impactingnthe very people who need it most.,It's impacting the studentsntrying to go to college,,the single mothersntrying to get health care,,the veterans coming home from battle.,They can't get what they neednwhen they need it.,And for these Americans,,government is more than justna presidential election every four years.,Government is a lifelinenthat provides services they need,and depend on and deserve.,Which is, quite frankly,,why government needs to getnits shit together and catch up.,Just saying. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, this wasn't always a problemnI was passionate about.,When I joined President Obama'sncampaign in 2008,,we brought the tech industry'snbest practices into politics.,We earned more money,,we engaged more volunteers,and we earned more votesnthan any political campaign in history.,We were a cutting-edge start-upnthat changed the game of politics forever.,So when the President askedna small group of us,to bring that very same disruptionndirectly into government,,I knew it wasn't going to be easy work,,but I was eager and showed upnready to get to work. 
 Now, on my first day in DC,,my first day in government,,I walked into the officenand they handed me a laptop.,And the laptop was running Windows 98. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, three entire presidentialnelections had come and gone,since the government had updatednthe operating system on that computer.,Three elections!,Which is when we realized,this problem was a whole lot biggernthan we ever could have imagined.,Let me paint the picture for you. 
 The federal government is the largestninstitution in the world.,It spends over 86 billion dollarsna year -- 86 billion --,on federal IT projects.,For context:,that is more than the entirenventure capital industry spends,annually -- on everything.,Now, the problem here,is that we the taxpayersnare not getting what we pay for,,because 94 percent of federal IT projects,are over budget or behind schedule.,94 percent!,For those of you keeping score,,yes, the number 94 is very close to 100. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's another problem:,40 percent of those never end upnseeing the light of day.,They are completely scrapped or abandoned.,Now, this is a very existentiallynpainful moment for any organization,,because it means as governmentncontinues to operate,as it's programmed to do,,failure is nearly inevitable.,And when the status quonis the riskiest option,,that means there is simply no other choice,than radical disruption. 
 So, what do we do about it?,How do we fix this?,Well, the irony of all of this,is that we actually don't have to looknany further than our backyard,,because right here in Americanare the very ideas, the very people,,who have swept our worldninto a radically different place,than it was two decades ago.,So what would it look like,if it was actually as easy to getnstudent loans or veterans' benefits,as it is to order cat food to my house?,What would it look like,if there was an easy pathwaynfor the very entrepreneurs and innovators,who have disrupted our tech sector,to come and disrupt their government? 
 Well, my friends,nhere's where we get to talk,about some of the excitingnnew formulas we've discovered,for creating change in government.,Enter the United States Digital Service.,The United States Digital Servicenis a new network of start-ups,,a team of teams,,organizing themselves across governmentnto create radical change.,The mission of the United StatesnDigital Service is to help government,deliver world-class digital services,for students, immigrants,nchildren, the elderly -- everybody --,at dramatically lower costs.,We are essentially trying to buildna more awesome government,,for the people, by the people, today.,We don't care -- (Applause) Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Who doesn't want a morenawesome government, right? 
 We don't care about politics.,We care about makingngovernment work better,,because it's the only one we've got. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, you can think of our team --nwell, it's pretty funny --,you can thinknof our team a little bit like,the Peace Corps meets DARPAnmeets SEAL Team 6.,We're like the Peace Corps for nerds,,but instead of traveling to crazy,ninteresting, far-off places,,you spend a lot of time indoors,nbehind computers,,helping restore the fabricnof our democracy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this team -- our playbooknfor the United States Digital Service,is pretty simple.,The first play is we recruitnthe very best talent,our country has to offer,,and recruit them for short toursnof duty inside government.,These are the very people who have helpednbuild the products and companies,that have made our tech sector amongstnthe most innovative in the world.,Second, we pair these incrediblenpeople from the tech core,with the dedicated civil servantsnalready inside government,on the ground creating change.,Third, we strategically deploy themnin a targeted formation,at the most mission-critical,nlife-changing, important services,that government offers.,And finally, we give themnmassive air cover,,from the leadership inside the agencies,all the way up to the President himself,,to transform these servicesnfor the better. 
 Now, this team is beginning to disrupt,how government does businessnfrom the inside out.,If you study classicnpatterns of disruption,,one very common pattern is rather simple.,It's to take something that has becomenroutine and standard in one industry,and apply it to anothernwhere it's a radical departure,from the status quo.,Think about what Airbnb tooknthat was normal from hospitality,and revolutionized my apartment.,The United States Digital Servicenis doing exactly that.,We are taking what Silicon Valleynand the private sector has learned,through a ton of hard work,about how to buildnplanetary-scale digital services,that delight users at lower cost,,and we're applying that to government,,where it is a radical departurenfrom the status quo. 
 Now, the good news is:,it's starting to work.,We know this because we cannalready see the results,from some of our early projects,nlike the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,,when that went off the rails.,Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first placenthat we ran this play,,and today we are taking that same play,and scaling it across a large number,of government's most importantncitizen-facing services.,Now, if I can take a moment,and brag about the team for a second --,it is the highestnconcentration of badasses,I could have ever dreamed of.,We have top talent from Google,nFacebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,,all on staff today,,all choosing to join their government.,And what's incredible is,,everybody is as eager and kindnas they are intelligent.,And I might add, by the way,nover half of us are women. 
 (Applause) 
 The best way to understand this strategy,is actually to walk throughna couple of examples,of how it's working out in the wild.,I'm going to give yountwo examples quickly. 
 The first one is about immigration.,This, my friends, is your typicalnimmigration application.,Yes, you guessed it --,it's almost entirely paper-based.,In the best case,,the application takes about sixnto eight months to process.,It is physically shipped thousandsnof miles -- thousands of miles! --,between no less than sixnprocessing centers.,Now, little story:,about a decade ago,,the government thoughtnthat if it brought this system online,,it could save taxpayer dollarsnand provide a better service,,which was a great idea.,So, the typical government process began.,Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later,,no working product was delivered --,1.2 billion with a "B.",Now at this point, the agency responsible,,US Citizenship and Immigration Services,,could have kept pouring moneyninto the failing program.,Sadly, that's what often happens.,That's the status quo today.,But they didn't.,The dedicated civil servantsninside the agency,decided to stand up and call for change.,We deployed a small teamnof just six people,,and what many people don't know is,that's the same size as the rescueneffort of Healthcare.gov --,just six people.,And that team jumped in, side-by-side,,to support the agencynin transitioning this project,into more modern business practices,nmore modern development practices.,Now, in non-tech speak,,what that basically meansnis taking big, multi-year projects,and breaking them upninto bite-sized chunks,,so that way we can reduce the risk,and actually start to see resultsnevery couple of weeks,,instead of waitingnin a black box for years. 
 So within less than three monthsnof our team being on the ground,,we were already able to pushnour first products to production.,The first one, this is the form I-90.,This is used to filenfor your replacement green card.,Now, for immigrant visa holders,,a replacement green card is a big deal.,Your green card is your proofnof identification,,it's your work authorization,,it's the proof that you cannbe here in this country.,So waiting six months while the governmentnprocesses the replacement,is not cool.,I'm excited to tell you that today,,you can now, for the first time,nfile for a replacement green card,entirely online without anyonentouching a piece of paper.,It is faster, it is cheaper,,and it's a better user experiencenfor the applicant,and the government employees alike. 
 (Applause) 
 Another one, quickly.,Last fall, we just releasedna brand-new practice civics test.,So as part of becoming a US citizen,,you have to pass a civics test.,For anyone who has taken this test,nit can be quite the stressful process.,So our team released a very easy,nsimple-to-use tool in plain language,to help people prepare,,to help ease their nerves,,to help them feel more confident,in taking the next stepnin pursuing their American dream.,Because all of this work,nall of this work on immigration,,is about taking complicated processesnand making them more human. 
 The other day, one of the dedicatedncivil servants on the ground,said something incredibly profound.,She said that she's never beennthis hopeful or optimistic,about a project in her entirentime in government.,And she's been doing this for 30 years.,That is exactly the kind of hopenand culture change,we are trying to create. 
 For my second example, I want to bringnit back to veterans for a second,,and what we are doing to build them a VA,that is worthy of their servicenand their sacrifice.,I'm proud to saynthat just a few months ago,,we released a brand-new beta,of a new website, Vets.gov.,Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website,that brings all of the online servicesna veteran needs into one place.,One website, not thousands.,The site is a work in progress,nbut it's significant progress,,because it's designednwith the users who matter most:,the veterans themselves.,This might sound incredibly obvious,nbecause it should be,,but sadly, this isn'tnnormal for government.,Far too often, product decisionsnare made by committees of stakeholders,who do their best to representnthe interests of the user,,but they're not necessarilynthe users themselves.,So our team at the VA went out,nwe looked at the data,,we talked to veterans themselves,and we started simple and small,,with the two most important servicesnthat matter most to them:,education benefitsnand disability benefits.,I'm proud to say that they arenlive on the site today,,and as the team continuesnto streamline more services,,they will be ported over here,nand the old sites, shut down. 
 (Applause) 
 To me, this is what changenlooks like in 2016. 
 When you walk out of the Oval Office,,the first time I was evernthere, I noticed a quote,the President had embroidered on the rug.,It's the classic JFK quote.,It says, "No problem of human destinynis beyond human beings.",It's true.,We have the tools to solve these problems.,We have the tools to come togethernas a society, as a country,,and to fix this together.,Yes, it's hard.,It's particularly hardnwhen we have to fight,,when we have to refuse to succumbnto the belief that things won't change.,But in my experience,,it's often the hardest thingsnthat are the most worth doing,,because if we don't do them,,who will?,This is on us,,all of us, together,,because government is notnan abstract institution or a concept.,Our government is us. 
 (Applause) 
 Today, it is no longer a question,of if change is possible.,The question is not, "Can we?",The question is, "Will we?" 
 Will you? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to tell you the story,about the time I almost got kidnapped,in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.,It's the day after graduatingnfrom design school,and I'm having a yard sale.,And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda,and he starts looking through my stuff.,And he buys a piece of art that I made.,And it turns out he's alonenin town for the night,,driving cross-country on a road trip,before he goes into the Peace Corps.,So I invite him out for a beer,and he tells me all about his passion,for making a difference in the world. 
 Now it's starting to get late,,and I'm getting pretty tired.,As I motion for the tab,,I make the mistake of asking him,,"So where are you staying tonight?",And he makes it worse by saying,,"Actually, I don't have a place.",And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!",What do you do?,We've all been there, right?,Do I offer to host this guy?,But, I just met him -- I mean,,he says he's going to the Peace Corps,,but I don't really know if he's goingnto the Peace Corps,and I don't want to end up kidnappednin the trunk of a Miata.,That's a small trunk! 
 So then I hear myself saying,,"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay onnin my living room.",And the voice in my head goes,,"Wait, what?" 
 That night, I'm laying in bed,,I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,,"Oh my god, what have I done?,There's a complete strangernsleeping in my living room.,What if he's psychotic?",My anxiety grows so much,,I leap out of bed,,I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,,and I lock the bedroom door. 
 It turns out he was not psychotic.,We've kept in touch ever since.,And the piece of artnhe bought at the yard sale,is hanging in his classroom;nhe's a teacher now. 
 This was my first hosting experience,,and it completely changed my perspective.,Maybe the people that my childhoodntaught me to label as strangers,were actually friends waitingnto be discovered.,The idea of hosting people on airbedsngradually became natural to me,and when I moved to San Francisco,,I brought the airbed with me. 
 So now it's two years later.,I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,,my roommate moves out,nand then the rent goes up.,And then I learn there's a designnconference coming to town,,and all the hotels are sold out.,And I've always believednthat turning fear into fun,is the gift of creativity. 
 So here's what I pitch my best friendnand my new roommate Brian Chesky:,"Brian, thought of a waynto make a few bucks --,turning our place into 'designersnbed and breakfast,',offering young designers who comento town a place to crash,,complete with wireless Internet,na small desk space,,sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.,Ha!" 
 We built a basic websitenand Airbed and Breakfast was born.,Three lucky guests got to stay,on a 20-dollar airbednon the hardwood floor.,But they loved it, and so did we.,I swear, the hamnand Swiss cheese omelets we made,tasted totally differentnbecause we made them for our guests.,We took them on adventuresnaround the city,,and when we said goodbyento the last guest,,the door latch clicked,,Brian and I just stared at each other.,Did we just discovernit was possible to make friends,while also making rent? 
 The wheels had started to turn.,My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,,joined as engineering co-founder.,And we buckled down to see,if we could turn this into a business. 
 Here's what we pitched investors:,"We want to build a website,where people publicly post picturesnof their most intimate spaces,,their bedrooms, the bathrooms --,the kinds of rooms you usually keep closednwhen people come over.,And then, over the Internet,,they're going to invite complete strangersnto come sleep in their homes.,It's going to be huge!" 
 (Laughter) 
 We sat back, and we waitednfor the rocket ship to blast off.,It did not.,No one in their right mindsnwould invest in a service,that allows strangersnto sleep in people's homes.,Why?,Because we've all been taughtnas kids, strangers equal danger. 
 Now, when you're faced with a problem,nyou fall back on what you know,,and all we really knew was design.,In art school, you learnnthat design is much more,than the look and feel of something --nit's the whole experience.,We learned to do that for objects,,but here, we were aimingnto build Olympic trust,between people who had never met.,Could design make that happen?,Is it possible to design for trust? 
 I want to give you a sensenof the flavor of trust,that we were aiming to achieve.,I've got a 30-second experiment,that will push you past your comfort zone.,If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.,OK, I need you to take out your phones.,Now that you have your phone out,,I'd like you to unlock your phone.,Now hand your unlocked phonento the person on your left. 
 (Laughter) 
 That tiny sense of panicnyou're feeling right now -- 
 (Laughter) 
 is exactly how hosts feel the first timenthey open their home.,Because the only thingnmore personal than your phone,is your home.,People don't just see your messages,,they see your bedroom,,your kitchen, your toilet. 
 Now, how does it feel holdingnsomeone's unlocked phone?,Most of us feel really responsible.,That's how most guests feelnwhen they stay in a home.,And it's because of thisnthat our company can even exist.,By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone? 
 (Laughter) 
 Would you tell Twitternhe's running for President? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 OK, you can hand your phones back now. 
 So now that you've experiencednthe kind of trust challenge,we were facing,,I'd love to share a few discoveriesnwe've made along the way.,What if we changed one small thing,about the design of that experiment?,What if your neighbor had introducednthemselves first, with their name,,where they're from, the namenof their kids or their dog?,Imagine that they had 150 reviewsnof people saying,,"They're great at holdingnunlocked phones!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Now how would you feelnabout handing your phone over? 
 It turns out,,a well-designed reputation systemnis key for building trust.,And we didn't actuallynget it right the first time.,It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.,Eventually, we learned to waitnuntil both guests and hosts,left the review before we reveal them. 
 Now, here's a discoverynwe made just last week.,We did a joint study with Stanford,,where we looked at people'snwillingness to trust someone,based on how similar they are in age,nlocation and geography.,The research showed, not surprisingly,,we prefer people who are like us.,The more different somebody is,,the less we trust them.,Now, that's a natural social bias.,But what's interesting is what happens,when you add reputation into the mix,,in this case, with reviews. 
 Now, if you've gotnless than three reviews,,nothing changes.,But if you've got more than 10,,everything changes.,High reputation beats high similarity.,The right design can actuallynhelp us overcome,one of our most deeply rooted biases. 
 Now we also learned that buildingnthe right amount of trust,takes the right amount of disclosure.,This is what happens when a guestnfirst messages a host.,If you share too little, like, "Yo,",acceptance rates go down.,And if you share too much, like,,"I'm having issues with my mother," 
 (Laughter) 
 acceptance rates also go down.,But there's a zone that's just right,,like, "Love the artwork in your place.nComing for vacation with my family.",So how do we design for justnthe right amount of disclosure?,We use the size of the boxnto suggest the right length,,and we guide them with promptsnto encourage sharing. 
 We bet our whole company,on the hope that,,with the right design,,people would be willing to overcomenthe stranger-danger bias.,What we didn't realize,is just how many people,were ready and waitingnto put the bias aside. 
 This is a graph that showsnour rate of adoption.,There's three things happening here.,The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.,The second is the efforts of our team.,And third is the existencenof a previously unsatisfied need.,Now, things have been going pretty well. 
 Obviously, there are timesnwhen things don't work out.,Guests have thrown unauthorized parties,and trashed homes.,Hosts have left guestsnstranded in the rain.,In the early days, I was customer service,,and those calls camenright to my cell phone.,I was at the front linesnof trust breaking.,And there's nothing worsenthan those calls,,it hurts to even think about them.,And the disappointmentnin the sound of someone's voice,was and, I would say, still is,our single greatest motivatornto keep improving. 
 Thankfully, out of the 123 million nightsnwe've ever hosted,,less than a fraction of a percentnhave been problematic.,Turns out, peoplenare justified in their trust.,And when trust works out right,,it can be absolutely magical. 
 We had a guest staynwith a host in Uruguay,,and he suffered a heart attack.,The host rushed him to the hospital.,They donated their own bloodnfor his operation.,Let me read you his review. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Excellent house for sedentary travelers,prone to myocardial infarctions. 
 (Laughter) 
 The area is beautiful and hasndirect access to the best hospitals. 
 (Laughter) 
 Javier and Alejandra instantlynbecome guardian angels,who will save your lifenwithout even knowing you.,They will rush you to the hospitalnin their own car while you're dying,and stay in the waiting roomnwhile the doctors give you a bypass.,They don't want you to feel lonely,nthey bring you books to read.,And they let you stay at their housenextra nights without charging you.,Highly recommended!" 
 (Applause) 
 Of course, not every stay is like that.,But this connection beyond the transaction,is exactly what the sharingneconomy is aiming for. 
 Now, when I heard that term,,I have to admit, it tripped me up.,How do sharingnand transactions go together?,So let's be clear; it is about commerce.,But if you just called itnthe rental economy,,it would be incomplete.,The sharing economy is commercenwith the promise of human connection.,People share a part of themselves,,and that changes everything. 
 You know how most travel today is, like,,I think of it like fast food --,it's efficient and consistent,,at the cost of local and authentic.,What if travel were likena magnificent buffet,of local experiences?,What if anywhere you visited,,there was a central marketplace of locals,offering to get you thoroughly drunk,on a pub crawl in neighborhoodsnyou didn't even know existed.,Or learning to cook from the chefnof a five-star restaurant? 
 Today, homes are designed aroundnthe idea of privacy and separation.,What if homes were designednto be shared from the ground up?,What would that look like?,What if cities embracedna culture of sharing?,I see a future of shared citiesnthat bring us community and connection,instead of isolation and separation. 
 In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,,they've actually even started this.,They've repurposed hundredsnof government parking spots,to be shared by residents.,They're connecting studentsnwho need a place to live,with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.,And they've started an incubatornto help fund the next generation,of sharing economy start-ups. 
 Tonight, just on our service,,785,000 people,in 191 countries,will either stay in a stranger's home,or welcome one into theirs.,Clearly, it's not as crazynas we were taught. 
 We didn't invent anything new.,Hospitality has been around forever.,There's been many othernwebsites like ours.,So, why did ours eventually take off?,Luck and timing aside,,I've learned that you can takenthe components of trust,,and you can design for that.,Design can overcome our most deeply rooted,stranger-danger bias.,And that's amazing to me.,It blows my mind.,I think about this every timenI see a red Miata go by. 
 Now, we know design won't solvenall the world's problems.,But if it can help out with this one,,if it can make a dent in this,,it makes me wonder,nwhat else can we design for next? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The language I'm speaking right now,is on its way to becomingnthe world's universal language,,for better or for worse.,Let's face it,,it's the language of the internet,,it's the language of finance,,it's the language of air traffic control,,of popular music,,diplomacy --,English is everywhere. 
 Now, Mandarin Chinesenis spoken by more people,,but more Chinese peoplenare learning English,than English speakersnare learning Chinese.,Last I heard,,there are two dozen universitiesnin China right now,teaching all in English.,English is taking over. 
 And in addition to that,,it's been predictednthat at the end of the century,almost all of the languagesnthat exist now --,there are about 6,000 --,will no longer be spoken.,There will only be some hundreds left.,And on top of that,,it's at the point whereninstant translation of live speech,is not only possible,nbut it gets better every year. 
 The reason I'm recitingnthose things to you,is because I can tellnthat we're getting to the point,where a questionnis going to start being asked,,which is: Why should wenlearn foreign languages --,other than if Englishnhappens to be foreign to one?,Why bother to learn another onenwhen it's getting to the point,where almost everybody in the worldnwill be able to communicate in one? 
 I think there are a lot of reasons,,but I first want to address,the one that you're probablynmost likely to have heard of,,because actually it's morendangerous than you might think.,And that is the idea,that a language channels your thoughts,,that the vocabularynand the grammar of different languages,gives everybodyna different kind of acid trip,,so to speak.,That is a marvelously enticing idea,,but it's kind of fraught. 
 So it's not that it's untrue completely.,So for example, in French and Spanish,the word for table is,nfor some reason, marked as feminine.,So, "la table," "la mesa,"nyou just have to deal with it.,It has been shown,that if you are a speakernof one of those languages,and you happen to be asked,how you would imagine a table talking,,then much more oftennthan could possibly be an accident,,a French or a Spanish speaker,says that the table would talknwith a high and feminine voice.,So if you're French or Spanish,nto you, a table is kind of a girl,,as opposed to if younare an English speaker. 
 It's hard not to love data like that,,and many peoplenwill tell you that that means,that there's a worldview that you havenif you speak one of those languages.,But you have to watch out,,because imagine if somebodynput us under the microscope,,the us being those of usnwho speak English natively.,What is the worldview from English? 
 So for example,nlet's take an English speaker.,Up on the screen, that is Bono.,He speaks English.,I presume he has a worldview.,Now, that is Donald Trump.,In his way,,he speaks English as well. 
 (Laughter) 
 And here is Ms. Kardashian,,and she is an English speaker, too.,So here are three speakersnof the English language.,What worldview do thosenthree people have in common?,What worldview is shaped throughnthe English language that unites them?,It's a highly fraught concept.,And so gradual consensus is becomingnthat language can shape thought,,but it tends to be in rather darling,nobscure psychological flutters.,It's not a matter of giving youna different pair of glasses on the world. 
 Now, if that's the case,,then why learn languages?,If it isn't going to changenthe way you think,,what would the other reasons be?,There are some.,One of them is that if younwant to imbibe a culture,,if you want to drink it in,nif you want to become part of it,,then whether or notnthe language channels the culture --,and that seems doubtful --,if you want to imbibe the culture,,you have to control to some degree,the language that the culturenhappens to be conducted in.,There's no other way. 
 There's an interestingnillustration of this.,I have to go slightly obscure,nbut really you should seek it out.,There's a movie by the Canadiannfilm director Denys Arcand --,read out in English on the page,n"Dennis Ar-cand,",if you want to look him up.,He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal.",And many of the characters,are vibrant, funny, passionate,ninteresting French-Canadian,,French-speaking women.,There's one scene closest to the end,,where they have to take a friendnto an Anglophone hospital.,In the hospital,nthey have to speak English.,Now, they speak Englishnbut it's not their native language,,they'd rather not speak English.,And they speak it more slowly,,they have accents, they're not idiomatic.,Suddenly these charactersnthat you've fallen in love with,become husks of themselves,nthey're shadows of themselves. 
 To go into a culture,and to only ever process peoplenthrough that kind of skrim curtain,is to never truly get the culture.,And so to the extent that hundredsnof languages will be left,,one reason to learn them,is because they are ticketsnto being able to participate,in the culture of the peoplenwho speak them,,just by virtue of the factnthat it is their code.,So that's one reason. 
 Second reason:,it's been shown,that if you speak two languages,ndementia is less likely to set in,,and that you are probablyna better multitasker.,And these are factors that set in early,,and so that ought to give you some sense,of when to give junior or juniorettenlessons in another language.,Bilingualism is healthy. 
 And then, third --,languages are just an awful lot of fun.,Much more fun than we're often told.,So for example,nArabic: "kataba," he wrote,,"yaktubu," he writes, she writes.,"Uktub," write, in the imperative.,What do those things have in common?,All those things have in common,the consonants sittingnin the middle like pillars.,They stay still,,and the vowelsndance around the consonants.,Who wouldn't want to rollnthat around in their mouths?,You can get that from Hebrew,,you can get that from Ethiopia'snmain language, Amharic.,That's fun. 
 Or languages have different word orders.,Learning how to speaknwith different word order,is like driving on the different sidenof a street if you go to certain country,,or the feeling that you get when younput Witch Hazel around your eyes,and you feel the tingle.,A language can do that to you. 
 So for example,,"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,",a book that I'm surenwe all often return to,,like "Moby Dick.",One phrase in it is,n"Do you know where I found him?,Do you know where he was?nHe was eating cake in the tub,,Yes he was!",Fine. Now, if you learn thatnin Mandarin Chinese,,then you have to master,,"You can know, I did where him find?,He was tub inside gorging cake,,No mistake gorging chewing!",That just feels good.,Imagine being able to do thatnfor years and years at a time. 
 Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?,Me either, but if I did,,I would get to roll around in my mouthnnot some baker's dozen of vowels,like English has,,but a good 30 different vowels,scooching and oozing aroundnin the Cambodian mouth,like bees in a hive.,That is what a language can get you. 
 And more to the point,,we live in an era when it's never beenneasier to teach yourself another language.,It used to be that you hadnto go to a classroom,,and there would bensome diligent teacher --,some genius teacher in there --,but that person was onlynin there at certain times,and you had to go then,,and then was not most times.,You had to go to class.,If you didn't have that,nyou had something called a record.,I cut my teeth on those.,There was only so much data on a record,,or a cassette,,or even that antique object known as a CD.,Other than that you had booksnthat didn't work,,that's just the way it was. 
 Today you can lay down --,lie on your living room floor,,sipping bourbon,,and teach yourselfnany language that you want to,with wonderful setsnsuch as Rosetta Stone.,I highly recommendnthe lesser known Glossika as well.,You can do it any time,,therefore you can do it more and better.,You can give yourself your morningnpleasures in various languages.,I take some "Dilbert" in variousnlanguages every single morning;,it can increase your skills.,Couldn't have done it 20 years ago,when the idea of havingnany language you wanted,in your pocket,,coming from your phone,,would have sounded like science fictionnto very sophisticated people. 
 So I highly recommend,that you teach yourself languagesnother than the one that I'm speaking,,because there's never beenna better time to do it.,It's an awful lot of fun.,It won't change your mind,,but it will most certainly blow your mind. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)What do you see?,Most of you see a barbershop,,but I see an opportunity:,an opportunity for health,,an opportunity for health equity. 
 For black men, the barbershopnis not just a place,where you get your hair cutnor your beard trimmed.,No, it's much more than that.,Historically, the barbershopnhas been a safe haven for black men.,It's a place where we go for friendship,,solidarity and solace.,It's a place where we gonto get away from the stress,of the grind of work,and sometimes home life.,It's a place where we don't have to worry,about how we're being perceivednby the outside world.,It's a place where we don'tnfeel threatened,,or threatening.,It's a place of loyalty and trust.,For that reason,,it's one of the few placesnwhere we can fearlessly be ourselves,and just ... talk.,The talk, the shop talk, the conversation,,that is the essencenof the black barbershop. 
 I can remember going to the barbershopnwith my dad as a kid.,We went to Mr. Mike's barbershopnevery other Saturday.,And like clockwork,nthe same group of men would be there,every time we went,,either waiting on their favorite barber,or just soaking up the atmosphere. 
 I can remember the jovial greetingnthat warmly welcomed us,every time we went. 
 "Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.,He's a local pastor,nand they treated him like a celebrity. 
 "Hey young fella, how you doing?",they would say to me,,making me feel just as special. 
 I remember the rangenof the conversations was immense.,The men would talk about politicsnand sports and music,and world news, national news,,neighborhood news.,There was some talk about women,and what it was like to bena black man in America.,But many times they alsontalked about health.,The conversations about healthnwere lengthy and deep.,The men often recountedntheir doctor's recommendations,to cut salt in their diet,or to eat less fried foods,or to stop smoking,or to reduce stress.,They talked about the different waysnyou could reduce stress,,like simplifying one's love life -- 
 (Laughter) 
 all ways to treat high blood pressure. 
 There's a lot of talk aboutnhigh blood pressure in the barbershop.,That's because almost 40 percentnof black men have it.,That means that almostnevery single black man,either has high blood pressure,or knows a black man who has it. 
 Sometimes, those conversationsnin the barbershop,would be about what happensnwhen high blood pressure,is not adequately addressed. 
 "Say, did you hear about Jimmy?nHe had a stroke." 
 "Did you hear about Eddie?nHe died last week.,Massive heart attack.,He was 50." 
 More black men die from high bloodnpressure than from anything else,,even though decades of medical wisdomnand science have demonstrated,that death from high blood pressurencan be prevented,with timely diagnosisnand appropriate treatment. 
 So why is high blood pressurenso differentially deadly for black men?,Because too often, high blood pressurenis either untreated,or under-treated in black men,,in part because of our lower engagementnwith the primary healthcare system.,Black men, in particularnthose with high blood pressure,,are less likely to havena primary care doctor,than other groups. 
 But why?,Some of our earliest researchnon black men's health,revealed that for many, the doctor'snoffice is associated with fear,,mistrust,,disrespect,,and unnecessary unpleasantness.,The doctor's office is only a placenthat you go when you don't feel well.,And when you do go,nyou might wait for hours,only to get the run-around,and to be evaluated byna stoic figure in a white coat,who only has 10 minutes to give you,and who doesn't value the talk.,So it's no wonder that some menndon't want to be bothered,and skip going to the doctor altogether,,especially if they feel fine. 
 But herein lies the problem.,You can feel just fine,while high blood pressure ravagesnyour most vital organs. 
 This is Denny Moe,,owner of Denny Moe'snSuperstar Barbershop in Harlem.,I've been lucky enough to have Dennynas my barber for the last eight years. 
 He said to me once,,"Hey Doc, you know,,lots of black men trust their barbersnmore than they trust their doctors." 
 This was stunning to me,,at first,,but not so much when you think about it.,Black men have been with theirncurrent barbers,on average as longnas I've been with Denny,,about eight years.,And black men see their barbersnabout every two weeks.,Not only do you trust your barbernwith your look and with your style,,but you also trust him with your secretsnand sometimes your life.,Denny, like many barbers,nis more than just an artist,,a businessman and confidant.,He's a leader and a passionate advocatenfor the well-being of his community.,The very first time I walkedninto Denny Moe's shop,,he wasn't just cutting hair.,He was also orchestratingna voter registration drive,to give a voice to his customersnand his community. 
 With this kind of activism,,and community investmentnthat typifies the black barbershop,,of course the barbershopnis a perfect place,to talk about high blood pressure andnother health concerns in the community. 
 First, the barbershop is notna medical setting,,and so it doesn't havenall the negative psychological baggage,that comes along with that.,When you're in a barbershop,,you're in your territory,nand you're among friends,who share your history,,your struggle and your health risks. 
 Second, because the barbershopnis a place of connection,,loyalty and trust,,it's a place where you're more opennto have a conversation about health,and especially about high blood pressure.,After all,,conversations about high blood pressurenhave all the elements of great shop talk:,stress and high blood pressure,,food and high blood pressure,,relationships and high blood pressure,,and yes, what it's likento be a black man in America,and high blood pressure. 
 But you can do more than just talknabout high blood pressure,in the barbershop.,You can concretely take action.,Here we have an opportunity to partnernwith the Denny Moe's of the world,and empower communitiesnto address the health inequities,that uniquely affect it.,When high blood pressure screeningnexpanded from clinics and hospitals,to communities in the 1960s and '70s,,black physicians likenDr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore,and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans,were at the forefront of bringingnhealth promotion to community hubs,in urban black neighborhoods. 
 These pioneers paved the waynfor my professional journey,with barbershops and health,,which began in Chicago in medical school. 
 The very first research projectnthat I worked on as a medical student,was to help designnhealthcare interventions,that would appeal to black men.,We conducted about a dozen focus groups,with a broad cross-section of black men,,and we learned that for them,,being healthy was as much aboutnbeing perceived as healthy,as it was about feeling healthy,,and that feeling goodnwent hand in hand with looking good.,This work led to the developmentnof Project Brotherhood,,a community clinic foundednby Dr. Eric Whitaker,that provided tailorednhealthcare to black men.,Part of this tailored care,involved having a barber on the premises,to reward the men who camenfor needed healthcare,with a free haircut,,to let the men know that we, too,nvalued how they looked,as well as how they felt,,and that what was important to themnwas also important to us. 
 But while there's only onenProject Brotherhood,,there are thousands of black barbershops,where the intersection of healthnand haircuts can be cultivated.,The next stop on my journeynwas Dallas, Texas,,where we learned that barbersnwere not only willing,but fully able to roll upntheir sleeves and participate,in delivering needed health servicesnto improve the health of their customers,and their community.,We teamed up with an amazingncadre of black barbers,and taught them hownto measure blood pressure,and how to counsel their customers,and refer them to doctors,to help manage high blood pressure.,The barbers were not only willing to do it,but they were damn good at it.,Over a three-year period,,the barbers measurednthousands of blood pressures,resulting in hundreds of black mennbeing referred to doctors,for medical carenof their high blood pressure.,These barber-doctor partnerships,resulted in a 20 percent increasenin the number of men,who were able to achieventarget blood pressure levels,and a three-point drop, on average,,in the blood pressure of each participant.,If we were to extrapolatenthat three point drop,to every single black mannwith high blood pressure in America,,we would prevent 800 heart attacks,n500 strokes and 900 deaths,from high blood pressure,in just one year. 
 And our experience with barbershopsnhas been no different in New York City,,where my journey has currently led me.,With an incredible teamnof diverse research assistants,,community health workers and volunteers,,we've been able to partnernwith over 200 barbershops,and other trusted community venues,to reach over 7,000 older black men.,And we've offered high blood pressurenscreening and counseling,to each and every one of them.,Thanks to Denny Moe,and the myriad other barbersnand community leaders,who shared the vision of opportunitynand empowerment,to make a difference in their communities,,we've been able to not onlynlower blood pressure,in our participants,,but we've also been able to impactnother health indicators. 
 So what do you see?,What is your barbershop?,Where is that place for you,where people who are affectednby a unique problem,can meet a unique solution?,When you find that place,nsee the opportunity. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How do you find a dinosaur?,Sounds impossible, doesn't it?,It's not.,And the answer relies on a formulanthat all paleontologists use.,And I'm going to tell you the secret. 
 First, find rocks of the right age.,Second, those rocksnmust be sedimentary rocks.,And third, layers of those rocksnmust be naturally exposed.,That's it.,Find those three thingsnand get yourself on the ground,,chances are goodnthat you will find fossils. 
 Now let me break down this formula.,Organisms exist only during certainngeological intervals.,So you have to findnrocks of the right age,,depending on what your interests are.,If you want to find trilobites,,you have to find the really,nreally old rocks of the Paleozoic --,rocks between a half a billionnand a quarter-billion years old.,Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,,don't look in the Paleozoic,nyou won't find them.,They hadn't evolved yet.,You have to find the youngernrocks of the Mesozoic,,and in the case of dinosaurs,,between 235 and 66 million years ago. 
 Now, it's fairly easy to find rocksnof the right age at this point,,because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,,geologically mapped.,This is hard-won information.,The annals of Earth historynare written in rocks,,one chapter upon the next,,such that the oldest pages are on bottom,and the youngest on top. 
 Now, were it quite that easy,ngeologists would rejoice.,It's not.,The library of Earth is an old one.,It has no librarian to impose order.,Operating over vast swaths of time,,myriad geological processesnoffer every possible insult,to the rocks of ages.,Most pages are destroyednsoon after being written.,Some pages are overwritten,,creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsestsnof long-gone landscapes.,Pages that do find sanctuarynunder the advancing sands of time,are never truly safe.,Unlike the Moon --nour dead, rocky companion --,the Earth is alive, pulsingnwith creative and destructive forces,that power its geological metabolism.,Lunar rocks brought backnby the Apollo astronauts,all date back to about the agenof the Solar System.,Moon rocks are forever.,Earth rocks, on the other hand,nface the perils of a living lithosphere.,All will suffer ruination,,through some combinationnof mutilation, compression,,folding, tearing, scorching and baking. 
 Thus, the volumes of Earth historynare incomplete and disheveled.,The library is vast and magnificent --,but decrepit.,And it was this tattered complexitynin the rock record,that obscured its meaningnuntil relatively recently.,Nature provided no card catalognfor geologists --,this would have to be invented.,Five thousand years after the Sumeriansnlearned to record their thoughts,on clay tablets,,the Earth's volumes remainedninscrutable to humans.,We were geologically illiterate,,unaware of the antiquitynof our own planet,and ignorant of our connection,to deep time. 
 It wasn't until the turnnof the 19th century,that our blinders were removed,,first, with the publicationnof James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,",in which he told us that the Earthnreveals no vestige of a beginning,and no prospect of an end;,and then, with the printingnof William Smith's map of Britain,,the first country-scale geological map,,giving us for the first time,predictive insight into wherencertain types of rocks might occur.,After that, you could say things like,,"If we go over there,nwe should be in the Jurassic,",or, "If we go up over that hill,nwe should find the Cretaceous." 
 So now, if you want to find trilobites,,get yourself a good geological map,and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.,If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,,find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.,Now of course, you can only makena fossil in a sedimentary rock,,a rock made by sand and mud.,You can't have a fossil,in an igneous rock formednby magma, like a granite,,or in a metamorphic rocknthat's been heated and squeezed.,And you have to get yourself in a desert.,It's not that dinosaursnparticularly lived in deserts;,they lived on every land mass,and in every imaginable environment.,It's that you need to go to a placenthat's a desert today,,a place that doesn't haventoo many plants covering up the rocks,,and a place where erosion is alwaysnexposing new bones at the surface.,So find those three things:,rocks of the right age,,that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,,and get yourself on the ground,,and you literally walk,until you see a bonensticking out of the rock. 
 Here's a picture that I tooknin Southern Patagonia.,Every pebble that you seenon the ground there,is a piece of dinosaur bone.,So when you're in that right situation,,it's not a question of whethernyou'll find fossils or not;,you're going to find fossils.,The question is: Will you find somethingnthat is scientifically significant?,And to help with that, I'm going to addna fourth part to our formula,,which is this:,get as far away from othernpaleontologists as possible. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's not that I don't likenother paleontologists.,When you go to a placenthat's relatively unexplored,,you have a much better chancenof not only finding fossils,but of finding somethingnthat's new to science.,So that's my formulanfor finding dinosaurs,,and I've applied it all around the world. 
 In the austral summer of 2004,,I went to the bottom of South America,,to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,,to prospect for dinosaurs:,a place that had terrestrialnsedimentary rocks of the right age,,in a desert,,a place that had been barely visitednby paleontologists.,And we found this.,This is a femur, a thigh bone,,of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.,That bone is 2.2 meters across.,That's over seven feet long. 
 Now, unfortunately,nthat bone was isolated.,We dug and dug and dug,nand there wasn't another bone around.,But it made us hungry to go backnthe next year for more.,And on the first daynof that next field season,,I found this: another two-meter femur,,only this time not isolated,,this time associated with 145 other bones,of a giant plant eater.,And after three more hard,nreally brutal field seasons,,the quarry came to look like this.,And there you see the tailnof that great beast wrapping around me.,The giant that lay in this grave,nthe new species of dinosaur,,we would eventually calln"Dreadnoughtus schrani.",Dreadnoughtus was 85 feetnfrom snout to tail.,It stood two-and-a-half storiesnat the shoulder,,and all fleshed out in life,nit weighed 65 tons.,People ask me sometimes,n"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?",That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex. 
 Now, one of the really cool thingsnabout being a paleontologist,is when you find a new species,nyou get to name it.,And I've always thought it a shamenthat these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs,are too often portrayed as passive,nlumbering platters of meat,on the landscape. 
 (Laughter) 
 They're not.,Big herbivores can be surly,nand they can be territorial --,you do not want to mess with a hipponor a rhino or a water buffalo.,The bison in Yellowstone injurenfar more people than do the grizzly bears.,So can you imagine a big bull,n65-ton Dreadnoughtus,in the breeding season,,defending a territory?,That animal would have beennincredibly dangerous,,a menace to all around, and itselfnwould have had nothing to fear.,And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,",or, "fears nothing." 
 Now, to grow so large,,an animal like Dreadnoughtusnwould've had to have been,a model of efficiency.,That long neck and long tail help itnradiate heat into the environment,,passively controlling its temperature.,And that long neck also servesnas a super-efficient feeding mechanism.,Dreadnoughtus could standnin one place and with that neck,clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,,taking in tens of thousands of caloriesnwhile expending very few.,And these animals evolvedna bulldog-like wide-gait stance,,giving them immense stability,,because when you're 65 tons,nwhen you're literally as big as a house,,the penalty for falling over,is death.,Yeah, these animals are big and tough,,but they won't take a blow like that.,Dreadnoughtus falls over,nribs break and pierce lungs.,Organs burst.,If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,,you don't get to fall downnin life -- even once. 
 Now, after this particularnDreadnoughtus carcass was buried,and de-fleshed by a multitudenof bacteria, worms and insects,,its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,,exchanging molecules with the groundwater,and becoming more and morenlike the entombing rock.,As layer upon layernof sediment accumulated,,pressure from all sidesnweighed in like a stony glove,whose firm and enduring grip heldneach bone in a stabilizing embrace. 
 And then came the long ...,nothing.,Epoch after epoch of sameness,,nonevents without number.,All the while, the skeleton layneverlasting and unchanging,in perfect equilibrium,within its rocky grave.,Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.,The dinosaurs would reignnfor another 12 million years,before their hegemony was snuffed outnin a fiery apocalypse.,The continents drifted. The mammals rose.,The Ice Age came. 
 And then, in East Africa,,an unpromising species of apenevolved the odd trick of sentient thought.,These brainy primates were notnparticularly fast or strong.,But they excelled at covering ground,,and in a remarkable diaspora,surpassing even the dinosaurs' recordnof territorial conquest,,they dispersed across the planet,,ravishing every ecosystemnthey encountered,,along the way, inventing culturenand metalworking and painting,and dance and music,and science,and rocket ships that would eventuallyntake 12 particularly excellent apes,to the surface of the Moon. 
 With seven billion peripateticnHomo sapiens on the planet,,it was perhaps inevitable,that one of them would eventuallyntrod on the grave of the magnificent titan,buried beneath the badlandsnof Southern Patagonia.,I was that ape.,And standing there, alone in the desert,,it was not lost on me,that the chance of any one individualnentering the fossil record,is vanishingly small.,But the Earth is very, very old.,And over vast tracts of time,nthe improbable becomes the probable.,That's the magic of the geological record.,Thus, multitudinous creaturesnliving and dying on an old planet,leave behind immense numbers of fossils,,each one a small miracle,,but collectively, inevitable. 
 Sixty-six million years ago,nan asteroid hits the Earth,and wipes out the dinosaurs.,This easily might not have been.,But we only get one history,nand it's the one that we have.,But this particular realitynwas not inevitable.,The tiniest perturbationnof that asteroid far from Earth,would have caused it to missnour planet by a wide margin.,The pivotal, calamitous day during whichnthe dinosaurs were wiped out,,setting the stagenfor the modern world as we know it,didn't have to be.,It could've just been another day --,a Thursday, perhaps --,among the 63 billion daysnalready enjoyed by the dinosaurs.,But over geological time,,improbable, nearly impossible events,do occur.,Along the path from our wormy,nCambrian ancestors,to primates dressed in suits,,innumerable forks in the roadnled us to this very particular reality.,The bones of Dreadnoughtusnlay underground for 77 million years.,Who could have imagined,that a single species of shrew-like mammal,living in the cracks of the dinosaur world,would evolve into sentient beings,capable of characterizingnand understanding,the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded? 
 I once stood at the headnof the Missouri River,and bestraddled it.,There, it's nothing morenthan a gurgle of water,that issues forth from beneath a rocknin a boulder in a pasture,,high in the Bitterroot Mountains.,The stream next to itnruns a few hundred yards,and ends in a small pond.,Those two streams -- they look identical.,But one is an anonymous trickle of water,,and the other is the Missouri River.,Now go down to the mouthnof the Missouri, near St. Louis,,and it's pretty obviousnthat that river is a big deal.,But go up into the Bitterrootsnand look at the Missouri,,and human prospection does notnallow us to see it as anything special.,Now go back to the Cretaceous Period,and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.,You would never guess,that they would amountnto anything special,,and they probably wouldn't have,,were it not for that pesky asteroid. 
 Now, make a thousand more worldsnand a thousand more solar systems,and let them run.,You will never get the same result.,No doubt, those worlds would benboth amazing and amazingly improbable,,but they would not be our worldnand they would not have our history.,There are an infinite number of historiesnthat we could've had.,We only get one, and wow,ndid we ever get a good one.,Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.,Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.,Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eaglenand pill bugs the length of a car,really existed. 
 Why study the ancient past?,Because it gives us perspective,and humility.,The dinosaurs died in the world'snfifth mass extinction,,snuffed out in a cosmic accidentnthrough no fault of their own.,They didn't see it coming,nand they didn't have a choice.,We, on the other hand, do have a choice.,And the nature of the fossil recordntells us that our place on this planet,is both precariousnand potentially fleeting.,Right now, our species is propagatingnan environmental disaster,of geological proportionsnthat is so broad and so severe,,it can rightly be callednthe sixth extinction.,Only unlike the dinosaurs,,we can see it coming.,And unlike the dinosaurs,,we can do something about it.,That choice is ours. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There are things we say,when we catch the eye of a stranger,or a neighbor walking by.,We say, "Hello, how are you?,It's a beautiful day.,How do you feel?",These sound kind of meaningless, right?nAnd, in some ways, they are.,They have no semantic meaning.,It doesn't matter how you arenor what the day is like.,They have something else.,They have social meaning.,What we mean when we say those things is:,I see you there. 
 I'm obsessed with talking to strangers.,I make eye contact, say hello,,I offer help, I listen.,I get all kinds of stories.,About seven years ago, I startedndocumenting my experiences,to try to figure out why.,What I found was that somethingnreally beautiful was going on.,This is almost poetic.,These were really profound experiences.,They were unexpected pleasures.,They were genuine emotional connections.,They were liberating moments. 
 So one day, I was standing on a cornernwaiting for the light to change,,which, I'm a New Yorker,,so that means I was actually standingnin the street on the storm drain,,as if that could get me across faster.,And there's an old mannstanding next to me.,So he's wearing, like, a long overcoatnand sort of an old-man hat,,and he looked like somebody from a movie.,And he says to me,,"Don't stand there. You might disappear.",So this is absurd, right?,But I did what he said.nI stepped back onto the sidewalk.,And he smiled, and he said,,"Good. You never know.,I might have turned around,,and zoop, you're gone." 
 This was weird,,and also really wonderful.,He was so warm, and he wasnso happy that he'd saved me.,We had this little bond.,For a minute, I felt likenmy existence as a person,had been noticed,,and I was worth saving.,The really sad thing is,,in many parts of the world,,we're raised to believenthat strangers are dangerous by default,,that we can't trust them,nthat they might hurt us.,But most strangers aren't dangerous.,We're uneasy around themnbecause we have no context.,We don't know what their intentions are.,So instead of using our perceptionsnand making choices,,we rely on this category of "stranger." 
 I have a four-year-old.,When I say hello to people on the street,,she asks me why.,She says, "Do we know them?" 
 I say, "No, they're our neighbor." 
 "Are they our friend?" 
 "No, it's just good to be friendly." 
 I think twice every timenI say that to her,,because I mean it,nbut as a woman, particularly,,I know that not every strangernon the street has the best intentions.,It is good to be friendly,nand it's good to learn when not to be,,but none of that meansnwe have to be afraid. 
 There are two huge benefits,to using our senses instead of our fears.,The first one is that it liberates us.,When you think about it,,using perception instead of categories,is much easier said than done.,Categories are something our brains use.,When it comes to people,,it's sort of a shortcutnfor learning about them.,We see male, female, young, old,,black, brown, white, stranger, friend,,and we use the information in that box.,It's quick, it's easy,and it's a road to bias.,And it means we're not thinkingnabout people as individuals.,I know an American researchernwho travels frequently,in Central Asia and Africa, alone.,She's entering into towns and cities,as a complete stranger.,She has no bonds, no connections.,She's a foreigner.,Her survival strategy is this:,get one stranger to see younas a real, individual person.,If you can do that, it'll helpnother people see you that way, too. 
 The second benefit of using our sensesnhas to do with intimacy.,I know it soundsna little counterintuitive,,intimacy and strangers,,but these quick interactionsncan lead to a feeling,that sociologists calln"fleeting intimacy.",So, it's a brief experiencenthat has emotional resonance and meaning.,It's the good feeling I got,from being saved from the death trapnof the storm drain by the old man,,or how I feel like part of a community,when I talk to somebodynon my train on the way to work. 
 Sometimes it goes further.,Researchers have foundnthat people often feel more comfortable,being honest and opennabout their inner selves with strangers,than they do with their friendsnand their families --,that they often feelnmore understood by strangers.,This gets reported in the medianwith great lament.,"Strangers communicatenbetter than spouses!",It's a good headline, right?,I think it entirely misses the point.,The important thing about these studies,is just how significantnthese interactions can be;,how this special form of closeness,gives us something we neednas much as we need our friends,and our families. 
 So how is it possible that we communicatenso well with strangers?,There are two reasons.,The first one is thatnit's a quick interaction.,It has no consequences.,It's easy to be honest with someonenyou're never going to see again, right?,That makes sense.,The second reason is wherenit gets more interesting.,We have a bias when it comesnto people we're close to.,We expect them to understand us.,We assume they do,,and we expect them to read our minds.,So imagine you're at a party,,and you can't believenthat your friend or your spouse,isn't picking up on itnthat you want to leave early.,And you're thinking,,"I gave you the look." 
 With a stranger, we havento start from scratch.,We tell the whole story,,we explain who the people are,nhow we feel about them;,we spell out all the inside jokes.,And guess what?,Sometimes they donunderstand us a little better. 
 OK.,So now that we knownthat talking to strangers matters,,how does it work?,There are unwritten rulesnwe tend to follow.,The rules are very differentndepending on what country you're in,,what culture you're in.,In most parts of the US,,the baseline expectation in public,is that we maintain a balancenbetween civility and privacy.,This is known as civil inattention.,So, imagine two people are walkingntowards each other on the street.,They'll glance at each othernfrom a distance.,That's the civility, the acknowledgment.,And then as they get closer,nthey'll look away,,to give each other some space. 
 In other cultures,,people go to extraordinary lengthsnnot to interact at all.,People from Denmark tell me,that many Danes are so aversento talking to strangers,,that they would rathernmiss their stop on the bus,than say "excuse me" to someonenthat they need to get around.,Instead, there's this elaboratenshuffling of bags,and using your body to saynthat you need to get past,,instead of using two words. 
 In Egypt, I'm told,,it's rude to ignore a stranger,,and there's a remarkablenculture of hospitality.,Strangers might ask each othernfor a sip of water.,Or, if you ask someone for directions,,they're very likelynto invite you home for coffee.,We see these unwritten rulesnmost clearly when they're broken,,or when you're in a new place,and you're trying to figure outnwhat the right thing to do is. 
 Sometimes breaking the rules a little bitnis where the action is.,In case it's not clear,nI really want you to do this. OK?,So here's how it's going to go.,Find somebody who is making eye contact.,That's a good signal.,The first thing is a simple smile.,If you're passing somebody on the streetnor in the hallway here, smile.,See what happens. 
 Another is triangulation.,There's you, there's a stranger,,there's some third thingnthat you both might see and comment on,,like a piece of public art,or somebody preaching in the street,or somebody wearing funny clothes.,Give it a try.,Make a comment about that third thing,nand see if starts a conversation. 
 Another is what I call noticing.,This is usually giving a compliment.,I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.,I'm actually not wearingnfabulous shoes right now,,but shoes are fabulous in general.,And they're pretty neutralnas far as giving compliments goes.,People always want to tell you thingsnabout their awesome shoes. 
 You may have already experiencednthe dogs and babies principle.,It can be awkwardnto talk to someone on the street;,you don't know hownthey're going to respond.,But you can always talknto their dog or their baby.,The dog or the baby,is a social conduit to the person,,and you can tell by how they respond,whether they're open to talking more. 
 The last one I want to challenge you to,is disclosure.,This is a very vulnerable thing to do,,and it can be very rewarding.,So next time you're talking to a stranger,and you feel comfortable,,tell them something true about yourself,,something really personal.,You might have that experiencenI talked about of feeling understood. 
 Sometimes in conversation, it comes up,,people ask me, "What does your dad do?"nor, "Where does he live?",And sometimes I tell them the whole truth,,which is that he died when I was a kid.,Always in those moments,,they share their own experiences of loss.,We tend to meetndisclosure with disclosure,,even with strangers. 
 So, here it is.,When you talk to strangers,nyou're making beautiful interruptions,into the expected narrativenof your daily life,and theirs.,You're making unexpected connections.,If you don't talk to strangers,nyou're missing out on all of that.,We spend a lot of time,teaching our children about strangers.,What would happen if we spentnmore time teaching ourselves?,We could reject all the ideasnthat make us so suspicious of each other.,We could make a space for change. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Normanndoesn't need much of an introduction,,but TED's audience is global,,it's diverse,,so I've been taskednwith starting with his bio,,which could easily take upnthe entire 18 minutes.,So instead we're going to don93 years in 93 seconds or less. 
 (Laughter) 
 You were born in New Hampshire. 
 Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut. 
 EH: New Haven, Connecticut. 
 (Laughter) 
 NL: There goes seven more seconds. 
 EH: Nailed it. 
 (Laughter) 
 You were born in New Haven, Connecticut.,Your father was a con man --nI got that right.,He was taken away to prisonnwhen you were nine years old.,You flew 52 missionsnas a fighter pilot in World War II.,You came back to -- 
 NL: Radio operator. 
 EH: You came to LAnto break into Hollywood,,first in publicity, then in TV.,You had no training as a writer, formally,,but you hustled your way in.,Your breakthrough, your debut,,was a little showncalled "All in the Family.",You followed that up with a string of hits,that to this day is unmatchednin Hollywood:,"Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times,","The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time,","Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,",to name literally a fraction of them.,Not only are they all commercially -- 
 (Applause) 
 Not only are they allncommercially successful,,but many of them push our culture forward,by giving the underrepresentednmembers of society,their first prime-time voice.,You have seven showsnin the top 10 at one time.,At one point,,you aggregate an audiencenof 120 million people per week,watching your content.,That's more than the audiencenfor Super Bowl 50,,which happens once a year. 
 NL: Holy shit. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 EH: And we're not evennto the holy shit part. 
 (Laughter) 
 You land yourselfnon Richard Nixon's enemies list --,he had one. 
 That's an applause line, too. 
 (Applause) 
 You're inducted into the TV Hall of Famenon the first day that it exists.,Then came the movies.,"Fried Green Tomatoes,","The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me,","This Is Spinal Tap." 
 (Applause) 
 Again, just to name a fraction. 
 (Applause) 
 Then you wipe the slate clean,,start a third act as a political activistnfocusing on protecting the First Amendment,and the separation of church and state.,You start People For The American Way.,You buy the Declaration of Independence,and give it back to the people.,You stay active in bothnentertainment and politics,until the ripe old of age of 93,,when you write a book,and make a documentarynabout your life story.,And after all that,,they finally thinknyou're ready for a TED Talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 NL: I love being here.,And I love you for agreeing to do this. 
 EH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor.,So here's my first question.,Was your mother proud of you? 
 (Laughter) 
 NL: My mother ...,what a place to start.,Let me put it this way --,when I came back from the war,,she showed me the lettersnthat I had written her from overseas,,and they were absolute love letters. 
 (Laughter) 
 This really sums up my mother.,They were love letters,,as if I had written them to --,they were love letters.,A year later I asked my mothernif I could have them,,because I'd like to keep themnall the years of my life ...,She had thrown them away. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's my mother. 
 (Laughter) 
 The best way I can sum it upnin more recent times is --,this is also more recent times --,a number of years ago,,when they started the Hall of Famento which you referred.,It was a Sunday morning,,when I got a call from the fellow who rannthe TV Academy of Arts & Sciences.,He was calling me to tell menthey had met all day yesterday,and he was confidentially telling menthey were going to start a hall of fame,and these were the inductees.,I started to say "Richard Nixon,",because Richard Nixon -- 
 EH: I don't think he was on their list. 
 NL: William Paley, who started CBS,,David Sarnoff, who started NBC,,Edward R. Murrow,,the greatest of the foreignncorrespondents,,Paddy Chayefsky --,I think the best writernthat ever came out of television --,Milton Berle, Lucille Ball,and me. 
 EH: Not bad. 
 NL: I call my mothernimmediately in Hartford, Connecticut.,"Mom, this is what's happened,,they're starting a hall of fame." 
 I tell her the list of names and me,,and she says,,"Listen, if that's what theynwant to do, who am I to say?" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 That's my Ma.,I think it earns that kind of a laugh,because everybodynhas a piece of that mother. 
 (Laughter) 
 EH: And the sitcom Jewish mothernis born, right there. 
 So your father also playedna large role in your life,,mostly by his absence. 
 NL: Yeah. 
 EH: Tell us what happenednwhen you were nine years old. 
 NL: He was flying to Oklahoma,with three guys that my mother said,,"I don't want you to havenanything to do with them,,I don't trust those men.",That's when I heard,,maybe not for the first time,,"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going.",And he went.,It turns out he was picking upnsome fake bonds,,which he was flyingnacross the country to sell.,But the fact that he was goingnto Oklahoma in a plane,,and he was going to bring menback a 10-gallon hat,,just like Ken Maynard,nmy favorite cowboy wore.,You know, this was a few yearsnafter Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.,I mean, it was exoticnthat my father was going there.,But when he came back,,they arrested him as he got off the plane. 
 That night newspapersnwere all over the house,,my father was with his hatnin front of his face,,manacled to a detective.,And my mother was selling the furniture,nbecause we were leaving --,she didn't want to staynin that state of shame,,in Chelsea, Massachusetts.,And selling the furniture --,the house was loaded with people. 
 And in the middle of all of that,,some strange horse's assnput his hand on my shoulder and said,,"Well, you're the man of the house now.",I'm crying, and this asshole says,n"You're the man of the house now.",And I think that was the moment,I began to understand the foolishnessnof the human condition.,So ...,it took a lot of years to look back at itnand feel it was a benefit.,But -- 
 EH: It's interestingnyou call it a benefit. 
 NL: Benefit in that it gavenme that springboard.,I mean that I could think,how foolish it was to saynto this crying nine-year-old boy,,"You're the man of the house now.",And then I was crying, and then he said,,"And men of the house don't cry.",And I ... 
 (Laughter) 
 So ...,I look back, and I think,that's when I learned the foolishnessnof the human condition,,and it's been that gift that I've used. 
 EH: So you have a father who's absent,,you have a mother for whomnapparently nothing is good enough.,Do you think that starting out as a kidnwho maybe never felt heard,started you down a journey,that ended with you being an adult,with a weekly audiencenof 120 million people? 
 NL: I love the way you put that question,,because I guessnI've spent my life wanting --,if anything, wanting to be heard.,I think --,It's a simple answer, yes,,that was what sparked --,well, there were other things, too.,When my father was away,,I was fooling with a crystal radio setnthat we had made together,,and I caught a signal that turned outnto be Father Coughlin. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, somebody laughed. 
 (Laughter) 
 But not funny,,this was a horse's --,another horse's ass --,who was very vocalnabout hating the New Deal,and Roosevelt and Jews.,The first time I ran into an understanding,that there were peoplenin this world that hated me,because I was born to Jewish parents.,And that had an enormousneffect on my life. 
 EH: So you had a childhood,with little in the waynof strong male role models,,except for your grandfather.,Tell us about him. 
 NL: Oh, my grandfather.,Well here's the way I alwaysntalked about that grandfather.,There were parades,,lots of parades when I was a kid.,There were parades on Veteran's Day --,there wasn't a President's Day.,There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,,George Washington's birthday,and Flag Day ...,And lots of little parades.,My grandfather used to take me,and we'd stand on the street corner,,he'd hold my hand,,and I'd look up and I'd see a tearnrunning down his eye.,And he meant a great deal to me. 
 And he used to write presidentsnof the United States.,Every letter started,,"My dearest, darling Mr. President,",and he'd tell him somethingnwonderful about what he did.,But when he disagreednwith the President, he also wrote,,"My dearest, darling Mr. President,,Didn't I tell you last week ...?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I would run down the stairsnevery now and then,and pick up the mail.,We were three flights up,,74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut.,And I'd pick up a little white envelopenreading, "Shya C. called at this address.",And that's the story I have toldnabout my grandfather -- 
 EH: They wrote him backnon the envelopes -- 
 NL: They wrote back.,But I have shown them myself,,going way back to Phil Donahuenand others before him,,literally dozens of interviewsnin which I told that story.,This will be the second time I have saidnthe whole story was a lie.,The truth was my grandfatherntook me to parades,,we had lots of those.,The truth is a tear came down his eye. 
 The truth is he would writenan occasional letter,,and I did pick up those little envelopes.,But "My dearest darling Mr. President,",all the rest of it,,is a story I borrowed from a good friend,whose grandfather was that grandfathernwho wrote those letters.,And, I mean, I stolenArthur Marshall's grandfather,and made him my own.,Always. 
 When I started to write my memoir --,"Even this --",How about that?,"Even This I Get to Experience.",When I started to write the memoir,and I started to think about it,,and then I --,I --,I did a reasonable amount of crying,,and I realized how muchnI needed the father.,So much so that I appropriatednArthur Marshall's grandfather.,So much so, the word "father" --,I have six kids by the way.,My favorite role in life.,It and husband to my wife Lyn.,But I stole the man's identitynbecause I needed the father. 
 Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit,and come out on the other side,,and I forgive my father --,the best thing I --,the worst thing I --,The word I'd like to use about himnand think about him is --,he was a rascal.,The fact that he liednand stole and cheated,and went to prison ...,I submerge that in the word "rascal." 
 EH: Well there's a saying that amateursnborrow and professionals steal. 
 NL: I'm a pro. 
 EH: You're a pro. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that quote is widelynattributed to John Lennon,,but it turns outnhe stole it from T.S. Eliot.,So you're in good company. 
 (Laughter) 
 EH: I want to talk about your work.,Obviously the impact of your worknhas been written about,and I'm sure you've heardnabout it all your life:,what it meant to people,,what it meant to our culture,,you heard the applause when I justnnamed the names of the shows,,you raised half the peoplenin the room through your work.,But have there ever been any storiesnabout the impact of your work,that surprised you? 
 NL: Oh, god --,surprised me and delighted menfrom head to toe.,There was "An Evening with Norman Lear"nwithin the last year,that a group of hip-hop impresarios,,performers and the Academy put together.,The subtext of "An Evening with ...",was: What do a 92-year-old Jew --,then 92 --,and the world of hip-hop have in common?,Russell Simmonsnwas among seven on the stage.,And when he talked about the shows,,he wasn't talking about the Hollywood,,George Jefferson in "The Jeffersons,",or the show that was a number five show.,He was talking about a simplenthing that made a big -- 
 EH: Impact on him? 
 NL: An impact on him --,I was hesitating over the word, "change.",It's hard for me to imagine,,you know, changing somebody's life,,but that's the way he put it.,He saw George Jeffersonnwrite a check on "The Jeffersons,",and he never knew that a black manncould write a check.,And he says it justnimpacted his life so --,it changed his life. 
 And when I hear things like that --,little things --,because I know that there isn'tnanybody in this audience,that wasn't likely responsible today fornsome little thing they did for somebody,,whether it's as little as a smilenor an unexpected "Hello,",that's how little this thing was.,It could have been the dresser of the set,who put the checkbook on the thing,,and George had nothing to donwhile he was speaking, so he wrote it,,I don't know.,But -- 
 EH: So in addition to the long listnI shared in the beginning,,I should have also mentionednthat you invented hip-hop. 
 (Laughter) 
 NL: Well ... 
 EH: I want to talk about -- 
 NL: Well, then do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,,but you've also built a life of meaning.,And all of us strive to donboth of those things --,not all of us manage to.,But even those of us who do managento accomplish both of those,,very rarely do we figure outnhow to do them together.,You managed to push culturenforward through your art,while also achieving world-beatingncommercial success.,How did you do both? 
 NL: Here's where my mind goes when I hearnthat recitation of all I accomplished.,This planet is one of a billion,,they tell us,,in a universenof which there are billions --,billions of universes,,billions of planets ...,which we're trying to save,and it requires saving.,But ...,anything I may have accomplished is --,my sister once asked menwhat she does about something,that was going onnin Newington, Connecticut.,And I said, "Write your aldermannor your mayor or something.",She said, "Well I'm notnNorman Lear, I'm Claire Lear.",And that was the first timenI said what I'm saying,,I said, "Claire. With everythingnyou think about what I may have done,and everything you've done," --,she never left Newington --,"can you get your fingers close enough,when you consider the sizenof the planet and so forth,,to measure anything I may have donento anything you may have done?" 
 So ...,I am convinced we're all responsible,for doing as muchnas I may have accomplished.,And I understand what you're saying -- 
 EH: It's an articulate deflection -- 
 NL: But you have to really buy intonthe size and scope,of the creator's enterprise, here. 
 EH: But here on this planetnyou have really mattered. 
 NL: I'm a son of a gun. 
 (Laughter) 
 EH: So I have one more question for you.,How old do you feel? 
 NL: I am the peernof whoever I'm talking to. 
 EH: Well, I feel 93. 
 (Applause) 
 NL: We out of here? 
 EH: Well, I feel 93 years old,,but I hope to one day feel as youngnas the person I'm sitting across from. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,the incomparable Norman Lear. 
 (Applause) 
 NL: Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 I went down,to St. James Infirmary 
 To see my baby there 
 She was lying on a long wooden table 
 So cold, so still, so fair 
 I went up to see the doctor 
 "She's very low," he said 
 I went back to see my baby 
 Good God,she's lying there dead 
 I went down to old Joe's bar room 
 On the corner of the square 
 They were serving drinks as per usual 
 And the usual crowd was there 
 To my left stood Old Joe McKennedy 
 His eyes were bloodshot red 
 He turned to the crowd around him 
 And these are the words he said 
 "Let her go, let her go, God bless her 
 Wherever she may be 
 She can searchnthis whole wide world all over 
 But she'll never find another man like me 
 She can searchnthis whole wide world all over 
 And she'll never find,another man,like me 
 When I die, please God, bury me 
 In my ten-dollar Stetson hat 
 Put a twenty-dollar gold piecenon my watch chain 
 So my friends know I died standing pat 
 Get six gamblers to carry my coffin 
 And six choir girls to sing me a song 
 Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon 
 To raise hell as I go along 
 Now that's the end of my story 
 Let's have another round of booze 
 And if anyone should ask you 
 Just tell them I got,the St. James Infirmary,blues 
 (Applause)Extraordinary claimsnrequire extraordinary evidence,,and it is my job,nmy responsibility, as an astronomer,to remind people that alien hypothesesnshould always be a last resort. 
 Now, I want to tell youna story about that.,It involves data from a NASA mission,,ordinary people and one of the mostnextraordinary stars in our galaxy. 
 It began in 2009 with the launchnof NASA's Kepler mission.,Kepler's main scientific objective,was to find planetsnoutside of our solar system.,It did this by staringnat a single field in the sky,,this one, with all the tiny boxes.,And in this one field,,it monitored the brightnessnof over 150,000 stars,continuously for four years,,taking a data point every 30 minutes.,It was looking for whatnastronomers call a transit.,This is when the planet's orbitnis aligned in our line of sight,,just so that the planetncrosses in front of a star.,And when this happens,nit blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,,which you can see as a dip in this curve. 
 And so the team at NASAnhad developed very sophisticated computers,to search for transitsnin all the Kepler data. 
 At the same timenof the first data release,,astronomers at Yalenwere wondering an interesting thing:,What if computers missed something? 
 And so we launched the citizennscience project called Planet Hunters,to have people look at the same data.,The human brain has an amazing abilitynfor pattern recognition,,sometimes even better than a computer.,However, there was a lotnof skepticism around this.,My colleague, Debra Fischer,nfounder of the Planet Hunters project,,said that people at the time were saying,,"You're crazy. There's no waynthat a computer will miss a signal.",And so it was on, the classicnhuman versus machine gamble.,And if we found one planet,nwe would be thrilled.,When I joined the team four years ago,,we had already found a couple.,And today, with the helpnof over 300,000 science enthusiasts,,we have found dozens,,and we've also foundnone of the most mysterious stars,in our galaxy. 
 So to understand this,,let me show you what a normal transitnin Kepler data looks like.,On this graph on the left-hand sidenyou have the amount of light,,and on the bottom is time.,The white linenis light just from the star,,what astronomers call a light curve.,Now, when a planet transits a star,nit blocks out a little bit of this light,,and the depth of this transitnreflects the size of the object itself.,And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.,Planets don't getnmuch bigger than Jupiter.,Jupiter will make a one percent dropnin a star's brightness.,Earth, on the other hand,nis 11 times smaller than Jupiter,,and the signalnis barely visible in the data. 
 So back to our mystery.,A few years ago, Planet Hunters werensifting through data looking for transits,,and they spotted a mysterious signalncoming from the star KIC 8462852.,The observations in May of 2009nwere the first they spotted,,and they started talking about thisnin the discussion forums. 
 They said and object like Jupiter,would make a drop like thisnin the star's light,,but they were also saying it was giant.,You see, transits normallynonly last for a few hours,,and this one lasted for almost a week. 
 They were also sayingnthat it looks asymmetric,,meaning that instead of the clean,nU-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,,it had this strange slopenthat you can see on the left side.,This seemed to indicate,that whatever was getting in the waynand blocking the starlight,was not circular like a planet.,There are few more dips that happened,,but for a couple of years,nit was pretty quiet. 
 And then in March of 2011, we see this.,The star's light dropsnby a whole 15 percent,,and this is huge compared to a planet,,which would only make a one percent drop.,We described this featurenas both smooth and clean.,It also is asymmetric,,having a gradual dimmingnthat lasts almost a week,,and then it snaps right back up to normalnin just a matter of days. 
 And again, after this, not much happens,until February of 2013.,Things start to get really crazy.,There is a huge complex of dipsnin the light curve that appear,,and they last for like a hundred days,,all the way upninto the Kepler mission's end.,These dips have variable shapes.,Some are very sharp, and some are broad,,and they also have variable durations.,Some last just for a day or two,nand some for more than a week.,And there's also up and down trendsnwithin some of these dips,,almost like several independent eventsnwere superimposed on top of each other.,And at this time, this star dropsnin its brightness over 20 percent.,This means that whatevernis blocking its light,has an area of over 1,000 timesnthe area of our planet Earth. 
 This is truly remarkable.,And so the citizen scientists,nwhen they saw this,,they notified the science teamnthat they found something weird enough,that it might be worth following up.,And so when the science team looked at it,,we're like, "Yeah, there's probablynjust something wrong with the data.",But we looked really, really, really hard,,and the data were good.,And so what was happeningnhad to be astrophysical,,meaning that something in spacenwas getting in the way,and blocking starlight.,And so at this point,,we set out to learnneverything we could about the star,to see if we could find any cluesnto what was going on.,And the citizen scientistsnwho helped us in this discovery,,they joined along for the ride,watching science in action firsthand. 
 First, somebody said, you know,nwhat if this star was very young,and it still had the cloud of materialnit was born from surrounding it.,And then somebody else said,,well, what if the starnhad already formed planets,,and two of these planets had collided,,similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.,Well, both of these theoriesncould explain part of the data,,but the difficulties were that the starnshowed no signs of being young,,and there was no glownfrom any of the material,that was heated up by the star's light,,and you would expect thisnif the star was young,or if there was a collisionnand a lot of dust was produced.,And so somebody else said,,well, how about a huge swarm of comets,that are passing by this starnin a very elliptical orbit?,Well, it ends up that this is actuallynconsistent with our observations.,But I agree, it does feelna little contrived.,You see, it would take hundreds of comets,to reproduce what we're observing.,And these are only the comets,that happen to passnbetween us and the star.,And so in reality, we're talkingnthousands to tens of thousands of comets.,But of all the bad ideas we had,,this one was the best.,And so we went aheadnand published our findings. 
 Now, let me tell you, this was onenof the hardest papers I ever wrote.,Scientists are meant to publish results,,and this situation was far from that.,And so we decidednto give it a catchy title,,and we called it: "Where's The Flux?",I will let you work out the acronym. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this isn't the end of the story.,Around the same timenI was writing this paper,,I met with a colleaguenof mine, Jason Wright,,and he was also writing a papernon Kepler data.,And he was saying that with Kepler'snextreme precision,,it could actually detectnalien megastructures around stars,,but it didn't.,And then I showed him this weird datanthat our citizen scientists had found,,and he said to me,,"Aw crap, Tabby.,Now I have to rewrite my paper." 
 So yes, the naturalnexplanations were weak,,and we were curious now.,So we had to find a waynto rule out aliens.,So together, we convincedna colleague of ours,who works on SETI, the Searchnfor Extraterrestrial Intelligence,,that this would benan extraordinary target to pursue.,We wrote a proposal to observe the star,with the world's largest radio telescopenat the Green Bank Observatory. 
 A couple months later,,news of this proposalngot leaked to the press,and now there are thousands of articles,,over 10,000 articles, on this star alone.,And if you search Google Images,,this is what you'll find. 
 Now, you may be wondering,nOK, Tabby, well,,how do aliens actually explainnthis light curve?,OK, well, imagine a civilizationnthat's much more advanced than our own.,In this hypothetical circumstance,,this civilization would have exhaustednthe energy supply of their home planet,,so where could they get more energy?,Well, they have a host starnjust like we have a sun,,and so if they were ablento capture more energy from this star,,then that would solve their energy needs.,So they would gonand build huge structures.,These giant megastructures,,like ginormous solar panels,nare called Dyson spheres. 
 This image above,are lots of artists' impressionsnof Dyson spheres.,It's really hard to provide perspectivenon the vastness of these things,,but you can think of it this way.,The Earth-Moon distancenis a quarter of a million miles.,The simplest elementnon one of these structures,is 100 times that size.,They're enormous.,And now imagine one of these structuresnin motion around a star.,You can see how it would producenanomalies in the data,such as uneven, unnatural looking dips. 
 But it remains that evennalien megastructures,cannot defy the laws of physics.,You see, anything that usesna lot of energy,is going to produce heat,,and we don't observe this.,But it could be something as simple,as they're just reradiating it awaynin another direction,,just not at Earth. 
 Another idea that's onenof my personal favorites,is that we had just witnessednan interplanetary space battle,and the catastrophicndestruction of a planet.,Now, I admit that thisnwould produce a lot of dust,that we don't observe.,But if we're already invoking aliensnin this explanation,,then who is to say they didn'tnefficiently clean up all this mess,for recycling purposes? 
 (Laughter) 
 You can see how this quicklyncaptures your imagination. 
 Well, there you have it.,We're in a situation that could unfold,to be a natural phenomenonnwe don't understand,or an alien technologynwe don't understand.,Personally, as a scientist,nmy money is on the natural explanation.,But don't get me wrong, I do thinknit would be awesome to find aliens.,Either way, there is something newnand really interesting to discover. 
 So what happens next?,We need to continue to observe this star,to learn more about what's happening.,But professional astronomers, like me,,we have limited resourcesnfor this kind of thing,,and Kepler is on to a different mission. 
 And I'm happy to say that once again,,citizen scientists have come innand saved the day.,You see, this time,,amateur astronomersnwith their backyard telescopes,stepped up immediatelynand started observing this star nightly,at their own facilities,,and I am so excited to see what they find. 
 What's amazing to me is that this starnwould have never been found by computers,because we just weren't lookingnfor something like this.,And what's more exciting,is that there's more data to come.,There are new missions that are coming up,that are observing millions more stars,all over the sky. 
 And just think: What will it meannwhen we find another star like this?,And what will it meannif we don't find another star like this? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So in college,,I was a government major,,which means I had to writena lot of papers.,Now, when a normal student writes a paper,,they might spread the work outna little like this.,So, you know -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you get started maybe a little slowly,,but you get enough done in the first week,that, with some heavier days later on,,everything gets done, things stay civil. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I would want to do that like that.,That would be the plan.,I would have it all ready to go,,but then, actually, the papernwould come along,,and then I would kind of do this. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that would happen every single paper. 
 But then came my 90-page senior thesis,,a paper you're supposednto spend a year on.,And I knew for a paper like that,nmy normal work flow was not an option.,It was way too big a project.,So I planned things out,,and I decided I kind of hadnto go something like this.,This is how the year would go.,So I'd start off light,,and I'd bump it up in the middle months,,and then at the end,nI would kick it up into high gear,just like a little staircase.,How hard could it bento walk up the stairs?,No big deal, right? 
 But then, the funniest thing happened.,Those first few months?,They came and went,,and I couldn't quite do stuff.,So we had an awesome new revised plan. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But then those middle monthsnactually went by,,and I didn't really write words,,and so we were here.,And then two months turned into one month,,which turned into two weeks.,And one day I woke up,with three days until the deadline,,still not having written a word,,and so I did the only thing I could:,I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,,pulling not one but two all-nighters --,humans are not supposed to pullntwo all-nighters --,sprinted across campus,,dove in slow motion,,and got it in just at the deadline. 
 I thought that was the end of everything.,But a week later I get a call,,and it's the school.,And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?",And I say, "Yeah.",And they say, "We neednto talk about your thesis.",And I say, "OK.",And they say,,"It's the best one we've ever seen." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 That did not happen. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was a very, very bad thesis. 
 (Laughter) 
 I just wanted to enjoy that one momentnwhen all of you thought,,"This guy is amazing!" 
 (Laughter) 
 No, no, it was very, very bad.,Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.,I write the blog Wait But Why.,And a couple of years ago,nI decided to write about procrastination.,My behavior has always perplexednthe non-procrastinators around me,,and I wanted to explainnto the non-procrastinators of the world,what goes on in the headsnof procrastinators,,and why we are the way we are.,Now, I had a hypothesis,that the brains of procrastinatorsnwere actually different,than the brains of other people.,And to test this, I found an MRI lab,that actually let me scan both my brain,and the brain of a provennnon-procrastinator,,so I could compare them.,I actually brought them herento show you today.,I want you to take a look carefullynto see if you can notice a difference.,I know that if you're notna trained brain expert,,it's not that obvious,nbut just take a look, OK?,So here's the brainnof a non-procrastinator. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now ...,here's my brain. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is a difference.,Both brains have a RationalnDecision-Maker in them,,but the procrastinator's brain,also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.,Now, what does this meannfor the procrastinator?,Well, it means everything's finenuntil this happens. 
 [This is a perfect timento get some work done.] [Nope!] 
 So the Rational Decision-Makernwill make the rational decision,to do something productive,,but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,,so he actually takes the wheel,,and he says, "Actually, let's readnthe entire Wikipedia page,of the Nancy Kerrigan/nTonya Harding scandal,,because I just rememberednthat that happened. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Then we're going to go over to the fridge,,to see if there's anything newnin there since 10 minutes ago.,After that, we're going to gonon a YouTube spiral,that starts with videosnof Richard Feynman talking about magnets,and ends much, much laternwith us watching interviews,with Justin Bieber's mom. 
 (Laughter) 
 "All of that's going to take a while,,so we're not going to really have roomnon the schedule for any work today.,Sorry!" 
 (Sigh) 
 Now, what is going on here?,The Instant Gratification Monkeyndoes not seem like a guy,you want behind the wheel.,He lives entirely in the present moment.,He has no memory of the past,nno knowledge of the future,,and he only cares about two things:,easy and fun. 
 Now, in the animal world, that works fine.,If you're a dog,and you spend your whole life doingnnothing other than easy and fun things,,you're a huge success! 
 (Laughter) 
 And to the Monkey,,humans are just another animal species.,You have to keep well-slept, well-fednand propagating into the next generation,,which in tribal timesnmight have worked OK.,But, if you haven't noticed,nnow we're not in tribal times.,We're in an advanced civilization,nand the Monkey does not know what that is.,Which is why we havenanother guy in our brain,,the Rational Decision-Maker,,who gives us the ability to do thingsnno other animal can do.,We can visualize the future.,We can see the big picture.,We can make long-term plans.,And he wants to takenall of that into account.,And he wants to just have us do,whatever makes sensento be doing right now.,Now, sometimes it makes sense,to be doing things that are easy and fun,,like when you're having dinnernor going to bed,or enjoying well-earned leisure time.,That's why there's an overlap.,Sometimes they agree.,But other times, it makes much more sense,to be doing things that are hardernand less pleasant,,for the sake of the big picture.,And that's when we have a conflict.,And for the procrastinator,,that conflict tends to endna certain way every time,,leaving him spending a lot of timenin this orange zone,,an easy and fun place that's entirelynout of the Makes Sense circle.,I call it the Dark Playground. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the Dark Playground is a place,that all of you procrastinatorsnout there know very well.,It's where leisure activities happen,at times when leisure activitiesnare not supposed to be happening.,The fun you have in the Dark Playground,isn't actually fun,nbecause it's completely unearned,,and the air is filled with guilt,ndread, anxiety, self-hatred --,all of those good procrastinator feelings.,And the question is, in this situation,nwith the Monkey behind the wheel,,how does the procrastinator ever getnhimself over here to this blue zone,,a less pleasant place, but wherenreally important things happen? 
 Well, turns out the procrastinatornhas a guardian angel,,someone who's always lookingndown on him and watching over him,in his darkest moments --,someone called the Panic Monster. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the Panic Monsternis dormant most of the time,,but he suddenly wakes upnanytime a deadline gets too close,or there's danger of public embarrassment,,a career disaster or some othernscary consequence.,And importantly, he's the only thingnthe Monkey is terrified of.,Now, he became very relevantnin my life pretty recently,,because the people of TEDnreached out to me about six months ago,and invited me to do a TED Talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, of course, I said yes.,It's always been a dream of minento have done a TED Talk in the past. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause),But in the middle of all this excitement,,the Rational Decision-Maker seemednto have something else on his mind.,He was saying, "Are we clearnon what we just accepted?,Do we get what's going to be nownhappening one day in the future?,We need to sit downnand work on this right now.",And the Monkey said, "Totally agree,nbut let's just open Google Earth,and zoom in to the bottom of India,nlike 200 feet above the ground,,and scroll up for two and a half hoursntil we get to the top of the country,,so we can get a better feel for India." 
 (Laughter) 
 So that's what we did that day. 
 (Laughter) 
 As six months turned into fournand then two and then one,,the people of TED decidednto release the speakers.,And I opened up the website,nand there was my face,staring right back at me.,And guess who woke up? 
 (Laughter) 
 So the Panic Monsternstarts losing his mind,,and a few seconds later,nthe whole system's in mayhem. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the Monkey -- remember,nhe's terrified of the Panic Monster --,boom, he's up the tree!,And finally,,finally, the Rational Decision-Makerncan take the wheel,and I can start working on the talk. 
 Now, the Panic Monster explains,all kinds of pretty insanenprocrastinator behavior,,like how someone like mencould spend two weeks,unable to start the openingnsentence of a paper,,and then miraculously findnthe unbelievable work ethic,to stay up all nightnand write eight pages.,And this entire situation,nwith the three characters --,this is the procrastinator's system.,It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.,This is what I decided to write aboutnon the blog a couple of years ago. 
 When I did, I was amazed by the response.,Literally thousands of emails came in,,from all different kinds of peoplenfrom all over the world,,doing all different kinds of things.,These are people who were nurses,nbankers, painters, engineers,and lots and lots of PhD students. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they were all writing,nsaying the same thing:,"I have this problem too.",But what struck me was the contrastnbetween the light tone of the post,and the heaviness of these emails.,These people were writingnwith intense frustration,about what procrastinationnhad done to their lives,,about what this Monkey had done to them.,And I thought about this, and I said,,well, if the procrastinator's systemnworks, then what's going on?,Why are all of these peoplenin such a dark place? 
 Well, it turns out that there'sntwo kinds of procrastination.,Everything I've talked about today,nthe examples I've given,,they all have deadlines.,And when there's deadlines,,the effects of procrastinationnare contained to the short term,because the Panic Monster gets involved.,But there's a second kindnof procrastination,that happens in situationsnwhen there is no deadline.,So if you wanted a careernwhere you're a self-starter --,something in the arts,nsomething entrepreneurial --,there's no deadlines on those thingsnat first, because nothing's happening,,not until you've gone outnand done the hard work,to get momentum, get things going.,There's also all kinds of important thingsnoutside of your career,that don't involve any deadlines,,like seeing your family or exercisingnand taking care of your health,,working on your relationship,or getting out of a relationshipnthat isn't working. 
 Now if the procrastinator's only mechanismnof doing these hard things,is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,,because in all of thesennon-deadline situations,,the Panic Monster doesn't show up.,He has nothing to wake up for,,so the effects of procrastination,nthey're not contained;,they just extend outward forever.,And it's this long-termnkind of procrastination,that's much less visiblenand much less talked about,than the funnier, short-termndeadline-based kind.,It's usually sufferednquietly and privately.,And it can be the source,of a huge amount of long-termnunhappiness, and regrets.,And I thought, that's whynthose people are emailing,,and that's why they'renin such a bad place.,It's not that they're crammingnfor some project.,It's that long-term procrastinationnhas made them feel like a spectator,,at times, in their own lives.,The frustration is notnthat they couldn't achieve their dreams;,it's that they weren't evennable to start chasing them. 
 So I read these emailsnand I had a little bit of an epiphany --,that I don't thinknnon-procrastinators exist.,That's right -- I think all of younare procrastinators.,Now, you might not all be a mess,,like some of us, 
 (Laughter) 
 and some of you may havena healthy relationship with deadlines,,but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick,is when the deadlines aren't there. 
 Now, I want to show you one last thing.,I call this a Life Calendar.,That's one box for every weeknof a 90-year life.,That's not that many boxes,,especially since we've alreadynused a bunch of those.,So I think we need to all take a long,nhard look at that calendar.,We need to think about whatnwe're really procrastinating on,,because everyone is procrastinatingnon something in life.,We need to stay awarenof the Instant Gratification Monkey.,That's a job for all of us.,And because there's notnthat many boxes on there,,it's a job that shouldnprobably start today. 
 Well, maybe not today, but ... 
 (Laughter) 
 You know.,Sometime soon. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Once there was a star.,Like everything else, she was born;,grew to be around 30 timesnthe mass of our sun,and lived for a very long time.,Exactly how long,,people cannot really tell.,Just like everything in life,,she reached the endnof her regular star days,when her heart, the core of her life,,exhausted its fuel.,But that was no end. 
 She transformed into a supernova,nand in the process,releasing a tremendous amount of energy,,outshining the rest of the galaxy,and emitting, in one second,,the same amount of energynour sun will release in 10 days.,And she evolvedninto another role in our galaxy. 
 Supernova explosions are very extreme.,But the ones that emit gamma raysnare even more extreme.,In the process of becoming a supernova,,the interior of the star collapsesnunder its own weight,and it starts rotating ever faster,,like an ice skater when pullingntheir arms in close to their body.,In that way, it starts rotating very fastnand it increases, powerfully,,its magnetic field.,The matter around the starnis dragged around,,and some energy from that rotationnis transferred to that matter,and the magnetic fieldnis increased even further.,In that way, our star had extra energynto outshine the rest of the galaxy,in brightness and gamma ray emission. 
 My star, the one in my story,,became what is known as a magnetar.,And just for your information,,the magnetic field of a magnetarnis 1,000 trillion times,the magnetic field of Earth.,The most energetic eventsnever measured by astronomers,carry the name gamma-ray bursts,because we observe themnas bursts most or explosions,,most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.,Our star, like the one in our storynthat became a magnetar,,is detected as a gamma-ray burst,during the most energeticnportion of the explosion.,Yet, even though gamma-ray burstsnare the strongest events,ever measured by astronomers,,we cannot see them with our naked eye.,We depend, we rely on other methods,in order to study this gamma-ray light.,We cannot see them with our naked eye.,We can only seenan itty bitty, tiny portion,of the electromagnetic spectrumnthat we call visible light.,And beyond that, we rely on other methods. 
 Yet as astronomers,nwe study a wider range of light,and we depend on other methods to do that.,On the screen, it may look like this.,You're seeing a plot.,That is a light curve.,It's a plot of intensitynof light over time.,It is a gamma-ray light curve.,Sighted astronomersndepend on this kind of plot,in order to interpret hownthis light intensity changes over time.,On the left, you will be seeingnthe light intensity without a burst,,and on the right, you will be seeingnthe light intensity with the burst. 
 Early during my career,nI could also see this kind of plot.,But then, I lost my sight.,I completely lost my sightnbecause of extended illness,,and with it, I lostnthe opportunity to see this plot,and the opportunity to do my physics.,It was a very strong transitionnfor me in many ways.,And professionally, it left menwithout a way to do my science.,I longed to access and scrutinizenthis energetic light,and figure out the astrophysical cause.,I wanted to experiencenthe spacious wonder, the excitement,,the joy produced by the detectionnof such a titanic celestial event. 
 I thought long and hard about it,,when I suddenly realizednthat all a light curve is,,is a table of numbersnconverted into a visual plot.,So along with my collaborators,,we worked really hard and we translatednthe numbers into sound.,I achieved access to the data,,and today I'm able to do physicsnat the level of the best astronomer,,using sound.,And what people have been able to do,,mainly visually,,for hundreds of years,,now I do it using sound. 
 (Applause),Listening to this gamma-ray burst,that you're seeing on the --n(Applause continues) 
 Thank you. 
 Listening to this burstnthat you're seeing on the screen,brought something to the earnbeyond the obvious burst.,Now I'm going to play the burst for you.,It's not music, it's sound. 
 (Digital beeping sounds) 
 This is scientific datanconverted into sound,,and it's mapped in pitch.,The process is called sonification. 
 So listening to thisnbrought something to the ear,besides the obvious burst.,When I examine the very strongnlow-frequency regions,,or bass line -- I'm zoomingninto the bass line now.,We noted resonances characteristicnof electrically charged gasses,like the solar wind.,And I want you to hear what I heard.,You will hear it as a very fastndecrease in volume.,And because you're sighted,nI'm giving you a red line,indicating what intensity of lightnis being converted into sound. 
 (Digital hum and whistling sound) 
 The (Whistles) is frogs at home,ndon't pay attention to that. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Digital hum and whistling sound) 
 I think you heard it, right? 
 So what we found,is that the bursts last long enoughnin order to support wave resonances,,which are things caused by exchangesnof energy between particles,that may have been excited,,that depend on the volume.,You may remember that I saidnthat the matter around the star,is dragged around?,It transmits power with frequencynand field distribution,determined by the dimensions.,You may remember that we were talkingnabout a super-massive star,that became a very strongnmagnetic field magnetar.,If this is the case, then outflowsnfrom the exploding star,may be associatednwith this gamma-ray burst. 
 What does that mean?,That star formationnmay be a very important part,of these supernova explosions.,Listening to this very gamma-ray burstnbrought us to the notion,that the use of soundnas an adjunctive visual display,may also support sighted astronomers,in the search for moreninformation in the data.,Simultaneously, I worked on analyzingnmeasurements from other telescopes,,and my experiments demonstrated,that when you use soundnas an adjunctive visual display,,astronomers can find more information,in this now more accessible data set.,This ability to transform data into sound,gives astronomy a tremendousnpower of transformation.,And the fact that a fieldnthat is so visual may be improved,in order to include anyone with interestnin understanding what lies in the heavens,is a spirit-lifter. 
 When I lost my sight,,I noticed that I didn't have access,to the same amountnand quality of information,a sighted astronomer had.,It was not until we innovatednwith the sonification process,that I regained the hopento be a productive member of the field,that I had worked so hard to be part of. 
 Yet, information accessnis not the only area in astronomy,where this is important.,The situation is systemic,and scientific fields are not keeping up.,The body is something changeable --,anyone may developna disability at any point.,Let's think about, for example,,scientists that are alreadynat the top of their careers.,What happens to themnif they develop a disability?,Will they feel excommunicated as I did?,Information accessnempowers us to flourish.,It gives us equal opportunitiesnto display our talents,and choose what we wantnto do with our lives,,based on interest and not basednon potential barriers.,When we give people the opportunitynto succeed without limits,,that will lead to personal fulfillmentnand prospering life.,And I think that the usenof sound in astronomy,is helping us to achieve thatnand to contribute to science. 
 While other countries told menthat the study of perception techniques,in order to study astronomy datanis not relevant to astronomy,because there are no blindnastronomers in the field,,South Africa said, "We wantnpeople with disabilities,to contribute to the field.",Right now, I'm working,at the South AfricannAstronomical Observatory,,at the Office of Astronomynfor Development.,There, we are working on sonificationntechniques and analysis methods,to impact the studentsnof the Athlone School for the Blind.,These students will be learningnradio astronomy,,and they will be learningnthe sonification methods,in order to study astronomical eventsnlike huge ejections of energy,from the sun, known asncoronal mass ejections.,What we learn with these students --,these students have multiple disabilitiesnand coping strategies,that will be accommodated --,what we learn with these studentsnwill directly impact,the way things are being donenat the professional level.,I humbly call this development.,And this is happening right now. 
 I think that science is for everyone.,It belongs to the people,,and it has to be available to everyone,,because we are all natural explorers.,I think that if we limit peoplenwith disabilities,from participating in science,,we'll sever our links with historynand with society.,I dream of a levelnscientific playing field,,where people encourage respectnand respect each other,,where people exchange strategiesnand discover together.,If people with disabilitiesnare allowed into the scientific field,,an explosion, a huge titanic burstnof knowledge will take place,,I am sure. 
 (Digital beeping sounds) 
 That is the titanic burst. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was excited to be a partnof the "Dream" theme,,and then I found out I'm leading offnthe "Nightmare?" section of it. 
 (Laughter) 
 And certainly there are thingsnabout the climate crisis that qualify.,And I have some bad news,,but I have a lot more good news.,I'm going to propose three questions,and the answer to the first one,necessarily involves a little bad news.,But -- hang on, because the answersnto the second and third questions,really are very positive. 
 So the first question is,n"Do we really have to change?",And of course, the Apollo Mission,namong other things,changed the environmental movement,,really launched the modernnenvironmental movement.,18 months after this Earthrise picturenwas first seen on earth,,the first Earth Day was organized.,And we learned a lot about ourselves,looking back at our planet from space.,And one of the things that we learned,confirmed what the scientistsnhave long told us.,One of the most essential facts,about the climate crisisnhas to do with the sky.,As this picture illustrates,,the sky is not the vastnand limitless expanse,that appears when we look upnfrom the ground.,It is a very thin shell of atmosphere,surrounding the planet.,That right now is the open sewernfor our industrial civilization,as it's currently organized.,We are spewing 110 million tons,of heat-trapping global warming pollutionninto it every 24 hours,,free of charge, go ahead. 
 And there are many sourcesnof the greenhouse gases,,I'm certainly not goingnto go through them all.,I'm going to focus on the main one,,but agriculture is involved,ndiet is involved, population is involved.,Management of forests, transportation,,the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.,But I'm going to focusnon the heart of the problem,,which is the fact that we still relynon dirty, carbon-based fuels,for 85 percent of all the energynthat our world burns every year.,And you can see from this imagenthat after World War II,,the emission ratesnstarted really accelerating.,And the accumulated amountnof man-made, global warming pollution,that is up in the atmosphere now,traps as much extra heat energynas would be released,by 400,000 Hiroshima-classnatomic bombs exploding,every 24 hours, 365 days a year.,Fact-checked over and over again,,conservative, it's the truth.,Now it's a big planet, but -- 
 (Explosion sound) 
 that is a lot of energy,,particularly when you multiply itn400,000 times per day.,And all that extra heat energy,is heating up the atmosphere,nthe whole earth system. 
 Let's look at the atmosphere.,This is a depiction,of what we used to think of asnthe normal distribution of temperatures.,The white representsnnormal temperature days;,1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.,The blue are cooler than average days,,the red are warmer than average days.,But the entire curve has movednto the right in the 1980s.,And you'll seenin the lower right-hand corner,the appearance of statisticallynsignificant numbers,of extremely hot days.,In the 90s, the curve shifted further.,And in the last 10 years,nyou see the extremely hot days,are now more numerousnthan the cooler than average days.,In fact, they are 150 times more commonnon the surface of the earth,than they were just 30 years ago. 
 So we're havingnrecord-breaking temperatures.,Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest yearsnever measured with instruments,have been in this young century.,The hottest of all was last year.,Last month was the 371st month in a row,warmer than the 20th-century average.,And for the first time,nnot only the warmest January,,but for the first time, it was morenthan two degrees Fahrenheit warmer,than the average.,These higher temperaturesnare having an effect on animals,,plants, people, ecosystems. 
 But on a global basis, 93 percentnof all the extra heat energy,is trapped in the oceans.,And the scientists can measurenthe heat buildup,much more precisely now,at all depths: deep, mid-ocean,,the first few hundred meters.,And this, too, is accelerating.,It goes back more than a century.,And more than half of the increasenhas been in the last 19 years.,This has consequences. 
 The first order of consequence:,the ocean-based storms get stronger.,Super Typhoon Haiyannwent over areas of the Pacific,five and a half degrees Fahrenheitnwarmer than normal,before it slammed into Tacloban,,as the most destructive stormnever to make landfall.,Pope Francis, who has madensuch a difference to this whole issue,,visited Tacloban right after that.,Superstorm Sandy went overnareas of the Atlantic,nine degrees warmer than normal,before slamming intonNew York and New Jersey.,The second order of consequencesnare affecting all of us right now.,The warmer oceans are evaporatingnmuch more water vapor into the skies.,Average humidity worldwidenhas gone up four percent.,And it creates these atmospheric rivers.,The Brazilian scientistsncall them "flying rivers.",And they funnel all of thatnextra water vapor over the land,where storm conditions triggernthese massive record-breaking downpours.,This is from Montana.,Take a look at this storm last August.,As it moves over Tucson, Arizona.,It literally splashes off the city.,These downpours are really unusual. 
 Last July in Houston, Texas,,it rained for two days,n162 billion gallons.,That represents more than two daysnof the full flow of Niagara Falls,in the middle of the city,,which was, of course, paralyzed.,These record downpours are creatingnhistoric floods and mudslides. 
 This one is from Chile last year.,And you'll see that warehouse going by.,There are oil tankers cars going by.,This is from Spain last September,,you could call this the runningnof the cars and trucks, I guess.,Every night on the TV news nownis like a nature hike,through the Book of Revelation. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, really. 
 The insurance industrynhas certainly noticed,,the losses have been mounting up.,They're not under any illusionsnabout what's happening.,And the causality requiresna moment of discussion.,We're used to thinking of linear causenand linear effect --,one cause, one effect.,This is systemic causation.,As the great Kevin Trenberth says,,"All storms are different now.,There's so much extra energynin the atmosphere,,there's so much extra water vapor.,Every storm is different now.",So, the same extra heat pullsnthe soil moisture out of the ground,and causes these deeper, longer,nmore pervasive droughts,and many of them are underway right now. 
 It dries out the vegetation,and causes more firesnin the western part of North America.,There's certainly been evidencenof that, a lot of them. 
 More lightning,,as the heat energy builds up,nthere's a considerable amount,of additional lightning also. 
 These climate-related disasters also havengeopolitical consequences,and create instability.,The climate-related historic droughtnthat started in Syria in 2006,destroyed 60 percentnof the farms in Syria,,killed 80 percent of the livestock,,and drove 1.5 million climate refugeesninto the cities of Syria,,where they collided with anothern1.5 million refugees,from the Iraq War.,And along with other factors,nthat opened the gates of Hell,that people are trying to close now.,The US Defense Department has long warned,of consequences from the climate crisis,,including refugees,nfood and water shortages,and pandemic disease. 
 Right now we're seeing microbial diseasesnfrom the tropics spread,to the higher latitudes;,the transportation revolution has hadna lot to do with this.,But the changing conditionsnchange the latitudes and the areas,where these microbial diseasesncan become endemic,and change the range of the vectors,nlike mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.,The Zika epidemic now --,we're better positioned in North America,because it's still a little too coolnand we have a better public health system.,But when women in some regionsnof South and Central America,are advised not to get pregnantnfor two years --,that's something new,nthat ought to get our attention.,The Lancet, one of the two greatestnmedical journals in the world,,last summer labeled thisna medical emergency now.,And there are many factors because of it. 
 This is also connectednto the extinction crisis.,We're in danger of losing 50 percentnof all the living species on earth,by the end of this century.,And already, land-based plants and animals,are now moving towards the poles,at an average rate of 15 feet per day. 
 Speaking of the North Pole,,last December 29, the same stormnthat caused historic flooding,in the American Midwest,,raised temperatures at the North Pole,50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,,causing the thawing of the North Pole,in the middle of the long,ndark, winter, polar night.,And when the land-based icenof the Arctic melts,,it raises sea level. 
 Paul Nicklen's beautiful photographnfrom Svalbard illustrates this.,It's more dangerous coming off Greenland,and particularly, Antarctica.,The 10 largest risk citiesnfor sea-level rise by population,are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.,When you measure it by assets at risk,nnumber one is Miami:,three and a half trillion dollars at risk.,Number three: New York and Newark.,I was in Miami last fallnduring the supermoon,,one of the highest high-tide days.,And there were fish from the oceannswimming in some of the streets,of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale,and Del Rey.,And this happens regularlynduring the highest-tide tides now.,Not with rain -- they call itn"sunny-day flooding.",It comes up through the storm sewers.,And the Mayor of Miaminspeaks for many when he says,it is long past time this can be viewednthrough a partisan lens.,This is a crisisnthat's getting worse day by day.,We have to move beyond partisanship. 
 And I want to take a momentnto honor these House Republicans -- 
 (Applause) 
 who had the courage last fall,to step out and take a political risk,,by telling the truthnabout the climate crisis. 
 So the cost of the climatencrisis is mounting up,,there are many of these aspectsnI haven't even mentioned.,It's an enormous burden.,I'll mention just one more,,because the World Economic Forumnlast month in Davos,,after their annual surveynof 750 economists,,said the climate crisis is nownthe number one risk,to the global economy.,So you get central bankers,like Mark Carney, the headnof the UK Central Bank,,saying the vast majoritynof the carbon reserves are unburnable.,Subprime carbon.,I'm not going to remind you what happenednwith subprime mortgages,,but it's the same thing.,If you look at all of the carbon fuelsnthat were burned,since the beginningnof the industrial revolution,,this is the quantity burnednin the last 16 years.,Here are all the ones that are provennand left on the books,,28 trillion dollars.,The International Energy Agencynsays only this amount can be burned.,So the rest, 22 trillion dollars --,unburnable.,Risk to the global economy.,That's why divestment movementnmakes practical sense,and is not just a moral imperative. 
 So the answer to the first question,n"Must we change?",is yes, we have to change.,Second question, "Can we change?",This is the exciting news!,The best projectionsnin the world 16 years ago,were that by 2010, the worldnwould be able to install,30 gigawatts of wind capacity.,We beat that marknby 14 and a half times over.,We see an exponential curvenfor wind installations now.,We see the cost coming down dramatically.,Some countries -- take Germany,nan industrial powerhouse,with a climate not that differentnfrom Vancouver's, by the way --,one day last December,,got 81 percent of all its energynfrom renewable resources,,mainly solar and wind.,A lot of countries are gettingnmore than half on an average basis. 
 More good news:,energy storage,nfrom batteries particularly,,is now beginning to take off,because the cost has beenncoming down very dramatically,to solve the intermittency problem.,With solar, the news is evennmore exciting!,The best projections 14 years agonwere that we would install,one gigawatt per year by 2010.,When 2010 came around,nwe beat that mark by 17 times over.,Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.,This year, we're on tracknto beat it 68 times over. 
 We're going to win this.,We are going to prevail.,The exponential curve on solarnis even steeper and more dramatic.,When I came to this stage 10 years ago,,this is where it was.,We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough,in the emergencenof these exponential curves. 
 (Applause) 
 And the cost has come downn10 percent per year,for 30 years.,And it's continuing to come down. 
 Now, the business communitynhas certainly noticed this,,because it's crossingnthe grid parity point.,Cheaper solar penetration ratesnare beginning to rise.,Grid parity is understoodnas that line, that threshold,,below which renewable electricitynis cheaper than electricity,from burning fossil fuels.,That threshold is a little bitnlike the difference,between 32 degrees Fahrenheitnand 33 degrees Fahrenheit,,or zero and one Celsius.,It's a difference of more than one degree,,it's the difference between ice and water.,And it's the difference between marketsnthat are frozen up,,and liquid flows of capitalninto new opportunities for investment.,This is the biggestnnew business opportunity,in the history of the world,,and two-thirds of itnis in the private sector.,We are seeing an explosionnof new investment.,Starting in 2010, investments globallynin renewable electricity generation,surpassed fossils.,The gap has been growing ever since.,The projections for the futurenare even more dramatic,,even though fossil energynis now still subsidized,at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.,And by the way, if you addnthe projections for nuclear on here,,particularly if you assumenthat the work many are doing,to try to break through to safernand more acceptable,,more affordable forms of nuclear,,this could change even more dramatically. 
 So is there any precedentnfor such a rapid adoption,of a new technology?,Well, there are many,nbut let's look at cell phones.,In 1980, AT&T, then Ma Bell,,commissioned McKinsey to dona global market survey,of those clunky new mobile phonesnthat appeared then.,"How many can we sellnby the year 2000?" they asked.,McKinsey came back and said, "900,000.",And sure enough,nwhen the year 2000 arrived,,they did sell 900,000 --nin the first three days.,And for the balance of the year,nthey sold 120 times more.,And now there are more cell connectionsnthan there are people in the world. 
 So, why were they not only wrong,nbut way wrong?,I've asked that question myself, "Why?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think the answer is in three parts.,First, the cost came down much fasternthan anybody expected,,even as the quality went up.,And low-income countries, placesnthat did not have a landline grid --,they leap-frogged to the new technology.,The big expansion has beennin the developing counties.,So what about the electricity gridsnin the developing world?,Well, not so hot.,And in many areas, they don't exist.,There are more peoplenwithout any electricity at all in India,than the entire populationnof the United States of America.,So now we're getting this:,solar panels on grass huts,and new business modelsnthat make it affordable.,Muhammad Yunus financednthis one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.,This is a village market.,Bangladesh is now the fastest-deployingncountry in the world:,two systems per minutenon average, night and day.,And we have all we need:,enough energy from the Sunncomes to the earth,every hour to supply the full world'snenergy needs for an entire year.,It's actually a little bitnless than an hour.,So the answer to the second question,n"Can we change?",is clearly "Yes.",And it's an ever-firmer "yes." 
 Last question, "Will we change?",Paris really was a breakthrough,,some of the provisions are binding,and the regular reviews will matter a lot.,But nations aren't waiting,nthey're going ahead.,China has already announcednthat starting next year,,they're adopting a nationwidencap and trade system.,They will likely link upnwith the European Union.,The United Statesnhas already been changing.,All of these coal plants were proposed,in the next 10 years and canceled.,All of these existingncoal plants were retired.,All of these coal plants have hadntheir retirement announced.,All of them -- canceled.,We are moving forward.,Last year -- if you look atnall of the investment,in new electricity generationnin the United States,,almost three-quartersnwas from renewable energy,,mostly wind and solar. 
 We are solving this crisis.,The only question is:nhow long will it take to get there?,So, it matters that a lotnof people are organizing,to insist on this change.,Almost 400,000 peoplenmarched in New York City,before the UN special session on this.,Many thousands, tens of thousands,,marched in cities around the world.,And so, I am extremely optimistic.,As I said before,nwe are going to win this. 
 I'll finish with this story.,When I was 13 years old,,I heard that proposal by President Kennedy,to land a person on the Moonnand bring him back safely,in 10 years.,And I heard adultsnof that day and time say,,"That's reckless, expensive,nmay well fail.",But eight years and two months later,,in the moment that Neil Armstrongnset foot on the Moon,,there was great cheer that went upnin NASA's mission control in Houston.,Here's a little-known fact about that:,the average age of the systems engineers,,the controllers in the roomnthat day, was 26,,which means, among other things,,their age, when they heardnthat challenge, was 18. 
 We now have a moral challenge,that is in the tradition of othersnthat we have faced.,One of the greatest poetsnof the last century in the US,,Wallace Stevens,,wrote a line that has stayed with me:,"After the final 'no,'nthere comes a 'yes,',and on that 'yes',nthe future world depends.",When the abolitionistsnstarted their movement,,they met with no after no after no.,And then came a yes.,The Women's Suffragenand Women's Rights Movement,met endless no's, until finally,nthere was a yes.,The Civil Rights Movement,nthe movement against apartheid,,and more recently, the movementnfor gay and lesbian rights,here in the United States and elsewhere.,After the final "no" comes a "yes." 
 When any great moral challengenis ultimately resolved,into a binary choicenbetween what is right and what is wrong,,the outcome is fore-ordainednbecause of who we are as human beings.,Ninety-nine percent of us,nthat is where we are now,and it is why we're going to win this.,We have everything we need.,Some still doubt that we haventhe will to act,,but I say the will to act is itselfna renewable resource. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: You've got this incrediblencombination of skills.,You've got this scientist mindnthat can understand,the full range of issues,,and the ability to turn itninto the most vivid language.,No one else can do that,nthat's why you led this thing.,It was amazing to see it 10 years ago,nit was amazing to see it now. 
 Al Gore: Well, you're nicento say that, Chris.,But honestly, I have a lotnof really good friends,in the scientific communitynwho are incredibly patient,and who will sit therenand explain this stuff to me,over and over and over again,until I can get itninto simple enough language,that I can understand it.,And that's the key to tryingnto communicate. 
 CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying,,second part: incredibly hopeful.,How do we know that all those graphs,nall that progress, is enough,to solve what you showednin the first part? 
 AG: I think that the crossing --,you know, I've only beennin the business world for 15 years.,But one of the things I've learnednis that apparently it matters,if a new product or servicenis more expensive,than the incumbent, or cheaper than.,Turns out, it makes a differencenif it's cheaper than. 
 (Laughter) 
 And when it crosses that line,,then a lot of things really change.,We are regularly surprisednby these developments.,The late Rudi Dornbusch,nthe great economist said,,"Things take longer to happennthen you think they will,,and then they happen much fasternthan you thought they could.",I really think that's where we are.,Some people are using the phrasen"The Solar Singularity" now,,meaning when it getsnbelow the grid parity,,unsubsidized in most places,,then it's the default choice. 
 Now, in one of the presentationsnyesterday, the jitney thing,,there is an effort to usenregulations to slow this down.,And I just don't think it's going to work. 
 There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley,,who's the Chairmannof the Atlanta Tea Party.,They enlisted hernin this effort to put a tax,on solar panels and regulations.,And she had just putnsolar panels on her roof,and she didn't understand the request. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so she went and formednan alliance with the Sierra Club,and they formed a new organizationncalled the Green Tea Party. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And they defeated the proposal.,So, finally, the answernto your question is,,this sounds a little cornynand maybe it's a cliché,,but 10 years ago -- and Christiananreferred to this --,there are people in this audiencenwho played an incredibly significant role,in generating those exponential curves.,And it didn't work out economicallynfor some of them,,but it kick-startednthis global revolution.,And what people in this audience do now,with the knowledgenthat we are going to win this.,But it matters a lot how fast we win it. 
 CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.,If this turns out to be the year,,that the partisan thing changes,,as you said, it's no longerna partisan issue,,but you bring along peoplenfrom the other side together,,backed by science, backed by these kindsnof investment opportunities,,backed by reason that you win the day --,boy, that's really exciting. 
 Thank you so much. 
 AG: Thank you so muchnfor bringing me back to TED.,Thank you! 
 (Applause)The world is fillednwith incredible objects,and rich cultural heritage.,And when we get access to them,,we are blown away, we fall in love.,But most of the time,,the world's population is livingnwithout real access to arts and culture.,What might the connections benwhen we start exploring our heritage,,the beautiful locationsnand the art in this world? 
 Before we get startednin this presentation,,I just want to take carenof a few housekeeping points.,First, I am no expert in art or culture.,I fell into this by mistake,nbut I'm loving it.,Secondly, all of whatnI'm going to show you,belongs to the amazing museums,narchives and foundations,that we partner with.,None of this belongs to Google.,And finally, what you see behind me,is available right nownon your mobile phones,,on your laptops. 
 This is our current platform,nwhere you can explore,thousands of museumsnand objects at your fingertips,,in extremely high-definition detail.,The diversity of the contentnis what's amazing.,If we just had European paintings,,if we just had modern art,,I think it gets a bit boring.,For example, this month,nwe launched the "Black History" channel,with 82 curated exhibitions,,which talk about arts and culturenin that community.,We also have somenamazing objects from Japan,,centered around craftsmanship,ncalled "Made in Japan.",And one of my favorite exhibitions,,which actually is the idea of my talk,,is -- I didn't expect to becomena fan of Japanese dolls.,But I am, thanks to this exhibition,,that has really taught menabout the craftsmanship,behind the soul of a Japanese doll.,Trust me, it's very exciting.,Take my word for it. 
 So, moving on swiftly.,One quick thing I wantednto showcase in this platform,,which you can share with your kidsnand your friends right now,,is you can travel to all thesenamazing institutions virtually, as well.,One of our recent ideas was withnThe Guggenheim Museum in New York,,where you can get a tastenof what it might feel like,to actually be there.,You can go to the ground floor,and obviously, most of you,nI assume, have been there.,And you can see the architecturalnmasterpiece that it is.,But imagine this accessibilitynfor a kid in Bombay,who's studying architecture,,who hasn't had a chancento go to The Guggenheim as yet.,You can obviously look at objectsnin the Guggenheim Museum,,you can obviously get into themnand so on and so forth.,There's a lot of information here. 
 But this is not the purposenof my talk today.,This exists right now.,What we now have are the building blocksnto a very exciting future,,when it comes to arts and culture,and accessibility to arts and culture.,So I am joined today onstagenby my good friend and artist in residence,at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,,who is the professor of interactive design,at ECAL Universitynin Lausanne, Switzerland.,What Cyril and our teamnof engineers have been doing,is trying to find these connectionsnand visualize a few of these. 
 So I'm going to go quite quick now.,This object you seenbehind me -- oh, just clarification:,Always, seeing the real thing is better.,In case people thinknI'm trying to replicate the real thing.,So, moving on.,This object you see behind menis the Venus of Berekhat Ram.,It's one of the oldestnobjects in the world,,found in the Golan Heightsnaround 233,000 years ago,,and currently residingnat the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.,It is also one of the oldestnobjects on our platform. 
 So let's zoom.,We start from this one object.,What if we zoomed out,and actually tried to experiencenour own cultural big bang?,What might that look like?,This is what we deal with on a daily basisnat the Cultural Institute --,over six million cultural artifactsncurated and given to us by institutions,,to actually make these connections.,You can travel through time,,you can understand morenabout our society through these.,You can look at itnfrom the perspective of our planet,,and try to see hownit might look without borders,,if we just organized art and culture.,We can also then plot it by time,,which obviously, for the data geeknin me, is very fascinating.,You can spend hoursnlooking at every decade,and the contributionsnin that decade and in those years,for art, history and cultures.,We would love to spend hoursnshowing you each and every decade,,but we don't have the time right now.,So you can go on your phonenand actually do it yourself. 
 (Applause) 
 But if you don't mindnand can hold your applause till later,,I don't want to run out of time,,because I want to show youna lot of cool stuff. 
 So, just very quickly:,you can move on from herento another very interesting idea.,Beyond the pretty picture,,beyond the nice visualization,,what is the purpose, how is this useful?,This next idea comesnfrom discussions with curators,that we've been having at museums,,who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,,because they dedicate their whole lifento try to tell these stories.,One of the curators told me,n"Amit, what would it be like,if you could createna virtual curator's table,where all these six million objects,are displayed in a way for usnto look at the connections between them?",You can spend a lot of time, trust me,nlooking at different objects,and understanding where they come from.,It's a crazy Matrix experience. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just moving on,,let's take the world-famousnVincent Van Gogh,,who is very well-representednon this platform.,Thanks to the diversitynof the institutions we have,,we have over 211 high-definition,namazing artworks by this artist,,now organized in one beautiful view.,And as it resolves,nand as Cyril goes deeper,,you can see all the self-portraits,,you can see still life.,But I just wanted to highlightnone very quick example,,which is very timely:,"The Bedroom.",This is an artworknwhere three copies exist --,one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,,one at the Orsay in Paris,and one at the Art Institute of Chicago,,which, actually, currentlynis hosting a reunion,of all three artworks physically,,I think only for the second time ever.,But, it is united digitally and virtuallynfor anybody to look at,in a very different way,,and you won't get pushednin the line in the crowd.,So let's take you and let's travelnthrough "The Bedroom" very quickly,,so you can experience what we are doingnfor every single object.,We want the image to speaknas much as it can,on a digital platform.,And all you need is an internetnconnection and a computer 
 (Applause) 
 And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.,I'm sorry, this is all live,,so you have to give Cyrilna little bit of --,and this is available for every object:,modern art, contemporary art,nRenaissance -- you name it,,even sculpture. 
 Sometimes, you don't knownwhat can attract you,to an artwork or to a museumnor to a cultural discovery.,So for me, personally,nit was quite a challenge,because when I decided to make thisnmy full-time job at Google,,my mother was not very supportive.,I love my mother,,but she thought I was wasting my lifenwith this museum stuff.,And for her, a museum is whatnyou do when you go on vacation,and you tick-mark and it's over, right?,And it took around four and a half years,for me to convince my lovely Indian mother,that actually, this is worthwhile.,And the way I did it was,nI realized one day that she loves gold.,So I started showing her all objectsnthat have the material gold in them.,And the first thing my mom asks me is,,"How can we buy these?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And obviously, my salary is not that high,,so I was like, "We can'tnactually do that, mom.,But you can explore them virtually.",And so now my mom -- every timenI meet her, she asks me,,"Any more gold, any more silvernin your project? Can you show me?",And that's the ideanI'm trying to illustrate.,It does not matter how you get in,,as long as you get in.,Once you get in, you're hooked. 
 Moving on from here very quickly,,there is kind of a playful idea, actually,,to illustrate the point of access,,and I'm going to gonquite quickly on this one.,We all know that seeing the artworknin person is amazing.,But we also knownthat most of us can't do it,,and the ones that can affordnto do it, it's complicated.,So -- Cyril, can we loadnup our art trip, what do we call it?,We don't have a good name for this.,But essentially, we havenaround 1,000 amazing institutions,,68 countries.,But let's start with Rembrandt.,We might have time for only one example.,But thanks to the diversity,,we've got around 500 amazingnRembrandt object artworks,from 46 institutions and 17 countries.,Let's say that on your next vacation,,you want to go seenevery single one of them.,That is your itinerary,,you will probably traveln53,000 kilometers,,visit around, I think, 46 institutions,,and just FYI, you might releasen10 tons of CO2 emissions. 
 (Laughter) 
 But remember, it's art,,so you can justify it,nperhaps, in some way. 
 Moving on swiftly from here,,is something a little bitnmore technical and more interesting.,All that we've shown you so farnuses metadata to make the connections.,But obviously we havensomething cool nowadays,that everyone likes to talk about,nwhich is machine learning.,So what we thought is,nlet's strip out all the metadata,,let's look at what machine learning can do,based purely on visual recognitionnof this entire collection.,What we ended up withnis this very interesting map,,these clusters that havenno reference point information,,but has just used visualsnto cluster things together.,Each cluster is an art to usnby itself of discovery.,But one of the clusters we wantnto show you very quickly,is this amazing cluster of portraits,that we found from museumsnaround the world.,If you could zoom inna little bit more, Cyril.,Just to show you, you cannjust travel through portraits.,And essentially, you can do nature,nyou can do horses,and clusters galore. 
 When we saw all these portraits,,we were like, "Hey, can we donsomething fun for kids,,or can we do something playful,to get people interested in portraits?",Because I haven't really seen,young kids really excitednto go to a portrait gallery.,I wanted to try to figure something out.,So we created somethingncalled the portrait matcher.,It's quite self-explanatory,,so I'm just going to let Cyrilnshow his beautiful face.,And essentially what's happening is,nwith the movement of his head,,we are matching different portraitsnaround the world from museums. 
 (Applause) 
 And I don't know about you,,but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,,and the reaction is just phenomenal.,All they ask me is,n"When can we go see this?",And by the way, if we're nice,,maybe, Cyril, you can smilenand find a happy one?,Oh, perfect.,By the way, this is not rehearsed.,Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.,OK, let's move on; otherwise,nthis will just take the whole time. 
 (Applause) 
 So, art and culturencan be fun also, right?,For our last quick experiment --,we call all of these "experiments" --,our last quick experimentncomes back to machine learning.,We show you clusters, visual clusters,,but what if we could ask the machinento also name these clusters?,What if it could automatically tagnthem, using no actual metadata?,So what we have is this kind of explorer,,where we have managed to match,nI think, around 4,000 labels.,And we haven't reallyndone anything special here,,just fed the collection.,And we found interesting categories.,We can start with horses,na very straightforward category.,You would expect to seenthat the machine has put,images of horses, right?,And it has, but you also notice,nright over there,,that it has a very abstract image,that it has still managed to recognizenand cluster as horses.,We also have an amazing headnin terms of a horse.,And each one has the tagsnas to why it got categorized in this. 
 So let's move to another onenwhich I found very funny and interesting,,because I don't understandnhow this category came up.,It's called "Lady in Waiting.",If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,,you will see that we haventhese amazing images,of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.,I don't really understand it.,But I've been trying to asknmy museum contacts,,you know, "What is this?nWhat's going on here?",And it's fascinating. 
 Coming back to gold very quickly,,I wanted to search for gold,and see how the machinentagged all the gold.,But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.,We are living in popular times.,It tags it as "bling-bling." 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm being hard on Cyril,nbecause I'm moving too fast.,Essentially, here you havenall the bling-bling,of the world's museums organized for you. 
 And finally, to end this talknand these experiments,,what I hope you feel after this talknis happiness and emotion.,And what would we seenwhen we see happiness?,If we actually look at all the objects,that have been tagged under "happiness,",you would expect happiness, I guess.,But there was one that came upnthat was very fascinating and interesting,,which was this artworknby Douglas Coupland,,our friend and artistnin residence as well,,called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain.",I don't know why the machine feels likenit misses its pre-Internet brain,and it's been tagged here,,but it's a very interesting thought.,I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,,but not when it comes to exploringnarts and culture online. 
 So take out your phones,ntake out your computers,,go visit museums.,And just a quick call-outnto all the amazing archivists,,historians, curators,,who are sitting in museums,npreserving all this culture.,And the least we can do is getnour daily dose of art and culture,for ourselves and our kids. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've been living in rural East Africanfor about 10 years,,and I want to share a field perspectivenwith you on global poverty.,I believe that the greatest failurenof the human race,is the fact that we've left more thannone billion of our members behind.,Hungry, extreme poverty:,these often seem like gigantic,ninsurmountable problems,,too big to solve.,But as a field practitioner,,I believe these are actuallynvery solvable problems,if we just take the right strategies. 
 Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,,and he taught us that if we leannon the right levers,,we can move the world.,In the fight against extreme poverty,nI believe there are three powerful levers,that we can lean on.,This talk is all about those levers,nand why they make poverty,a winnable fight in our lifetimes. 
 What is extreme poverty?,When I first moved to rural East Africa,,I stayed overnight with a farm family.,They were wonderful people.,They invited me into their home.nWe sang songs together,and ate a simple dinner.,They gave me a blanketnto sleep on the floor.,In the morning, however,nthere was nothing to eat.,And then at lunchtime, I watchednwith an increasingly sick feeling,as the eldest girl in the familyncooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.,For that meal, every childndrank one cup to survive.,And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt,when they handed one of those cups to me,,and I knew I had to acceptntheir hospitality. 
 Children need food not only to survivenbut also to grow physically and mentally.,Every day they fail to eat,nthey lose a little bit of their future.,Amongst the extreme poor,none in three children,are permanently stuntednfrom a lifetime of not eating enough.,When that's combinednwith poor access to health care,,one in 10 extremely poor childrenndie before they reach age five.,And only one quarter of childrenncomplete high school,because they lack school fees.,Hunger and extreme poverty curbnhuman potential in every possible way.,We see ourselves as a thinking,nfeeling and moral human race,,but until we solve these problemsnfor all of our members,,we fail that standard,,because every personnon this planet matters.,This child matters.,These children matter.,This girl matters. 
 You know, we see things like this,,and we're upset by them,,but they seem like such big problems.,We don't know hownto take effective action.,But remember our friend Archimedes.,Global poverty has powerful levers.,It's a problem like any other.,I live and work in the field,nand as a practitioner,,I believe these are verynsolvable problems.,So for the next 10 minutes,,let's not be sadnabout the state of the world.,Let's engage our brains.,Let's engage our collective passionnfor problem-solving,and figure out what those levers are. 
 Lever number one: mostnof the world's poor are farmers.,Think about how extraordinary this is.,If this picture representsnthe world's poor,,then more than half engage in farmingnas a major source of income.,This gets me really excited.,All of these people, one profession.,Think how powerful this is.,When farmers become more productive,nthen more than half the world's poor,earn more money and climb out of poverty.,And it gets better.,The product of farmingnis, of course, food.,So when farmers become more productive,nthey earn more food,,and they don't just help themselves,,but they help to feed healthy communitiesnand thriving economies.,And when farmers become more productive,nthey reduce environmental pressure.,We only have two waysnwe can feed the world:,we can either make our existing farmlandna lot more productive,,or we can clear cut forest and savannahnto make more farmland,,which would be environmentally disastrous.,Farmers are basicallyna really important leverage point.,When farmers become more productive,,they earn more income,nthey climb out of poverty,,they feed their communities and theynreduce environmental land pressure.,Farmers stand at the center of the world. 
 And not a farmer like this one,,but rather this lady.,Most of the farmers I knownare actually women.,Look at the strength and the willnradiating from this woman.,She is physically strong, mentally tough,,and she will do whatever it takesnto earn a better life for her children.,If we're going to put the futurenof humanity in one person's hands,,then I'm really glad it's her. 
 (Applause) 
 There's just one problem:,many smallholder farmersnlack access to basic tools and knowledge.,Currently, they take a little bitnof saved food grain from the prior year,,they plant it in the groundnand they till it with a manual hand hoe.,These are tools and techniquesnthat date to the Bronze Age,,and it's why many farmersnare still very poor. 
 But good news, again.,Lever number two:,humanity actually solved the problemnof agricultural poverty a century ago.,Let me walk you through the threenmost basic factors in farming.,First, hybrid seed is creatednwhen you cross two seeds together.,If you naturally pollinatena high-yielding variety,together with a drought-resistant variety,,you get a hybrid that inheritsnpositive traits from both of its parents.,Next, conventional fertilizer,nif used responsibly,,is environmentally sustainable.,If you micro-dosenjust a pinch of fertilizer,to a plant that's taller than I am,,you unlock enormous yield gain.,These are known as farm inputs.,Farm inputs need to be combinednwith good practice.,When you space your seedsnand plant with massive amounts of compost,,farmers multiply their harvests.,These proven tools and practicesnhave more than tripled,agricultural productivitynin every major region of the world,,moving mass numbers of peoplenout of poverty.,We just haven't finished deliveringnthese things to everybody just yet,,particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
 So overall, this is amazing news.,Humanity actually solvednagricultural poverty a century ago,,in theory.,We just haven't delivered these thingsnto everybody just yet.,In this century, the reasonnthat people remain poor,is because maybe they livenin remote places.,They lack access to these things.,Therefore, ending povertynis simply a matter,of delivering proven goodsnand services to people.,We don't need more genius types right now.,The humble delivery guy is goingnto end global poverty in our lifetime. 
 So these are the three levers,,and the most powerful levernis simply delivery.,Wherever the world's companies,ngovernments and nonprofits,set up delivery networksnfor life-improving goods,,we eliminate poverty. 
 OK, so that sounds really nice in theory,,but what about in practice?,What do these delivery networks look like?,I want to share the concrete examplenthat I know best,,my organization, One Acre Fund.,We only serve the farmer,,and our job is to provide hernwith the tools that she needs to succeed.,We start off by delivering farm inputsnto really rural places.,Now, this may appearninitially very challenging,,but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.,We buy farm inputs with the combined powernof our farmer network,,and store it in 20 warehouses like this.,Then, during input delivery,nwe rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks,and send them out to where farmersnare waiting in the field.,They then get their individual ordersnand walk it home to their farms.,It's kind of like Amazonnfor rural farmers.,Importantly, realistic deliverynalso includes finance, a way to pay.,Farmers pay us little by little over time,ncovering most of our expenses.,And then we surroundnall that with training.,Our rural field officersndeliver practical, hands-on training,to farmers in the field,every two weeks. 
 Wherever we deliver our services,nfarmers use these tools,to climb out of poverty.,This is a farmernin our program, Consolata.,Look at the pride on her face.,She has achieved a modest prosperitynthat I believe is the human right,of every hardworking person on the planet.,Today, I'm proud to say that we're servingnabout 400,000 farmers like Consolata. 
 (Applause) 
 The key to doing thisnis scalable delivery.,In any given area, we hirena rural field officer,who delivers our servicesnto 200 farmers, on average,,with more than 1,000 peoplenliving in those families.,Today, we have 2,000nof these rural field officers,growing very quickly.,This is our delivery army,,and we're just one organization.,There are many companies,ngovernments and nonprofits,that have delivery armies just like this.,And I believe we stand at a moment in time,where collectively, we are capable ofndelivering farm services to all farmers. 
 Let me show you how possible this is.,This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,,with a map of the United States for scale.,I chose Sub-Saharan Africa becausenthis is a huge delivery territory.,It's very challenging.,But we analyzed every 50-milenby 50-mile block on the continent,,and we found that half of farmersnlive in just these shaded regions.,That's a remarkably small area overall.,If you were to lay these boxesnnext to each other,within a map of the United States,,they would only covernthe Eastern United States.,You can order pizzananywhere in this territory,and it'll arrive to your housenhot, fresh and delicious.,If America can deliver pizzanto an area of this size,,then Africa's companies,ngovernments and non-profits,can deliver farm servicesnto all of her farmers.,This is possible. 
 I'm going to wrap up by generalizingnbeyond just farming.,In every field of human development,,humanity has already inventedneffective tools to end poverty.,We just need to deliver them.,So again, in every areanof human development,,super-smart people a long time agoninvented inexpensive,,highly effective tools.,Humanity is armed to the teeth,with simple, effectivensolutions to poverty.,We just need to deliver thesento a pretty small area.,Again using the mapnof Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,,remember that rural poverty isnconcentrated in these blue shaded areas.,Urban poverty is even more concentrated,nin these green little dots.,Again, using a mapnof the United States for scale,,this is what I would callna highly achievable delivery zone.,In fact, for the first timenin human history,,we have a vast amount of deliveryninfrastructure available to us.,The world's companies,ngovernments and non-profits,have delivery armiesnthat are fully capable,of covering this relatively small area.,We just lack the will. 
 If we are willing,,every one of us has a role to play.,We first need more people to pursuencareers in human development,,especially if you livenin a developing nation.,We need more front line health workers,nteachers, farmer trainers,,sales agents for life-improving goods.,These are the delivery peoplenthat dedicate their careers,to improving the lives of others.,But we also need a lot of support roles.,These are roles availablenat just my organization alone,,and we're just one out of many.,This may surprise you, but no matternwhat your technical specialty,,there is a role for you in this fight.,And no matter how logistically possiblenit is to end poverty,,we need a lot more resources.,This is our number one constraint.,For private investors, we needna big expansion of venture capital,,private equity, working capital,navailable in emerging markets.,But there are also limitsnto what private business can accomplish.,Private businesses often strugglento profitably serve the extreme poor,,so philanthropy still hasna major role to play.,Anybody can give,nbut we need more leadership.,We need more visionary philanthropists,and global leaders who will takenproblems in human development,and lead humanity to wipe themnoff the face of the planet.,If you're interested in these ideas,ncheck out this website. 
 We need more leaders.,Humanity has put people on the moon.,We've invented supercomputersnthat fit into our pockets,and connect us with anybody on the planet.,We've run marathonsnat a five-minute mile pace.,We are an exceptional people.,But we've left more than one billionnof our members behind.,Until every girl like this onenhas an opportunity,to earn her full human potential,,we have failed to becomena truly moral and just human race.,Logistically speaking,nit's incredibly possible,to end extreme poverty.,We just need to delivernproven goods and services,to everybody.,If we have the will, every one of usnhas a role to play.,Let's deploy our time, our careers,,our collective wealth.,Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty,in this lifetime. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have one more reason for optimism:,climate change.,Maybe you don't believe it,nbut here is the fact. 
 On December 12, 2015,,in Paris, under the United Nations,,195 governments got together,and unanimously --,if you've worked with governments,nyou know how difficult that is --,unanimously decided,to intentionally change the coursenof the global economy,in order to protect the most vulnerable,and improve the life of all of us.,Now, that is a remarkable achievement. 
 (Applause) 
 But it is even more remarkable,if you consider where we had beennjust a few years ago.,2009, Copenhagen.,Who remembers Copenhagen?,Well, after years of workingntoward a climate agreement,,the same governmentsnconvened in Copenhagen,and failed miserably. 
 Why did it fail miserably?,For many different reasons,,but primarily becausenof the deeply entrenched divide,between the globalnNorth and the global South.,So now, six months after this failure,,I was called innto assume the responsibility,of the global climate change negotiations.,You can imagine, the perfect momentnto start this new job.,The global mood on climate changenwas in the trash can.,No one believed,that a global agreementncould ever be possible.,In fact, neither did I.,If you promise not to tell anyonenoutside of this wonderful TED audience,,I'm going to divulge a secret,that has been gratefullynburied by history.,On my first press conference,,a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,,do you think that a global agreementnis ever going to be possible?",And without engaging brain,nI heard me utter,,"Not in my lifetime.",Well, you can imaginenthe faces of my press team,who were horrifiednat this crazy Costa Rican woman,who was their new boss.,And I was horrified, too.,Now, I wasn't horrified at me,nbecause I'm kind of used to myself.,I was actually horrified,at the consequencesnof what I had just said,,at the consequences for the world,in which all our childrennare going to have to live.,It was frankly a horrible moment for me,,and I thought, well, no, hang on,,hang on.,Impossible is not a fact,,it's an attitude.,It's only an attitude.,And I decided right then and therenthat I was going to change my attitude,and I was going to help the worldnchange its attitude on climate change. 
 So I don't know --,No, just this? Thanks.,I don't know --,what you would do,if you were toldnyour job is to save the planet.,Put that on the job description.,And you have full responsibility,,but you have absolutely no authority,,because governments are sovereignnin every decision that they take. 
 Well, I would really love to know,what you would donon the first Monday morning,,but here's what I did: I panicked. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I panicked again,,because I realized I have no ideanhow we're going to solve this problem.,And then I realized I have no ideanhow we're going to solve this problem,,but I do know one thing:,we have got to changenthe tone of this conversation.,Because there is no waynyou can deliver victory,without optimism. 
 And here,,I use optimism as a very simple word,,but let's understand itnin its broader sense.,Let's understand it as courage,,hope, trust, solidarity,,the fundamental beliefnthat we humans can come together,and can help each othernto better the fate of mankind.,Well, you can imaginenthat I thought that without that,,there was no way we were goingnto get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.,And for six years,,I have stubbornly, relentlesslyninjected optimism into the system,,no matter what the questionsnfrom the press --,and I have gotten better at those --,and no matter what the evidencento the contrary.,And believe you me, there has beenna lot of contrary evidence.,But relentless optimism into the system. 
 And pretty soon,,we began to see changesnhappening in many areas,,precipitated by thousands of people,,including many of you here today,,and I thank you.,And this TED communitynwill not be surprised,if I tell you the first area,in which we saw remarkable change,was ...,technology.,We began to see that clean technologies,,in particular renewablenenergy technologies,,began to drop pricenand increase in capacity,,to the point where todaynwe are already building,concentrated solar power plants,that have the capacitynto power entire cities,,to say nothing of the factnof what we are doing on mobility,and intelligent buildings.,And with this shift in technologies,,we were able to begin to understand,that there was a shiftnin the economic equation,,because we were able to recognize,that yes, there arenhuge costs to climate change,,and yes, there are compounded risks.,But there also are economic advantages,and intrinsic benefits,,because the disseminationnof the clean technologies,is going to bring us cleaner air,,better health,,better transportation,nmore livable cities,,more energy security,,more energy accessnto the developing world.,In sum, a better worldnthan what we have now. 
 And with that understanding,,you should have witnessed,nin fact, part of you were,,the spread of ingenuity and excitement,that went through,nfirst through nonnational governments,,the private sector, captains of industry,ninsurance companies,,investors, city leaders,nfaith communities,,because they all began to understand,nthis actually can be in their interest.,This can actuallynimprove their bottom line. 
 And it wasn't just the usual suspects.,I have to tell you I had the CEOnof a major, major oil and gas company,come to me at the beginning of last year,and say --,privately, of course --,he did not know hownhe was going to change his company,,but he is going to change it,,because he's interestednin long-term viability.,Well, now we have a shiftnin the economic equation,,and with that, with broadernsupport from everyone,,it did not take very longnbefore we saw that national governments,woke up to the factnthat this is in their national interest.,And when we asked countriesnto begin to identify,how they could contributento global efforts,but based on their national interest,,189 countries out of 195,,189 countries sent theirncomprehensive climate change plans,,based on their national interest,,concurrent with their priorities,,consistent with their nationalnsustainable development plans. 
 Well,,once you protectnthe core interests of nations,,then you can understandnthat nations were ready,to begin to converge onto a common path,,onto a common direction of travel,that is going to take usnprobably several decades,,but over those several decadesnis going to take us,into the new economy,,into a decarbonized,nhighly resilient economy,,And the national contributionsnthat are currently on the table,on behalf of national governments,are insufficient to get usnto a stabilized climate,,but they are only the first step,,and they will improve over time.,And the measurement, reportingnand verification of all of those efforts,is legally binding.,And the checkpoints that we'rengoing to have every five years,to assess collective progressntowards our goal are legally binding,,and the path itself towardna decarbonized and more resilient economy,is legally binding. 
 And here's the more important part:,What did we have before?,A very small handful of countries,who had undertaken very reduced,,short-term emission reduction commitments,that were completely insufficient,and furthermore,nlargely perceived as a burden.,Now what do we have?,Now we have all countries of the worldncontributing with different intensities,from different approachesnin different sectors,,but all of themncontributing to a common goal,and along a path,with environmental integrity.,Well, once you have all of this in place,and you have shifted this understanding,,then you see that governmentsnwere able to go to Paris,and adopt the Paris agreement. 
 (Applause) 
 So,,as I look back,over the past six years,,first I remember,the day the Paris agreement was adopted.,I cannot tell younthe euphoria in the room.,5,000 people jumping out of their seats,,crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,,torn between euphoria and still disbeliefnat what they had just seen,,because so many people,had worked for years towards this,nand this was finally their reality. 
 And it wasn't just thosenwho had participated directly.,A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague,who was trying to decide,on a Tahitian pearl that he wantednto give to his wonderful wife Natasha.,And once he had finally decidednwhat he was going to buy,,the jeweler said to him,,"You know, you're very luckynthat you're buying this now,,because these pearls could go extinctnvery soon because of climate change.","But," the jeweler said, "have you heard,,the governmentsnhave just come to a decision,,and Tahiti could have a chance.",Well, what a fantastic confirmation,that perhaps, perhaps here is hope,,here is a possible chance.,I'm the first one to recognizenthat we have a lot of work still to do.,We've only just startednour work on climate change.,And in fact, we need to make surenthat we redouble our efforts,over the next five yearsnthat are the urgent five years.,But I do believe,that we have come over the past six years,from the impossible,to the now unstoppable.,And how did we do that?nBy injecting transformational optimism,that allowed us to gonfrom confrontation to collaboration,,that allowed us to understandnthat national and local interests,are not necessarily at oddsnwith global needs,,and that if we understand that,nwe can bring them together,and we can merge them harmoniously. 
 And as I look forwardnto other global issues,that will requirenour attention this century --,food security, water security,nhome security, forced migration --,I see that we certainly do not know,how we are going to solventhose problems yet.,But we can take a pagenout of what we have done on climate change,and we can understand,that we have got to reinterpretnthe zero-sum mentality.,Because we were trained to believenthat there always are winners and losers,,and that your loss is my gain.,Well, now that we're in a world,in which we have reachednplanetary boundaries,and that we are notnjust so interconnected,,but increasinglyninterdependent on each other,,your loss is no longer my gain.,We're either all losers,or we all can be winners.,But we are going to have to decide,between zero and sum.,We're going to have to decidenbetween zero benefit for all,or living life as the sum of all of us.,We've done it once. We can do it again. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)OK, so, confession:,I've always been weirdlynobsessed with advertising.,I remember watchingnSaturday morning cartoons,,paying more attention to the commercials,than to the shows,,trying to figure out how they were tryingnto get inside my head.,Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.,I became a partnernat a big New York ad agency. 
 But then, all of that suddenly changednon February 23, 1997,,when my little brother Mattnwas shot in the head,in a shooting that happenednon the observation deck,of the Empire State Building.,Suddenly, my family was thrownninto the middle of a nightmare,,being told that my brothernwas going to die,,actually being given the opportunitynto say goodbye to him,,then several emergency brain surgeries,and now what's amounted, for Matt,,to a lifetime spent courageouslynrecovering from a traumatic brain injury.,He is definitely my hero. 
 But as much as (Applause) --nyeah, deserves it -- 
 (Applause) 
 But as much as this tragedynwas a nightmare for my family,,I often think about how much worsenit could have been;,in fact, how much worsenit is for the 90 families every day,who aren't as fortunate,,who lose loved ones -- brothers,nsisters, sons, daughters, parents.,They don't all make national headlines.,In fact, most of them don't.,They go largely unnoticed,,in a nation that's kind of come to acceptna disgraceful national epidemic,as some kind of new normal. 
 So I quit my job in advertising,to try and do something aboutnthis disgraceful national epidemic,,because I came to realize,that the challengesnto preventing gun violence,are actually the same onesnthat made me love advertising,,which is to try to figure outnhow to engage people.,Only instead of doing it to sell products,,doing it to save lives.,And that comes down tonfinding common ground,,where what I want overlapsnwith what you want.,And you might be surprised to learn,nwhen it comes to gun violence,,just how much common ground there is. 
 Let's look, for example,nat people who love to hunt,,a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.,It's a proud tradition. Families.,In some places,,the first day of hunting seasonnis actually a school holiday.,What do hunters want?,Well, they want to hunt.nThey love their guns.,They believe deeply,in the Second Amendment rightnto own those guns.,But that doesn't meannthere isn't common ground. 
 In fact, there's a lot of it,,starting with the basic ideanof keeping guns out of dangerous hands.,This isn't about takingncertain guns away from all people.,It's about keeping all gunsnaway from certain people,,and it's the people that, it turns out,nwe all agree shouldn't have guns:,convicted violent criminals,ndomestic abusers,,the dangerously mentally ill.,We can all appreciate,how Brady background checksnhave been incredibly effective,in keeping gunsnout of those dangerous hands.,In 20 years, Brady background checksnat federally licensed firearm dealers,have blocked 2.4 million gun sales,to those people that we all agreenshouldn't have guns. 
 (Applause) 
 And whether you love guns or hate guns,nyou probably also appreciate,that there shouldn't be thousandsnof gun sales every day,at guns shows or online,without those Brady background checks,,just like there shouldn't be two linesnto get on an airplane --,one with securitynand one with no security.,And -- 
 (Applause) 
 And the numbers show the overwhelmingnagreement among the American public:,90 percent of Americans supportnexpanding Brady background checks,to all gun sales -- includingn90 percent of Republicans,,more than 80 percent of gun owners,,more than 70 percent of NRA members.,This is not a controversial idea.,In fact, only six percentnof the American public disagrees.,That's about the percentagenof the American public,that believes the moon landing was a fake. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's also about the percentagenthat believes the government,is putting mind-controlling technologynin our TV broadcast signals.,That's the extent to which we agreenabout background checks. 
 But what about the 300 million guns,already out there in homes across America?,Well first, it's important to realize,that those guns are mostlynin the hands and homes,of decent, law-abiding peoplenlike you and me,,who want what we all want --nincluding keeping our families safe.,In fact, that's why more and more peoplenare choosing to own guns.,Ten years ago, 42 percentnof the American public,believed -- incorrectly -- that a gunnmakes your home safer.,Today, that number is 63 percent. 
 Why?,I kind of hate to say it,,because it gets to the darknunderbelly of advertising,,which is if you tellna big enough lie enough times,,eventually that lie becomes the truth.,And that's exactly what's happened here.,The corporate gun lobbynhas spent billions of dollars,blocking the CDC from doing researchninto the public health epidemic,of gun violence;,blocking pediatriciansnfrom talking to parents,about the dangers of guns in the home;,blocking smart-gun technologynand other technology,that would prevent kidsnfrom firing parents' guns,and would save lives.,They're desperate to hide the truth,,because they view the truthnas a threat to their bottom line. 
 And every day,,people are dying as a result.,And a lot of those people are children.,Every day in the US,,nine kids are just shot unintentionally.,900 children and teensntake their own lives every year.,And here's the thing:nthey're almost all with a parent's gun.,Even two-thirds of school shootingsnhappen with a gun taken from the home,,including the terrible tragedy,at Sandy Hook.,I meet so many of these parents;,it's the most heartbreakingnpart of my job.,These are not bad people.,They're just living with the unimaginablenconsequences of a very bad decision,,made based on very bad information,that was put into their mindsnby very bad people,,who know good and wellnthe misery that they're causing,,but just don't care.,And the result is a nightmare --,not only for families like mine,,but for, really, at the endnof the day, all of us. 
 But I'm not here to talknabout the nightmare of gun violence.,I'm here to talk about our dream,nand it's a dream we all share,,which is the dreamnof a better, safer, future.,For my organization,nfor the Brady Campaign,,that dream is reflected in the bold goal,to cut the number of gun deathsnin the US in half by 2025.,And I hope to leavenall of you here tonight,with a strong sense of exactly whynthat dream is so absolutely within reach.,Because folks,,for every great movement around the world,,there's a momentnwhere you can look back and say,,"That's when thingsnreally started to change.",And I'm here to say,that for the movementnto end gun violence in America,,that moment is here. 
 (Applause) 
 We are so clearly at a tipping point,,because the American publicnhas come together by the millions,like never before,nbased on that common ground,,to say, "Enough.",Enough of the mass shootingsnin malls and movie theaters,and churches and schools.,Enough of the daily terrornof gun violence in homes and streets,that's claimed the lives of womennand young black men,in staggering proportions.,Enough of easy access to guns,by the people that we all agreenshouldn't have them.,And enough of a small groupnof craven politicians,putting the interestsnof the corporate gun lobby,ahead of the peoplenthey have been elected to represent.,Enough. 
 (Applause) 
 And the really exciting thing is,nit's not just the usual suspects like me,that are saying it anymore.,It's so much bigger than that.,And if you want proof,,let's start where most conversationsnin the US seem to start --,with Kim Kardashian. 
 (Laughter) 
 And here's the thing:nit's not really a joke.,I mean, think about when issues change.,It's when they go from beingnpolitical and advocacy issues,to being part of pop culture,,voices coming from everywhere,ncelebrities using their platforms,,musicians, athletes.,The NBA has come forward.,Conservative pundits that you nevernwould have imagined,have come forward.,There's real cultural change --,I even hear there's a TED Talknabout it this year.,That's the extent to whichnthis cultural change is happening.,And yes, Kim Kardashian has madenan unsolicited passionate appeal,to her 35 million Twitter followers,for expanded background checks. 
 Let's look at the political electionsnthat are heating up.,This used to be the classicnthird-rail issue for Democrats.,Couldn't run from it fast enough.,Now candidates are running on it.,Some are being forcednto reverse very bad positions,they defended very comfortably,nuntil very recently.,For somebody like me,,watching people wave aroundntheir negative NRA ratings --,it's almost surreal to watch.,We're still outfunded, yes,nby the corporate gun lobby,,and ultimately that needs to change.,But you know what?,We're smarter and we're scrappier,nand we have the truth on our side.,And we're on offense. 
 You know, they say that the Internetndemocratizes information.,Social media and somenof the organizing tools that plug into it,have democratized activism.,It's allowed us to show what 90 percentnsupport really looks like.,Sometimes I think of it --,you know, we're convergingnand attacking instantly by the millions,,kind of like white blood cells.,It's enabled us to start to reallynclose -- and this is the bottom line --,close that disgraceful disconnect,between what the American public wants,and what our elected leadersnare doing about it. 
 Until recently,,the narrative in Congressnwas that calls from the other side,,from that six percent,,outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.,We're flipping that narrative on its head.,After that recent terrible tragedynin San Bernardino,,we jammed Congressional switchboards.,We put 15,000 callsninto Congress in 24 hours.,And you know what?,We got a vote on a bill,that nobody thought was going to seenthe light of day anytime soon.,We're seeing real movementnto repeal some of the most evil,,ugly gun lobby legislationnpassed over the last dark decade.,The stranglehold of the gun lobbynis clearly being broken.,We've seen President Obama'snhistoric executive actions.,They don't go all the way,,but they are going to save lives,,because they expandnBrady background checks,to thousands of gun salesnthat didn't have them previously.,And we're marching across the country --nwe're not just waiting,for Congress to act; that would almostnbe the definition of insanity.,We're marching across the country,,state by state, marriage-equality style. 
 And you know what? We're winning.,Congress is almost alwaysnthe last to wake up and realize,that it's on the wrong side of history.,And when they do, it's alwaysnbecause the American public shakes them.,And that's exactlynwhat we're doing right now,,as we're in this tipping point. 
 You know, recently I was flyingncross-country to give a speech,to a large group like this,nalthough far less intimidating,,and the woman sitting next to menhappened to be binge-watching,one of my all-time favoritenTV shows, "Mad Men,",a period TV show about advertising,in the 1960s.,And as I was trying to thinknabout how to end my remarks,,I'd glance up at her screennevery now and then,,and it seemed that every time I did,,I'd see somebody smokingnin an office or around children,or while pregnant or drinking and driving,or driving without seat beltsnor sexually harassing a coworker. 
 And ultimately it dawned on me:,what tremendous inspiration,to those of us who have this dreamnto end gun violence.,I mean, think about how muchnthe world has changed,in a relatively short period of time,,how all those behaviors that were oncenconsidered commonplace or normal --,some even glamorous or sexy --,have become stigmatizednin just a generation or two,,once they became conversationsnabout our common ground.,That is the magnitude of the changenwe have the potential to create,around gun violence. 
 And that's my dream,,that maybe someday,,some period TV show will depictnthe terrible nightmare of gun violence,,and a future generation of childrennmight only be able to imagine,how terrible it must have been. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to introduce younto an amazing woman.,Her name is Davinia.,Davinia was born in Jamaica,nemigrated to the US at the age of 18,,and now lives just outsidenof Washington, DC.,She's not a high-powerednpolitical staffer,,nor a lobbyist.,She'd probably tell younshe's quite unremarkable,,but she's havingnthe most remarkable impact.,What's incredible about Davinia,is that she's willing to spendntime every single week,focused on people who are not her:,people not her in her neighborhood,nher state, nor even in her country --,people she'd likely never meet. 
 Davinia's impact started a few years ago,when she reached outnto all of her friends on Facebook,,and asked them to donate their pennies,so she could fund girls' education.,She wasn't expecting a huge response,,but 700,000 pennies later,,she's now sent over 120 girls to school.,When we spoke last week,,she told me she's becomena little infamous at the local bank,every time she rocks upnwith a shopping cart full of pennies. 
 Now -- Davinia is not alone.,Far from it.,She's part of a growing movement.,And there's a namenfor people like Davinia:,global citizens.,A global citizen is someonenwho self-identifies first and foremost,not as a member of a state,na tribe or a nation,,but as a member of the human race,,and someone who is preparednto act on that belief,,to tackle our world's greatest challenges.,Our work is focused on finding,,supporting and activating global citizens.,They exist in every country,and among every demographic. 
 I want to make the case to you today,that the world's future dependsnon global citizens.,I'm convinced that if we hadnmore global citizens active in our world,,then every single onenof the major challenges we face --,from poverty, climate change,ngender inequality --,these issues become solvable.,They are ultimately global issues,,and they can ultimately only be solved,by global citizens demandingnglobal solutions from their leaders. 
 Now, some people's immediatenreaction to this idea,is that it's either a bit utopiannor even threatening.,So I'd like to share with youna little of my story today,,how I ended up here,,how it connects with Davinia,and, hopefully, with you. 
 Growing up in Melbourne, Australia,,I was one of those seriouslynirritating little kids,that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?",You might have been one yourself.,I used to ask my mumnthe most annoying questions.,I'd ask her questions like,n"Mum, why I can't I dress up,and play with puppets all day?","Why do you want fries with that?","What is a shrimp,,and why do we have to keepnthrowing them on the barbie?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "And mum -- this haircut.,Why?" 
 (Laughter) 
 The worst haircut, I think.,Still terrible. 
 As a "why" kid, I thoughtnI could change the world,,and it was impossiblento convince me otherwise.,And when I was 12nand in my first year of high school,,I started raising moneynfor communities in the developing world.,We were a reallynenthusiastic group of kids,,and we raised more moneynthan any other school in Australia.,And so I was awarded the chancento go to the Philippines to learn more.,It was 1998.,We were taken into a slumnin the outskirts of Manila.,It was there I became friendsnwith Sonny Boy,,who lived on what was literallyna pile of steaming garbage.,"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.,But don't let the romancenof that name fool you,,because it was nothing morenthan a rancid landfill,that kids like Sonny Boy spent hoursnrummaging through every single day,to find something, anything of value. 
 That night with Sonny Boy and his familynchanged my life forever,,because when it came time to go to sleep,,we simply laid down on this concretenslab the size of half my bedroom,with myself, Sonny Boy,nand the rest of his family,,seven of us in this long line,,with the smell of rubbish all around us,and cockroaches crawling all around.,And I didn't sleep a wink,,but I lay awake thinking to myself,,"Why should anyone have to live like this,when I have so much?,Why should Sonny Boy's abilitynto live out his dreams,be determined by where he's born,,or what Warren Buffett calledn'the ovarian lottery?'",I just didn't get it,,and I needed to understand why. 
 Now, I only later came to understand,that the poverty I'd seennin the Philippines,was the result of decisions madenor not made, man-made,,by a succession of colonial powersnand corrupt governments,who had anything but the interestsnof Sonny Boy at heart.,Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain,nbut they may as well have.,And if we're to try to helpnkids like Sonny Boy,,it wouldn't work just to trynto send him a few dollars,or to try to clean upnthe garbage dump on which he lived,,because the corenof the problem lay elsewhere.,And as I worked on communityndevelopment projects over the coming years,trying to help build schools,,train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,,I came to see that community development,should be drivennby communities themselves,,and that although charity is necessary,nit's not sufficient.,We need to confront these challenges,on a global scale and in a systemic way.,And the best thing I could do,is try to mobilize a large groupnof citizens back home,to insist that our leaders engagenin that systemic change. 
 That's why, a few years later,,I joined with a group of college friends,in bringing the Make Poverty Historyncampaign to Australia.,We had this dream of stagingnthis small concert,around the time of the G20nwith local Aussie artists,,and it suddenly exploded one day,when we got a phone call from Bono,nthe Edge and Pearl Jam,,who all agreed to headline our concert.,I got a little bit excitednthat day, as you can see. 
 (Laughter) 
 But to our amazement,,the Australian governmentnheard our collective voices,,and they agreed to double investmentninto global health and development --,an additional 6.2 billion dollars.,It felt like -- 
 (Applause) 
 It felt like this incredible validation.,By rallying citizens together,nwe helped persuade our government,to do the unthinkable,,and act to fix a problemnmiles outside of our borders. 
 But here's the thing:,it didn't last.,See, there was a change in government,,and six years later, all that new money,disappeared.,What did we learn?,We learned that one-off spikesnare not enough.,We needed a sustainable movement,,not one that is susceptiblento the fluctuating moods of a politician,or the hint of an economic downturn.,And it needed to happen everywhere;,otherwise, every individual governmentnwould have this built-in excuse mechanism,that they couldn't possibly carrynthe burden of global action alone. 
 And so this is what we embarked upon.,And as we embarked uponnthis challenge, we asked ourselves,,how do we gain enough pressurenand build a broad enough army,to win these fights for the long term?,We could only think of one way.,We needed to somehow turnnthat short-term excitement,of people involved withnthe Make Poverty History campaign,into long-term passion.,It had to be part of their identity.,So in 2012, we cofounded an organizationnthat had exactly that as its goal.,And there was only one name for it:,Global Citizen. 
 But this is not aboutnany one organization.,This is about citizens taking action.,And research data tells us,that of the total populationnwho even care about global issues,,only 18 percent have donenanything about it.,It's not that people don't want to act.,It's often that they don'tnknow how to take action,,or that they believe that their actionsnwill have no effect.,So we had to somehow recruitnand activate millions of citizens,in dozens of countries,to put pressure on their leadersnto behave altruistically. 
 And as we did so, we discoverednsomething really thrilling,,that when you makenglobal citizenship your mission,,you suddenly find yourselfnwith some extraordinary allies.,See, extreme poverty isn't the only issuenthat's fundamentally global.,So, too, is climate change,,human rights, gender equality,,even conflict.,We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder,with people who are passionate aboutntargeting all these interrelated issues. 
 But how did we actuallyngo about recruiting,and engaging those global citizens?,Well, we used the universal language:,music.,We launched the Global Citizen Festival,in the heart of New York Citynin Central Park,,and we persuaded some of the world'snbiggest artists to participate.,We made sure thatnthese festivals coincided,with the UN General Assembly meeting,,so that leaders who neednto hear our voices,couldn't possible ignore them. 
 But there was a twist:,you couldn't buy a ticket.,You had to earn it.,You had to take actionnon behalf of a global cause,,and only once you'd done thatncould you earn enough points to qualify.,Activism is the currency.,I had no interest in citizenshipnpurely as some sort of feel-good thing.,For me, citizenship means you have to act,nand that's what we required.,And amazingly, it worked.,Last year, more than 155,000 citizensnin the New York area alone,earned enough points to qualify.,Globally, we've now signed up citizensnin over 150 countries around the world.,And last year, we signed upnmore than 100,000 new members,each and every week of the whole year. 
 See, we don't need to createnglobal citizens from nothing.,We're already everywhere.,We just need to be organized,and motivated to start acting.,And this is where I believenwe can learn a lot from Davinia,,who started taking actionnas a global citizen back in 2012.,Here's what she did.,It wasn't rocket science.,She started writing letters,,emailing politicians' offices.,She volunteered her timenin her local community.,That's when she got active on social media,and started to collect pennies --,a lot of pennies. 
 Now, maybe that doesn't soundnlike a lot to you.,How will that achieve anything?,Well, it achieved a lotnbecause she wasn't alone.,Her actions, alongside 142,000nother global citizens',,led the US governmentnto double their investment,into Global Partnership for Education.,And here's Dr. Raj Shah,,the head of USAID,nmaking that announcement.,See, when thousands of global citizensnfind inspiration from each other,,it's amazing to seentheir collective power.,Global citizens like Davinianhelped persuade the World Bank,to boost their investmentninto water and sanitation.,Here's the Bank's president Jim Kimnannouncing 15 billion dollars onstage,at Global Citizen,,and Prime Minister Modi of Indianaffirmed his commitment,to put a toilet in every householdnand school across India by 2019.,Global citizens encouragednby the late-night host Stephen Colbert,launched a Twitter invasion on Norway.,Erna Solberg, the country'snPrime Minister, got the message,,committing to double investmentninto girls' education.,Global citizens together with Rotariansncalled on the Canadian, UK,,and Australian governments,to boost their investmentninto polio eradication.,They got together and committedn665 million dollars. 
 But despite all of this momentum,,we face some huge challenges.,See, you might be thinking to yourself,,how can we possibly persuade world leaders,to sustain a focus on global issues?,Indeed, the powerful Americannpolitician Tip O'Neill once said,,"All politics is local.",That's what alwaysngot politicians elected:,to seek, gain and hold onto power,through the pursuit of localnor at very best national interests. 
 I experienced this for the first timenwhen I was 21 years old.,I took a meeting,with a then-Australian Foreign Ministernwho shall remain nameless -- 
 [Alexander Downer] 
 (Laughter) 
 And behind closed doors,,I shared with him my passionnto end extreme poverty.,I said, "Minister -- Australianhas this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,to help achieve the MillenniumnDevelopment Goals.,We can do this.",And he paused,,looked down on menwith cold, dismissive eyes,,and he said, "Hugh,,no one gives a funk about foreign aid.",Except he didn't use the word "funk.",He went on.,He said we need to look afternour own backyard first. 
 This is, I believe,,outdated, even dangerous thinking.,Or as my late grandfather would say,,complete BS.,Parochialism offers this false dichotomy,because it pits the poor in one countrynagainst the poor in another.,It pretends we can isolate ourselvesnand our nations from one another.,The whole world is our backyard,,and we ignore it at our peril.,See, look what happenednwhen we ignored Rwanda,,when we ignore Syria,,when we ignore climate change.,Political leaders ought to give a "funk",because the impact of climate changenand extreme poverty,comes right to our shore. 
 Now, global citizens --nthey understand this.,We live in a time that favorsnthe global citizen,,in an age where everynsingle voice can be heard.,See, do you remember,when the Millennium Development Goalsnwere signed back in the year 2000?,The most we could do in those daysnwas fire off a letter,and wait for the next election.,There was no social media.,Today, billions of citizensnhave more tools,,more access to information,,more capacity to influencenthan ever before.,Both the problems and the toolsnto solve them are right before us.,The world has changed,,and those of us who looknbeyond our borders,are on the right side of history. 
 So where are we?,So we run this amazing festival,,we've scored some big policy wins,,and citizens are signing upnall over the world.,But have we achieved our mission?,No.,We have such a long way to go. 
 But this is the opportunity that I see.,The concept of global citizenship,,self-evident in its logic but until nownimpractical in many ways,,has coincided with this particular momentnin which we are privileged to live.,We, as global citizens,,now have a unique opportunitynto accelerate large-scale positive change,around the world.,So in the months and years ahead,,global citizens will holdnworld leaders accountable,to ensure that the new Global Goalsnfor Sustainable Development,are tracked and implemented.,Global citizens will partnernwith the world's leading NGOs,to end diseases like polio and malaria.,Global citizens will sign upnin every corner of this globe,,increasing the frequency, quality,and impact of their actions.,These dreams are within reach.,Imagine an army of millions,growing into tens of millions,,connected, informed, engaged,and unwilling to take no for an answer. 
 Over all these years,,I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.,Sadly, I've been unable to.,We met long before social media,,and his address has nownbeen relocated by the authorities,,as often happens with slums.,I'd love to sit down with him,,wherever he is,,and share with him how much the timenI spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.,Thanks to him and so many others,,I came to understand the importancenof being part of a movement of people --,the kids willing to look upnfrom their screens and out to the world,,the global citizens.,Global citizens who stand together,,who ask the question "Why?,",who reject the naysayers,,and embrace the amazing possibilitiesnof the world we share. 
 I'm a global citizen. 
 Are you? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So this is a talk about gene drives,,but I'm going to startnby telling you a brief story.,20 years ago, a biologistnnamed Anthony James,got obsessed with the ideanof making mosquitos,that didn't transmit malaria. 
 It was a great idea,nand pretty much a complete failure.,For one thing, it turned outnto be really hard,to make a malaria-resistant mosquito.,James managed it, finally,njust a few years ago,,by adding some genesnthat make it impossible,for the malaria parasitento survive inside the mosquito. 
 But that just created another problem.,Now that you've gotna malaria-resistant mosquito,,how do you get it to replacenall the malaria-carrying mosquitos?,There are a couple options,,but plan A was basically to breed up,a bunch of the newngenetically-engineered mosquitos,release them into the wild,and hope that they pass on their genes.,The problem was that you'd have to release,literally 10 times the numbernof native mosquitos to work.,So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,,you release an extra 100,000.,As you might guess,,this was not a very popular strategynwith the villagers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then, last January,nAnthony James got an email,from a biologist named Ethan Bier.,Bier said that henand his grad student Valentino Gantz,had stumbled on a toolnthat could not only guarantee,that a particular genetic traitnwould be inherited,,but that it would spreadnincredibly quickly.,If they were right,nit would basically solve the problem,that he and James had beennworking on for 20 years. 
 As a test, they engineered two mosquitosnto carry the anti-malaria gene,and also this new tool, a gene drive,,which I'll explain in a minute.,Finally, they set it upnso that any mosquitos,that had inherited the anti-malaria gene,wouldn't have the usual white eyes,nbut would instead have red eyes.,That was pretty much just for convenience,so they could tell just at a glancenwhich was which. 
 So they took their twonanti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos,and put them in a boxnwith 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,,and let them breed.,In two generations, those had producedn3,800 grandchildren.,That is not the surprising part.,This is the surprising part:,given that you startednwith just two red-eyed mosquitos,and 30 white-eyed ones,,you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.,Instead, when James opened the box,,all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes. 
 When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,,he became so excited that he was literallynshouting into the phone.,That's because gettingnonly red-eyed mosquitos,violates a rule that is the absolutencornerstone of biology,,Mendelian genetics.,I'll keep this quick,,but Mendelian geneticsnsays when a male and a female mate,,their baby inherits halfnof its DNA from each parent.,So if our original mosquito was aanand our new mosquito is aB,,where B is the anti-malarial gene,,the babies should come outnin four permutations:,aa, aB, aa, Ba.,Instead, with the new gene drive,,they all came out aB.,Biologically, that shouldn'tneven be possible. 
 So what happened?,The first thing that happened,was the arrival of a gene-editing toolnknown as CRISPR in 2012.,Many of you have probablynheard about CRISPR,,so I'll just say briefly that CRISPRnis a tool that allows researchers,to edit genes very precisely,neasily and quickly.,It does this by harnessing a mechanismnthat already existed in bacteria.,Basically, there's a proteinnthat acts like a scissors,and cuts the DNA,,and there's an RNA moleculenthat directs the scissors,to any point on the genome you want.,The result is basicallyna word processor for genes.,You can take an entire genenout, put one in,,or even edit just a singlenletter within a gene.,And you can do it in nearly any species. 
 OK, remember how I said that gene drivesnoriginally had two problems?,The first was that it was hardnto engineer a mosquito,to be malaria-resistant.,That's basically gone now,nthanks to CRISPR.,But the other problem was logistical.,How do you get your trait to spread?,This is where it gets clever. 
 A couple years ago, a biologistnat Harvard named Kevin Esvelt,wondered what would happen,if you made it so thatnCRISPR inserted not only your new gene,but also the machinerynthat does the cutting and pasting.,In other words, what if CRISPRnalso copied and pasted itself.,You'd end up with a perpetualnmotion machine for gene editing.,And that's exactly what happened.,This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created,not only guaranteesnthat a trait will get passed on,,but if it's used in the germline cells,,it will automatically copy and pastenyour new gene,into both chromosomesnof every single individual.,It's like a global search and replace,,or in science terms, it makesna heterozygous trait homozygous. 
 So, what does this mean?,For one thing, it means we havena very powerful,,but also somewhat alarming new tool.,Up until now, the fact that gene drivesndidn't work very well,was actually kind of a relief.,Normally when we mess aroundnwith an organism's genes,,we make that thingnless evolutionarily fit.,So biologists can makenall the mutant fruit flies they want,without worrying about it.,If some escape, natural selectionnjust takes care of them. 
 What's remarkable and powerfulnand frightening about gene drives,is that that will no longer be true.,Assuming that your trait does not havena big evolutionary handicap,,like a mosquito that can't fly,,the CRISPR-based gene drivenwill spread the change relentlessly,until it is in every single individualnin the population.,Now, it isn't easy to makena gene drive that works that well,,but James and Esvelt think that we can. 
 The good news is that this opensnthe door to some remarkable things.,If you put an anti-malarial gene drive,in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,,the species that transmits malaria,,researchers estimate that it would spreadnto the entire population in a year.,So in a year, you could virtuallyneliminate malaria.,In practice, we're still a few years outnfrom being able to do that,,but still, a 1,000 childrenna day die of malaria.,In a year, that numberncould be almost zero.,The same goes for dengue fever,nchikungunya, yellow fever. 
 And it gets better.,Say you want to get ridnof an invasive species,,like get Asian carpnout of the Great Lakes.,All you have to do is release a gene drive,that makes the fish producenonly male offspring.,In a few generations,nthere'll be no females left, no more carp.,In theory, this means we could restorenhundreds of native species,that have been pushed to the brink. 
 OK, that's the good news,,this is the bad news.,Gene drives are so effective,that even an accidental releasencould change an entire species,,and often very quickly.,Anthony James took good precautions.,He bred his mosquitosnin a bio-containment lab,and he also used a speciesnthat's not native to the US,so that even if some did escape,,they'd just die off, there'd be nothingnfor them to mate with.,But it's also true that if a dozennAsian carp with the all-male gene drive,accidentally got carriednfrom the Great Lakes back to Asia,,they could potentially wipe outnthe native Asian carp population.,And that's not so unlikely,ngiven how connected our world is.,In fact, it's why we havenan invasive species problem.,And that's fish.,Things like mosquitos and fruit flies,,there's literally no way to contain them.,They cross bordersnand oceans all the time. 
 OK, the other piece of bad news,is that a gene drivenmight not stay confined,to what we call the target species.,That's because of gene flow,,which is a fancy way of sayingnthat neighboring species,sometimes interbreed.,If that happens, it's possiblena gene drive could cross over,,like Asian carp could infectnsome other kind of carp.,That's not so bad if your drivenjust promotes a trait, like eye color.,In fact, there's a decentnchance that we'll see,a wave of very weird fruit fliesnin the near future.,But it could be a disaster,if your drive is deignednto eliminate the species entirely. 
 The last worrisome thingnis that the technology to do this,,to genetically engineer an organismnand include a gene drive,,is something that basically any labnin the world can do.,An undergraduate can do it.,A talented high schoolernwith some equipment can do it. 
 Now, I'm guessingnthat this sounds terrifying. 
 (Laughter) 
 Interestingly though,nnearly every scientist I talk to,seemed to think that gene drives were notnactually that frightening or dangerous.,Partly because they believenthat scientists will be,very cautious and responsiblenabout using them. 
 (Laughter) 
 So far, that's been true.,But gene drives also havensome actual limitations.,So for one thing, they worknonly in sexually reproducing species.,So thank goodness, they can't be usednto engineer viruses or bacteria.,Also, the trait spreadsnonly with each successive generation.,So changing or eliminating a population,is practical only if that speciesnhas a fast reproductive cycle,,like insects or maybensmall vertebrates like mice or fish.,In elephants or people,nit would take centuries,for a trait to spreadnwidely enough to matter. 
 Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easynto engineer a truly devastating trait.,Say you wanted to make a fruit fly,that feeds on ordinary fruitninstead of rotting fruit,,with the aim of sabotagingnAmerican agriculture.,First, you'd have to figure out,which genes controlnwhat the fly wants to eat,,which is already a very longnand complicated project.,Then you'd have to alter those genesnto change the fly's behavior,to whatever you'd want it to be,,which is an even longernand more complicated project.,And it might not even work,,because the genesnthat control behavior are complex.,So if you're a terroristnand have to choose,between starting a gruelingnbasic research program,that will require years of meticulousnlab work and still might not pan out,,or just blowing stuff up?,You'll probably choose the later. 
 This is especially truenbecause at least in theory,,it should be pretty easynto build what's called a reversal drive.,That's one that basically overwritesnthe change made by the first gene drive.,So if you don't likenthe effects of a change,,you can just release a second driventhat will cancel it out,,at least in theory. 
 OK, so where does this leave us?,We now have the abilitynto change entire species at will.,Should we?,Are we gods now?,I'm not sure I'd say that.,But I would say this:,first, some very smart people,are even now debatingnhow to regulate gene drives.,At the same time,nsome other very smart people,are working hard to create safeguards,,like gene drives that self-regulatenor peter out after a few generations.,That's great.,But this technology still requiresna conversation.,And given the nature of gene drives,,that conversation has to be global.,What if Kenya wants to use a drivenbut Tanzania doesn't?,Who decides whether to releasena gene drive that can fly? 
 I don't have the answer to that question.,All we can do going forward, I think,,is talk honestlynabout the risks and benefits,and take responsibility for our choices.,By that I mean, not just the choicento use a gene drive,,but also the choice not to use one.,Humans have a tendency to assumenthat the safest option,is to preserve the status quo.,But that's not always the case.,Gene drives have risks,nand those need to be discussed,,but malaria exists nownand kills 1,000 people a day.,To combat it, we spray pesticidesnthat do grave damage to other species,,including amphibians and birds. 
 So when you hear about gene drivesnin the coming months,,and trust me, you willnbe hearing about them,,remember that.,It can be frightening to act,,but sometimes, not acting is worse. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: This is suchna strange thing.,Your software, Linux,nis in millions of computers,,it probably powers much of the Internet.,And I think that there are, like,,a billion and a half activenAndroid devices out there.,Your software is in everynsingle one of them.,It's kind of amazing.,You must have some amazingnsoftware headquarters driving all this.,That's what I thought -- and I was shockednwhen I saw a picture of it.,I mean, this is --,this is the Linux world headquarters. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Linus Torvalds: It reallyndoesn't look like much.,And I have to say,,the most interesting part in this picture,,that people mostly react to,,is the walking desk.,It is the most interestingnpart in my office,and I'm not actually using it anymore.,And I think the two things are related. 
 The way I work is ...,I want to not have external stimulation.,You can kind of see,non the walls are this light green.,I'm told that at mental institutionsnthey use that on the walls. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's like a calming color,,it's not somethingnthat really stimulates you. 
 What you can't see is the computer here,nyou only see the screen,,but the main thing I worrynabout in my computer is --,it doesn't have to be bignand powerful, although I like that --,it really has to be completely silent.,I know people who work for Google,and they have their ownnsmall data center at home,,and I don't do that.,My office is the mostnboring office you'll ever see.,And I sit there alone in the quiet.,If the cat comes up,,it sits in my lap.,And I want to hear the cat purring,,not the sound of the fans in the computer. 
 CA: So this is astonishing,,because working this way,,you're able to run this vastntechnology empire --,it is an empire --,so that's an amazing testamentnto the power of open source. 
 Tell us how you gotnto understand open source,and how it leadnto the development of Linux. 
 LT: I mean, I still work alone.,Really -- I work alone in my house,,often in my bathrobe.,When a photographer shows up, I dress up,,so I have clothes on. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's how I've always worked.,I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.,I did not start Linuxnas a collaborative project.,I started it as onenin a series of many projects,I had done at the time for myself,,partly because I needed the end result,,but even more because I justnenjoyed programming.,So it was about the end of the journey,,which, 25 years later,nwe still have not reached.,But it was really about the factnthat I was looking for a project on my own,and there was no open source,nreally, on my radar at all. 
 And what happened is ...,the project grows and becomes somethingnyou want to show off to people.,Really, this is more of a, "Wow,nlook at what I did!",And trust me -- it was notnthat great back then.,I made it publicly available,,and it wasn't evennopen source at that point.,At that point it was source that was open,nbut there was no intention,behind using the kind of open-sourcenmethodology that we think of today,to improve it.,It was more like,,"Look, I've been workingnon this for half a year,,I'd love to have comments." 
 And other people approached me.,At the University of Helsinki,,I had a friend who was onenof the open source --,it was called mainlyn"free software" back then --,and he actually introduced mento the notion that, hey,,you can use these open-sourcenlicenses that had been around.,And I thought about it for a while.,I was actually worried about the wholencommercial interests coming in.,I mean, that's one of the worriesnI think most people who start out have,,is that they worry about somebodyntaking advantage of their work, right?,And I decided, "What the hell?",And -- 
 CA: And then at some point,,someone contributednsome code that you thought,,"Wow, that really is interesting,nI would not have thought of that.,This could actually improve this." 
 LT: It didn't even startnby people contributing code,,it was more that peoplenstarted contributing ideas.,And just the fact that somebody elsentakes a look at your project --,and I'm sure it's truenof other things, too,,but it's definitely true in code --,is that somebody elsentakes an interest in your code,,looks at it enough to actuallyngive you feedback,and give you ideas.,That was a huge thing for me. 
 I was 21 at the time, so I was young,,but I had already programmednfor half my life, basically.,And every project before thatnhad been completely personal,and it was a revelation when peoplenjust started commenting,,started giving feedback on your code.,And even before they startedngiving code back,,that was, I think, one of the bignmoments where I said,,"I love other people!",Don't get me wrong --,I'm actually not a people person. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't really love other people -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But I love computers,,I love interacting with othernpeople on email,,because it kind of gives you that buffer.,But I do love other people who commentnand get involved in my project.,And it made it so much more. 
 CA: So was there a momentnwhen you saw what was being built,and it suddenly started taking off,,and you thought, "Wait a sec,nthis actually could be something huge,,not just a personal projectnthat I'm getting nice feedback on,,but a kind of explosive developmentnin the whole technology world"? 
 LT: Not really.,I mean, the big point for me, really,nwas not when it was becoming huge,,it was when it was becoming little.,The big point for me was not being alone,and having 10, maybe 100npeople being involved --,that was a big point.,Then everything else was very gradual.,Going from 100 people to a million peoplenis not a big deal -- to me.,Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're -- 
 (Laughter) 
 If you want to sell your resultnthen it's a huge deal --,don't get me wrong.,But if you're interested in the technology,and you're interested in the project,,the big part was getting the community.,Then the community grew gradually.,And there's actually notna single point where I went like,,"Wow, that just took off!" because it --,I mean -- it took a long time, relatively. 
 CA: So all the technologistsnthat I talk to really credit you,with massively changing their work.,And it's not just Linux,,it's this thing called Git,,which is this management systemnfor software development.,Tell us briefly about thatnand your role in that. 
 LT: So one of the issues we had,,and this took a while to start to appear,,is when you ...,When you grow from having 10 peoplenor 100 people working on a project,to having 10,000 people, which --,I mean, right now we're in the situationnwhere just on the kernel,,we have 1,000 people involvednin every single release,and that's every two months,nroughly two or three months.,Some of those people don't do a lot.,There's a lot of peoplenwho make small, small changes. 
 But to maintain this,,the scale changes hownyou have to maintain it.,And we went through a lot of pain.,And there are whole projectsnthat do only source-code maintenance.,CVS is the one that used to benthe most commonly used,,and I hated CVS with a passionnand refused to touch it,and tried something elsenthat was radical and interesting,and everybody else hated. 
 CA: (Laughs) 
 LT: And we were in this bad spot,,where we had thousands of peoplenwho wanted to participate,,but in many ways,nI was the kind of break point,,where I could not scale to the point,where I could worknwith thousands of people. 
 So Git is my second big project,,which was only created for mento maintain my first big project.,And this is literally how I work.,I don't code for --,well, I do code for fun --,but I want to codenfor something meaningful,so every single project I've ever donenhas been something I needed,and -- 
 CA: So really, both Linuxnand Git kind of arose,almost as an unintended consequence,of your desire not to havento work with too many people. 
 LT: Absolutely. Yes. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: That's amazing.nLT: Yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 And yet, you're the mannwho's transformed technology,not just once but twice,,and we have to trynand understand why it is.,You've given us some clues, but ...,Here's a picture of you as a kid,nwith a Rubik's Cube.,You mentioned that you've beennprogramming since you were like 10 or 11,,half your life. 
 Were you this sort of computerngenius, you know, übernerd,,were you the star at schoolnwho could do everything?,What were you like as a kid? 
 LT: Yeah, I think I wasnthe prototypical nerd.,I mean, I was ...,I was not a people person back then.,That's my younger brother.,I was clearly more interestednin the Rubik's Cube,than my younger brother. 
 (Laughter) 
 My younger sister,nwho's not in the picture,,when we had family meetings --,and it's not a huge family, but I have,nlike, a couple of cousins --,she would prep me beforehand.,Like, before I steppedninto the room she would say,,"OK. That's so-and-so ...",Because I was not --,I was a geek.,I was into computers,,I was into math,,I was into physics.,I was good at that.,I don't think I wasnparticularly exceptional.,Apparently, my sister said,that my biggest exceptional qualitynwas that I would not let go. 
 CA: OK, so let's go there,nbecause that's interesting.,You would not let go.,So that's not about beingna geek and being smart,,that's about being ... stubborn? 
 LT: That's about being stubborn.,That's about, like,,just starting something,and not saying, "OK, I'm done,nlet's do something else --,Look: shiny!" 
 And I notice that in manynother parts in my life, too.,I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.,And I worked for the samencompany, in Silicon Valley,,for the whole time.,That is unheard of.,That's not how Silicon Valley works.,The whole point of Silicon Valleynis that people jump between jobs,to kind of mix up the pot.,And that's not the kind of person I am. 
 CA: But during the actualndevelopment of Linux itself,,that stubbornness sometimes broughtnyou in conflict with other people.,Talk about that a bit.,Was that essential to sort of maintainnthe quality of what was being built?,How would you describe what happened? 
 LT: I don't know if it's essential.,Going back to the "I'm notna people person," --,sometimes I'm also ...,shall we say,,"myopic" when it comesnto other people's feelings,,and that sometimes makes younsay things that hurt other people.,And I'm not proud of that. 
 (Applause) 
 But, at the same time, it's --,I get people who tell menthat I should be nice.,And then when I try to explain to themnthat maybe you're nice,,maybe you should be more aggressive,,they see that as me being not nice. 
 (Laughter) 
 What I'm trying to saynis we are different.,I'm not a people person;,it's not somethingnI'm particularly proud of,,but it's part of me.,And one of the thingsnI really like about open source,is it really allows differentnpeople to work together.,We don't have to like each other --,and sometimes we reallyndon't like each other.,Really -- I mean, there are very,nvery heated arguments.,But you can, actually,nyou can find things that --,you don't even agree to disagree,,it's just that you're interestednin really different things. 
 And coming back to the pointnwhere I said earlier,that I was afraid of commercial peoplentaking advantage of your work,,it turned out, and verynquickly turned out,,that those commercial peoplenwere lovely, lovely people.,And they did all the things that I was notnat all interested in doing,,and they had completely different goals.,And they used open source in waysnthat I just did not want to go.,But because it was opennsource they could do it,,and it actually worksnreally beautifully together. 
 And I actually thinknit works the same way.,You need to have the people-people,nthe communicators,,the warm and friendly people,who like -- 
 (Laughter) 
 really want to hug younand get you into the community.,But that's not everybody.,And that's not me.,I care about the technology.,There are people who care about the UI.,I can't do UI to save my life.,I mean, if I was stranded on an island,and the only way to get off that islandnwas the make a pretty UI,,I'd die there. 
 (Laughter) 
 So there's different kinds of people,,and I'm not making excuses,nI'm trying to explain. 
 CA: Now, when we talked last week,,you talked about somenother trait that you have,,which I found really interesting.,It's this idea called taste. 
 And I've just got a couple of images here.,I think this is an example of notnparticularly good taste in code,,and this one is better taste,,which one can immediately see.,What is the difference between these two? 
 LT: So this is --,How many people here actually have coded? 
 CA: Oh my goodness. 
 LT: So I guarantee you,,everybody who raised their hand,,they have done what's calledna singly-linked list.,And it's taught --,This, the first not veryngood taste approach,,is basically how it's taught to be donenwhen you start out coding.,And you don't have to understand the code. 
 The most interesting part to me,is the last if statement.,Because what happensnin a singly-linked list --,this is trying to removenan existing entry from a list --,and there's a differencenbetween if it's the first entry,or whether it's an entry in the middle.,Because if it's the first entry,,you have to changenthe pointer to the first entry.,If it's in the middle,,you have to change the pointernof a previous entry.,So they're two completely different cases. 
 CA: And that's better. 
 LT: And this is better.,It does not have the if statement.,And it doesn't really matter --,I don't want you understandnwhy it doesn't have the if statement,,but I want you to understand,that sometimes you can seena problem in a different way,and rewrite it so thatna special case goes away,and becomes the normal case.,And that's good code.,But this is simple code.,This is CS 101.,This is not important --nalthough, details are important. 
 To me, the sign of peoplenI really want to work with,is that they have good taste,nwhich is how ...,I sent you this stupid example,that is not relevantnbecause it's too small.,Good taste is much bigger than this.,Good taste is about reallynseeing the big patterns,and kind of instinctively knowingnwhat's the right way to do things. 
 CA: OK, so we're puttingnthe pieces together here now.,You have taste,,in a way that's meaningfulnto software people.,You're -- 
 (Laughter) 
 LT: I think it was meaningfulnto some people here. 
 CA: You're a very smart computer coder,,and you're hellish stubborn.,But there must be something else.,I mean, you've changed the future.,You must have the abilitynof these grand visions of the future.,You're a visionary, right? 
 LT: I've actually felt slightlynuncomfortable at TED,for the last two days,,because there's a lotnof vision going on, right?,And I am not a visionary.,I do not have a five-year plan.,I'm an engineer.,And I think it's really --,I mean -- I'm perfectlynhappy with all the people,who are walking aroundnand just staring at the clouds,and looking at the starsnand saying, "I want to go there.",But I'm looking at the ground,,and I want to fix the potholenthat's right in front of me,before I fall in.,This is the kind of person I am. 
 (Cheers) 
 (Applause) 
 CA: So you spoke to me last weeknabout these two guys.,Who are they and howndo you relate to them? 
 LT: Well, so this is kindnof cliché in technology,,the whole Tesla versus Edison,,where Tesla is seen as the visionarynscientist and crazy idea man.,And people love Tesla.,I mean, there are people who namentheir companies after him. 
 (Laughter) 
 The other person there is Edison,,who is actually often vilifiednfor being kind of pedestrian,and is --,I mean, his most famous quote is,,"Genius is one percent inspirationnand 99 percent perspiration.",And I'm in the Edison camp,,even if people don't always like him.,Because if you actually compare the two,,Tesla has kind of this mindngrab these days,,but who actually changed the world?,Edison may not have been a nice person,,he did a lot of things --,he was maybe not so intellectual,,not so visionary.,But I think I'm morenof an Edison than a Tesla. 
 CA: So our theme at TEDnthis week is dreams --,big, bold, audacious dreams.,You're really the antidote to that. 
 LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes. 
 CA: That's good. 
 (Laughter),We embrace you, we embrace you. 
 Companies like Google and manynothers have made, arguably,,like, billions of dollarsnout of your software.,Does that piss you off? 
 LT: No.,No, it doesn't piss me offnfor several reasons.,And one of them is, I'm doing fine.,I'm really doing fine. 
 But the other reason is --,I mean, without doing the wholenopen source and really letting go thing,,Linux would never have been what it is.,And it's brought experiencesnI don't really enjoy, public talking,,but at the same time,nthis is an experience.,Trust me.,So there's a lot of things going onnthat make me a very happy man,and thinking I did the right choices. 
 CA: Is the open source idea --,this is, I think we'll end here --,is the open source ideanfully realized now in the world,,or is there more that it could go,,are there more things that it could do? 
 LT: So, I'm of two minds there.,I think one reason open sourcenworks so well in code,is that at the end of the day,,code tends to be somewhat black and white.,There's often a fairly good way to decide,,this is done correctlynand this is not done well.,Code either works or it doesn't,,which means that there's lessnroom for arguments.,And we have arguments despite this, right?,In many other areas --,I mean, people have talked aboutnopen politics and things like that --,and it's really hard sometimes to say,that, yes, you can apply the samenprinciples in some other areas,just because the black and whitenturns into not just gray,,but different colors. 
 So, obviously open source in sciencenis making a comeback.,Science was there first.,But then science ended upnbeing pretty closed,,with very expensive journalsnand some of that going on.,And open source is makingna comeback in science,,with things like arXiv and open journals.,Wikipedia changed the world, too.,So there are other examples,,I'm sure there are more to come. 
 CA: But you're not a visionary,,and so it's not up to you to name them. 
 LT: No. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's up to you guys to make them, right? 
 CA: Exactly. 
 Linus Torvalds,,thank you for Linux,nthank you for the Internet,,thank you for all those Android phones. 
 Thank you for coming here to TEDnand revealing so much of yourself. 
 LT: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have spent the past 38 yearsntrying to be invisible.,I'm a copy editor.,I work at The New Yorker,,and copyediting for The New Yorkernis like playing shortstop,for a Major League Baseball team:,every little movementngets picked over by the critics --,God forbid you should commit an error. 
 Just to clarify: copy editors don't choosenwhat goes into the magazine.,We work at the level of the sentence,,maybe the paragraph,,the words, the punctuation.,Our business is in the details.,We put the diaeresis, the double dot,nover the "i" in "naïve.",We impose house style.,Every publication has a house style.,The New Yorker'snis particularly distinctive.,We sometimes get teased for our style.,Imagine -- we still spelln"teen-ager" with a hyphen,,as if that word had just been coined.,But you see that hyphen in "teen-age",and that diaeresis over "coöperate,",and you know you're readingnThe New Yorker. 
 Copyediting at The New Yorkernis a mechanical process.,There is a related role callednquery proofreading,,or page-OK'ing.,Whereas copyediting is mechanical,,query proofreading is interpretive.,We make suggestions to the authornthrough the editor,to improve the emphasis of a sentence,or point out unintentional repetitions,and supply compelling alternatives.,Our purpose is to makenthe author look good. 
 Note that we give our proofsnnot directly to the author,,but to the editor.,This often createsna good cop/bad cop dynamic,in which the copy editor -- I'll use thatnas an umbrella term --,is invariably the bad cop.,If we do our job well, we're invisible,,but as soon as we make a mistake,,we copy editors become glaringly visible.,Here is the most recent mistakenthat was laid at my door. 
 [Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin,nthe pre-Trump embodiment,of populist no-nothingismnin the Republican Party,,endorsed Trump.] 
 "Where were The New Yorker's fabledncopy editors?" a reader wrote.,"Didn't the writer meann'know-nothingism'?" 
 Ouch.,There's no excuse for this mistake.,But I like it: "no-nothingism.",It might be Americannvernacular for "nihilism." 
 (Laughter) 
 Here, another reader quotesna passage from the magazine: 
 [Ruby was seventy-six, but she retainednher authoritative bearing;,only her unsteady gait belied her age.] 
 He added:,"Surely, someone at The New Yorkernknows the meaning of 'belied,',and that it is the oppositenof how it is used in this sentence.,Come on! Get it together." 
 Belie: to give a false impression.,It should have been "betrayed." 
 E.B. White once wrotenof commas in The New Yorker:,"They fall with the precisionnof knives outlining a body." 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's true -- we get a lotnof complaints about commas.,"Are there really two commasnin 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?",There may not be on the sign, but yes,nthat is New Yorker style for "Jr.",One wag wrote: 
 ["Please, could you expel,nor, at least, restrain,,the comma-maniac,non your editorial staff?"] 
 (Laughter) 
 Ah, well.,In this case, those commasnare well-placed,,except that there should not be one,between "maniac" and "on." 
 (Laughter) 
 Also, if we must have commasnaround "at least,",we might change it upnby using dashes around that phrase:,"... -- or, at least, restrain --",Perfect. 
 (Applause) 
 Then there's this:,"Love you, love your magazine,,but can you please stop writingnmassive numbers as text?" 
 [two and a half million ...] 
 No. 
 (Laughter) 
 One last cri de coeurnfrom a spelling stickler: 
 ["Those long stringy thingsnare vocal cords, not chords."] 
 The outraged reader added,,"I'm sure I'm not the first to write,regarding this egregiousnproofreading error,,but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.,Fie!" 
 (Laughter) 
 I used to like getting mail. 
 There is a pactnbetween writers and editors.,The editor never sells out the writer,,never goes public about bad jokesnthat had to be cut,or stories that went on too long.,A great editor saves a writernfrom her excesses.,Copy editors, too, have a code;,we don't advertise our oversights.,I feel disloyal divulging them here,,so let's have look at what we do right. 
 Somehow, I've gottenna reputation for sternness.,But I work with writers who knownhow to have their way with me.,I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy,"nsince the early 80s.,And he's one of my favorites,,even though he sometimes writes a sentence,that gives a copy editor pause.,Here is one from a storynabout Staten Island,after Hurricane Sandy: 
 [A dock that had been brokennin the middle and lost its other half,sloped down toward the water,,its support pipes and wiresnleaning forward,like when you open a boxnof linguine and it slides out.] 
 (Laughter) 
 This would never have got pastnthe grammarian in the days of yore.,But what could I do?,Technically, the "like" should be an "as,",but it sounds ridiculous,,as if the author were about to embarknon an extended Homeric simile --,"as when you open a box of linguine." 
 (Laughter) 
 I decided that the hurricanenconferred poetic justice on Sandy,and let the sentence stand. 
 (Laughter) 
 Generally, if I think something is wrong,,I query it three times.,I told Sandy that not long agonin a moment of indiscretion and he said, 
 "Only three?" 
 So, he has learned to hold out. 
 Recently, he wrote a storynfor "Talk of the Town,",that's the sectionnat the front of the magazine,with short pieces on subjectsnranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit,at the Metropolitan Museum,to the introductionnof doggie bags in France.,Sandy's story was aboutnthe return to the Bronx,of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.,There were three thingsnin it that I had to challenge. 
 First, a grammar query.,The justice was wearing blacknand Sandy wrote, 
 [Her face and hands stood outnlike in an old, mostly dark painting.] 
 Now, unlike with the hurricane,,with this "like," the authorndidn't have the excuse,of describing hurricane damage.,"Like" in this sense is a preposition,nand a preposition takes an object,,which is a noun.,This "like" had to be an "as.","As in an old, mostly dark painting." 
 Second, a spelling issue.,The author was quoting someonenwho was assisting the justice: 
 ["It will be just a minute.,We are getting the justice mic'ed,"] 
 Mic'ed?,The music industry spells it "mic",because that's how it's spellednon the equipment.,I'd never seen it usednas a verb with this spelling,,and I was distraughtnto think that "mic'ed",would get into the magazine on my watch. 
 (Laughter) 
 New Yorker style for "microphone"nin its abbreviated form is "mike." 
 Finally, there was a stickyngrammar and usage issue,in which the pronoun has to haventhe same grammatical number,as its antecedent. 
 [everyone in the vicinitynheld their breath] 
 "Their" is plural and "everyone,"nits antecedent, is singular.,You would never say,n"Everyone were there.",Everyone was there. Everyone is here.,But people say things like,n"Everyone held their breath" all the time.,To give it legitimacy,,copy editors call itn"the singular 'their,'",as if calling it singularnmakes it no longer plural. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is my job when I see it in printnto do my best to eliminate it.,I couldn't make it,n"Everyone held her breath,",or "Everyone held his breath,",or "Everyone held his or her breath.",Whatever I suggested had to blend in.,I asked, through the editor,,if the author would consider changing it,to "All in the vicinitynheld their breath,",because "all" is plural.,Nope. 
 I tried again: "All those presentnheld their breath?",I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.,But the editor pointed out,that we could not have "present"nand "presence",in the same sentence.,When the final proof came back,,the author had accepted "as" for "like,",and "miked" for "mic'ed.",But on "Everyone held their breath,"nhe stood his ground.,Two out of three isn't bad. 
 In the same issue,,in that piece on doggie bags in France,,there was the gratuitous usenof the f-word by a Frenchman.,I wonder, when the mail comes in,,which will have offended the readers more. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today's computers are so amazing,that we fail to noticenhow terrible they really are.,I'd like to talk to you todaynabout this problem,,and how we can fix it with neuroscience. 
 First, I'd like to take you backnto a frosty night in Harlem in 2011,that had a profound impact on me.,I was sitting in a dive barnoutside of Columbia University,,where I studied computer sciencenand neuroscience,,and I was having this great conversationnwith a fellow student,about the power of hologramsnto one day replace computers.,And just as we were gettingnto the best part of the conversation,,of course, his phone lights up.,And he pulls it towards himself,nand he looks down and he starts typing.,And then he forces his eyeballsnback up to mine and he goes,,"Keep going. I'm with you.",But of course his eyes were glazed over,,and the moment was dead. 
 Meanwhile across the bar,,I noticed another studentnholding his phone,,this time towards a group.,He was swiping throughnpictures on Instagram,,and these kids were laughing hysterically.,And that dichotomynbetween how crappy I was feeling,and how happy they were feelingnabout the same technology,,really got me thinking.,And the more I thought of it,nthe more I realized,it was clearly not the digital informationnthat was the bad guy here,,it was simply the display positionnthat was separating me from my friend,and that was binding those kids together. 
 See, they were connected around something,,just like our ancestorsnwho evolved their social cognitions,telling stories around the campfire.,And that's exactly what toolsnshould do, I think.,They should extend our bodies.,And I think computers todaynare doing quite the opposite.,Whether you're sendingnan email to your wife,or you're composing a symphony,or just consoling a friend,,you're doing it in prettynmuch the same way.,You're hunched over these rectangles,,fumbling with buttons and menusnand more rectangles.,And I think this is the wrong way,,I think we can start usingna much more natural machine.,We should use machines that bringnour work back into the world.,We should use machines that usenthe principles of neuroscience,to extend our sensesnversus going against them. 
 Now it just so happensnthat I have such a machine here.,It's called the Meta 2.,Let's try it out.,Now in front of me right now,nI can see the audience,,and I can see my very hands.,And in three, two, one,,we're going to see an immersivenhologram appear,,a very realistic hologramnappear in front of me,,of our very glasses I'm wearingnon my head right now.,And of course this could benanything that we're shopping for,or learning from,,and I can use my hands,to very nicely kind of movenit around with fine control.,And I think Iron Man would be proud.,We're going to come backnto this in just a bit. 
 (Applause) 
 Now if you're anything like me,nyour mind is already reeling,with the possibilities of what we can donwith this kind of technology,,so let's look at a few. 
 My mom is an architect,,so naturally the first thing I imagined,was laying out a building in 3D space,instead of having to usenthese 2D floor plans.,She's actually touching graphics right now,and selecting an interior decor.,This was all shot through a GoPronthrough our very glasses. 
 And this next use casenis very personal to me,,it's Professor Adam Gazzaley'snglass brain project,,courtesy of UCSF.,As a neuroscience student,,I would always fantasize,about the ability to learn and memorizenthese complex brain structures,with an actual machine,,where I could touch and playnwith the various brain structures. 
 Now what you're seeingnis called augmented reality,,but to me, it's partnof a much more important story --,a story of how we can beginnto extend our bodies with digital devices,,instead of the other way around. 
 Now ...,in the next few years, humanity'sngoing to go through a shift, I think.,We're going to start puttingnan entire layer of digital information,on the real world.,Just imagine for a moment,what this could mean for storytellers,,for painters,,for brain surgeons,,for interior decorators,and maybe for all of us here today.,And what I think we neednto do as a community,,is really try and make an effort,to imagine how we canncreate this new reality,in a way that extendsnthe human experience,,instead of gamifying our reality,or cluttering it with digital information.,And that's what I'm very passionate about. 
 Now, I want to tell you a little secret.,In about five years --,this is not the smallest device --,in about five years,,these are all going to look likenstrips of glass on our eyes,that project holograms.,And just like we don't care so muchnabout which phone we buy,in terms of the hardware -- we buy itnfor the operating system --,as a neuroscientist,,I always dreamt of buildingnthe iOS of the mind, if you will.,And it's very, very importantnthat we get this right,,because we might be livingninside of these things,for at least as long as we've lived,with the Windows graphical user interface.,And I don't know about you,,but living inside of Windows scares me. 
 (Laughter) 
 To isolate the single most intuitiveninterface out of infinity,,we use neuroscience to drivenour design guidelines,,instead of letting a bunch of designersnfight it out in the boardroom.,And the principle we all revolve around,is what's called the "Neural Pathnof Least Resistance." 
 At every turn, we're connectingnthe iOS of the brain with our brain,on, for the first time, our brain's terms.,In other words, we're trying to createna zero learning-curve computer.,We're building a systemnthat you've always known how to use. 
 Here are the first threendesign guidelines that we employ,in this brand-new form of user experience.,First and foremost,nyou are the operating system.,Traditional file systemsnare complex and abstract,,and they take your brainnextra steps to decode them.,We're going against the Neural Pathnof Least Resistance.,Meanwhile, in augmented reality,,you can of course placenyour holographic TED panel over here,,and your holographic emailnon the other side of the desk,,and your spatial memory evolved just finento go ahead and retrieve them.,You could put your holographic Teslanthat you're shopping for --,or whatever model my legal teamntold me to put in right before the show. 
 (Laughter) 
 Perfect. And your brain knowsnexactly how to get it back. 
 The second interface guidelinenwe call "touch to see.",What do babies do when they seensomething that grabs their interest?,They try and reach out and touch it.,And that's exactly how the naturalnmachine should work as well.,Turns out the visual systemngets a fundamental boost,from a sense we call proprioception --,that's the sensenof our body parts in space.,So by touching our work directly,nwe're not only going to control it better,,we're also going to understandnit much more deeply.,Hence, touch to see. 
 But it's not enoughnto experience things ourselves.,We're inherently these social primates.,And this leads me to our third guideline,,the holographic campfirenfrom our first story. 
 Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests,that we can connect with each othernand with our work much better,if we can see each other'snfaces and hands in 3D.,So if you look at the video behind me,,you can see two Meta usersnplaying around with the same hologram,,making eye contact,nconnected around this thing,,instead of being distractednby external devices. 
 Let's go ahead and try this againnwith neuroscience in mind.,So again, our favorite interface,nthe iOS of the mind.,I'm going to now take a step further,and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses,and leave it right here by the desk.,I'm now with you, I'm in the moment,,we're connecting.,My spatial memory kicks in,nand I can go ahead and grab it,and bring it right back here, reminding me,that I am the operating system.,And now my proprioception is working,,and I can go ahead and explodenthese glasses into a thousand parts,and touch the very sensornthat is currently scanning my hand. 
 But it's not enough to see things alone,,so in a second, my co-founder Raynis going to make a 3D call --,Ray? 
 (Ringing) 
 Hey Ray, how's it going?,Guys, I can see this guynin front me in full 3D.,And he is photo-realistic. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 My mirror-neuron subsystem suggestsnthat this is going to replace phones,in not too long.,Ray, how's it going? 
 Ray: Great. We're live today. 
 (Applause) 
 MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift,of the holographic brainnwe saw from the video earlier.,Guys, this is not onlyngoing to change phones,,it's also going to changenthe way we collaborate. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thanks, Ray. 
 Ray: You're welcome. 
 (Applause) 
 MG: So folks, this is the messagenthat I discovered in that bar in 2011:,The future of computers is notnlocked inside one of these screens.,It's right here, inside of us. 
 (Applause) 
 So if there's one idea that I couldnleave you with here today,,it's that the natural machinenis not some figment of the future,,it's right here in 2016.,Which is why all hundred of us at Meta,,including the administrative staff,,the executives,,the designers, the engineers --,before TED2017,,we're all going to be throwingnaway our external monitors,and replacing them with a trulynand profoundly more natural machine. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, appreciate it.,Thanks, guys. 
 Chris Anderson: So helpnme out on one thing,,because there've been a fewnaugmented reality demos,shown over the last year or so out there.,And there's sometimesna debate among technologists,about, are we really seeingnthe real thing on-screen?,There's this issue of field of view,,that somehow the technologynis showing a broader view,than you would actually seenwearing the glasses.,Were we seeing the real deal there? 
 MG: Absolutely the real deal.,Not only that,,we took extra measures to shoot itnwith a GoPro through the actual lens,in the various videosnthat you've seen here.,We want to try to simulatenthe experience for the world,that we're actually seeingnthrough the glasses,,and not cut any corners. 
 CA: Thank you so much for showing us that. 
 MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.Every weekend for as longnas I can remember,,my father would get up on a Saturday,,put on a worn sweatshirt,and he'd scrape away,at the squeaky old wheelnof a house that we lived in.,I wouldn't even call it restoration;,it was a ritual, catharsis.,He would spend all yearnscraping paint with this old heat gun,and a spackle knife,,and then he would repaintnwhere he scraped,,only to begin again the following year.,Scraping and re-scraping,npainting and repainting:,the work of an old housenis never meant to be done. 
 The day my father turned 52,nI got a phone call.,My mother was on the line,to tell me that doctors had foundna lump in his stomach --,terminal cancer, she told me,,and he had been givennonly three weeks to live. 
 I immediately moved homento Poughkeepsie, New York,,to sit with my father on death watch,,not knowing what the next daysnwould bring us.,To keep myself distracted,,I rolled up my sleeves,,and I went about finishingnwhat he could now no longer complete --,the restoration of our old home. 
 When that looming three-week deadline came,and then went,,he was still alive.,And at three months,,he joined me.,We gutted and repainted the interior.,At six months, the old windowsnwere refinished,,and at 18 months,,the rotted porch was finally replaced. 
 And there was my father,,standing with me outside,nadmiring a day's work,,hair on his head, fully in remission,,when he turned to me and he said,,"You know, Michael,,this house saved my life." 
 So the following year, I decidednto go to architecture school. 
 (Laughter) 
 But there, I learnednsomething different about buildings.,Recognition seemed to come,to those who prioritizednnovel and sculptural forms,,like ribbons, or ...,pickles? 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think thisnis supposed to be a snail. 
 Something about this bothered me.,Why was it that the best architects,nthe greatest architecture --,all beautiful and visionarynand innovative --,is also so rare,,and seems to serve so very few?,And more to the point:,With all of this creative talent,nwhat more could we do? 
 Just as I was about to startnmy final exams,,I decided to take a breaknfrom an all-nighter,and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,,a leading health activistnfor the global poor.,I was surprised to hear a doctorntalking about architecture.,Buildings are makingnpeople sicker, he said,,and for the poorest in the world,,this is causing epidemic-level problems.,In this hospital in South Africa,,patients that came innwith, say, a broken leg,,to wait in this unventilated hallway,,walked out with a multidrug-resistantnstrand of tuberculosis.,Simple designs for infection controlnhad not been thought about,,and people had died because of it. 
 "Where are the architects?" Paul said.,If hospitals are making people sicker,,where are the architects and designers,to help us build and designnhospitals that allow us to heal? 
 That following summer,,I was in the back of a Land Rovernwith a few classmates,,bumping over the mountainousnhillside of Rwanda.,For the next year, I'd be living in Butaronin this old guesthouse,,which was a jail after the genocide.,I was there to design and buildna new type of hospital,with Dr. Farmer and his team.,If hallways are making patients sicker,,what if we could design a hospitalnthat flips the hallways on the outside,,and makes people walk in the exterior?,If mechanical systems rarely work,,what if we could design a hospitalnthat could breathe,through natural ventilation,,and meanwhile reducenits environmental footprint? 
 And what about the patients' experience?,Evidence showsnthat a simple view of nature,can radically improve health outcomes,,So why couldn't we design a hospital,where every patientnhad a window with a view?,Simple, site-specific designsncan make a hospital that heals. 
 Designing it is one thing;,getting it built, we learned,nis quite another. 
 We worked with Bruce Nizeye,,a brilliant engineer,,and he thought aboutnconstruction differently,than I had been taught in school.,When we had to excavatenthis enormous hilltop,and a bulldozer was expensivenand hard to get to site,,Bruce suggested doing it by hand,,using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe,",which means "community worksnfor the community.",Hundreds of people camenwith shovels and hoes,,and we excavated that hill,in half the time and halfnthe cost of that bulldozer.,Instead of importing furniture,nBruce started a guild,,and he brought innmaster carpenters to train others,in how to make furniture by hand.,And on this job site,,15 years after the Rwandan genocide,,Bruce insisted that we bring onnlabor from all backgrounds,,and that half of them be women. 
 Bruce was usingnthe process of building to heal,,not just for those who were sick,,but for the entire community as a whole.,We call this the locally fabricatednway of building, or "lo-fab,",and it has four pillars:,hire locally,,source regionally,,train where you can,and most importantly,,think about every design decisionnas an opportunity,to invest in the dignitynof the places where you serve.,Think of it like the local food movement,,but for architecture.,And we're convincednthat this way of building,can be replicated across the world,,and change the way we talk aboutnand evaluate architecture. 
 Using the lo-fab way of building,,even aesthetic decisionsncan be designed to impact people's lives.,In Butaro, we chose to usena local volcanic stone,found in abundance within the area,,but often consideredna nuisance by farmers,,and piled on the side of the road.,We worked with these masonsnto cut these stones,and form them into the wallsnof the hospital.,And when they began on this corner,and wrapped around the entire hospital,,they were so good at puttingnthese stones together,,they asked us if they could take downnthe original wall and rebuild it.,And you see what is possible.,It's beautiful.,And the beauty, to me,,comes from the fact that I knownthat hands cut these stones,,and they formed them into this thick wall,,made only in this placenwith rocks from this soil. 
 When you go outside todaynand you look at your built world,,ask not only:,"What is the environmental footprint?" --nan important question --,but what if we also asked,,"What is the human handprintnof those who made it?" 
 We started a new practicenbased around these questions,,and we tested it around the world.,Like in Haiti,,where we asked if a new hospitalncould help end the epidemic of cholera.,In this 100-bed hospital,,we designed a simple strategy,to clean contaminated medical wastenbefore it enters the water table,,and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO,are already saving lives because of it. 
 Or Malawi:,we asked if a birthing centerncould radically reduce,maternal and infant mortality.,Malawi has one of the highest ratesnof maternal and infant death,in the world.,Using a simple strategynto be replicated nationally,,we designed a birthing center,that would attract womennand their attendants,to come to the hospital earliernand therefore have safer births. 
 Or in the Congo, where we asked,if an educational centerncould also be used,to protect endangered wildlife.,Poaching for ivory and bushmeat,is leading to global epidemic,ndisease transfer and war.,In one of the hardest-to-reachnplaces in the world,,we used the mud and the dirtnand the wood around us,to construct a center,that would show us ways to protectnand conserve our rich biodiversity. 
 Even here in the US,,we were asked to rethink,the largest university for the deafnand hard of hearing in the world.,The deaf community, through sign language,,shows us the powernof visual communication.,We designed a campusnthat would awaken the ways,in which we as humans all communicate,,both verbally and nonverbally. 
 And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,,we thought about oldnindustrial infrastructure.,We wondered:,Could we use arts and culturenand design to revitalize this city,and other Rust Belt citiesnacross our nation,,and turn them into centersnfor innovation and growth?,In each of these projects,nwe asked a simple question:,What more can architecture do?,And by asking that question,,we were forced to considernhow we could create jobs,,how we could source regionally,and how we could investnin the dignity of the communities,in which we serve. 
 I have learned,that architecture can bena transformative engine for change. 
 About a year ago, I read an article,about a tireless and intrepidncivil rights leader,named Bryan Stevenson. 
 (Applause) 
 And Bryan had a bold architectural vision.,He and his team had been documenting,the over 4,000 lynchingsnof African-Americans,that have happened in the American South.,And they had a plan to mark every countynwhere these lynchings occurred,,and build a national memorialnto the victims of lynching,in Montgomery, Alabama. 
 Countries like Germany and South Africa,and, of course, Rwanda,,have found it necessary to build memorials,to reflect on the atrocitiesnof their past,,in order to heal their national psyche.,We have yet to do thisnin the United States. 
 So I sent a cold emailnto info@equaljusticeintiative.org:,"Dear Bryan," it said,,"I think your building project,is maybe the most importantnproject we could do in America,and could change the waynwe think about racial injustice.,By any chance,,do you know who will design it?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Surprisingly, shockingly,,Bryan got right back to me,,and invited me down to meetnwith his team and talk to them.,Needless to say,nI canceled all my meetings,and I jumped on a planento Montgomery, Alabama.,When I got there,,Bryan and his team picked me up,nand we walked around the city.,And they took the time to point out,the many markers that havenbeen placed all over the city,to the history of the Confederacy,,and the very few that marknthe history of slavery. 
 And then he walked me to a hill.,It overlooked the whole city.,He pointed out the rivernand the train tracks,where the largest domesticnslave-trading port in America,had once prospered.,And then to the Capitol rotunda,,where George Wallacenhad stood on its steps,and proclaimed, "Segregation forever.",And then to the very hill below us.,He said, "Here we will buildna new memorial,that will change the identitynof this city and of this nation." 
 Our two teams have workedntogether over the last year,to design this memorial.,The memorial will take us on a journey,through a classical,nalmost familiar building type,,like the Parthenonnor the colonnade at the Vatican.,But as we enter,,the ground drops below usnand our perception shifts,,where we realize that these columnsnevoke the lynchings,,which happened in the public square.,And as we continue,,we begin to understand the vast number,of those who have yet to be put to rest.,Their names will be engravednon the markers that hang above us.,And just outside will be a fieldnof identical columns.,But these are temporary columns,nwaiting in purgatory,,to be placed in the very countiesnwhere these lynchings occurred.,Over the next few years,,this site will bear witness,,as each of these markers is claimed,and visibly placed in those counties.,Our nation will begin to healnfrom over a century of silence. 
 When we think aboutnhow it should be built,,we were reminded of Ubudehe,,the building processnwe learned about in Rwanda.,We wondered if we could fillnthose very columns,with the soil from the sitesnof where these killings occurred.,Brian and his team have begunncollecting that soil,and preserving it in individual jars,with family members, communitynleaders and descendants.,The act of collecting soil itself,has lead to a type of spiritual healing.,It's an act of restorative justice. 
 As one EJI team member noted,in the collection of the soilnfrom where Will McBride was lynched,,"If Will McBride left one drop of sweat,,one drop of blood,,one hair follicle --,I pray that I dug it up,,and that his whole bodynwould be at peace." 
 We plan to break groundnon this memorial later this year,,and it will be a place to finally speaknof the unspeakable acts,that have scarred this nation. 
 (Applause) 
 When my father told menthat day that this house --,our house --,had saved his life,,what I didn't know,was that he was referringnto a much deeper relationship,between architecture and ourselves.,Buildings are not simplynexpressive sculptures.,They make visible our personalnand our collective aspirations,as a society.,Great architecture can give us hope.,Great architecture can heal. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I want you to reimaginenhow life is organized on earth.,Think of the planetnlike a human body that we inhabit.,The skeleton is the transportation systemnof roads and railways,,bridges and tunnels, air and seaports,that enable our mobilitynacross the continents.,The vascular system that powers the body,are the oil and gas pipelinesnand electricity grids.,that distribute energy.,And the nervous system of communications,is the Internet cables,nsatellites, cellular networks,and data centers that allownus to share information. 
 This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix,already consists of 64 millionnkilometers of roads,,four million kilometers of railways,,two million kilometers of pipelines,and one million kilometersnof Internet cables.,What about international borders?,We have less thann500,000 kilometers of borders. 
 Let's build a better map of the world.,And we can start by overcomingnsome ancient mythology.,There's a saying with whichnall students of history are familiar:,"Geography is destiny.",Sounds so grave, doesn't it?,It's such a fatalistic adage.,It tells us that landlocked countriesnare condemned to be poor,,that small countriesncannot escape their larger neighbors,,that vast distances are insurmountable.,But every journey I take around the world,,I see an even greater forcensweeping the planet:,connectivity. 
 The global connectivity revolution,nin all of its forms --,transportation, energynand communications --,has enabled such a quantum leapnin the mobility of people,,of goods, of resources, of knowledge,,such that we can no longer even thinknof geography as distinct from it.,In fact, I view the two forcesnas fusing together,into what I call "connectography." 
 Connectography represents a quantum leap,in the mobility of people,nresources and ideas,,but it is an evolution,,an evolution of the worldnfrom political geography,,which is how we legally divide the world,,to functional geography,,which is how we actually use the world,,from nations and borders,nto infrastructure and supply chains. 
 Our global system is evolving,from the vertically integratednempires of the 19th century,,through the horizontally interdependentnnations of the 20th century,,into a global network civilizationnin the 21st century.,Connectivity, not sovereignty,,has become the organizing principlenof the human species. 
 (Applause) 
 We are becomingnthis global network civilization,because we are literally building it.,All of the world's defense budgetsnand military spending taken together,total just underntwo trillion dollars per year.,Meanwhile, our globalninfrastructure spending,is projected to risento nine trillion dollars per year,within the coming decade.,And, well, it should.,We have been livingnoff an infrastructure stock,meant for a world populationnof three billion,,as our population has crossednseven billion to eight billion,and eventually nine billion and more.,As a rule of thumb, we should spendnabout one trillion dollars,on the basic infrastructure needsnof every billion people in the world. 
 Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.,In 2015, China announced the creation,of the Asian InfrastructurenInvestment Bank,,which together with a networknof other organizations,aims to construct a networknof iron and silk roads,,stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon. 
 And as all of this topographicalnengineering unfolds,,we will likely spend morenon infrastructure in the next 40 years,,we will build more infrastructurenin the next 40 years,,than we have in the past 4,000 years. 
 Now let's stop and thinknabout it for a minute.,Spending so much more on buildingnthe foundations of global society,rather than on the tools to destroy it,can have profound consequences.,Connectivity is hownwe optimize the distribution,of people and resources around the world.,It is how mankind comes to be morenthan just the sum of its parts.,I believe that is what is happening. 
 Connectivity has a twin megatrendnin the 21st century:,planetary urbanization.,Cities are the infrastructuresnthat most define us.,By 2030, more than two thirdsnof the world's population,will live in cities.,And these are notnmere little dots on the map,,but they are vast archipelagosnstretching hundreds of kilometers. 
 Here we are in Vancouver,,at the head of the Cascadia Corridor,that stretches southnacross the US border to Seattle.,The technology powerhousenof Silicon Valley,begins north of San Franciscondown to San Jose,and across the bay to Oakland.,The sprawl of Los Angelesnnow passes San Diego,across the Mexican border to Tijuana.,San Diego and Tijuanannow share an airport terminal,where you can exit into either country.,Eventually, a high-speed rail networknmay connect the entire Pacific spine.,America's northeastern megalopolisnbegins in Boston through New York,and Philadelphia to Washington.,It contains more than 50 million people,and also has plansnfor a high-speed rail network. 
 But Asia is where we really seenthe megacities coming together.,This continuous strip of lightnfrom Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka,contains more than 80 million people,and most of Japan's economy.,It is the world's largest megacity.,For now. 
 But in China, megacity clustersnare coming together,with populationsnreaching 100 million people.,The Bohai Rim around Beijing,,The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai,and the Pearl River Delta,,stretching from Hong Kongnnorth to Guangzhou.,And in the middle,,the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,,whose geographic footprintnis almost the same size,as the country of Austria. 
 And any number of these megacity clusters,has a GDP approachingntwo trillion dollars --,that's almost the samenas all of India today.,So imagine if our global diplomaticninstitutions, such as the G20,,were to base their membershipnon economic size,rather than national representation.,Some Chinese megacitiesnmay be in and have a seat at the table,,while entire countries,nlike Argentina or Indonesia would be out. 
 Moving to India, whose populationnwill soon exceed that of China,,it too has a number of megacity clusters,,such as the Delhi Capital Region,and Mumbai.,In the Middle East,,Greater Tehran is absorbingnone third of Iran's population.,Most of Egypt's 80 million people,live in the corridornbetween Cairo and Alexandria.,And in the gulf, a necklacenof city-states is forming,,from Bahrain and Qatar,,through the United Arab Emiratesnto Muscat in Oman. 
 And then there's Lagos,,Africa's largest citynand Nigeria's commercial hub.,It has plans for a rail network,that will make it the anchornof a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,,stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,,to Abidjan, the capitalnof the Ivory Coast. 
 But these countries are suburbs of Lagos.,In a megacity world,,countries can be suburbs of cities.,By 2030, we will have as manynas 50 such megacity clusters in the world.,So which map tells you more?,Our traditional mapnof 200 discrete nations,that hang on most of our walls,,or this map of the 50 megacity clusters? 
 And yet, even this is incomplete,because you cannot understandnany individual megacity,without understandingnits connections to the others.,People move to cities to be connected,,and connectivitynis why these cities thrive.,Any number of them,nsuch as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,,has a GDP approaching or exceedingnone third of one half,of their entire national GDP. 
 But equally importantly,,you cannot calculatenany of their individual value,without understandingnthe role of the flows of people,,of finance, of technology,that enable them to thrive.,Take the Gauteng province of South Africa,,which contains Johannesburgnand the capital Pretoria.,It too represents just overna third of South Africa's GDP.,But equally importantly,nit is home to the offices,of almost every singlenmultinational corporation,that invests directly into South Africa,and indeed, into the entirenAfrican continent. 
 Cities want to be partnof global value chains.,They want to be partnof this global division of labor.,That is how cities think.,I've never met a mayor who said to me,,"I want my city to be cut off.",They know that their cities belong as much,to the global network civilizationnas to their home countries. 
 Now, for many people,nurbanization causes great dismay.,They think cities are wrecking the planet.,But right now,,there are more than 200nintercity learning networks thriving.,That is as many as the numbernof intergovernmental organizations,that we have.,And all of these intercity networksnare devoted to one purpose,,mankind's number one prioritynin the 21st century:,sustainable urbanization. 
 Is it working?,Let's take climate change.,We know that summit after summitnin New York and Paris,is not going to reducengreenhouse gas emissions.,But what we can seenis that transferring technology,and knowledge and policies between cities,is how we've actually begun to reducenthe carbon intensity of our economies. 
 Cities are learning from each other.,How to install zero-emissions buildings,,how to deploy electricncar-sharing systems.,In major Chinese cities,,they're imposing quotasnon the number of cars on the streets.,In many Western cities,,young people don't evennwant to drive anymore.,Cities have been part of the problem,,now they are part of the solution. 
 Inequality is the other great challengento achieving sustainable urbanization.,When I travel through megacitiesnfrom end to end --,it takes hours and days --,I experience the tragedynof extreme disparity,within the same geography.,And yet, our global stocknof financial assets,has never been larger,,approaching 300 trillion dollars.,That's almost four timesnthe actual GDP of the world. 
 We have taken on such enormous debtsnsince the financial crisis,,but have we invested themnin inclusive growth?,No, not yet.,Only when we build sufficient,naffordable public housing,,when we invest in robustntransportation networks,to allow people to connect to each othernboth physically and digitally,,that's when our dividedncities and societies,will come to feel whole again. 
 (Applause) 
 And that is why infrastructurenhas just been included,in the United NationsnSustainable Development Goals,,because it enables all the others.,Our political and economic leaders,are learning that connectivitynis not charity,,it's opportunity.,And that's why our financial communitynneeds to understand,that connectivity is the mostnimportant asset class of the 21st century. 
 Now, cities can make the worldnmore sustainable,,they can make the world more equitable,,I also believe thatnconnectivity between cities,can make the world more peaceful.,If we look at regions of the worldnwith dense relations across borders,,we see more trade, more investment,and more stability.,We all know the storynof Europe after World War II,,where industrial integrationnkicked off a process,that gave rise to today'snpeaceful European Union.,And you can see that Russia, by the way,,is the least connected of major powersnin the international system.,And that goes a long wayntowards explaining the tensions today.,Countries that havenless stake in the system,also have less to lose in disturbing it.,In North America, the linesnthat matter most on the map,are not the US-Canada bordernor the US-Mexico border,,but the dense network of roadsnand railways and pipelines,and electricity gridsnand even water canals,that are forming an integratednNorth American union.,North America does not need more walls,nit needs more connections. 
 (Applause) 
 But the real promise of connectivitynis in the postcolonial world.,All of those regions where bordersnhave historically been the most arbitrary,and where generations of leaders,have had hostile relationsnwith each other.,But now a new group of leadersnhas come into power,and is burying the hatchet. 
 Let's take Southeast Asia,nwhere high-speed rail networks,are planned to connectnBangkok to Singapore,and trade corridorsnfrom Vietnam to Myanmar.,Now this region of 600 million peoplencoordinates its agricultural resources,and its industrial output.,It is evolvingninto what I call a Pax Asiana,,a peace among Southeast Asian nations. 
 A similar phenomenonnis underway in East Africa,,where a half dozen countries,are investing in railwaysnand multimodal corridors,so that landlocked countriesncan get their goods to market.,Now these countriesncoordinate their utilities,and their investment policies.,They, too, are evolvingninto a Pax Africana. 
 One region we know couldnespecially use this kind of thinking,is the Middle East.,As Arab states tragically collapse,,what is left behindnbut the ancient cities,,such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?,In fact, the nearlyn400 million people of the Arab world,are almost entirely urbanized.,As societies, as cities,,they are either water rich or water poor,,energy rich or energy poor.,And the only waynto correct these mismatches,is not through more wars and more borders,,but through more connectivitynof pipelines and water canals.,Sadly, this is not yetnthe map of the Middle East.,But it should be,,a connected Pax Arabia,,internally integrated,and productively connectednto its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa. 
 Now, it may not seem like connectivitynis what we want right now,towards the world's most turbulent region.,But we know from historynthat more connectivity is the only way,to bring about stability in the long run.,Because we knownthat in region after region,,connectivity is the new reality.,Cities and countriesnare learning to aggregate,into more peaceful and prosperous wholes. 
 But the real test is going to be Asia.,Can connectivity overcomenthe patterns of rivalry,among the great powers of the Far East?,After all, this is where World War IIInis supposed to break out.,Since the end of the Cold War,na quarter century ago,,at least six major warsnhave been predicted for this region.,But none have broken out. 
 Take China and Taiwan.,In the 1990s, this was everyone'snleading World War III scenario.,But since that time,,the trade and investment volumesnacross the straits have become so intense,that last November,,leaders from both sidesnheld a historic summit,to discuss eventualnpeaceful reunification.,And even the electionnof a nationalist party in Taiwan,that's pro-independence earlier this year,does not underminenthis fundamental dynamic. 
 China and Japan havenan even longer history of rivalry,and have been deployingntheir air forces and navies,to show their strength in island disputes.,But in recent years,,Japan has been makingnits largest foreign investments in China.,Japanese cars are sellingnin record numbers there.,And guess wherenthe largest number of foreigners,residing in Japan today comes from?,You guessed it: China. 
 China and India have fought a major war,and have three outstandingnborder disputes,,but today India is the secondnlargest shareholder,in the Asian InfrastructurenInvestment Bank.,They're building a trade corridornstretching from Northeast India,through Myanmar and Bangladeshnto Southern China.,Their trade volume has grownnfrom 20 billion dollars a decade ago,to 80 billion dollars today. 
 Nuclear-armed India and Pakistannhave fought three wars,and continue to dispute Kashmir,,but they're also negotiatingna most-favored-nation trade agreement,and want to complete a pipeline,stretching from Irannthrough Pakistan to India. 
 And let's talk about Iran.,Wasn't it just two years agonthat war with Iran seemed inevitable?,Then why is every single major powernrushing to do business there today? 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,I cannot guaranteenthat World War III will not break out.,But we can definitely seenwhy it hasn't happened yet.,Even though Asia is homento the world's fastest growing militaries,,these same countriesnare also investing billions of dollars,in each other's infrastructurenand supply chains.,They are more interestednin each other's functional geography,than in their political geography.,And that is why their leaders think twice,nstep back from the brink,,and decide to focus on economic tiesnover territorial tensions. 
 So often it seemsnlike the world is falling apart,,but building more connectivity,is how we put Humpty Dumptynback together again,,much better than before.,And by wrapping the world,in such seamless physicalnand digital connectivity,,we evolve towards a world,in which people can risenabove their geographic constraints.,We are the cells and vessels,pulsing through these globalnconnectivity networks. 
 Everyday, hundreds of millionsnof people go online,and work with people they've never met.,More than one billion peoplencross borders every year,,and that's expected to risento three billion in the coming decade. 
 We don't just build connectivity,,we embody it.,We are the global network civilization,,and this is our map.,A map of the world in whichngeography is no longer destiny.,Instead, the futurenhas a new and more hopeful motto:,connectivity is destiny. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So a few years ago,,I did something really brave,,or some would say really stupid.,I ran for Congress. 
 For years, I had existednsafely behind the scenes in politics,as a fundraiser, as an organizer,,but in my heart, I always wanted to run.,The sitting congresswomannhad been in my district since 1992.,She had never lost a race,,and no one had really even run against hernin a Democratic primary.,But in my mind, this was my way,to make a difference,,to disrupt the status quo.,The polls, however,ntold a very different story.,My pollsters told menthat I was crazy to run,,that there was no way that I could win. 
 But I ran anyway,,and in 2012, I became an upstartnin a New York City congressional race.,I swore I was going to win.,I had the endorsementnfrom the New York Daily News,,the Wall Street Journalnsnapped pictures of me on election day,,and CNBC called it one of the hottestnraces in the country.,I raised money from everyone I knew,,including Indian aunties,that were just so happynan Indian girl was running.,But on election day, the polls were right,,and I only got 19 percent of the vote,,and the same papersnthat said I was a rising political star,now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars,on 6,321 votes.,Don't do the math.,It was humiliating. 
 Now, before you get the wrong idea,,this is not a talknabout the importance of failure.,Nor is it about leaning in.,I tell you the storynof how I ran for Congress,because I was 33 years old,and it was the first timenin my entire life,that I had done somethingnthat was truly brave,,where I didn't worry about being perfect. 
 And I'm not alone:,so many women I talk to tell me,that they gravitatentowards careers and professions,that they knownthey're going to be great in,,that they know they'rengoing to be perfect in,,and it's no wonder why.,Most girls are taughtnto avoid risk and failure.,We're taught to smile pretty,,play it safe, get all A's.,Boys, on the other hand,,are taught to play rough, swing high,,crawl to the top of the monkey barsnand then just jump off headfirst.,And by the time they're adults,,whether they're negotiating a raisenor even asking someone out on a date,,they're habituatednto take risk after risk.,They're rewarded for it.,It's often said in Silicon Valley,,no one even takes you seriouslynunless you've had two failed start-ups.,In other words,,we're raising our girls to be perfect,,and we're raising our boys to be brave. 
 Some people worrynabout our federal deficit,,but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.,Our economy, our society,nwe're just losing out,because we're not raisingnour girls to be brave.,The bravery deficit is whynwomen are underrepresented in STEM,,in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,,and pretty much everywhere you look. 
 In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck,looked at how bright fifth gradersnhandled an assignment,that was too difficult for them.,She found that bright girlsnwere quick to give up.,The higher the IQ,nthe more likely they were to give up.,Bright boys, on the other hand,,found the difficult materialnto be a challenge.,They found it energizing.,They were more likelynto redouble their efforts. 
 What's going on?,Well, at the fifth grade level,,girls routinely outperform boysnin every subject,,including math and science,,so it's not a question of ability.,The difference is in how boysnand girls approach a challenge.,And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.,An HP report foundnthat men will apply for a job,if they meet only 60 percentnof the qualifications,,but women, women will apply,only if they meet 100 percentnof the qualifications.,100 percent.,This study is usually invokednas evidence that, well,,women need a little more confidence.,But I think it's evidence,that women have been socializednto aspire to perfection,,and they're overly cautious. 
 (Applause) 
 And even when we're ambitious,,even when we're leaning in,,that socialization of perfection,has caused us to takenless risks in our careers.,And so those 600,000 jobsnthat are open right now,in computing and tech,,women are being left behind,,and it means our economynis being left behind,on all the innovation and problemsnwomen would solve,if they were socialized to be brave,instead of socialized to be perfect. 
 (Applause) 
 So in 2012, I started a companynto teach girls to code,,and what I foundnis that by teaching them to code,I had socialized them to be brave.,Coding, it's an endless processnof trial and error,,of trying to get the right commandnin the right place,,with sometimes just a semicolon,making the differencenbetween success and failure.,Code breaks and then it falls apart,,and it often takes many, many tries,until that magical moment,when what you're tryingnto build comes to life.,It requires perseverance.,It requires imperfection. 
 We immediately see in our program,our girls' fear of not getting it right,,of not being perfect.,Every Girls Who Code teacherntells me the same story.,During the first week,nwhen the girls are learning how to code,,a student will call her overnand she'll say,,"I don't know what code to write.",The teacher will look at her screen,,and she'll see a blank text editor.,If she didn't know any better,nshe'd think that her student,spent the past 20 minutesnjust staring at the screen.,But if she presses undo a few times,,she'll see that her studentnwrote code and then deleted it.,She tried, she came close,,but she didn't get it exactly right.,Instead of showingnthe progress that she made,,she'd rather show nothing at all.,Perfection or bust. 
 It turns out that our girlsnare really good at coding,,but it's not enoughnjust to teach them to code. 
 My friend Lev Brie, who is a professornat the University of Columbia,and teaches intro to Java,tells me about his office hoursnwith computer science students.,When the guys are strugglingnwith an assignment,,they'll come in and they'll say,,"Professor, there's somethingnwrong with my code.",The girls will come in and say,,"Professor, there's somethingnwrong with me." 
 We have to begin to undonthe socialization of perfection,,but we've got to combine itnwith building a sisterhood,that lets girls knownthat they are not alone.,Because trying hardernis not going to fix a broken system.,I can't tell you how many women tell me, 
 "I'm afraid to raise my hand,,I'm afraid to ask a question,,because I don't want to be the only one,who doesn't understand,,the only one who is struggling.,When we teach girls to be brave,and we have a supportive networkncheering them on,,they will build incredible things,,and I see this every day.,Take, for instance,ntwo of our high school students,who built a game called Tampon Run --,yes, Tampon Run --,to fight against the menstruation taboo,and sexism in gaming.,Or the Syrian refugee,who dared show her lovenfor her new country,by building an appnto help Americans get to the polls.,Or a 16-year-old girlnwho built an algorithm,to help detect whether a cancernis benign or malignant,in the off chancenthat she can save her daddy's life,because he has cancer.,These are justnthree examples of thousands,,thousands of girls who have beennsocialized to be imperfect,,who have learned to keep trying,nwho have learned perseverance.,And whether they become coders,or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,,they will not defer their dreams. 
 And those dreams have never beennmore important for our country.,For the American economy,nfor any economy to grow,,to truly innovate,,we cannot leave behindnhalf our population.,We have to socialize our girlsnto be comfortable with imperfection,,and we've got to do it now.,We cannot wait for themnto learn how to be brave like I did,when I was 33 years old.,We have to teach themnto be brave in schools,and early in their careers,,when it has the most potentialnto impact their lives,and the lives of others,,and we have to show themnthat they will be loved and accepted,not for being perfect,but for being courageous.,And so I need each of younto tell every young woman you know --,your sister, your niece,nyour employee, your colleague --,to be comfortable with imperfection,,because when we teachngirls to be imperfect,,and we help them leverage it,,we will build a movementnof young women who are brave,and who will buildna better world for themselves,and for each and every one of us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.,It's such a powerful vision you have.nYou have a vision.,Tell me how it's going.,How many girlsnare involved now in your program? 
 Reshma Saujani: Yeah.nSo in 2012, we taught 20 girls.,This year we'll teach 40,000nin all 50 states. 
 (Applause) 
 And that number is really powerful,,because last year we only graduatedn7,500 women in computer science.,Like, the problem is so bad,that we can makenthat type of change quickly. 
 CA: And you're working with somenof the companies in this room even,,who are welcomingngraduates from your program? 
 RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,,from Twitter to Facebook,to Adobe to IBM to Microsoftnto Pixar to Disney,,I mean, every single company out there.,And if you're not signed up,nI'm going to find you,,because we need every single tech company,to embed a Girls Who Codenclassroom in their office. 
 CA: And you have some storiesnback from some of those companies,that when you mix in more gender balance,in the engineering teams,ngood things happen. 
 RS: Great things happen.,I mean, I think that it's crazy to mento think about the fact,that right now 85 percent of allnconsumer purchases are made by women.,Women use social media at a ratenof 600 percent more than men.,We own the Internet,,and we should be buildingnthe companies of tomorrow.,And I think when companiesnhave diverse teams,,and they have incredible womennthat are part of their engineering teams,,they build awesome things,nand we see it every day. 
 CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.nYou're doing incredibly important work.,This whole community is cheering you on.nMore power to you. Thank you. 
 RS: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Have you ever been askednby your Chinese friend,,"What is your zodiac sign?",Don't think they are making small talk.,If you say, "I'm a Monkey,",they immediately know,you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old. 
 (Laughter),Asking a zodiac sign is a polite waynof asking your age. 
 By revealing your zodiac sign,nyou are also being evaluated.,Judgments are being madenabout your fortune or misfortune,,your personality, career prospects,and how you will do in a given year.,If you share you and yournpartner's animal signs,,they will paint a picture in their mindnabout your private life.,Maybe you don't believenin the Chinese zodiac.,As a quarter of the world populationnis influenced by it,,you'd be wise to do something about that. 
 So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?,Most Westerners thinknof Greco-Roman zodiac,,the signs divided into 12 months.,The Chinese zodiac is different.,It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,,starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,,and has no associationnwith constellations.,For example, if you were bornnin 1975, you are a Rabbit.,Can you see your zodiac sign there?,Our Chinese ancestors constructedna very complicated theoretical framework,based on yin and yang, the five elementsnand the 12 zodiac animals.,Over thousands of years,,this popular culture has affectednpeople's major decisions,,such as naming, marriage, giving birthnand attitude towards each other.,And some of the implicationsnare quite amazing. 
 The Chinese believe certain animalsnget on better than the others.,So parents choose specific yearsnto give birth to babies,,because they believe the team effortnby the right combination of animals,can give prosperity to families.,We even refer to the zodiacnwhen entering into romantic relations.,I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romancenwith Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.,Chinese people believe some animalsnare natural enemies.,As a Pig, I neednto be careful with a Snake.,Raise your hand if you are a Snake.,Let's have a chat later. 
 (Laughter) 
 We believe some animalsnare luckier than the others,,such as the Dragon.,Unlike the Western tradition,,the Chinese Dragon is a symbolnfor power, strength and wealth.,It's everyone's dreamnto have a Dragon baby.,Jack Ma's parentsnmust have been very proud.,And they are not the only ones.,In 2012, the Year of the Dragon,,the birthrate in China,nHong Kong and Taiwan,increased by five percent.,That means anothernone million more babies.,With a traditionalnpreference to baby boys,,the boy-girl ratio that yearnwas 120 to 100.,When those Dragon boys grow up,,they will face much more severencompetition in love and job markets. 
 According to the BBC and the Chinesengovernment's press release,,January 2015 saw a peaknof Cesarean sections.,Why?,That was the last monthnfor the Year of the Horse.,It's not because they like horses so much,,it's because they try to avoidnhaving unlucky Goat babies. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.,Those are Goat babies.,They don't look like losers to me. 
 (Laughter) 
 Tiger is another undesirable animal,,due to its volatile temperament.,Many Chinese regionsnsaw a sharp decline of birthrate,during those years.,Perhaps one should considernzodiac in reverse,,as those Tiger and Goat babiesnwill face much less competition.,Maybe they are the lucky ones.,I went through the Forbesntop 300 richest people in the world,,and it's interesting to see,the most undesirable two animals,nthe Goat and Tiger,,are at the top of the chart,,even higher than the Dragon.,So maybe we should consider,,maybe it's much betternto have less competition. 
 One last but interesting point:,many Chinese people makentheir investment decisions,based on the zodiac sign index.,Although the belief and traditionnof the zodiac sign,has been over thousands of years,,the trend of using itnin making major decisions,did not really happennuntil the past few decades.,Our ancestors were very busynsurviving poverty, drought,,famine, riot, disease and civil war.,And finally, Chinese peoplenhave the time, wealth and technology,to create an ideal lifenthey've always wanted.,The collective decisionnmade by 1.3 billion people,has caused the fluctuation in economicsnand demand on everything,,from health care and educationnto property and consumer goods.,As China plays such an important rolenin the global economy and geopolitics,,the decisions made based on the zodiacnand other Chinese traditions,end up impacting everyonenaround the world. 
 Are there any Monkeys here?,2016 is the Year of the Monkey.,Monkeys are clever, curious,ncreative and mischievous. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When we're designing new products,,services or businesses,,the only time you'll knownif they're any good,,if the designs are good,,is to see how they're usednin the real world, in context. 
 I'm reminded of that every timenI walk past Highbury Fields,in north London.,It's absolutely beautiful.,There's a big open green space.,There's Georgian buildingsnaround the side.,But then there's this mud trapnthat cuts across the middle.,People clearly don't want to walknall the way around the edge.,Instead, they want to take the shortcut,,and that shortcut is self-reinforcing. 
 Now, this shortcutnis called a desire path,,and it's often the pathnof least resistance.,I find them fascinating,,because they're often the pointnwhere design and user experience diverge. 
 Now at this point, I should apologize,,because you guys are going to startnseeing these everywhere.,But today, I'm going to picknthree I find interesting,and share what actually it reminds me,about launching new products and services.,The first is in the capital citynof Brazil -- Brasilia.,And it reminds me that sometimes,,you have to just focusnon designing for a real need,at low friction.,Now, Brasilia is fascinating.,It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.,It was the golden age of flying,,so he laid it out like a plane,nas you can see there.,Slightly worryingly,,he put most of the importantngovernment buildings in the cockpit.,But if you zoom in,nin the very center of Brasilia,,just where the point is there,,you see it's littered with desire paths.,They're absolutely everywhere. 
 Now, they thought that theynhad future-proofed this design.,They thought in the futurenwe wouldn't need to walk anywhere --,we'd be able to drive --,so there was little neednfor walkways or pavements.,But as you can see, there's a real need.,These are very dangerous desire paths.,If we just pick one, in the middle,,you can see it crossesn15 lanes of traffic.,It won't surprise you guys,that Brasilia has five timesnthe pedestrian accident rate,of your average US city.,People are resourceful.,They'll always find the low-friction route,to save money, save time. 
 Not all these desire paths are dangerous,,I was reminded flying herenwhen I was in Heathrow.,Many of us get frustratednwhen we're confronted,with the obligatory walknthrough duty-free.,It was amazing to me,how many people refused to takenthe long, meandering path to the left,,and just cut through to the right,,cut through the desire path. 
 The question that's interesting is:,What do designers thinknwhen they see our behavior here?,Do they think we're stupid?,Do they think we're lazy?,Or do they acceptnthat this is the only truth?,This is their product.,We're effectivelynco-designing their product.,So our job is to designnfor real needs at low friction,,because if you don't,nthe customer will, anyway. 
 The second desire path I wanted to share,is at the University of California.,And it reminds me,that sometimes the best waynto come up with a great design,is just to launch it.,Now, university campuses are fantasticnfor spotting desire paths.,I think it's because studentsnare always late and they're pretty smart.,So they're dashing to lectures.,They'll always find the shortcut.,And the designers here knew that.,So they built the buildings,and then they waited a few monthsnfor the paths to form.,They then paved them.,(Laughter),Incredibly smart approach.,In fact, often, just launchingnthe straw man of a service,can teach you what people really want. 
 For example, Ayr Muir in Bostonnknew he wanted to open a restaurant.,But where should it be?,What should the menu be?,He launched a service,,in this case a food truck,,and he changed the location each day.,He'd write a different menunon the side in a whiteboard marker,to figure out what people wanted.,He now has a chain of restaurants.,So it can be incredibly efficient,to launch somethingnto spot the desire paths. 
 The third and final desire pathnI wanted to share with you,is the UNIH.,It reminds me that the world's in flux,,and we have to respond to those changes.,So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.,I've marked for you on the leftnthe Oncology Department.,The patients would usually staynin the hotels down on the bottom right.,This was a patient-centered organization,,so they laid on cars for their patients.,But what they realized when they startednoffering chemotherapy,is the patients rarelynwanted to get in cars.,They were too nauseous,nso they'd walk back to their hotels.,This desire path that you seendiagonally, formed.,The patients even called itn"The Chemo Trail.",Now, when the hospitalnsaw this originally,,they tried to lay turfnback over it, ignore it.,But after a while, they realizednit was an important need,they were meeting for their patients,,so they paved it. 
 And I think our job is oftennto pave these emerging desire paths.,If we look back at the onenin North London again,,that desire path hasn't always been there.,The reason it sprung up,is people were traveling to the mightynArsenal Football Club stadium,on game days,,from the Underground stationnyou see on the bottom right.,So you see the desire path.,If we just wind the clocknback a few years,,when the stadium was being constructed,,there is no desire path. 
 So our job is to watchnfor these desire paths emerging,,and, where appropriate, pave them,,as someone did here.,Someone installed a barrier,,people started walking acrossnand round the bottom as you see,,and they paved it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I think this is a wonderfulnreminder as well,,that, actually, the world is in flux.,It's constantly changing,,because if you looknat the top of this image,,there's another desire path forming. 
 So these three desire paths remind me,we need to design for real human needs.,I think empathy for whatnyour customers want,is probably the biggest leading indicatornof business success.,Design for real needs,and design them in low friction,,because if you don't offer themnin low friction,,someone else will, often the customer. 
 Secondly, often the best waynto learn what people really want,is to launch your service.,The answer is rarely inside the building.,Get out there and seenwhat people really want. 
 And finally, in partnbecause of technology,,the world is incredibly fluxnat the moment.,It's changing constantly.,These desire paths are goingnto spring up faster than ever.,Our job is to pick the appropriate ones,and pave over them. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The following are my opinions,,and do not reflectnthe opinions or policies,of any particular prosecutor's office. 
 (Laughter) 
 I am a prosecutor.,I believe in law and order.,I am the adopted son of a police officer,na Marine and a hairdresser.,I believe in accountability,and that we should all be safenin our communities.,I love my job,and the people that do it.,I just think that it's our responsibility,to do it better. 
 By a show of hands,,how many of you, by the age of 25,,had either acted up in school,,went somewhere you werenspecifically told to stay out of,,or drank alcohol before your legal age? 
 (Laughter) 
 All right. 
 How many of you shoplifted,,tried an illegal drug,or got into a physical fight --,yes, even with a sibling?,Now, how many of younever spent one day in jail,for any of those decisions?,How many of you sitting here today,think that you're a danger to society,or should be defined by those actionsnof youthful indiscretion? 
 (Laughter) 
 Point taken. 
 When we talk aboutncriminal justice reform,,we often focus on a few things,,and that's what I wantnto talk to you about today.,But first I'm going to --nsince you shared with me,,I'm going to give youna confession on my part.,I went to law school,to make money.,I had no interestnin being a public servant,,I had no interest in criminal law,,and I definitely didn't thinknthat I would ever be a prosecutor. 
 Near the end of my first yearnof law school, I got an internship,in the Roxbury Divisionnof Boston Municipal Court.,I knew of Roxbury as an impoverishednneighborhood in Boston,,plagued by gun violence and drug crime.,My life and my legal career changednthe first day of that internship.,I walked into a courtroom,nand I saw an auditorium of people,who, one by one, would approachnthe front of that courtroom,to say two words and two words only:,"Not guilty.",They were predominately black and brown.,And then a judge, a defensenattorney and a prosecutor,would make life-altering decisionsnabout that person without their input.,They were predominately white.,As each person, one by one,napproached the front of that courtroom,,I couldn't stop but think:,How did they get here?,I wanted to know their stories.,And as the prosecutornread the facts of each case,,I was thinking to myself,,we could have predicted that.,That seems so preventable...,not because I was an expertnin criminal law,,but because it was common sense. 
 Over the course of the internship,,I began to recognizenpeople in the auditorium,,not because they werencriminal masterminds,but because they werencoming to us for help,and we were sending them out without any. 
 My second year of law school I workednas a paralegal for a defense attorney,,and in that experience I met manynyoung men accused of murder.,Even in our "worst," I saw human stories.,And they all contained childhood trauma,,victimization, poverty, loss,,disengagement from school,,early interaction with the policenand the criminal justice system,,all leading to a seat in a courtroom.,Those convicted of murdernwere condemned to die in prison,,and it was during those meetingsnwith those men that I couldn't fathom,why we would spend so much money,to keep this one person in jailnfor the next 80 years,when we could have reinvested it up front,,and perhaps prevented the whole thingnfrom happening in the first place. 
 (Applause) 
 My third year of law school,,I defended people accusednof small street crimes,,mostly mentally ill,,mostly homeless,,mostly drug-addicted,,all in need of help.,They would come to us,,and we would send them awaynwithout that help.,They were in need of our assistance.,But we weren't giving them any.,Prosecuted, adjudged and defended,by people who knew nothing about them. 
 The staggering inefficiency is whatndrove me to criminal justice work.,The unfairness of it allnmade me want to be a defender.,The power dynamicnthat I came to understand,made me become a prosecutor. 
 I don't want to spend a lot of timentalking about the problem.,We know the criminal justicensystem needs reform,,we know there are 2.3 millionnpeople in American jails and prisons,,making us the most incarceratednnation on the planet.,We know there's another seven millionnpeople on probation or parole,,we know that the criminal justice system,disproportionately affectsnpeople of color,,particularly poor people of color.,And we know there are system failuresnhappening everywhere,that bring people to our courtrooms.,But what we do not discuss,is how ill-equipped our prosecutorsnare to receive them.,When we talk aboutncriminal justice reform,,we, as a society, focus on three things.,We complain, we tweet, we protest,about the police, about sentencing laws,and about prison.,We rarely, if ever, talknabout the prosecutor. 
 In the fall of 2009,,a young man was arrestednby the Boston Police Department.,He was 18 years old,nhe was African American,and he was a seniornat a local public school.,He had his sights set on college,but his part-time, minimum-wage jobnwasn't providing the financial opportunity,he needed to enroll in school.,In a series of bad decisions,,he stole 30 laptops from a storenand sold them on the Internet.,This led to his arrest,and a criminal complaintnof 30 felony charges.,The potential jail time he faced is whatnstressed Christopher out the most.,But what he had little understanding of,was the impact a criminal recordnwould have on his future. 
 I was standing in arraignments that day,when Christopher's casencame across my desk.,And at the risk of soundingndramatic, in that moment,,I had Christopher's life in my hands.,I was 29 years old,na brand-new prosecutor,,and I had little appreciationnfor how the decisions I would make,would impact Christopher's life.,Christopher's case was a serious one,and it needed to be dealt with as such,,but I didn't think branding himna felon for the rest of his life,was the right answer. 
 For the most part,nprosecutors step onto the job,with little appreciationnof the impact of our decisions,,regardless of our intent.,Despite our broad discretion,,we learn to avoid risk at all cost,,rendering our discretion,basically useless.,History has conditioned usnto believe that somehow,,the criminal justice systemnbrings about accountability,and improves public safety,,despite evidence to the contrary.,We're judged internally and externallynby our convictions and our trial wins,,so prosecutors aren't reallynincentivized to be creative,at our case dispositions,,or to take risks on peoplenwe might not otherwise.,We stick to an outdated method,,counterproductive to achievingnthe very goal that we all want,,and that's safer communities. 
 Yet most prosecutors standing in my spacenwould have arraigned Christopher.,They have little appreciationnfor what we can do.,Arraigning Christophernwould give him a criminal record,,making it harder for him to get a job,,setting in motion a cycle,that defines the failingncriminal justice system today.,With a criminal record and without a job,,Christopher would be unable to findnemployment, education or stable housing.,Without those protectivenfactors in his life,,Christopher would be more likelynto commit further, more serious crime.,The more contact Christopher hadnwith the criminal justice system,,the more likely it would benthat he would return again,and again and again --,all at tremendous social costnto his children, to his family,and to his peers.,And, ladies and gentlemen,,it is a terrible public safetynoutcome for the rest of us. 
 When I came out of law school,,I did the same thing as everybody else.,I came out as a prosecutornexpected to do justice,,but I never learned whatnjustice was in my classes --,none of us do.,None of us do. 
 And yet, prosecutorsnare the most powerful actors,in the criminal justice system.,Our power is virtually boundless.,In most cases, not the judge,,not the police, not the legislature,,not the mayor, not the governor,nnot the President,can tell us how to prosecute our cases.,The decision to arraign Christophernand give him a criminal record,was exclusively mine.,I would choose whether to prosecutenhim for 30 felonies, for one felony,,for a misdemeanor,,or at all.,I would choose whether to leveragenChristopher into a plea deal,or take the case to trial, and ultimately,,I would be in a position to asknfor Christopher to go to jail.,These are decisions that prosecutorsnmake every day unfettered,,and we are unaware and untrained,of the grave consequencesnof those decisions. 
 One night this past summer,,I was at a small gatheringnof professional men of color,from around the city.,As I stood there stuffingnfree finger sandwiches into my mouth,,as you do as public servant -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I noticed across the room,,a young man waving and smilingnat me and approaching me.,And I recognized him,nbut I couldn't place from where,,and before I knew it,nthis young man was hugging me.,And thanking me.,"You cared about me,nand you changed my life.",It was Christopher. 
 See, I never arraigned Christopher.,He never faced a judge or a jail,,he never had a criminal record.,Instead, I worked with Christopher;,first on being accountablenfor his actions,,and then, putting him in a positionnwhere he wouldn't re-offend.,We recovered 75 percentnof the computers that he sold,and gave them back to Best Buy,,and came up with a financial plan,to repay for the computersnwe couldn't recover.,Christopher did community service.,He wrote an essay reflecting on hownthis case could impact his future,and that of the community.,He applied to college,,he obtained financial aid,,and he went on to graduatenfrom a four-year school. 
 (Applause) 
 After we finished hugging,nI looked at his name tag,,to learn that Christopher was the managernof a large bank in Boston.,Christopher had accomplished --nand making a lot more money than me -- 
 (Laughter) 
 He had accomplished all of this,in the six years since I had firstnseen him in Roxbury Court.,I can't take credit for Christopher'snjourney to success,,but I certainly did my partnto keep him on the path. 
 There are thousandsnof Christophers out there,,some locked in our jails and prisons.,We need thousands of prosecutors,to recognize that and to protect them.,An employed Christopher is betternfor public safety than a condemned one.,It's a bigger win for all of us.,In retrospect, the decision notnto throw the book at Christopher,makes perfect sense.,When I saw him that first daynin Roxbury Court,,I didn't see a criminal standing there.,I saw myself -- a young personnin need of intervention.,As an individual caught selling a largenquantity of drugs in my late teens,,I knew firsthand the power of opportunity,as opposed to the wrathnof the criminal justice system.,Along the way, with the helpnand guidance of my district attorney,,my supervisor and judges,,I learned the power of the prosecutor,to change lives instead of ruining them. 
 And that's how we do it in Boston.,We helped a woman who was arrestednfor stealing groceries to feed her kids,get a job.,Instead of putting an abusednteenager in adult jail,for punching another teenager,,we secured mental health treatmentnand community supervision.,A runaway girl who was arrested,for prostituting, to survivenon the streets,,needed a safe place to live and grow --,something we could help her with.,I even helped a young man,who was so afraid of the older gang kidsnshowing up after school,,that one morning insteadnof a lunchbox into his backpack,,he put a loaded 9-millimeter.,We would spend our time that we'dnnormally take prepping our cases,for months and monthsnfor trial down the road,by coming up with real solutionsnto the problems as they presented. 
 Which is the better way to spend our time?,How would you prefernyour prosecutors to spend theirs?,Why are we spending 80 billion dollars,on a prison industrynthat we know is failing,,when we could take that moneynand reallocate it into education,,into mental health treatment,,into substance abuse treatment,and to community investmentnso we can develop our neighborhoods? 
 (Applause) 
 So why should this matter to you?,Well, one, we're spending a lot of money.,Our money.,It costs 109,000 dollars in some states,to lock up a teenager for a year,,with a 60 percent chance that that personnwill return to the very same system.,That is a terrible return on investment. 
 Number two: it's the right thing to do.,If prosecutors were a partnof creating the problem,,it's incumbent on us to create a solution,and we can do that using other disciplines,that have already done the datanand research for us. 
 And number three:,your voice and your votencan make that happen.,The next time there's a localndistrict attorney's election,in your jurisdiction,,ask candidates these questions.,One: What are you doing to makenme and my neighbors safer?,Two: What data are you collecting,,and how are you training your prosecutors,to make sure that it's working?,And number three:,If it's not working for everybody,,what are you doing to fix it?,If they can't answer the questions,,they shouldn't be doing the job. 
 Each one of you that raised your handnat the beginning of this talk,is a living, breathing examplenof the power of opportunity,,of intervention,,of support,and of love.,While each of you may have facednyour own brand of discipline,for whatever malfeasances you committed,,barely any of you needed a day in jail,to make you the peoplenthat you are today --,some of the greatest minds on the planet. 
 Every day, thousands of times a day,,prosecutors around the United Statesnwield power so great,that it can bring about catastrophe,as quickly as it cannbring about opportunity,,intervention,,support,and yes, even love.,Those qualities are the hallmarksnof a strong community,,and a strong community is a safe one.,If our communities are broken,,don't let the lawyersnthat you elect fix them,with outdated, inefficient,nexpensive methods. 
 Demand more; vote for the prosecutornwho's helping people stay out of jail,,not putting them in. 
 Demand better.,You deserve it, your children deserve it,,the people who are tied upnin the system deserve it,,but most of all,,the people that we are sworn to protectnand do justice for demand it. 
 We must,,we must do better. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much.Thousands of years from now,,we'll look back at the firstncentury of computing,as a fascinating but very peculiar time --,the only time in history where humansnwere reduced to live in 2D space,,interacting with technologynas if we were machines;,a singular, 100-year periodnin the vastness of time,where humans communicated,,were entertained and managed their lives,from behind a screen. 
 Today, we spend most of our timentapping and looking at screens.,What happened to interactingnwith each other?,I don't know about you, but I feel limited,inside this 2D worldnof monitors and pixels.,And it is this very limitation,and my desire to connect with people,that inspires me as a creator.,Put simply: I wantnto create a new reality,,a reality where technology bringsnus infinitely closer to each other,,a reality where people, not devices,,are the center of everything. 
 I dream of a reality where technologynsenses what we see, touch and feel;,a reality where technologynno longer gets in our way,,but instead embraces who we are.,I dream of technology,on a human path.,We have all experienced technology,that enables peoplento act more like people,,products that enable natural interactions,nvoice controls or biometrics. 
 This is the next step in the evolution.,This is Microsoft HoloLens,,the first fully untetherednholographic computer.,Devices like this will bringn3D holographic content,right into our world,,enhancing the way we experience life,beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.,Now, I'm not thinkingnabout a distant future.,I'm talking about today.,We are already seeingncar companies like Volvo,designing cars differently with HoloLens;,universities like Case Westernnredefining the way medical students learn;,and my personal favorite,,NASA is using HoloLensnto let scientists explore planets,holographically. 
 Now, this is important.,By bringing holograms into our world,,I'm not just talking about a new devicenor a better computer.,I'm talking about freeing ourselvesnfrom the 2D confines,of traditional computing. 
 Put it this way:,temporally adjusted, we're likencave people in computer terms.,We've barely discovered charcoal,and started drawingnthe first stick figures in our cave.,Now, this is the perspectivenI apply to my work every single day.,And now for the next few minutes,,I invite all of you to applynthe same perspective,to the journey ahead of us. 
 Now, as I put this HoloLens on,,let me explain the setup a little bit.,It's probably the most risky demonwe have ever done on any stage,with HoloLens,,and I can't think of a better placento do it than here at TED.,Momentarily, I am goingnto be seeing holograms,right on this stage,,just as clearly as I can see all of you.,Now at the same time,nwe have also this special camera,that just walked in onstage,so that all of you can sharenin this experience with me,up on all the monitors. 
 So let's start our journey.,And what better placento begin our journey,,than in the computer cave of 2D.,Let's explore the worldnall around us with this new lens,,and understand the computer worldnfrom a brand new perspective. 
 The computer universenis both marvelous and primitive.,It's a universe based on causality.,As developers, we dreamnthe different causes,and then we program the different effects.,Double click on an icon, that's a cause.,Open an application, that's an effect.,Now when we compare thisnto our physical universe,,it is overly constraining,,because our universe is not digital.,Our universe is analog.,Our universe doesn't thinknin terms of zero or one,,true or false, or black or white.,We exist in a worldngoverned by quantum physics,,a universe of zero and onenboth at the same time,,a reality based on infinitenprobabilities and shades of gray.,You can see how these two worlds collide. 
 So why are screens so pervasivenin our analog life?,We see screens from the moment we wake up,,to the moment we fall asleep.,Why? 
 I think it's because computersngive us superpowers.,Within the digital universe,nwe have the power to displace space,and the power to displace time.,It doesn't matter if you're usingntechnology for entertainment,,productivity or communication.,Think of it this way:,let's all go home tonight,and watch our favorite show on television.,This is theater -- timenand space displaced.,As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,,I'm going to immediately callnmy lovely family in Seattle.,That's displacement of space.,Now, these are such great superpowers,that we put up withnthe two-dimensional limitations,of our current digital world.,But what if we didn't have to?,What if we could haventhese same digital powers,in our world?,You can already see glimmers of this,,but I believe our children's children,will grow up in a worldndevoid of 2D technology.,It's remarkable to dream of this world,,a world where technologyntruly understands us --,where we live, work and communicate --,with tools that enhancenthe human experience,,not machines that limit our humanity. 
 So how do we get there?,For me, the answer requirednlooking at the problem,from a different perspective.,It required sensing the worldnfrom the perspective of a machine.,If you're a machine tryingnto sense our world,,how would you actuallynbreak the problem down?,You'd probably try to classify things,as a human,,an environment,or an object.,But how would that machinenthen interact with reality?,And I can think of three ways. 
 First, as a machine,,I would observe or I would input reality.,Speech recognitionnand biometric authentication,are great examples of a machineninteracting with humans,from an input perspective.,Secondly, as a machine,,I could place digital information,nor output information,,into reality.,Holograms are examples of a machineninteracting with an environment,from an output perspective.,Finally, as a machine,,I could exchange energynwith the world via haptics.,Now, imagine being able to feelnthe temperature of a virtual object,,or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram,and having it push you backnwith equal force. 
 With this perspective,,we are able to collapse realityninto a simple matrix.,Now here's a secret:,as an engineer, I get really excited,anytime I can reducensomething to the matrix.,From self-driving cars,to smartphones,to this holographic computer on my head,,machines are becoming capablenof understanding our world.,And they are starting to interact with us,in significantly more personal ways. 
 Now, imagine having granular control,over everything in the world.,Move the dial one way,,and you get reality.,Move the dial the other way,,and you get virtual reality.,Now, imagine dialingnyour entire environment,between virtual and real worlds.,I love it down here.,Now, imagine if I could look at all of you,and dial from real humans into elves.,When technology trulynunderstands our world,,it will again transformnthe ways we interact,,the ways we work and the ways we play. 
 Less than half a century ago,,two courageous men landed on the moon,,using computers that were less powerfulnthan the phones in your pockets.,Six hundred million humans watched them,on grainy, black-and-white televisions.,And the world?,The world was mesmerized. 
 Now imagine how our childrennand their children,will experience the continuednexploration of space,with technologynthat understands this world.,We already live in a world wherenreal-time universal translators exist.,And I can squint, and I can alreadynsee holographic telepresence,in our near future.,In fact, since we've been luckynwith our demo so far,,let's try doing something elseneven more crazy.,I invite you to experience,,for the first time anywhere in the world,,here on the TED stage,,a real-life holographic teleportation,,between me and my friend,nDr. Jeffrey Norris,,from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
 Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff. 
 Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex. 
 Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked.nHow are you doing today, Jeff? 
 (Applause) 
 JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week. 
 AK: So, can you tell us a little bit,nJeff, about where you are? 
 JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.,I'm standing in a room across the street,,while I'm standing on this stage with you,,while I'm standing on Mars,na hundred million miles away. 
 AK: Wow, a hundred millionnmiles away. This is crazy!,Can you tell us a little bit morenabout where all this data,from Mars is coming from? 
 JN: Absolutely.,This is a precisenholographic replica of Mars,,built from data capturednby the Curiosity Mars Rover,,that I can explore as easilynas a place on Earth.,Humans are natural explorers.,We can instantlynunderstand an environment,,just by being present in it.,We've built tools like our Mars Rover,to extend our visionnand lengthen our reach.,But for decades,,we've explored from a seatnbehind screens and keyboards.,Now, we're leaping over all of that,,over the giant antennasnand the relay satellites,and the vastness between worlds,to take our first steps on this landscapenas if we were truly there.,Today, a group of scientistsnon our mission,are seeing Mars as never before --,an alien world madena little more familiar,,because they're finally exploring itnas humans should. 
 But our dreams don't have to endnwith making it just like being there.,When we dial this real worldnto the virtual,,we can do magical things.,We can see in invisible wavelengths,or teleport to the top of a mountain.,Perhaps someday, we'll feel the mineralsnin a rock just by touching it.,We're taking the first steps.,But we want the whole worldnto join us in taking the next,,because this is not a journey for a few,,but for all of us. 
 AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.,Thank you so much for joining usnon the TED stage today. 
 (Applause) 
 JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye. 
 AK: Bye, Jeff. 
 (Applause) 
 I dream about this future,every single day.,I take inspiration from our ancestors.,We used to live in tribesnwhere we interacted,,communicated and worked together.,We are all beginning to build technologynthat will enable us to return,to the humanity that brought usnwhere we are today --,technology that will let us stop livingninside this 2D world,of monitors and pixels,,and let us start rememberingnwhat it feels like,to live in our 3D world.,It's a phenomenal time to be human. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Helen Walters: Thanks so much.nI have some questions. 
 AK: OK. 
 HW: So there's beennsome talk in the press.,And I'll just ask you straight,nthen we have a straight answer.,There's been talk about the differencenbetween the demos,and the reality of the commercial product.,Talk about this field of view issue.,Is this type of experience what someonenwho buys the product will get? 
 AK: It's a great question,,Or, said better, this is a questionnwe've been receiving,in the media for possibly the last year.,If you do your research,nI haven't answered that question.,I've purposely ignored it,,because ultimately,nit's the wrong question to ask.,That's the equivalent of me showingnholograms to someone for the first time,,and you then saying,n"What's the size of your television?",The field of view for the productnis almost irrelevant.,What we should be talking aboutnis the density of lights,,or radiance, that shows up.,Better said, what the angular resolutionnis of the things that you see.,So from that perspective, what you saw --,you know, the cameranis wearing a HoloLens.,So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't. 
 HW: But the camera has a different lensnon it than our eye. Right? 
 AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.,It's seeing a much wider viewnthan the human eye is.,So if you think about the points of lightnthat show up radially,from the vision of the camera,,which is the thing that matters:,how many points of lightncan I get in a given volume?,That's the same as I getnon this HoloLens as I will on that one.,Now, this camera seesna much wider view of the world, right? 
 HW: Jesus Christ! 
 (Laughter) 
 AK: He did show up!nI told you he'd show up.,Come this way. 
 (Laughter) 
 HW: Oh, shit. 
 AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris. 
 HW: I knew something was happening,nbut I really wasn't sure what. 
 AK: So in short: to be super crisp,,the camera that you see on the screennhas a wider field of view,than the human eye.,But the angular resolutionnof the holograms that you see,,the points of light per unit of area,,are actually the same. 
 HW: So you spent -- Jeff,nI'll get to you in a minute --,so you spent a lot of timenmapping the stage -- 
 AK: That's right. 
 HW: So help me out here:,if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,,I don't need to map my apartment, right? 
 AK: The HoloLens maps in real timenat about five frames per second,,with this technologynthat we call spatial mapping.,So in your home, as soon as you put it on,,holograms will start showing up,nand you'll start placing them,and they'll start learning your home.,In a stage environment where we're tryingnto get something on my head,to communicate with something over there,with all of the wireless connectivitynthat usually brings all conferences down,,we don't take the risknof trying to do this live.,So what we do is pre-map the stagenat five frames per second,with the same spatial-mapping technology,that you'll use with the product at home,,and then we store it,,so that when there's shenanigansnof wireless in an environment like this,,between the camera's HoloLensnand the one on my head,,we don't have things disappear.,Because ultimately, the hologramsnare coming from this HoloLens,,and that one is just viewing the HoloLens.,So if I lose connectivity,,you would stop seeingnbeautiful things on the screen. 
 HW: And it was beautiful.,Um ... Jeff? 
 JN: Yes? 
 HW: Hi. 
 AK: I'll take a step back. 
 HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,,you were here, you werenin a room across the street.,Tell me more about the fact that,nwith holograms, you have sight,but you don't have touch,nyou don't have smell.,Is this scientifically useful now?,That's my question for a hologram. 
 JN: Thanks for the question.,Absolutely, I believenthat these technologies,are scientifically useful right now,,and that's why we're using themnin multiple parts of our work at NASA.,So we're using it to improventhe ways that we explore Mars.,We're also using it for our astronautsnon the space station.,We're even using it now to design,the next generation of our spacecraft. 
 HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away.nThank you very much. 
 (Laughter) 
 Alex, really, that was amazing.nThank you so much. 
 AK: Thank you. 
 HW: Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Design is a slipperynand elusive phenomenon,,which has meant differentnthings at different times.,But all truly inspiring design projectsnhave one thing in common:,they began with a dream.,And the bolder the dream,,the greater the design featnthat will be required to achieve it.,And this is why the greatestndesigners are almost always,the biggest dreamersnand rebels and renegades. 
 This has been the case throughout history,,all the way back to the year 300 BC,,when a 13-year-old became the king,of a remote, very poornand very small Asian country.,He dreamt of acquiring land,nriches and power,through military conquest.,And his design skills --,improbable though it sounds --,would be essentialnin enabling him to do so. 
 At the time,,all weapons were made by handnto different specifications.,So if an archer ran outnof arrows during a battle,,they wouldn't necessarily be ablento fire another archer's arrows,from their bow.,This of course meant that they wouldnbe less effective in combat,and very vulnerable, too.,Ying solved this problem,by insisting that all bows and arrowsnwere designed identically,,so they were interchangeable.,And he did the same for daggers,naxes, spears, shields,and every other form of weaponry.,His formidably equipped armynwon batter after battle,,and within 15 years,,his tiny kingdom hadnsucceeded in conquering,all its larger, richer,nmore powerful neighbors,,to found the mighty Chinese Empire. 
 Now, no one, of course,,would have thought of describingnYing Zheng as a designer at the time --,why would they?,And yet he used designnunknowingly and instinctively,but with tremendous ingenuity,to achieve his ends.,And so did another equallynimprobable, accidental designer,,who was also not above usingnviolence to get what he wanted.,This was Edward Teach, better knownnas the British pirate, Blackbeard. 
 This was the golden age of piracy,,where pirates like Teachnwere terrorizing the high seas.,Colonial trade was flourishing,,and piracy was highly profitable.,And the smarter pirates like himnrealized that to maximize their spoils,,they needed to attackntheir enemies so brutally,that they would surrender on sight.,So in other words,,they could take the shipsnwithout wasting ammunition,,or incurring casualties. 
 So Edward Teach redesignednhimself as Blackbeard,by playing the part of a merciless brute.,He wore heavy jackets and big hatsnto accentuate his height.,He grew the bushy black beardnthat obscured his face.,He slung braces of pistolsnon either shoulder.,He even attached matches to the brimnof his hat and set them alight,,so they sizzled menacinglynwhenever his ship was poised to attack.,And like many pirates of that era,,he flew a flag that borenthe macabre symbols,of a human skullnand a pair of crossed bones,,because those motifs had signified deathnin so many cultures for centuries,,that their meaningnwas instantly recognizable,,even in the lawless, illiteratenworld of the high seas:,surrender or you'll suffer.,So of course, all his sensiblenvictims surrendered on sight. 
 Put like that,,it's easy to see why Edward Teachnand his fellow pirates,could be seen as pioneersnof modern communications design,,and why their deadly symbol -- 
 (Laughter) 
 there's more --,why their deadly symbolnof the skull and crossbones,was a precursor of today's logos,,rather like the big red lettersnstanding behind me,,but of course with a different message. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yet design was also used to nobler ends,by an equally brilliant and equallynimprobable designer,,the 19th-century British nurse,nFlorence Nightingale.,Her mission was to providendecent healthcare for everyone.,Nightingale was born into a ratherngrand, very wealthy British family,,who were horrified when she volunteerednto work in military hospitals,during the Crimean War.,Once there, she swiftly realized,that more patients were dyingnof infections that they caught there,,in the filthy, fetid wards,,than they were of battle wounds.,So she campaignednfor cleaner, lighter, airier clinics,to be designed and built. 
 Back in Britain,,she mounted another campaign,,this time for civilian hospitals,,and insisted that the same designnprinciples were applied to them.,The Nightingale ward, as it is called,,dominated hospital designnfor decades to come,,and elements of it are still used today.,But by then,,design was seen as a toolnof the Industrial Age.,It was formalized and professionalized,,but it was restricted to specific roles,and generally applied in pursuitnof commercial goals,rather than being used intuitively,,as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeardnand Ying Zheng had done. 
 By the 20th century,,this commercial ethos was so powerful,,that any designers who deviated from it,risked being seen as cranksnor subversives. 
 Now among them is onenof my great design heroes,,the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.,He was the Hungarian artist and designer,whose experiments with the impactnof technology on daily life,were so powerful,that they still influencenthe design of the digital images,we see on our phone and computer screens.,He radicalized the Bauhaus DesignnSchool in 1920s Germany,,and yet some of his formerncolleagues shunned him,when he struggled to open a newnBauhaus in Chicago years later.,Moholy's ideas were as boldnand incisive as ever,,but his approach to designnwas too experimental,,as was his insistencenon seeing it, as he put it,,as an attitude, not a professionnto be in tune with the times. 
 And sadly, the same applied,to another design maverick:nRichard Buckminster Fuller.,He was yet anothernbrilliant design visionary,and design activist,,who was completely committednto designing a sustainable society,in such a forward-thinking way,that he started talking aboutnthe importance of environmentalism,in design in the 1920s.,Now he, despite his efforts,,was routinely mocked as a cranknby many in the design establishment,,and admittedly,,some of his experiments failed,,like the flying carnthat never got off the ground.,And yet, the geodesic dome,,his design formula to buildnan emergency shelter,from scraps of wood, metal, plastic,,bits of tree, old blankets,nplastic sheeting --,just about anythingnthat's available at the time --,is one of the greatest featsnof humanitarian design,,and has provided sorely needed refuge,to many, many peoplenin desperate circumstances,ever since. 
 Now, it was the couragenand verve of radical designers,like Bucky and Moholy,that drew me to design.,I began my career as a news journalistnand foreign correspondent.,I wrote about politics, economicsnand corporate affairs,,and I could have chosennto specialize in any of those fields.,But I picked design,,because I believe it's one of the mostnpowerful tools at our disposal,to improve our quality of life. 
 Thank you, fellow TED design buffs. 
 (Applause) 
 And greatly as I admire the achievementsnof professional designers,,which have been extraordinary and immense,,I also believe,that design benefits hugelynfrom the originality,,the lateral thinking,and the resourcefulnessnof its rebels and renegades.,And we're living at a remarkablenmoment in design,,because this is a time when the two campsnare coming closer together.,Because even very basic advancesnin digital technology,have enabled them to operatenincreasingly independently,,in or out of a commercial context,,to pursue ever more ambitiousnand eclectic objectives. 
 So in theory,,basic platforms like crowdfunding,ncloud computing, social media,are giving greater freedomnto professional designers,and giving more resourcesnfor the improvisational ones,,and hopefully,,a more receptive response to their ideas. 
 Now, some of my favoritenexamples of this are in Africa,,where a new generation of designers,are developing incrediblenInternet of Things technologies,to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dreamnof improving healthcare,in countries where more peoplennow have access to cell phones,than to clean, running water. 
 And among them is Arthur Zang.,He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer,who has a adapted a tabletncomputer into the Cardiopad,,a mobile heart-monitoring device.,It can be used to monitor the heartsnof patients in remote, rural areas.,The data is then sentnon a cellular network,to well-equipped hospitalsnhundreds of miles away,for analysis.,And if any problems are spottednby the specialists there,,a suitable course of treatmentnis recommended.,And this of course saves many patients,from making long, arduous, expensivenand often pointless journeys,to those hospitals,,and makes it much, much likelier,that their heartsnwill actually be checked. 
 Arthur Zang started workingnon the Cardiopad eight years ago,,in his final year at university.,But he failed to persuadenany conventional sources,to give him investment to getnthe project off the ground.,He posted the idea on Facebook,,where a Cameroonianngovernment official saw it,and managed to securena government grant for him.,He's now developingnnot only the Cardiopad,,but other mobile medical devicesnto treat different conditions. 
 And he isn't alone,,because there are many otherninspiring and enterprising designers,who are also pursuingnextraordinary projects of their own.,And I'm going to finishnby looking at just a few of them.,One is Peek Vision.,This is a group of doctorsnand designers in Kenya,,who've developed an Internet of Thingsntechnology of their own,,as a portable eye examination kit.,Then there's Gabriel Maher,,who is developing a new design language,to enable us to articulate the subtletiesnof our changing gender identities,,without recoursento traditional stereotypes. 
 All of these designers and many morenare pursuing their dreams,,by the making the mostnof their newfound freedom,,with the disciplinenof professional designers,and the resourcefulnessnof rebels and renegades.,And we all stand to benefit. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hello.,This is my first trip,,first time in life I'm outsidenof the walls of Gaza.,I'm so happy to be here. 
 (Applause) 
 My ambition always wasnto be a pilot, to fly a plane,,to feel free to fly the sky,nto touch the sky.,But that didn't happen.,Simply, I live in Gaza,nthere is no airport.,All borders are closed on every side.,We live in one of the biggestnprisons in the world.,The only thing I can donis just to look up to the sky.,On some days, we are luckynif we have electricity,for four or five hours.,When it's cold, we make a firenon the front or on the roof of our homes.,Sometimes we make food, too. 
 My job in Gaza is to arrange everythingnfor journalists who come to my homeland,to tell the storiesnabout what's going on in Gaza.,Many mornings,nI had to go to the border area,to collect a journalist.,If anything should happennto the journalist,,or if the journalist decidesnto cover a story,the government doesn't want us to cover,,bad things could happen. 
 Navigating through my countrynhelping journalists,,filmmakers, news crews,nis my working life.,I believe my success comesnfrom building a relationship,not only with journalistsnand the news crews,,but also with the communitiesnin the Gaza Strip.,These communities who don't wantntheir stories to be told,,I never looked to themnas stories or numbers.,But like me, they are human beings. 
 I have built upnmany relationships over 10 years.,And guess what?,This gives me the chancento get access to people,,to stories that others can't.,In some certain situations,nI feel, as a woman, I have more power.,Many male journalists in my society,,they want to cover a storynabout drug addiction in my country.,That problem startednwhen the Gaza tunnel was being built.,With the siege on Gaza,,tunnels brought people all the basic needs,like food, building material,nother stuff we needed.,But not anymore, because the Egyptian sidenflooded them up with water,and they are not working anymore.,Drugs were being smuggled,,and many young people got addicted, too.,In the traditionnof the Palestinian society,,it's forbidden for mennto enter the household.,So, no male journalists get the story.,But I did. 
 I have a wonderful husband,,a wonderful husband who supports me,despite all the criticismnhe gets from the society.,He's at home now with my two kids,,and I have another onenthat's growing in here. 
 (Applause) 
 When I'm working,nI call him every two hours,,and he knows if he doesn't hear from me,,he should call my contact,,the one who gives me access to the story,,which is the one who I trust. 
 One of the times in Gaza,,during the kidnappingnof the British journalist Alan Johnston,,I was asked by an American magazine,to set up a meetingnwith the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.,The journalist covering the story and I,were asked to meet outside of his hotel.,They came, they picked us upnin a black van with black windows,,they were wearing masks on that day.,And they drove us away,nfar away in the middle of a field.,They took our cell phones,and we did the interviewnwith the kidnapper outside in that field.,I was so scared that day,,a day I will never forget. 
 So, why do I do what I do?,I do it because I believe if I didn't,,a huge part of the storynabout Gaza will be missing.,There are some more storiesnI could tell you about my country.,And not all of them are bad.,I love my country, despitenthe terrible situation we live in --,siege, poverty, unemployment --,but there is life.,There are people who are dreamersnand amazing people full of energy.,We have wonderful music,nand a great music school.,We have parkour dancersnwho dance in the rubble of their homes.,And Gaza is the only placenin the Arab world,where Muslims and Christiansnlive in strong brotherhood. 
 (Applause) 
 During the time of war,,the hardest part for menis leaving the house early in the morning,,leaving my children.,I take a picture of them everyday,because I never knownif I will make it back to them.,Being a fixer and a journalistnis difficult and dangerous in Gaza.,But when I hear the sound of the shellingnor the sound of the bombing,,I just head straight toward it,,because I want to be there first,,because these stories should be told. 
 When my children were smallnand we heard the sound of the war,,I used to tell themnthat they were fireworks.,Now they are older, they understand.,I do have terrible nightmares,because of all that I witnessednduring war times,,especially these lifeless bodiesnof young children.,I still remember a little girl,nher name is Hala.,She's the only survivor from her family.,Her picture will be with me forever.,I will never forget her. 
 I'm proud that I can stand herenand be here today with you.,I'm proud that I can tell younstories, sad and happy,,stories about my small cornernof the world, Gaza.,I'm proud that I amnthe first female fixer working in Gaza.,And the funny thing isnthey call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza. 
 (Laughter) 
 I hope one day, I will get the chancento tell the stories of all other women,,all other amazing womennI know in my country.,I hope that one daynI can help other women in my country,to be fixers like me.,And of course sometimes,nI feel I can't do this work anymore,,it's just too much for me.,But I remember these words:,"Don't limit your challenge,nbut challenge your limit.,Don't allow others to standnin front of your dreams." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It has been 128 years,since the last countrynin the world abolished slavery,and 53 years,since Martin Luther King pronouncednhis "I Have A Dream" speech.,But we still live in a world,where the color of our skinnnot only gives a first impression,,but a lasting one that remains. 
 I was born in a family full of colors.,My father is the son of a maid,from whom he inheritednan intense dark chocolate tone.,He was adopted by thosenwho I know as my grandparents.,The matriarch, my grandma,,has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.,My grandpa was somewhere betweenna vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,,like my uncle and my cousin.,My mother is a cinnamon-skinndaughter of a native Brazilian,,with a pinch of hazel and honey,,and a man [who is]na mix of coffee with milk,,but with a lot of coffee.,She has two sisters.,One in a toasted-peanut skin,and the other,,also adopted,,more on the beige side,,like a pancake. 
 (Laughter) 
 Growing up in this family,,color was never important for me.,Outside home, however,nthings were different soon.,Color had many other meanings. 
 I remember my firstndrawing lessons in school,as a bunch of contradictory feelings.,It was exciting and creative,but I never understoodnthe unique flesh-colored pencil.,I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.,My skin was brown,nand people said I was black.,I was seven years oldnwith a mess of colors in my head. 
 Later,,when I took my cousin to school,,I was usually taken for the nanny.,By helping in the kitchennat a friend's party,,people thought I was the maid.,I was even treated like a prostitute,just because I was walking alonenon the beach with European friends.,And many times,,visiting my grandma or friendsnin upper class buildings,,I was invited not to usenthe main elevator.,Because in the end,,with this color and this hair,,I cannot belong to some places. 
 In some way,,I get to used to it and accept part of it.,However, something inside of menkeeps revolving and struggling. 
 Years later I married a Spaniard.,But not any Spaniard.,I chose one with the skin colornof a lobster when sunburnt. 
 (Laughter) 
 Since then, a new questionnstarted to chase me.,What will be the color of your children?,As you can understand,nthis is my last concern.,But thinking about it,,with my previous background,,my story led me to makenmy personal exercise as a photographer.,And that is how Humanae was born. 
 Humanae is a pursuitnto highlight our true colors,,rather than the untrue,white, red, black or yellownassociated with race.,It's a kind of game to question our codes.,It's a work in progressnfrom a personal story to a global history. 
 I portray the subjectsnin a white background.,Then I choose an 11-pixelnsquare from the nose,,paint the background,,and look for the corresponding colornin the industrial palette, Pantone. 
 I started with my family and friends,,then more and more peoplenjoined the adventure,,thanks to public callsncoming through the social media. 
 I thought that the main spacento show my work was the Internet,because I want an open conceptnthat invites everybody,to push the share buttonnin both the computer and their brain. 
 The snowball started to roll.,The project had a great welcome --,invitations, exhibitions,,physical formats,,galleries and museums ...,just happened.,And among them, my favorite:,when Humanae occupies public spaces,and appears in the street,,it fosters a popular debate,and creates a feeling of community. 
 I have portrayed more than 3,000 people,in 13 different countries,,19 different cities around the world.,Just to mention some of them --,from someone included in the Forbes list,,to refugees who crossednthe Mediterranean by boat.,In Paris, from the UNESCOnHeadquarters to a shelter.,And students both in Switzerlandnand favelas in Rio de Janeiro. 
 All kinds of beliefs,,gender identities,or physical impairments,,a newborn or terminally ill.,We all together build Humanae. 
 Those portraits make us rethinknhow we see each other.,When modern sciencenis questioning the race concept,,what does it mean for usnto be black, white, yellow, red?,Is it the eye, the nose,nthe mouth, the hair?,Or does it have to do with our origin,,nationality,or bank account? 
 This personal exercisenturned out to be a discovery.,Suddenly I realized that Humanaenwas useful for many people.,It represents a sort of mirror,for those who cannot findnthemselves reflected in any label. 
 It was amazing,that people started to sharentheir thoughts about the work with me.,I have hundreds of that,,I will share with you, too. 
 A mother of 11 years --,A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,,"Very good for me as a toolnto work on her confidence,,as this past weekend,one of her girlfriends argued with hernthat she does not belong,and should not be allowednto live in Norway.,So your work hasna very special place in my heart,and it's very important for me." 
 A woman shared her portraitnon Facebook and wrote,,"All my life,,people from across the globenhad difficulties to place me in a group,,a stereotype,,a box.,Perhaps we should stop.,Instead of framing, ask the individual,,'How would you label yourself?',Then I would say,,'Hi. I'm Massiel.,I'm a Dominican-Dutch,,I grew up in a mixed family,and I'm a bisexual woman.' " 
 Besides these unexpectednand touching reactions,,Humanae finds a new lifenin a different variety of fields.,Just to show you some examples,,illustrators and art students,using it as a referencenfor their sketches and their studies.,It's a collection of faces. 
 Researchers in the fields of anthropology,,physics and neuroscience,use Humanae with differentnscientific approaches,related to human ethnicity,,optophysiology,,face recognition,or Alzheimer's. 
 One of the most importantnimpacts of the project,is that Humanae was chosennto be the cover of Foreign Affairs,,one of the most relevantnpolitical publications.,And talking about foreign affairs,,I found the perfectnambassadors for my project ...,teachers.,They are the ones that use Humanaenas a tool for educational purposes.,Their passion encourages mento go back to drawing classes,,but this time as a teacher myself. 
 My students,,both adults and kids,,paint their self-portraits,,trying to discoverntheir own unique color. 
 As a photographer,,I realize that I can be a channelnfor others to communicate.,As an individual,,as Angélica,,every time I take a picture,,I feel that I am sittingnin front of a therapist.,All the frustration, fear and loneliness,that I once felt ...,becomes love. 
 The last country --,the last country in the worldnwho abolished slavery,is the country where I was born,,Brazil.,We still have to work hardnto abolish discrimination.,That remains a common practice worldwide,,and that will not disappear by itself. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.When I was a kid,,I experienced something so powerful,,I spent the rest of my lifensearching for it,,and in all the wrong places.,What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.,It was music.,And this is where the story begins. 
 That's me,,listening to the Beatles' "White Album.",And the look on my face is the feeling,that I've been searching for ever since.,Music goes straight to the emotional vein,,into your bloodstream,and right into your heart.,It deepens every experience.,Fellas? 
 (Music) 
 This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert,and Joshua Roman.,Music -- 
 (Applause) 
 Yeah. 
 Music makes everythingnhave more emotional resonance.,Let's see how it does for this talk.,The right piece of musicnat the right time fuses with us,on a cellular level.,When I hear that one song,from that one summer,with that one girl,,I'm instantly transportednback there again.,Hey, Stacey. 
 Here's a part of the story, though,nwhere I got a little greedy.,I thought if I added more layersnon top of the music,,I could make the feelingsneven more powerful.,So I got into directing music videos.,This is what they looked like.,That's my brother, Jeff.,Sorry about this, Jeff. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's me, just so we're even.,Incredible moves.,Should've been a dancer. 
 (Laughter) 
 These experiments grew,,and in time, startednto look more like this.,In both, I'm searchingnfor the same thing, though,,to capture that lightning in a bottle.,Except, I'm not.,Adding moving pictures over the musicnadded narrative dimension, yes,,but never quite equated the power,that just raw music had for me on its own.,This is not a great thing to realizenwhen you've devoted your life,and professional careernto becoming a music video director.,I kept asking myself,ndid I take the wrong path?,So I started thinking: if I couldninvolve you, the audience, more,,I might be able to make younfeel something more as well. 
 So Aaron Koblin and I begannauditioning new technologies,that could put more of youninside of the work,,like your childhood homenin "The Wilderness Downtown,",your hand-drawn portraits,nin "The Johnny Cash Project,",and your interactive dreams,in "3 Dreams of Black.",We were pushing beyond the screen,,trying to connect more deeply,to people's hearts and imaginations.,But it wasn't quite enough.,It still didn't have the rawnexperiential power of pure music for me. 
 So I started chasing a new technology,that I only had read aboutnin science fiction.,And after years of searching,nI found a prototype.,It was a project from Nonny de la Peñanin Mark Bolas's lab in USC.,And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.,I could taste the lightning.,It was called virtual reality.,This was it five years agonwhen I ran into it.,This is what it looks like now. 
 I quickly started building thingsnin this new medium,,and through that processnwe realized something:,that VR is going to playnan incredibly important role,in the history of mediums.,In fact, it's going to be the last one.,I mean this because it's the first mediumnthat actually makes the jump,from our internalizationnof an author's expression,of an experience,,to our experiencing it firsthand.,You look confused.nI'll explain. Don't worry. 
 (Laughter) 
 If we go back to the origins of mediums,,by all best guesses,,it starts around a fire,nwith a good story.,Our clan leader is telling us,about how he hunted the woolly mammothnon the tundra that day.,We hear his words,and translate themninto our own internal truths.,The same thing happens,when we look at the cave paintingnversion of the story,,the book about the mammoth hunt,,the play,,the radio broadcast,,the television show,or the movie.,All of these mediums requirenwhat we call "suspension of disbelief,",because there's a translation gapnbetween the reality of the story,and our consciousnessninterpreting the story,into our reality.,I'm using the word "consciousness"nas a feeling of reality that we get,from our senses experiencingnthe world around us. 
 Virtual reality bridges that gap.,Now, you are on the tundranhunting with the clan leader.,Or you are the clan leader.,Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth. 
 (Laughter) 
 So here's what special about VR.,In all other mediums,,your consciousness interprets the medium.,In VR, your consciousness is the medium.,So the potential for VR is enormous.,But where are we now?,What is the current state of the art?,Well,,we are here.,We are the equivalentnof year one of cinema.,This is the Lumière Brothers film,that allegedly sent a theater fullnof people running for their lives,as they thought a trainnwas coming toward them.,Similar to this early stagenof this medium,,in VR, we also have to movenpast the spectacle,and into the storytelling.,It took this medium decades,to figure out its preferrednlanguage of storytelling,,in the form of a feature film.,In VR today, we're more learning grammar,than writing language. 
 We've made 15 films in the last yearnat our VR company, Vrse,,and we've learned a few things.,We found that we have a unique,ndirect path into your senses,,your emotions, even your body. 
 So let me show you some things.,For the purpose of this demo,,we're going to take every directionnthat you could possibly look,,and stretch it into this giant rectangle.,OK, here we go. 
 So, first: camera movementnis tricky in VR.,Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.,We found if you move the cameranat a constant speed in a straight line,,you can actually get away with it, though.,The first day in film school,,they told me you have to learnnevery single rule,before you can break one.,We have not learned every single rule.,We've barely learned any at all,,but we're already trying to break them,to see what kind of creative thingsnwe can accomplish.,In this shot here, where we're moving upnoff the ground, I added acceleration.,I did that because I wantednto give you a physical sensation,of moving up off the ground.,In VR, I can give that to you. 
 (Music) 
 Not surprisingly, music matters a lotnin this medium as well.,It guides us how to feel.,In this project we madenwith the New York Times, Zach Richter,and our friend, JR,,we take you up in a helicopter,,and even though you're flyingn2,000 feet above Manhattan,,you don't feel afraid.,You feel triumphant for JR's character.,The music guides you there. 
 (Music) 
 Contrary to popular belief,,there is composition in virtual reality,,but it's completelyndifferent than in film,,where you have a rectangular frame.,Composition is nownwhere your consciousness exists,and how the world moves around you.,In this film, "Waves of Grace,"nwhich was a collaboration between Vrse,,the United Nations, Gabo Arora,nand Imraan Ismail,,we also see the changing rolenof the close-up in virtual reality.,A close-up in VR meansnyou're actually close up to someone.,It brings that character insidenof your personal space,,a space that we'd usually reservenfor the people that we love.,And you feel an emotionalncloseness to the character,because of what you feelnto be a physical closeness. 
 Directing VR is not likendirecting for the rectangle.,It's more of a choreographynof the viewer's attention.,One tool we can usento guide your attention,is called "spatialized sound.",I can put a sound anywherenin front of you, to left or right,,even behind you,,and when you turn your head,nthe sound will rotate accordingly.,So I can use that to direct your attentionnto where I want you to see.,Next time you hear someonensinging over your shoulder,,it might be Bono. 
 (Laughter) 
 VR makes us feelnlike we are part of something.,For most of human history,nwe lived in small family units.,We started in caves,,then moved to clans and tribes,nthen villages and towns,,and now we're all global citizens.,But I believe that we are stillnhardwired to care the most,about the things that are local to us.,And VR makes anywherenand anyone feel local.,That's why it works as an empathy machine.,Our film "Clouds Over Sidra"ntakes you to a Syrian refugee camp,,and instead of watching a storynabout people over there,,it's now a story about us here. 
 But where do we go from here?,The tricky thing is thatnwith all previous mediums,,the format is fixed at its birth.,Film has been a sequence of rectangles,,from Muybridge and his horses to now.,The format has never changed.,But VR as a format, as a medium,,isn't complete yet.,It's not using physical celluloidnor paper or TV signals.,It actually employs what we usento make sense of the world.,We're using your sensesnas the paints on the canvas,,but only two right now.,Eventually, we can see if we will havenall of our human senses employed,,and we will have agency to liventhe story in any path we choose.,And we call it virtual reality right now,,but what happens when we movenpast simulated realities?,What do we call it then?,What if instead of verballyntelling you about a dream,,I could let you live inside that dream?,What if instead of just experiencingnvisiting some reality on Earth,,you could surf gravitational wavesnon the edge of a black hole,,or create galaxies from scratch,,or communicate with each othernnot using words,but using our raw thoughts?,That's not a virtual reality anymore.,And honestly I don't knownwhat that's called.,But I hope you see where we're going. 
 But here I am, intellectualizingna medium I'm saying is experiential.,So let's experience it.,In your hands, you hopefully holdna piece of cardboard.,Let's open the flap.,Tap on the power buttonnto unlock the phone.,For the people watching at home,,we're going to put up a card right now,to show you how to downloadnthis experience on your phone yourself,,and even get a Google cardboardnof your own to try it with.,We played in cardboard boxes as kids,,and as adults, I'm hoping we can all findna little bit of that lightning,by sticking our head in one again.,You're about to participate,in the largest collectivenVR viewing in history.,And in that classic old-timeynstyle of yesteryear,,we're all going to watch something,at the exact same time, together.,Let's hope it works.,What's the countdownnlook like? I can't see.

 Chris Milk: How was it? 
 (Applause) 
 That was a cheap way of getting younto do a standing ovation.,I just made you all stand.nI knew you'd applaud at the end. 
 (Applause) 
 I believe that everyone on Earthnneeds to experience,what you just experienced.,That way we can collectivelynstart to shape this,,not as a tech platform,but as a humanity platform.,And to that end, in November of last year,,the New York Times and Vrse madena VR project called "The Displaced.",It launched with one millionnGoogle Cardboards,sent out to every Sunday subscribernwith their newspaper.,But a funny thing happenednthat Sunday morning.,A lot of people got them,that were not the intended recipientsnon the mailing label.,And we started seeing thisnall over Instagram.,Look familiar? 
 Music led me on a path,of searching for what seemednlike the unattainable,for a very long time.,Now, millions of kids just hadnthe same formative experience,in their childhood,that I had in mine.,Only I think this one,surpasses it.,Let's see,where this,leads them. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hi.,Let me ask the audience a question:,Did you ever lie as a child?,If you did, could you pleasenraise your hand?,Wow! This is the most honestngroup of people I've ever met. 
 (Laughter) 
 So for the last 20 years,,I've been studyingnhow children learn to tell lies.,And today, I'm going to share with you,some of the discoveries we have made. 
 But to begin, I'm going to tell youna story from Mr. Richard Messina,,who is my friend and an elementarynschool principal.,He got a phone call one day.,The caller says,,"Mr. Messina, my son Johnnynwill not come to school today,because he's sick." 
 Mr. Messina asks,,"Who am I speaking to, please?" 
 And the caller says,,"I am my father." 
 (Laughter) 
 So this story -- 
 (Laughter) 
 sums up very nicelynthree common beliefs we have,about children and lying.,One, children only come to tell lies,after entering elementary school.,Two, children are poor liars.,We adults can easily detect their lies.,And three, if children lienat a very young age,,there must be somencharacter flaws with them,,and they are going to becomenpathological liars for life.,Well, it turns out,all of the three beliefs are wrong. 
 We have been playing guessing games,with children all over the world.,Here is an example.,So in this game, we asked childrennto guess the numbers on the cards.,And we tell them if they win the game,,they are going to get a big prize.,But in the middle of the game,,we make an excuse and leave the room.,And before we leave the room,,we tell them not to peek at the cards.,Of course,,we have hidden cameras in the room,to watch their every move.,Because the desirento win the game is so strong,,more than 90 percent of children will peek,as soon as we leave the room. 
 (Laughter) 
 The crucial question is:,When we return and ask the children,whether or not they have peeked,,will the children who peeked confess,or lie about their transgression? 
 We found that regardlessnof gender, country, religion,,at two years of age,,30 percent lie,,70 percent tell the truthnabout their transgression.,At three years of age,,50 percent lie and 50 percentntell the truth.,At four years of age,,more than 80 percent lie.,And after four years of age,,most children lie.,So as you can see,,lying is really a typical partnof development.,And some children begin to tell lies,as young as two years of age. 
 So now, let's take a closer looknat the younger children.,Why do some but not allnyoung children lie?,In cooking, you need good ingredients,to cook good food.,And good lying requiresntwo key ingredients.,The first key ingredientnis theory of mind,,or the mind-reading ability.,Mind reading is the ability to know,that different people havendifferent knowledge about the situation,and the ability to differentiatenbetween what I know,and what you know.,Mind reading is important for lying,because the basis of lying is that I know,you don't know,what I know.,Therefore, I can lie to you. 
 The second key ingredientnfor good lying is self-control.,It is the ability to control your speech,nyour facial expression,and your body language,,so that you can tell a convincing lie.,And we found that those young children,who have more advanced mind-readingnand self-control abilities,tell lies earlier,and are more sophisticated liars.,As it turns out, these two abilitiesnare also essential for all of us,to function well in our society.,In fact, deficits in mind-readingnand self-control abilities,are associated with seriousndevelopmental problems,,such as ADHD and autism.,So if you discover your two-year-oldnis telling his or her first lie,,instead of being alarmed,,you should celebrate -- 
 (Laughter) 
 because it signals that your childnhas arrived at a new milestone,of typical development. 
 Now, are children poor liars?,Do you think you can easilyndetect their lies?,Would you like to give it a try?,Yes? OK.,So I'm going to show you two videos.,In the videos,,the children are going to respondnto a researcher's question,,"Did you peek?",So try to tell me,which child is lying,and which child is telling the truth.,Here's child number one.,Are you ready? 
 (Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No. 
 Kang Lee: And this is child number two. 
 (Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No. 
 KL: OK, if you thinknchild number one is lying,,please raise your hand.,And if you think child number twonis lying, please raise your hand.,OK, so as a matter of fact,,child number one is telling the truth,,child number two is lying.,Looks like many of you are terriblendetectors of children's lies. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, we have played similar kinds of games,with many, many adultsnfrom all walks of life.,And we show them many videos.,In half of the videos, the children lied.,In the other half of the videos,nthe children told the truth.,And let's find outnhow these adults performed.,Because there are as many liarsnas truth tellers,,if you guess randomly,,there's a 50 percent chancenyou're going to get it right.,So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,,it means you are a terrible detectornof children's lies. 
 So let's start with undergradsnand law school students,,who typically havenlimited experience with children.,No, they cannot detect children's lies.,Their performance is around chance. 
 Now how about social workersnand child-protection lawyers,,who work with children on a daily basis?,Can they detect children's lies?,No, they cannot. 
 (Laughter) 
 What about judges,,customs officers,and police officers,,who deal with liars on a daily basis?,Can they detect children's lies?,No, they cannot. 
 What about parents?,Can parents detect other children's lies?,No, they cannot. 
 What about, can parentsndetect their own children's lies?,No, they cannot. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 So now you may ask,why children's liesnare so difficult to detect.,Let me illustrate thisnwith my own son, Nathan.,This is his facial expression,when he lies. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when children lie,,their facial expressionnis typically neutral.,However, behind this neutral expression,,the child is actually experiencingna lot of emotions,,such as fear, guilt, shame,and maybe a little bit of liar's delight. 
 (Laughter) 
 Unfortunately, such emotionsnare either fleeting or hidden.,Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us. 
 So in the last five years,,we have been trying to figure out a waynto reveal these hidden emotions.,Then we made a discovery. 
 We know that underneath our facial skin,,there's a rich network of blood vessels.,When we experience different emotions,,our facial blood flow changes subtly.,And these changes are regulatednby the autonomic system,that is beyond our conscious control.,By looking at facial blood flow changes,,we can reveal people's hidden emotions.,Unfortunately, such emotion-relatednfacial blood flow changes,are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.,So to help us revealnpeople's facial emotions,,we have developed a new imaging technology,we call "transdermal optical imaging." 
 To do so, we use a regularnvideo camera to record people,when they experiencenvarious hidden emotions.,And then, using our imagenprocessing technology,,we can extract transdermal imagesnof facial blood flow changes.,By looking at transdermal video images,,now we can easily see,facial blood flow changes associatednwith the various hidden emotions.,And using this technology,,we can now reveal the hidden emotionsnassociated with lying,,and therefore detect people's lies.,We can do so noninvasively,,remotely, inexpensively,,with an accuracy at about 85 percent,,which is far better than chance level. 
 And in addition, we discoveredna Pinocchio effect.,No, not this Pinocchio effect. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is the real Pinocchio effect.,When people lie,,the facial blood flownon the cheeks decreases,,and the facial blood flownon the nose increases. 
 Of course, lying is not the only situation,that will evoke our hidden emotions.,So then we asked ourselves,,in addition to detecting lies,,how can our technology be used?,One application is in education.,For example, using this technology,nwe can help this mathematics teacher,to identify the student in his classroom,who may experience high anxietynabout the topic he's teaching,so that he can help him.,And also we can use this in health care.,For example, every day I Skype my parents,,who live thousands of miles away.,And using this technology,,I can not only find outnwhat's going on in their lives,but also simultaneously monitorntheir heart rate, their stress level,,their mood and whether or notnthey are experiencing pain.,And perhaps in the future,,their risks for heart attacknor hypertension.,And you may ask:,Can we use this also to revealnpoliticians' emotions? 
 (Laughter) 
 For example, during a debate.,Well, the answer is yes.,Using TV footage,,we could detectnthe politicians' heart rate,,mood and stress,,and perhaps in the future,nwhether or not they are lying to us.,We can also use thisnin marketing research,,for example, to find out,whether or not people likencertain consumer products.,We can even use it in dating.,So for example,,if your date is smiling at you,,this technology can help you to determine,whether she actually likes you,or she is just trying to be nice to you.,And in this case,,she is just trying to be nice to you. 
 (Laughter) 
 So transdermal optical imaging technology,is at a very early stage of development.,Many new applications will come aboutnthat we don't know today.,However, one thing I know for sure,is that lying will nevernbe the same again. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Xiè xie. 
 (Applause)So I know TED is about a lotnof things that are big,,but I want to talk to younabout something very small.,So small, it's a single word.,The word is "misfit.",It's one of my favorite words,nbecause it's so literal.,I mean, it's a personnwho sort of missed fitting in.,Or a person who fits in badly.,Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted,to new situations and environments.",I'm a card-carrying misfit.,And I'm here for the othernmisfits in the room,,because I'm never the only one.,I'm going to tell you a misfit story. 
 Somewhere in my early 30s,,the dream of becoming a writerncame right to my doorstep.,Actually, it came to my mailbox,in the form of a letter that saidnI'd won a giant literary prize,for a short story I had written.,The short story was about my lifenas a competitive swimmer,and about my crappy home life,,and a little bit about how griefnand loss can make you insane.,The prize was a trip to New York Citynto meet big-time editors and agents,and other authors.,So kind of it was the wannabenwriter's dream, right?,You know what I did the daynthe letter came to my house?,Because I'm me,,I put the letter on my kitchen table,,I poured myself a giant glass of vodka,with ice and lime,,and I sat there in my underwearnfor an entire day,,just staring at the letter.,I was thinking about all the waysnI'd already screwed my life up.,Who the hell was I to go to New York City,and pretend to be a writer?,Who was I? 
 I'll tell you.,I was a misfit.,Like legions of other children,,I came from an abusive household,that I narrowly escaped with my life.,I already had two epicallynfailed marriages underneath my belt.,I'd flunked out of collegennot once but twice,and maybe even a third timenthat I'm not going to tell you about. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'd done an episodenof rehab for drug use.,And I'd had two lovelynstaycations in jail.,So I'm on the right stage. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the real reason,nI think, I was a misfit,,is that my daughter diednthe day she was born,,and I hadn't figured outnhow to live with that story yet.,After my daughter diednI also spent a long time homeless,,living under an overpass,in a kind of profound statenof zombie grief and loss,that some of us encounter along the way.,Maybe all of us, if you live long enough.,You know, homeless peoplenare some of our most heroic misfits,,because they start out as us.,So you see, I'd missed fitting innto just about every category out there:,daughter, wife, mother, scholar.,And the dream of being a writer,was really kind of like a small,nsad stone in my throat. 
 It was pretty much in spite of myselfnthat I got on that plane,and flew to New York City,,where the writers are.,Fellow misfits, I can almostnsee your heads glowing.,I can pick you out of a room.,At first, you would've loved it.,You got to choose the threenfamous writers you wanted to meet,,and these guys wentnand found them for you.,You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel,,where you got to drink Scotchnlate in the night,with cool, smart, swank people.,And you got to pretend you were coolnand smart and swank, too.,And you got to meet a bunchnof editors and authors and agents,at very, very fancy lunches and dinners.,Ask me how fancy. 
 Audience: How fancy? 
 Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession:nI stole three linen napkins -- 
 (Laughter) 
 from three different restaurants.,And I shoved a menu down my pants. 
 (Laughter) 
 I just wanted some keepsakesnso that when I got home,,I could believe it had reallynhappened to me.,You know? 
 The three writers I wanted to meet,were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillmannand Peggy Phelan.,These were not famous,nbest-selling authors,,but to me, they were women-writer titans.,Carole Maso wrote the booknthat later became my art bible.,Lynne Tillman gave menpermission to believe,that there was a chancenmy stories could be part of the world.,And Peggy Phelan reminded me,that maybe my brainsncould be more important than my boobs.,They weren't mainstream women writers,,but they were cutting a pathnthrough the mainstream,with their body stories,,I like to think, kind of the waynwater cut the Grand Canyon. 
 It nearly killed me with joy,to hang out with these threenover-50-year-old women writers.,And the reason it nearlynkilled me with joy,is that I'd never known a joy like that.,I'd never been in a room like that.,My mother never went to college.,And my creative career to that point,was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.,So kind of in those first nightsnin New York I wanted to die there.,I was just like, "Kill me now.nI'm good. This is beautiful.",Some of you in the roomnwill understand what happened next. 
 First, they took me to the officesnof Farrar, Straus and Giroux.,Farrar, Straus and Girouxnwas like my mega-dream press.,I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connornwere published there.,The main editor guy sat me downnand talked to me for a long time,,trying to convince me I had a book in me,about my life as a swimmer.,You know, like a memoir.,The whole time he was talking to me,,I sat there smiling and noddingnlike a numb idiot,,with my arms crossed over my chest,,while nothing, nothing, nothingncame out of my throat.,So in the end, he patted menon the shoulder,like a swim coach might.,And he wished me luck,and he gave me some free books,and he showed me out the door. 
 Next, they took mento the offices of W.W. Norton,,where I was pretty surenI'd be escorted from the building,just for wearing Doc Martens.,But that didn't happen.,Being at the Norton offices,felt like reaching up into the night skynand touching the moon,while the stars stitched your namenacross the cosmos.,I mean, that's how bigna deal it was to me.,You get it?,Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,,leaned over right in my facenwith these beady, bright, fierce eyes,and said, "Well, send mensomething then, immediately!",See, now most people,nespecially TED people,,would have run to the mailbox, right?,It took me over a decade to even imagine,putting something in an envelopenand licking a stamp. 
 On the last night,,I gave a big readingnat the National Poetry Club.,And at the end of the reading,,Katharine Kidde of Kidde,nHoyt & Picard Literary Agency,,walked straight up to me and shook my hand,and offered me representation,nlike, on the spot.,I stood there and I kind of went deaf.,Has this ever happened to you?,And I almost started crying,because all the people in the roomnwere dressed so beautifully,,and all that came out of my mouth was:,"I don't know. I have to think about it.",And she said, "OK, then," and walked away.,All those open hands out to me,nthat small, sad stone in my throat ... 
 You see, I'm trying to tell you somethingnabout people like me.,Misfit people -- we don't always knownhow to hope or say yes,or choose the big thing,,even when it's right in front of us.,It's a shame we carry.,It's the shame of wanting something good.,It's the shame of feeling something good.,It's the shame of not really believingnwe deserve to be in the room,with the people we admire. 
 If I could, I'd go backnand I'd coach myself.,I'd be exactly like thosenover-50-year-old women who helped me.,I'd teach myself how to want things,,how to stand up, how to ask for them.,I'd say, "You! Yeah, you!nYou belong in the room, too.",The radiance falls on all of us,,and we are nothing without each other.,Instead, I flew back to Oregon,,and as I watched the evergreensnand rain come back into view,,I just drank many tiny bottlesnof airplane "feel sorry for yourself.",I thought about how, if I was a writer,nI was some kind of misfit writer.,What I'm saying is,,I flew back to Oregon without a book deal,,without an agent,,and with only a headfulnand heart-ful of memories,of having sat so near,the beautiful writers.,Memory was the only prizenI allowed myself. 
 And yet, at home in the dark,,back in my underwear,,I could still hear their voices.,They said, "Don't listen to anyonenwho tries to get you to shut up,or change your story.",They said, "Give voice to the storynonly you know how to tell.",They said, "Sometimes telling the story,is the thing that saves your life." 
 Now I am, as you can see,nthe woman over 50.,And I'm a writer.,And I'm a mother.,And I became a teacher.,Guess who my favorite students are.,Although it didn't happen the day,that dream letter came through my mailbox,,I did write a memoir,,called "The Chronology of Water.",In it are the stories of how many timesnI've had to reinvent a self,from the ruins of my choices,,the stories of how my seeming failuresnwere really just weird-ass portals,to something beautiful.,All I had to donwas give voice to the story. 
 There's a myth in most culturesnabout following your dreams.,It's called the hero's journey.,But I prefer a different myth,,that's slightly to the side of that,or underneath it.,It's called the misfit's myth.,And it goes like this:,even at the moment of your failure,,right then, you are beautiful.,You don't know it yet,,but you have the abilitynto reinvent yourself,endlessly.,That's your beauty. 
 You can be a drunk,,you can be a survivor of abuse,,you can be an ex-con,,you can be a homeless person,,you can lose all your moneynor your job or your husband,or your wife, or the worst thing of all,,a child.,You can even lose your marbles.,You can be standing dead centernin the middle of your failure,and still, I'm only here to tell you,,you are so beautiful.,Your story deserves to be heard,,because you, you rarenand phenomenal misfit,,you new species,,are the only one in the room,who can tell the story,the way only you would.,And I'd be listening. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We have historical records that allow usnto know how the ancient Greeks dressed,,how they lived,,how they fought ...,but how did they think? 
 One natural idea is that the deepestnaspects of human thought --,our ability to imagine,,to be conscious,,to dream --,have always been the same.,Another possibility,is that the social transformationsnthat have shaped our culture,may have also changednthe structural columns of human thought. 
 We may all have differentnopinions about this.,Actually, it's a long-standingnphilosophical debate.,But is this questionneven amenable to science? 
 Here I'd like to propose,that in the same way we can reconstructnhow the ancient Greek cities looked,just based on a few bricks,,that the writings of a culturenare the archaeological records,,the fossils, of human thought. 
 And in fact,,doing some form of psychological analysis,of some of the most ancientnbooks of human culture,,Julian Jaynes came up in the '70snwith a very wild and radical hypothesis:,that only 3,000 years ago,,humans were what todaynwe would call schizophrenics.,And he made this claim,based on the fact that the firstnhumans described in these books,behaved consistently,,in different traditionsnand in different places of the world,,as if they were hearing and obeying voices,that they perceivednas coming from the Gods,,or from the muses ...,what today we would call hallucinations.,And only then, as time went on,,they began to recognizenthat they were the creators,,the owners of these inner voices.,And with this, they gained introspection:,the ability to thinknabout their own thoughts. 
 So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,,at least in the way we perceive it today,,where we feel that we are the pilotsnof our own existence --,is a quite recent cultural development.,And this theory is quite spectacular,,but it has an obvious problem,which is that it's built on just a fewnand very specific examples.,So the question is whether the theory,that introspection built up in humannhistory only about 3,000 years ago,can be examined in a quantitativenand objective manner. 
 And the problem of hownto go about this is quite obvious.,It's not like Plato woke up one daynand then he wrote,,"Hello, I'm Plato,,and as of today, I havena fully introspective consciousness." 
 (Laughter) 
 And this tells us actuallynwhat is the essence of the problem.,We need to find the emergencenof a concept that's never said.,The word introspectionndoes not appear a single time,in the books we want to analyze. 
 So our way to solve thisnis to build the space of words.,This is a huge spacenthat contains all words,in such a way that the distancenbetween any two of them,is indicative of hownclosely related they are.,So for instance,,you want the words "dog" and "cat"nto be very close together,,but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm"nto be very far away.,And this has to be truenfor any two words within the space. 
 And there are different waysnthat we can construct the space of words.,One is just asking the experts,,a bit like we do with dictionaries.,Another possibility,is following the simple assumptionnthat when two words are related,,they tend to appear in the same sentences,,in the same paragraphs,,in the same documents,,more often than would be expectednjust by pure chance.,And this simple hypothesis,,this simple method,,with some computational tricks,that have to do with the fact,that this is a very complexnand high-dimensional space,,turns out to be quite effective. 
 And just to give you a flavornof how well this works,,this is the result we get whennwe analyze this for some familiar words.,And you can see first,that words automatically organizeninto semantic neighborhoods.,So you get the fruits, the body parts,,the computer parts,nthe scientific terms and so on. 
 The algorithm also identifiesnthat we organize concepts in a hierarchy.,So for instance,,you can see that the scientific termsnbreak down into two subcategories,of the astronomic and the physics terms.,And then there are very fine things.,For instance, the word astronomy,,which seems a bit bizarre where it is,,is actually exactly where it should be,,between what it is,,an actual science,,and between what it describes,,the astronomical terms. 
 And we could go on and on with this.,Actually, if you starenat this for a while,,and you just build random trajectories,,you will see that it actually feelsna bit like doing poetry.,And this is because, in a way,,walking in this spacenis like walking in the mind. 
 And the last thing,is that this algorithm also identifiesnwhat are our intuitions,,of which words should leadnin the neighborhood of introspection.,So for instance,,words such as "self," "guilt,"n"reason," "emotion,",are very close to "introspection,",but other words,,such as "red," "football,"n"candle," "banana,",are just very far away. 
 And so once we've built the space,,the question of the historynof introspection,,or of the history of any concept,which before could seem abstractnand somehow vague,,becomes concrete --,becomes amenable to quantitative science. 
 All that we have to do is take the books,,we digitize them,,and we take this streamnof words as a trajectory,and project them into the space,,and then we ask whether this trajectorynspends significant time,circling closely to the conceptnof introspection. 
 And with this,,we could analyzenthe history of introspection,in the ancient Greek tradition,,for which we have the bestnavailable written record.,So what we did is we took all the books --,we just ordered them by time --,for each book we take the words,and we project them to the space,,and then we ask for each wordnhow close it is to introspection,,and we just average that.,And then we ask whether,nas time goes on and on,,these books get closer,nand closer and closer,to the concept of introspection. 
 And this is exactly what happensnin the ancient Greek tradition.,So you can see that for the oldest booksnin the Homeric tradition,,there is a small increase with booksngetting closer to introspection.,But about four centuries before Christ,,this starts ramping up very rapidlynto an almost five-fold increase,of books getting closer,nand closer and closer,to the concept of introspection.,And one of the nice things about this,is that now we can ask,whether this is also truenin a different, independent tradition. 
 So we just ran this same analysisnon the Judeo-Christian tradition,,and we got virtually the same pattern.,Again, you see a small increasenfor the oldest books in the Old Testament,,and then it increases much more rapidly,in the new books of the New Testament.,And then we get the peak of introspection,in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine,",about four centuries after Christ.,And this was very important,,because Saint Augustinenhad been recognized by scholars,,philologists, historians,,as one of the founders of introspection.,Actually, some believe him to benthe father of modern psychology. 
 So our algorithm,,which has the virtuenof being quantitative,,of being objective,,and of course of being extremely fast --,it just runs in a fraction of a second --,can capture some of the mostnimportant conclusions,of this long tradition of investigation.,And this is in a waynone of the beauties of science,,which is that now this ideancan be translated,and generalized to a whole lotnof different domains. 
 So in the same way that we askednabout the past of human consciousness,,maybe the most challenging questionnwe can pose to ourselves,is whether this can tell us somethingnabout the future of our own consciousness.,To put it more precisely,,whether the words we say today,can tell us somethingnof where our minds will be in a few days,,in a few months,or a few years from now. 
 And in the same way many of usnare now wearing sensors,that detect our heart rate,,our respiration,,our genes,,on the hopes that this maynhelp us prevent diseases,,we can ask whether monitoringnand analyzing the words we speak,,we tweet, we email, we write,,can tell us ahead of time whethernsomething may go wrong with our minds.,And with Guillermo Cecchi,,who has been my brother in this adventure,,we took on this task.,And we did so by analyzingnthe recorded speech of 34 young people,who were at a high risknof developing schizophrenia. 
 And so what we did is,nwe measured speech at day one,,and then we asked whether the propertiesnof the speech could predict,,within a window of almost three years,,the future development of psychosis.,But despite our hopes,,we got failure after failure.,There was just not enoughninformation in semantics,to predict the futurenorganization of the mind.,It was good enough,to distinguish between a groupnof schizophrenics and a control group,,a bit like we had donenfor the ancient texts,,but not to predict the futurenonset of psychosis. 
 But then we realized,that maybe the most important thingnwas not so much what they were saying,,but how they were saying it.,More specifically,,it was not in which semanticnneighborhoods the words were,,but how far and fast they jumped,from one semantic neighborhoodnto the other one.,And so we came up with this measure,,which we termed semantic coherence,,which essentially measures the persistencenof speech within one semantic topic,,within one semantic category. 
 And it turned out to benthat for this group of 34 people,,the algorithm based on semanticncoherence could predict,,with 100 percent accuracy,,who developed psychosis and who will not.,And this was somethingnthat could not be achieved --,not even close --,with all the othernexisting clinical measures. 
 And I remember vividly,nwhile I was working on this,,I was sitting at my computer,and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo --,Polo had been my first studentnback in Buenos Aires,,and at the timenhe was living in New York.,And there was something in this tweets --,I could not tell exactly whatnbecause nothing was said explicitly --,but I got this strong hunch,,this strong intuition,nthat something was going wrong.,So I picked up the phone,nand I called Polo,,and in fact he was not feeling well.,And this simple fact,,that reading in between the lines,,I could sense,nthrough words, his feelings,,was a simple, but veryneffective way to help. 
 What I tell you today,is that we're gettingnclose to understanding,how we can convert this intuitionnthat we all have,,that we all share,,into an algorithm.,And in doing so,,we may be seeing in the futurena very different form of mental health,,based on objective, quantitativenand automated analysis,of the words we write,,of the words we say. 
 Gracias. 
 (Applause)Do I look real to you?,Hope so.,I have no idea if you're seeing this,,but I'm just going to look aheadnand trust that you're there.,I've drawn a semicirclenin the sand in front of me,so I don't walk past itnand look like I'm floating in midair. 
 Right now I'm standing,in the open air,,on a beach under a palm tree,,in the exact spotnwhere your stage used to be.,I have 12 minutes with you.,I set a limit.,My wife Navid once said,that infinite possibilitynis a creator's worst enemy.,For example, this dress: I'd askednher to design something,that a priest might have wornnin 23rd-century Cairo.,But we only had three days to make it,,and the only fabric we had,was an old duvet covernthat another resident left behind.,But she did it, and it's perfect.,And she looked at it and said,,"Proof of concept --ncreation needs constraint.",So with these 12 minutes,,I'm going to tell younabout my greatest discovery. 
 For my whole life, my obsessionnhas been eternal life,,as I know it is so many of yours.,You may be happy to knownthat your research will pay off.,I am 318 years old.,The average human lifespannis now 432 years,,and my work has been to extendnthe human lifespan indefinitely.,And I've never questioned that someday,,we'll reach a pointnwhere we'll be content.,But the opposite keeps happening:,the longer we live,nthe longer we want to live,,the less we want to die. 
 Who can blame us?,The universe is so big.,There won't ever not be more to see.,Just yesterday,,I was reading about how you canntake out a boat on Europa,and sail from island to islandnall over the planet,,and some of the islands have villagesnthat you can stay and visit,and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.,And then there's this other islandnwhere there's just one songwriter,who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.,And then there are othersnwhere there's no one,and there never has been,,and so you go just for the pleasurenof touching your foot to sand,that no foot has ever touched before.,You could spend 400 years doing just that. 
 Right now the Moon is risingnin the Northeast.,I can see the cities on itnwith my naked eye.,They're connected like nerve clusters:,Mariapolis on the South Pole,nand Ramachandran on the Equator.,And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility. 
 That's where Navid and I met.,We were both artists downtown.,The day we met, we were passingneach other in Azadi Square,,and we bumped shoulders.,And I turned to apologize,and she, without saying hellonor introducing herself or anything,,said, "Well, why do you thinknwe didn't just pass through each other?",And first of all, I thought,n"Who the hell are you?",But second, the question annoyed me,,because the answer is so simple.,I said, "We didn't pass through each other,because elementary particles have mass,and because the spacenbetween elementary particles,is filled with the binding energynthat also has the properties of mass,,and we've known that for 800 years.",She must have been in one of those moods,where she likes to mess with strangers.,Or maybe she was just flirting with me,,because she looked at me and said,n"I thought you'd say that.,Think deeper.",And then she took off her belt,,this belt that I'm wearing now,,and she said,,"Our universe is builtnso that particles have mass.,Without that basic constraint,,we'd have just passed right throughneach other at the speed of light,and never even known." 
 And that's how our romance began.,Navid and I,never ran out of things to talk about.,Never.,It was incredible.,It was like we were both heroesnclimbing up into a mountain range together,and we kept arriving at new vistas,,and these new, perfectnconstellations of words,would come out of us to describe them.,And we'd forget themnas soon as we made them,,and throw them over our shouldernand go on to the next thing, on and up.,Or one time, Navid said that our talknwas like we were always making bread,,and that we were alwaysnadding in a little more flour,and a little more water,,and folding it in and turning it over,and never getting around to baking it. 
 If my obsession was eternal life,nNavid's obsession was touch.,She had a genius for it.,All of her work revolved around it.,My body was like a canvas for her,,and she would draw her fingertipndown over my face so slowly,that I couldn't feel it moving.,And she was obsessed with the exact moment,when I would stop being able to tellnthe difference between her body and mine.,Or she would just lie across menand dig her shoulder into mine,and say, "Pilar, why doesnthis feel so good?",I'd say, "I don't know!",And she always had a facetious answernfor her facetious question,,but the answer I remember today is,,"It feels good,because the universe chosenits constraints,,and we are its art." 
 It's always funny what you thinknthe future is going to be like,versus what it turns out to be.,In your time, scientists thoughtnhumans could freeze themselves,and wake up in the future.,And they did -- but then they died.,In your time, scientists thoughtnhumans could replace organs,and extend life for hundreds of years.,And they did,,but eventually, they died anyway.,In your time, Earthnis the only place people live.,In my time, Earth is the placenpeople come to die. 
 So when Navid started to show the signs,,our friends assumed I would donwhat everyone does,,which is say goodbyenand send her to Earth,,so that none of usnwould have to look at her,or be around hernor think about her and her ...,failure to keep living.,More than anything,,they didn't want to be aroundnher actual physical body.,They kept referring to it as "declining,",even though she herselfnwas fascinated by it,,the changes it was going through,,following the rules of its naturenday by day, independent of her will.,I did send Navid to Earth.,But I came with her.,I remember a friend of ours,njust before we left, said,,"I just think it's arrogant,,like the rules don't apply to you,nlike you think your love is that special.",But I did. 
 So, even here on Earth,,I kept working on how to extend life.,It didn't occur to me,that there could be any other response.,I kept going back to that thingnthat Navid said to me,that day in Azadi Square,,that without that basic constraint --,a universe that granted mass to matter --,we would not exist.,That's one rule.,Another rule is that all massnis subject to entropy.,And there is no way to benin this universe without mass.,I know. I tried everything.,I tried creating a photon boxnwhere the Higgs field was altered.,I tried recording allnsubatomic movements in my body,and replaying them on closed loop.,Nothing worked. 
 But my final innovationnwas to create a coil dimension,with the boundaries of a bodynin which time moved infinitely slower,,but whose projection would appearnto move in normal time.,That body would then appearnin our universe as a hologram --,here but not here.,When I realized I'd done it,,I ran to her room,,so happy to tell her I'd done it,,moving through spacenalmost normally to all eyes,,even to my own,,and went to lie down next to her,,and forgot, and fell right through her.,I'd found a way to eternal life,,at the expense of the one thingnNavid loved most,,which was to touch and be touched.,And she threw me out.,I still got to watch, though. 
 Humans live 400 years now,,and we still die.,And when death comes,,the dying still pick at their bedsheets,,and their arms break outnin blue and violet blooms on the insides,,and their breaths get furthernand further apart,,like they're falling asleep. 
 I've always thought that,what gives a life meaning is adventure.,And death is just a problem,we haven't discovered the solution to yet.,But maybe a life has meaningnonly because it ends.,Maybe that's the paradox:,constraints don't constrain,nthey allow perfect freedom. 
 (Sighs) 
 There was a thunderstormnhere this morning.,There is another forecast for tonight,,but for now the sky is clear.,I can't feel the wind here,,but I just asked one of the caretakersnwho passed by what it felt like,,and she said it felt warm,nlike melted butter.,An answer worthy of my wife.,I have to find my way back to the flesh.,Until then, I take up no spacenbut the space you give me.It began with one question:,If Africa was a bar, what wouldnyour country be drinking or doing?,I kicked it off with a guessnabout South Africa,,which wasn't exactlynaccording to the rules,because South Africa's not my country.,But alluding to the country'sncontinual attempts,to build a postracial society,after being ravagednfor decades by apartheid,,I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africanwould be drinking all kinds of alcohol,and begging themnto get along in its stomach. 
 And then I waited.,And then I had that funny feelingnwhere I wondered if I crossed the line.,So, I sent out a few other tweetsnabout my own country,and a few other African countriesnI'm familiar with.,And then I waited again,,but this time,I read through almost every tweetnI had ever tweeted,to convince myself,,no, to remind myself that I'm really funny,and that if nobody gets it, that's fine. 
 But luckily,,I didn't have to do that for very long.,Very soon, people were participating.,In fact, by the end of that week in July,,the hashtag #ifafricawasabar,would have garnered around 60,000 tweets,,lit up the continent,and made its way to publicationsnall over the world. 
 People were using the hashtagnto do many different things.,To poke fun at their stereotypes:,[#IfAfricaWasABarnNigeria would be outside explaining,that he will pay the entrance fee,,all he needs isnthe bouncer's account details.] 
 (Laughter) 
 To criticize government spending:,[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would benordering bottles it can't pronounce,running a tab it won't be able to pay] 
 To make light of geopolitical tensions:,[#IfAfricaWasABarnSouth Sudan would be the new guy,with serious anger management issues.] 
 To remind us that even in Africa,there are some countriesnwe don't know exist:,[#IfAfricaWasABarnLesotho would be that person,who nobody really knowsnbut is always in the pictures.] 
 And also to make fun of the countriesnthat don't think that they're in Africa:,[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya,nTunisia, Algeria and Morocco,be like "What the hellnare we doing here?!!"] 
 (Laughter) 
 And to note the countriesnthat had made a big turnaround:,[#ifAfricawasabarnRwanda would be that girl,that comes with no money and no transportnbut leaves drunk, happy and rich] 
 But most importantly,,people were using the hashtag to connect.,People were connectingnover their Africanness.,So for one week in July,,Twitter became a real African bar.,And I was really thrilled,,mainly because I realizednthat Pan-Africanism could work,,that we had before us,nbetween us, at our fingertips,a platform that just needed a small spark,to light in us a hunger for each other. 
 My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,,I'm 22 years old,and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.,Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth,because my parents arenfrom two different African countries.,My father's from a countryncalled Botswana in southern Africa.,It's only slightly bigger than Germany.,This year we celebratenour 50th year of stable democracy.,And it has some very progressivensocial policies.,My mother's countrynis the Kingdom of Swaziland.,It's a very, very small country,nalso in southern Africa.,It is Africa's last complete monarchy.,So it's been ruled by a kingnand a royal family,in line with their tradition,,for a very long time. 
 On paper, these countriesnseem very different.,And when I was a kid,nI could see the difference.,It rained a lot in one country,nit didn't rain quite as much in the other.,But outside of that,nI didn't really realize,why it mattered that my parentsnwere from two different places.,But it would go onnto have a very peculiar effect on me.,You see, I was born in one country,and raised in the other. 
 When we moved to Botswana,,I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati,and nothing else.,So I was being introduced to my new home,,my new cultural identity,,as a complete outsider,,incapable of comprehendingnanything that was being said to me,by the family and country whose traditionsnI was meant to move forward.,But very soon, I would shed SiSwati.,And when I would go back to Swaziland,,I would be constantly confrontednby how very non-Swazi I was becoming. 
 Add to that my entryninto Africa's private school system,,whose entire purposenis to beat the Africanness out of you,,and I would havena very peculiar adolescence.,But I think that my interestnin ideas of identity was born here,,in the strange intersectionnof belonging to two places at once,but not really belongingnto either one very well,and belonging to this vast spacenin between and around simultaneously.,I became obsessed with the ideanof a shared African identity. 
 Since then, I have continuednto read about politics,and geography and identitynand what all those things mean.,I've also held on to a deep curiositynabout African philosophies.,When I began to read,,I gravitated towards the worksnof black intellectuals,like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,,who tackled complex ideas,like decolonizationnand black consciousness.,And when I thought, at 14,nthat I had digested these grand ideas,,I moved on to the speechesnof iconic African statesmen,like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara,and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.,I read every piece of African fictionnthat I could get my hands on. 
 So when Twitter came,,I hopped on with the enthusiasmnof a teenage girl,whose friends are super, super borednof hearing about all this random stuff. 
 The year was 2011,and all over southern Africanand the whole continent,,affordable data packagesnfor smartphones and Internet surfing,became much easier to get.,So my generation, we were sendingnmessages to each other on this platform,that just needed 140 charactersnand a little bit of creativity.,On long commutes to work,,in lectures that some of usnshould have been paying attention to,,on our lunch breaks,,we would communicate as much as we could,about the everyday realitiesnof being young and African. 
 But of course, this luxurynwas not available to everybody.,So this meant that if you werena teenage girl in Botswana,and you wantednto have fun on the Internet,,one, you had to tweet in English.,Two, you had to follow more than justnthe three other people you knew online.,You had to follow South Africans,nZimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.,And suddenly, your whole world opened up.,And my whole world did open up. 
 I followed vibrant Africansnwho were travelling around the continent,,taking pictures of themselves,and posting themnunder the hashtag #myafrica.,Because at that time,,if you were to search Africanon Twitter or on Google,or any kind of social media,,you would think that the entire continentnwas just pictures of animals,and white guys drinking cocktailsnin hotel resorts. 
 (Laughter) 
 But Africans were using this platform,to take some kind of ownershipnof the tourism sectors.,It was Africans taking selfiesnon the beaches of Nigeria.,It was Africansnin cocktail bars in Nairobi. 
 And these were the same Africansnthat I began to meet,in my own travels around the continent.,We would discuss African literature,npolitics, economic policy.,But almost invariably, every single time,,we would end up discussing Twitter.,And that's when I realized what this was.,We were standing in the middlenof something amazing,,because for the first time ever,young Africans could discussnthe future of our continent in real time,,without the restriction of borders,nfinances and watchful governments. 
 Because the little known truth is,many Africans know a lot lessnabout other African countries,than some Westernersnmight know about Africa as a whole.,This is by accident,,but sometimes, it's by design.,For example, in apartheid South Africa,,black South Africansnwere constantly being bombarded,with this message that any countrynruled by black people,was destined for failure.,And this was done to convince them,that they were much better offnunder crushing white rule,than they were livingnin a black and free nation.,Add to that Africa's colonial,narchaic education system,,which has been unthinkinglyncarried over from the 1920s --,and at the age of 15,nI could name all the various causes,of the wars that had happenednin Europe in the past 200 years,,but I couldn't name the presidentnof my neighboring country.,And to me, this doesn't make any sense,because whether we like it or not,,the fates of African peoplenare deeply intertwined. 
 When disaster hits, when turmoil hits,,we share the consequences.,When Burundians flee political turmoil,,they go to us,,to other African countries.,Africa has six of the world'snlargest refugee centers.,What was once a Burundian problem,becomes an African problem.,So to me, there are no Sudanese problems,or South African problemsnor Kenyan problems,,only African problems,because eventually, we share the turmoil. 
 So if we share the problems,,why aren't we doing a better jobnof sharing the successes?,How can we do that?,Well, in the long term,,we can shoot towardsnincreasing inter-African trade,,removing bordersnand putting pressure on leaders,to fulfill regional agreementsnthey've already signed.,But I think that the biggest waynfor Africa to share its successes,is to foster somethingnI like to call social Pan-Africanism. 
 Now, political Pan-Africanismnalready exists,,so I'm not inventing anythingntotally new here.,But political Pan-Africanism,is usually the African unitynof the political elite.,And who does that benefit?,Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.,No, what I'm talking about,is the Pan-Africanismnof the ordinary African.,Young Africans like me,,we are bursting with creative energy,,with innovative ideas.,But with bad governancenand shaky institutions,,all of this potential could go to waste.,On a continent where morenthan a handful of leaders,have been in power longer,than the majoritynof the populations has been alive,,we are in desperate need of something new,,something that works.,And I think that thingnis social Pan-Africanism. 
 My dream is that young Africans,stop allowing borders and circumstancento suffocate our innovation.,My dream is that when a young Africanncomes up with something brilliant,,they don't say, "Well,nthis wouldn't work in my country,",and then give up.,My dream is that young Africansnbegin to realize,that the entire continentnis our canvas, is our home.,Using the Internet,nwe can begin to think collaboratively,,we can begin to innovate together.,In Africa, we say,n"If you want to go fast, you go alone,,but if you want to go far,nyou go together.",And I believe that social Pan-Africanismnis how we can go far together. 
 And this is already happening.,Access to these online networksnhas given young Africans,something we've alwaysnhad to violently take: a voice.,We now have a platform.,Before now, if you wantednto hear from the youth in Africa,,you waited for the 65-year-oldnminister of youth -- 
 (Laughter) 
 to wake up in the morning,,take his heartburn medication,and then tell you the plansnhe has for your generation,in 20 years time.,Before now, if you wanted to be heardnby your possibly tyrannical government,,you were pushed to protest,nsuffer the consequences,and have your fingers crossed,that some Western paper somewherenmight make someone care.,But now we have opportunitiesnto back each other up,in ways we never could before. 
 We support South African students,who are marching againstnridiculously high tertiary fees.,We support Zimbabwean womennwho are marching to parliament.,We support Angolan journalistsnwho are being illegally detained.,For the first time ever,,African pain and African aspiration,has the ability to be witnessed,by those who can empathizenwith it the most:,other Africans. 
 I believe that withna social Pan-Africanist thinking,and using the Internet as a tool,,we can begin to rescue each other,,and ultimately, to rescue ourselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Imagine that you invented a device,that can record my memories,,my dreams, my ideas,,and transmit them to your brain.,That would be a game-changingntechnology, right?,But in fact, we alreadynpossess this device,,and it's called human communication system,and effective storytelling.,To understand how this device works,,we have to look into our brains.,And we have to formulate the questionnin a slightly different manner. 
 Now we have to ask,how these neuron patterns in my brain,that are associatednwith my memories and ideas,are transmitted into your brains.,And we think there are two factorsnthat enable us to communicate.,First, your brain is nownphysically coupled to the sound wave,that I'm transmitting to your brain.,And second, we developedna common neural protocol,that enabled us to communicate. 
 So how do we know that?,In my lab in Princeton,,we bring people to the fMRI scannernand we scan their brains,while they are either tellingnor listening to real-life stories.,And to give you a sensenof the stimulus we are using,,let me play 20 secondsnfrom a story that we used,,told by a very talented storyteller,,Jim O'Grady. 
 (Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging outnmy story and I know it's good,,and then I start to make it better -- 
 (Laughter) 
 by adding an element of embellishment.,Reporters call this "making shit up." 
 (Laughter) 
 And they recommendnagainst crossing that line.,But I had just seen the line crossednbetween a high-powered dean,and assault with a pastry.,And I kinda liked it." 
 Uri Hasson: OK, so nownlet's look into your brain,and see what's happeningnwhen you listen to these kinds of stories.,And let's start simple -- let's startnwith one listener and one brain area:,the auditory cortex that processesnthe sounds that come from the ear.,And as you can see,nin this particular brain area,,the responses are going up and downnas the story is unfolding.,Now we can take these responses,and compare them to the responsesnin other listeners,in the same brain area.,And we can ask:,How similar are the responsesnacross all listeners? 
 So here you can see five listeners.,And we start to scan their brainsnbefore the story starts,,when they're simply lying in the darknand waiting for the story to begin.,As you can see,,the brain area is going up and downnin each one of them,,but the responses are very different,,and not in sync.,However, immediatelynas the story is starting,,something amazing is happening. 
 (Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my storynand I know it's good,,and then I start to make it -- 
 UH: Suddenly, you can seenthat the responses in all of the subjects,lock to the story,,and now they are going up and downnin a very similar way,across all listeners.,And in fact, this is exactlynwhat is happening now in your brains,when you listen to my sound speaking.,We call this effect "neural entrainment.",And to explain to younwhat is neural entrainment,,let me first explainnwhat is physical entrainment. 
 So, we'll look and see five metronomes.,Think of these five metronomesnas five brains.,And similar to the listenersnbefore the story starts,,these metronomes are going to click,,but they're going to click out of phase. 
 (Clicking) 
 Now see what will happennwhen I connect them together,by placing them on these two cylinders. 
 (Clicking) 
 Now these two cylinders start to rotate.,This rotation vibrationnis going through the wood,and is going to couplenall the metronomes together.,And now listen to the click. 
 (Synchronized clicking) 
 This is what you callnphysical entrainment.,Now let's go back to the brain and ask:,What's driving this neural entrainment?,Is it simply the soundsnthat the speaker is producing?,Or maybe it's the words.,Or maybe it's the meaningnthat the speaker is trying to convey. 
 So to test it, we didnthe following experiment.,First, we took the storynand played it backwards.,And that preserved manynof the original auditory features,,but removed the meaning.,And it sounds something like that. 
 (Audio) JO: (Unintelligible) 
 And we flashed colors in the two brains,to indicate brain areas that respondnvery similarly across people.,And as you can see,,this incoming sound induced entrainmentnor alignment in all of the brains,in auditory corticesnthat process the sounds,,but it didn't spreadndeeper into the brain. 
 Now we can take these soundsnand build words out of it.,So if we take Jim O'Gradynand scramble the words,,we'll get a list of words. 
 (Audio) JO: ... an animal ...nassorted facts ...,and right on ... pie man ...npotentially ... my stories 
 UH: And you can see that these wordsnstart to induce alignment,in early language areas,nbut not more than that.,Now we can take the wordsnand start to build sentences out of them. 
 (Audio) JO: And they recommendnagainst crossing that line.,He says: "Dear Jim,nGood story. Nice details.,Didn't she only knownabout him through me?" 
 UH: Now you can see that the responsesnin all the language areas,that process the incoming language,become aligned or similarnacross all listeners.,However, only when we usenthe full, engaging, coherent story,do the responses spreadndeeper into the brain,into higher-order areas,,which include the frontal cortexnand the parietal cortex,,and make all of themnrespond very similarly.,And we believe that these responsesnin higher-order areas are induced,or become similar across listeners,because of the meaningnconveyed by the speaker,,and not by words or sound.,And if we are right,nthere's a strong prediction over here,if I tell you the exact same ideas,using two very different sets of words,,your brain responsesnwill still be similar. 
 And to test it, we didnthe following experiment in my lab.,We took the English story,and translated it to Russian.,Now you have two different soundsnand linguistic systems,that convey the exact same meaning.,And you play the English storynto the English listeners,and the Russian storynto the Russian listeners,,and we can compare their responsesnacross the groups.,And when we did that, we didn't seenresponses that are similar,in auditory cortices in language,,because the languagenand sound are very different.,However, you can seenthat the responses in high-order areas,were still similarnacross these two groups.,We believe this is because they understoodnthe story in a very similar way,,as we confirmed, using a testnafter the story ended. 
 And we think that this alignmentnis necessary for communication.,For example, as you can tell,,I am not a native English speaker.,I grew up with another language,,and the same might be for manynof you in the audience.,And still, we can communicate.,How come?,We think we can communicatenbecause we have this common code,that presents meaning. 
 So far, I've only talked aboutnwhat's happening in the listener's brain,,in your brain, whennyou're listening to talks.,But what's happeningnin the speaker's brain, in my brain,,when I'm speaking to you?,To look in the speaker's brain,,we asked the speakernto go into the scanner,,we scan his brain,and then compare his brain responsesnto the brain responses of the listeners,listening to the story.,You have to remember that producing speechnand comprehending speech,are very different processes.,Here we're asking: How similar are they?,To our surprise,,we saw that all these complexnpatterns within the listeners,actually came from the speaker brain.,So production and comprehensionnrely on very similar processes.,And we also found,the stronger the similaritynbetween the listener's brain,and the speaker's brain,,the better the communication.,So I know that if younare completely confused now,,and I do hope that this is not the case,,your brain responsesnare very different than mine.,But I also know that if you reallynunderstand me now,,then your brain ... and your brainn... and your brain,are really similar to mine. 
 Now, let's take allnthis information together and ask:,How can we use it to transmitna memory that I have,from my brain to your brains?,So we did the following experiment.,We let people watch,nfor the first time in their life,,a TV episode from the BBC seriesn"Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.,And then we asked themnto go back to the scanner,and tell the story to another personnthat never watched the movie.,So let's be specific.,Think about this exact scene,,when Sherlock is enteringnthe cab in London,driven by the murderer he is looking for. 
 With me, as a viewer,,there is a specific brain patternnin my brain when I watch it.,Now, the exact same pattern,nI can reactivate in my brain again,by telling the word:nSherlock, London, murderer.,And when I'm transmittingnthese words to your brains now,,you have to reconstruct it in your mind.,In fact, we see that patternnemerging now in your brains.,And we were really surprised to see,that the pattern you havennow in your brains,when I'm describing to you these scenes,would be very similar to the patternnI had when I watched this movie,a few months ago in the scanner.,This starts to tell younabout the mechanism,by which we can tell storiesnand transmit information.,Because, for example,,now you're listening really hardnand trying to understand what I'm saying.,And I know that it's not easy.,But I hope that at one pointnin the talk we clicked, and you got me.,And I think that in a few hours,na few days, a few months,,you're going to meet someone at a party,,and you're going to tell himnabout this lecture,,and suddenly it will be as ifnhe is standing now here with us.,Now you can seenhow we can take this mechanism,and try to transmit memoriesnand knowledge across people,,which is wonderful, right? 
 But our ability to communicatenrelies on our ability,to have common ground.,Because, for example,,if I'm going to use the British synonym,"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,",I know that I'm going to be misalignednwith most of you in the audience.,This alignment dependsnnot only on our ability,to understand the basic concept;,it also depends on our ability to developncommon ground and understanding,and shared belief systems.,Because we know that in many cases,,people understand the exactnsame story in very different ways. 
 So to test it in the lab,nwe did the following experiment.,We took a story by J.D. Salinger,,in which a husband lost tracknof his wife in the middle of a party,,and he's calling his best friend, asking,n"Did you see my wife?",For half of the subjects,,we said that the wife was havingnan affair with the best friend.,For the other half,,we said that the wife is loyalnand the husband is very jealous.,This one sentence before the story started,was enough to make the brain responses,of all the people that believednthe wife was having an affair,be very similar in these high-order areas,and different than the other group.,And if one sentence is enoughnto make your brain similar,to people that think like you,and very different than peoplenthat think differently than you,,think how this effect is goingnto be amplified in real life,,when we are all listeningnto the exact same news item,after being exposednday after day after day,to different media channels,nlike Fox News or The New York Times,,that give us very differentnperspectives on reality. 
 So let me summarize.,If everything worked as planned tonight,,I used my ability to vocalize soundnto be coupled to your brains.,And I used this coupling,to transmit my brain patterns associatednwith my memories and ideas,into your brains.,In this, I start to revealnthe hidden neural mechanism,by which we communicate.,And we know that in the futurenit will enable us to improve,and facilitate communication.,But these studies also reveal,that communication reliesnon a common ground.,And we have to benreally worried as a society,if we lose this common groundnand our ability to speak with people,that are slightly different than us,because we let a few very strongnmedia channels,take control of the mic,,and manipulate and controlnthe way we all think.,And I'm not sure how to fix itnbecause I'm only a scientist.,But maybe one way to do it,is to go back to the morennatural way of communication,,which is a dialogue,,in which it's not only menspeaking to you now,,but a more natural way of talking,,in which I am speaking and I am listening,,and together we are trying to comento a common ground and new ideas.,Because after all,,the people we are coupled tondefine who we are.,And our desire to be couplednto another brain,is something very basicnthat starts at a very early age. 
 So let me finish with an examplenfrom my own private life,that I think is a good examplenof how coupling to other people,is really going to define who we are. 
 This my son Jonathan at a very early age.,See how he developedna vocal game together with my wife,,only from the desire and pure joynof being coupled to another human being. 
 (Both vocalizing) 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, think how the ability of my son,to be coupled to usnand other people in his life,is going to shape the mannhe is going to become.,And think how you change on a daily basis,from the interaction and couplingnto other people in your life. 
 So keep being coupled to other people.,Keep spreading your ideas,,because the sum of all of usntogether, coupled,,is greater than our parts. 
 Thank you.

 ["I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man,,just a mortal with the potentialnof a superman ...,... I'm living on." nDavid Bowie, 1947-2016] 
 (Applause)There we were,,souls and bodies packedninto a Texas church,on the last night of our lives.,Packed into a room just like this,,but with creaky wooden pewsndraped in worn-down red fabric,,with an organ to my leftnand a choir at my back,and a baptism poolnbuilt into the wall behind them.,A room like this, nonetheless.,With the same great feelings of suspense,,the same deep hopes for salvation,,the same sweat in the palms,and the same peoplenin the back not paying attention. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was December 31, 1999,,the night of the Second Coming of Christ,,and the end of the world as I knew it.,I had turned 12 that year,and had reached the age of accountability.,And once I stopped complaining,about how unfair it wasnthat Jesus would return,as soon as I had to be accountablenfor all that I had done,,I figured I had better getnmy house in order very quickly. 
 So I went to church as often as I could.,I listened for silence as anxiouslynas one might listen for noise,,trying to be sure that the Lordnhadn't pulled a fast one on me,and decided to come back early. 
 And just in case he did,,I built a backup plan,,by reading the "Left Behind" booksnthat were all the rage at the time.,And I found in their pages,that if I was not takennin the rapture at midnight,,I had another shot.,All I had to do was avoidntaking the mark of the beast,,fight off demons, plaguesnand the Antichrist himself.,It would be hard -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but I knew I could do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But planning time was over now.,It was 11:50pm.,We had 10 minutes left,,and my pastor called usnout of the pews and down to the altar,because he wanted to be prayingnwhen midnight struck.,So every faction of the congregation,took its place.,The choir stayed in the choir stand,,the deacons and their wives --,or the Baptist Bourgeoisienas I like to call them -- 
 (Laughter) 
 took first position in front of the altar.,You see, in America,,even the Second Coming of Christnhas a VIP section. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie,were the elderly --,these men and women whose young backsnhad been bent under hot suns,in the cotton fields of East Texas,,and whose skin seemed to be burntna creaseless noble brown,,just like the clay of East Texas,,and whose hopes and dreamsnfor what life might become,outside of East Texas,had sometimes been bent and broken,even further than their backs. 
 Yes, these men and womennwere the stars of the show for me.,They had waited their whole livesnfor this moment,,just as their medieval predecessorsnhad longed for the end of the world,,and just as my grandmothernwaited for the Oprah Winfrey Show,to come on Channel 8nevery day at 4 o'clock.,And as she made her way to the altar,,I snuck right in behind her,,because I knew for sure,that my grandmother was going to heaven.,And I thought that if I held onnto her hand during this prayer,,I might go right on with her. 
 So I held on,and I closed my eyes,to listen,,to wait.,And the prayers got louder.,And the shouts of responsento the call of the prayer,went up higher even still.,And the organ rolled on innto add the dirge.,And the heat came on to add to the sweat.,And my hand gripped firmer,,so I wouldn't be the onenleft in the field.,My eyes clenched tighter,so I wouldn't see the wheatnbeing separated from the chaff.,And then a voice rang out above us:,"Amen." 
 It was over.,I looked at the clock.,It was after midnight.,I looked at the elder believers,whose savior had not come,,who were too proud to shownany signs of disappointment,,who had believed too much and for too long,to start doubting now.,But I was upset on their behalf.,They had been duped,,hoodwinked, bamboozled,,and I had gone right along with them.,I had prayed their prayers,,I had yielded not to temptationnas best I could.,I had dipped my head not once, but twice,in that snot-inducing baptism pool.,I had believed.,Now what? 
 I got home just in timento turn on the television,and watch Peter Jenningsnannounce the new millennium,as it rolled in around the world.,It struck me that it would havenbeen strange anyway,,for Jesus to come back again and again,based on the different time zones. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this made me feelneven more ridiculous --,hurt, really.,But there on that night,nI did not stop believing.,I just believed a new thing:,that it was possible not to believe.,It was possible the answersnI had were wrong,,that the questions themselves were wrong.,And now, where there was oncena mountain of certitude,,there was, running right downnto its foundation,,a spring of doubt,,a spring that promised rivers. 
 I can trace the whole drama of my life,back to that night in that church,when my savior did not come for me;,when the thing I believed most certainly,turned out to be, if not a lie,,then not quite the truth.,And even though most of younprepared for Y2K in a very different way,,I'm convinced that you are here,because some part of you has donenthe same thing that I have done,since the dawn of this new century,,since my mother leftnand my father stayed away,and my Lord refused to come.,And I held out my hand,,reaching for something to believe in. 
 I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,,with the faith that my journeynfrom Oak Cliff, Texas,was a chance to leave behindnall the challenges I had known,,the broken dreamsnand broken bodies I had seen.,But when I found myself back homenone winter break,,with my face planted in the floor,,my hands tied behind my back,and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,,I knew that even the best educationncouldn't save me. 
 I held on when I showed upnat Lehman Brothers,as an intern in 2008. 
 (Laughter) 
 So hopeful -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that I called home to inform my family,that we'd never be poor again. 
 (Laughter) 
 But as I witnessed this temple of finance,come crashing down before my eyes,,I knew that even the best jobncouldn't save me. 
 I held on when I showed upnin Washington DC as a young staffer,,who had heard a voicencall out from Illinois,,saying, "It's been a long time coming,,but in this election, changenhas come to America.",But as the Congress ground to a halt,and the country ripped at the seams,and hope and changenbegan to feel like a cruel joke,,I knew that evennthe political second coming,could not save me. 
 I had knelt faithfully at the altarnof the American Dream,,praying to the gods of my time,of success,,and money,,and power.,But over and over again,,midnight struck, and I opened my eyes,to see that all of these gods were dead. 
 And from that graveyard,,I began the search once more,,not because I was brave,,but because I knewnthat I would either believe,or I would die. 
 So I took a pilgrimagento yet another mecca,,Harvard Business School -- 
 (Laughter) 
 this time, knowing that I could notnsimply accept the salvation,that it claimed to offer.,No, I knew there'd be more work to do. 
 The work began in the dark cornernof a crowded party,,in the late night of an early,nmiserable Cambridge winter,,when three friends and I asked a question,that young folks searchingnfor something real have asked,for a very long time:,"What if we took a road trip?" 
 (Laughter) 
 We didn't know where'd we gonor how we'd get there,,but we knew we had to do it.,Because all our lives we yearned,nas Jack Kerouac wrote,,to "sneak out into the nightnand disappear somewhere,",and go find out what everybody was doing,all over the country.,So even though there werenother voices who said,that the risk was too greatnand the proof too thin,,we went on anyhow. 
 We went on 8,000 miles across Americanin the summer of 2013,,through the cow pastures of Montana,nthrough the desolation of Detroit,,through the swamps of New Orleans,,where we found and workednwith men and women,who were building small businesses,that made purpose their bottom line.,And having been trainednat the West Point of capitalism,,this struck us as a revolutionary idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this idea spread,,growing into a nonprofitncalled MBAs Across America,,a movement that landed me herenon this stage today.,It spread because we foundna great hunger in our generation,for purpose, for meaning.,It spread because we foundncountless entrepreneurs,in the nooks and crannies of America,who were creating jobs and changing lives,and who needed a little help. 
 But if I'm being honest, it also spread,because I fought to spread it.,There was no lengthnto which I would not go,to preach this gospel,,to get more people to believe,that we could bind the woundsnof a broken country,,one social business at a time.,But it was this journey of evangelism,that led me to the rather different gospel,that I've come to share with you today. 
 It began one evening almost a year ago,at the Museum of Natural Historynin New York City,,at a gala for alumninof Harvard Business School.,Under a full-size replica of a whale,,I sat with the titans of our time,as they celebrated their peersnand their good deeds.,There was pride in a room,where net worthnand assets under management,surpassed half a trillion dollars.,We looked over all that we had made,,and it was good. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it just so happened,,two days later,,I had to travel up the road to Harlem,,where I found myselfnsitting in an urban farm,that had once been a vacant lot,,listening to a man named Tonyntell me of the kids,that showed up there every day.,All of them lived below the poverty line.,Many of them carriednall of their belongings in a backpack,to avoid losing themnin a homeless shelter.,Some of them came to Tony's program,,called Harlem Grown,,to get the only meal they had each day.,Tony told me that he started Harlem Grownnwith money from his pension,,after 20 years as a cab driver.,He told me that he didn't givenhimself a salary,,because despite success,nthe program struggled for resources.,He told me that he would take any help,that he could get.,And I was there as that help. 
 But as I left Tony,nI felt the sting and salt of tears,welling up in my eyes.,I felt the weight of revelation,that I could sit in one room on one night,,where a few hundred peoplenhad half a trillion dollars,,and another room, two days later,,just 50 blocks up the road,,where a man was going without a salary,to get a child her only meal of the day. 
 And it wasn't the glaring inequalitynthat made me want to cry,,it wasn't the thought of hungry,nhomeless kids,,it wasn't rage toward the one percent,or pity toward the 99.,No, I was disturbednbecause I had finally realized,that I was the dialysis,for a country that neededna kidney transplant.,I realized that my storynstood in for all those,who were expected to picknthemselves up by their bootstraps,,even if they didn't have any boots;,that my organization stood in,for all the structural, systemic helpnthat never went to Harlem,or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;,that my voice stood innfor all those voices,that seemed too unlearned,ntoo unwashed, too unaccommodated. 
 And the shame of that,,that shame washed over me,like the shame of sittingnin front of the television,,watching Peter Jenningsnannounce the new millennium,again,and again,and again.,I had been duped,,hoodwinked,,bamboozled.,But this time, the false savior was me. 
 You see, I've come a long way nfrom that altar,on the night I thoughtnthe world would end,,from a world where people spoke in tongues,and saw sufferingnas a necessary act of God,and took a text to be infallible truth.,Yes, I've come so far,that I'm right back where I started. 
 Because it simply is not true to say,that we live in an age of disbelief --,no, we believe today just as muchnas any time that came before.,Some of us may believenin the prophecy of Brené Brown,or Tony Robbins.,We may believe in the biblenof The New Yorker,or the Harvard Business Review.,We may believe most deeply,when we worship right herenat the church of TED,,but we desperately want to believe,,we need to believe.,We speak in the tonguesnof charismatic leaders,that promise to solve all our problems.,We see suffering as a necessary actnof the capitalism that is our god,,we take the text of technological progress,to be infallible truth.,And we hardly realizenthe human price we pay,when we fail to question one brick,,because we fear it might shakenour whole foundation. 
 But if you are disturbed,by the unconscionable thingsnthat we have come to accept,,then it must be questioning time.,So I have not a gospelnof disruption or innovation,or a triple bottom line.,I do not have a gospel of faithnto share with you today, in fact.,I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.,The gospel of doubt does not asknthat you stop believing,,it asks that you believe a new thing:,that it is possible not to believe.,It is possible the answersnwe have are wrong,,it is possible the questionsnthemselves are wrong.,Yes, the gospel of doubt meansnthat it is possible that we,,on this stage, in this room,,are wrong.,Because it raises the question, "Why?",With all the powernthat we hold in our hands,,why are people still suffering so bad? 
 This doubt leads me to sharenthat we are putting my organization,,MBAs Across America,,out of business.,We have shed our staffnand closed our doors,and we will share our model freely,with anyone who seesntheir power to do this work,without waiting for our permission.,This doubt compels me,to renounce the role of savior,that some have placed on me,,because our time is too shortnand our odds are too long,to wait for second comings,,when the truth is thatnthere will be no miracles here. 
 And this doubt, it fuels me,,it gives me hope,that when our troubles overwhelm us,,when the paths laid out for usnseem to lead to our demise,,when our healers bringnno comfort to our wounds,,it will not be our blind faith --,no, it will be our humble doubt,that shines a little lightninto the darkness of our lives,and of our world,and lets us raise our voice to whisper,or to shout,or to say simply,,very simply,,"There must be another way." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a journalist,,so I like to look for the untold stories,,the lives that quietly play outnunder the scream of headlines.,I've also been going about the businessnof putting down roots,,choosing a partner, making babies.,So for the last few years,,I've been trying to understand,what constitutesnthe 21st-century good life,,both because I'm fascinated by the moralnand philosophical implications,,but also because I'm in desperatenneed of answers myself. 
 We live in tenuous times.,In fact, for the first timenin American history,,the majority of parents do not thinknthat their kids will be better off,than they were.,This is true of rich and poor,nmen and women.,Now, some of younmight hear this and feel sad.,After all, America is deeply invested,in this idea of economic transcendence,,that every generation kind ofnleapfrogs the one before it,,earning more, buying more, being more.,We've exported this dreamnall over the world,,so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya,inherit our insatiable expectation,for more.,But when I read this historic pollnfor the first time,,it didn't actually make me feel sad.,It felt like a provocation.,"Better off" -- based on whose standards? 
 Is "better off" finding a secure job,that you can count onnfor the rest of your life?,Those are nearly extinct.,People move jobs, on average,nevery 4.7 years,,and it's estimated that by 2020,,nearly half of Americansnwill be freelancers.,OK, so is better off just a number?,Is it about earningnas much as you possibly can?,By that singular measurement,nwe are failing.,Median per capita incomenhas been flat since about 2000,,adjusted for inflation.,All right, so is better off gettingna big house with a white picket fence?,Less of us are doing that.,Nearly five million people lostntheir homes in the Great Recession,,and even more of us sobered upnabout the lengths we were willing to go --,or be tricked into going,nin many predatory cases --,to hold that deed.,Home-ownership ratesnare at their lowest since 1995. 
 All right, so we're notnfinding steady employment,,we're not earning as much money,,and we're not living in big fancy houses.,Toll the funeral bells,for everything that made America great.,But,,are those the best measurementsnof a country's greatness,,of a life well lived?,What I think makes America greatnis its spirit of reinvention.,In the wake of the Great Recession,,more and more Americans are redefiningnwhat "better off" really means.,Turns out, it has more to donwith community and creativity,than dollars and cents. 
 Now, let me be very clear:,the 14.8 percent of Americansnliving in poverty need money,,plain and simple.,And all of us need policiesnthat protect us from exploitation,by employers and financial institutions.,Nothing that follows is meant to suggestnthat the gap between rich and poor,is anything but profoundly immoral.,But,,too often we letnthe conversation stop there.,We talk about poverty as ifnit were a monolithic experience;,about the poor as ifnthey were solely victims.,Part of what I've learnednin my research and reporting,is that the art of living well,is often practiced most masterfully,by the most vulnerable. 
 Now, if necessitynis the mother of invention,,I've come to believe,that recession can benthe father of consciousness.,It confronts us with profound questions,,questions we might be too lazynor distracted to ask,in times of relative comfort.,How should we work?,How should we live?,All of us, whether we realize it or not,,seek answers to these questions,,with our ancestorsnkind of whispering in our ears. 
 My great-grandfathernwas a drunk in Detroit,,who sometimes managednto hold down a factory job.,He had, as unbelievable as it might sound,,21 children,,with one woman, my great-grandmother,,who died at 47 years oldnof ovarian cancer.,Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,,and I cannot even fathomnwhat she must have gone through.,And if you're trying to do the math --nthere were six sets of twins.,So my grandfather, their son,,became a traveling salesman,,and he lived boom and bust.,So my dad grew up answeringnthe door for debt collectors,and pretending his parents weren't home.,He actually took his braces off himselfnwith pliers in the garage,,when his father admittednhe didn't have money,to go back to the orthodontist.,So my dad, unsurprisingly,,became a bankruptcy lawyer.,Couldn't write this in a novel, right?,He was obsessed with providingna secure foundation,for my brother and I. 
 So I ask these questionsnby way of a few generations of struggle.,My parents made sure that I grew upnon a kind of steady ground,that allows one to questionnand risk and leap.,And ironically, and probablynsometimes to their frustration,,it is their steadfastncommitment to security,that allows me to question its value,,or at least its valuenas we've historically defined it,in the 21st century. 
 So let's dig into this first question:,How should we work?,We should work like our mothers.,That's right -- we've spent decades,trying to fit women into a work worldnbuilt for company men.,And many have done backbends to fit in,,but others have carvedna more unconventional path,,creating a patchwork of meaning and money,with enough flexibilitynto do what they need to do,for those that they love.,My mom called it "just making it work.",Today I hear life coachesncall it "a portfolio career.",Whatever you call it,,more and more men are cravingnthese whole, if not harried, lives.,They're waking up to their desirenand duty to be present fathers and sons. 
 Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said,,"Labor is a way of knowing.",Labor is a way of knowing.,In other words, what we work on,is what we understand about the world.,If this is true, and I think it is,,then women who have disproportionatelyncared for the little ones,and the sick ones and the aging ones,,have disproportionately benefited,from the most profound kindnof knowing there is:,knowing the human condition.,By prioritizing care,,men are, in a sense, staking their claim,to the full range of human existence. 
 Now, this means the nine-to-fivenno longer works for anyone.,Punch clocks are becoming obsolete,nas are career ladders.,Whole industries are being bornnand dying every day.,It's all nonlinear from here.,So we need to stop asking kids,,"What do you want to be when you grow up?",and start asking them,n"How do you want to be when you grow up?",Their work will constantly change.,The common denominator is them.,So the more they understand their gifts,and create crews of ideal collaborators,,the better off they will be. 
 The challenge ahead is to reinventnthe social safety net,to fit this increasinglynfragmented economy.,We need portable health benefits.,We need policies that reflectnthat everyone deserves to be vulnerable,or care for vulnerable others,,without becoming destitute.,We need to seriously considerna universal basic income.,We need to reinvent labor organizing.,The promise of a work worldnthat is structured to actually fit,our 21st century values,,not some archaic ideanabout bringing home the bacon,,is long overdue --,just ask your mother. 
 Now, how about the second question:,How should we live?,We should live,like our immigrant ancestors.,When they came to America,,they often shared apartments,nsurvival tactics, child care --,always knew how to fill one more belly,,no matter how small the food available.,But they were told that success meantnleaving the village behind,and pursuing that iconic symbolnof the American Dream,,the white picket fence.,And even today,nwe see a white picket fence,and we think success, self-possession.,But when you strip awaynthe sentimentality,,what it really does is divides us.,Many Americans are rejectingnthe white picket fence,and the kind of highly privatized lifenthat happened within it,,and reclaiming village life,,reclaiming interdependence instead. 
 Fifty million of us, for example,,live in intergenerational households.,This number explodednwith the Great Recession,,but it turns out peoplenactually like living this way.,Two-thirds of those who are livingnwith multiple generations under one roof,say it's improved their relationships.,Some people are choosingnto share homes not with family,,but with other people who understandnthe health and economic benefits,of daily community.,CoAbode, an online platformnfor single moms looking to share homes,with other single moms,,has 50,000 users.,And people over 65 are especially prone,to be looking for these alternativenliving arrangements.,They understand that their quality of life,depends on a mixnof solitude and solidarity.,Which is true of all of usnwhen you think about it,,young and old alike.,For too long, we've pretendednthat happiness is a king in his castle.,But all the research proves otherwise.,It shows that the healthiest,nhappiest and even safest --,in terms of both climate change disaster,nin terms of crime, all of that --,are Americans who live livesnintertwined with their neighbors. 
 Now, I've experienced this firsthand.,For the last few years, I've been livingnin a cohousing community.,It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees,,this prolific blackberry bushnthat snakes around a community garden,,all smack-dab, by the way,nin the middle of urban Oakland.,The nine units are all builtnto be different,,different sizes, different shapes,,but they're meant to benas green as possible.,So big, shiny blacknsolar cells on our roof,mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds,more than five bucks in a month.,The 25 of us who live there are allndifferent ages and political persuasions,and professions,,and we live in homes that have everythingna typical home would have.,But additionally,,we share an industrial-sizednkitchen and eating area,,where we have common meals twice a week. 
 Now, people, when I tell themnI live like this,,often have one of two extreme reactions.,Either they say, "Why doesn'tneveryone live like this?",Or they say, "That soundsntotally horrifying.,I would never want to do that.",So let me reassure you: there isna sacred respect for privacy among us,,but also a commitment to what we calln"radical hospitality" --,not the kind advertisednby the Four Seasons,,but the kind that says that everynsingle person is worthy of kindness,,full stop, end of sentence. 
 The biggest surprise for menof living in a community like this?,You share all the domestic labor --nthe repairing, the cooking, the weeding --,but you also share the emotional labor.,Rather than depending onlynon the idealized family unit,to get all of your emotional needs met,,you have two dozen other peoplenthat you can go to,to talk about a hard day at work,or troubleshoot how to handlenan abusive teacher.,Teenagers in our community will often gonto an adult that is not their parent,to ask for advice.,It's what bell hooksncalled "revolutionary parenting,",this humble acknowledgment,that kids are healthier when they havena wider range of adults,to emulate and count on.,Turns out, adults are healthier, too.,It's a lot of pressure,,trying to be that perfect familynbehind that white picket fence. 
 The "new better off,"nas I've come to call it,,is less about investingnin the perfect family,and more about investingnin the imperfect village,,whether that's relativesnliving under one roof,,a cohousing community like mine,,or just a bunch of neighborsnwho pledge to really know,and look out for one another.,It's good common sense, right?,And yet, money has often made us dumb,about reaching out.,The most reliable wealth,is found in relationship. 
 The new better off is notnan individual prospect at all.,In fact, if you're a failurenor you think you're a failure,,I've got some good news for you:,you might be a success by standardsnyou have not yet honored.,Maybe you're a mediocre earnernbut a masterful father.,Maybe you can't afford your dream home,,but you throw legendarynneighborhood parties.,If you're a textbook success,,the implications of what I'm sayingncould be more grim for you.,You might be a failurenby standards you hold dear,but that the world doesn't reward.,Only you can know. 
 I know that I am not a tribute,to my great-grandmother,,who lived such a short and brutish life,,if I earn enough money to affordnevery creature comfort.,You can't buy your waynout of suffering or into meaning.,There is no home big enough,to erase the painnthat she must have endured.,I am a tribute to her,if I live a life as connectednand courageous as possible.,In the midst of suchnwidespread uncertainty,,we may, in fact, be insecure.,But we can let that insecuritynmake us brittle,or supple.,We can turn inward, lose faithnin the power of institutions to change --,even lose faith in ourselves.,Or we can turn outward,,cultivate faith in our abilitynto reach out, to connect, to create. 
 Turns out, the biggest danger,is not failing to achieventhe American Dream.,The biggest danger is achieving a dream,that you don't actually believe in.,So don't do that.,Do the harder, more interesting thing,,which is to compose a lifenwhere what you do every single day,,the people you give your best lovenand ingenuity and energy to,,aligns as closely as possiblenwith what you believe.,That, not something as mundanenas making money,,is a tribute to your ancestors.,That is the beautiful struggle. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm driven by pure passion,to create photographs that tell stories.,Photography can be describednas the recording of a single moment,frozen within a fraction of time.,Each moment or photographnrepresents a tangible piece,of our memories as time passes.,But what if you could capture morenthan one moment in a photograph?,What if a photographncould actually collapse time,,compressing the best momentsnof the day and the night,seamlessly into one single image? 
 I've created a conceptncalled "Day to Night",and I believe it's going to change,the way you look at the world.,I know it has for me. 
 My process begins by photographingniconic locations,,places that are part of what I callnour collective memory.,I photograph from a fixed vantage point,nand I never move.,I capture the fleeting momentsnof humanity and light as time passes.,Photographing for anywherenfrom 15 to 30 hours,and shooting over 1,500 images,,I then choose the best momentsnof the day and night. 
 Using time as a guide,,I seamlessly blend those best momentsninto one single photograph,,visualizing our consciousnjourney with time.,I can take you to Paris,for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.,And I can show you thenearly morning rowers,along the River Seine.,And simultaneously,,I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.,And in between, I can show younthe romance of the City of Light. 
 I am essentially a street photographernfrom 50 feet in the air,,and every single thing you seenin this photograph,actually happened on this day. 
 Day to Night is a global project,,and my work has always been about history.,I'm fascinated by the conceptnof going to a place like Venice,and actually seeing it duringna specific event.,And I decided I wanted to seenthe historical Regata,,an event that's actually beenntaking place since 1498.,The boats and the costumesnlook exactly as they did then.,And an important element that I reallynwant you guys to understand is:,this is not a timelapse,,this is me photographingnthroughout the day and the night.,I am a relentless collectornof magical moments.,And the thing that drives menis the fear of just missing one of them. 
 The entire concept came about in 1996.,LIFE Magazine commissioned mento create a panoramic photograph,of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann'snfilm Romeo + Juliet.,I got to the set and realized:nit's a square.,So the only way I could actually createna panoramic was to shoot a collage,of 250 single images.,So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danesnembracing.,And as I pan my camera to the right,,I noticed there was a mirror on the wall,and I saw they werenactually reflecting in it.,And for that one moment, that one image,I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss,for this one picture?",And then I came backnto my studio in New York,,and I hand-glued these 250 images together,and stood back and went,n"Wow, this is so cool!,I'm changing time in a photograph.",And that concept actuallynstayed with me for 13 years,until technology finallynhas caught up to my dreams. 
 This is an image I creatednof the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.,And I'm going to show you a little video,that gives you an idea of whatnit's like being with me,when I do these pictures.,To start with, you have to understandnthat to get views like this,,most of my time is spent up high,nand I'm usually in a cherry picker,or a crane.,So this is a typical day,n12-18 hours, non-stop,capturing the entire day unfold. 
 One of the things that's greatnis I love to people-watch.,And trust me when I tell you,,this is the greatest seatnin the house to have. 
 But this is really how I go aboutncreating these photographs.,So once I decide on my viewnand the location,,I have to decide where day beginsnand night ends.,And that's what I call the time vector.,Einstein described time as a fabric.,Think of the surface of a trampoline:,it warps and stretches with gravity.,I see time as a fabric as well,,except I take that fabric and flatten it,ncompress it into single plane. 
 One of the unique aspectsnof this work is also,,if you look at all my pictures,,the time vector changes:,sometimes I'll go left to right,,sometimes front to back,nup or down, even diagonally.,I am exploring the space-time continuum,within a two-dimensional still photograph. 
 Now when I do these pictures,,it's literally like a real-time puzzlengoing on in my mind.,I build a photograph based on time,,and this is what I call the master plate.,This can take us severalnmonths to complete.,The fun thing about this work is,I have absolutely zero controlnwhen I get up there,on any given day and capture photographs.,So I never know who'sngoing to be in the picture,,if it's going to be a greatnsunrise or sunset -- no control.,It's at the end of the process,,if I've had a really great daynand everything remained the same,,that I then decide who's in and who's out,,and it's all based on time.,I'll take those best moments that I picknover a month of editing,and they get seamlessly blendedninto the master plate.,I'm compressing the day and night,as I saw it,,creating a unique harmony betweennthese two very discordant worlds. 
 Painting has always been a reallynimportant influence in all my work,and I've always been a huge fannof Albert Bierstadt,,the great Hudson River School painter.,He inspired a recent seriesnthat I did on the National Parks.,This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.,So this is the photographnI created of Yosemite.,This is actually the cover storynof the 2016 January issue,of National Geographic.,I photographed for overn30 hours in this picture.,I was literally on the side of a cliff,,capturing the starsnand the moonlight as it transitions,,the moonlight lighting El Capitan.,And I also captured this transitionnof time throughout the landscape.,The best part is obviously seeingnthe magical moments of humanity,as time changed --,from day into night. 
 And on a personal note,,I actually had a photocopynof Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.,And when that sun startednto rise in the valley,,I started to literally shakenwith excitement,because I looked at the painting and I go,,"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt'snexact same lighting,100 years earlier." 
 Day to Night is about all the things,,it's like a compilation of allnthe things I love,about the medium of photography.,It's about landscape,,it's about street photography,,it's about color, it's about architecture,,perspective, scale --nand, especially, history. 
 This is one of the most historical moments,I've been able to photograph,,the 2013 Presidential Inaugurationnof Barack Obama.,And if you look closely in this picture,,you can actually see time changing,in those large television sets.,You can see Michellenwaiting with the children,,the president now greets the crowd,,he takes his oath,,and now he's speaking to the people.,There's so many challenging aspectsnwhen I create photographs like this.,For this particular photograph,,I was in a 50-foot scissor liftnup in the air,and it was not very stable.,So every time my assistant and Inshifted our weight,,our horizon line shifted.,So for every picture you see,,and there were aboutn1,800 in this picture,,we both had to tape our feet into position,every time I clicked the shutter.,(Applause) 
 I've learned so many extraordinarynthings doing this work.,I think the two most importantnare patience,and the power of observation.,When you photograph a citynlike New York from above,,I discovered that those people in cars,that I sort of live with everyday,,they don't look like peoplenin cars anymore.,They feel like a giant school of fish,,it was a form of emergent behavior.,And when people describenthe energy of New York,,I think this photograph beginsnto really capture that.,When you look closer in my work,,you can see there's stories going on.,You realize that Times Square is a canyon,,it's shadow and it's sunlight.,So I decided, in this photograph,nI would checkerboard time.,So wherever the shadows are, it's night,and wherever the sun is,nit's actually day. 
 Time is this extraordinary thing,that we never can reallynwrap our heads around.,But in a very unique and special way,,I believe these photographsnbegin to put a face on time.,They embody a newnmetaphysical visual reality.,When you spend 15 hoursnlooking at a place,,you're going to see thingsna little differently,than if you or I walked upnwith our camera,,took a picture, and then walked away. 
 This was a perfect example.,I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie.",I watched over 15 hours,all these peoplennot even look at Sacré-Coeur.,They were more interestednin using it as a backdrop.,They would walk up, take a picture,,and then walk away.,And I found this to be an absolutelynextraordinary example,,a powerful disconnect betweennwhat we think the human experience is,versus what the human experiencenis evolving into.,The act of sharing has suddenlynbecome more important,than the experience itself.,(Applause) 
 And finally, my most recent image,,which has such a special meaningnfor me personally:,this is the Serengeti NationalnPark in Tanzania.,And this is photographednin the middle of the Seronera,,this is not a reserve.,I went specifically duringnthe peak migration,to hopefully capturenthe most diverse range of animals.,Unfortunately, when we got there,,there was a drought going onnduring the peak migration,,a five-week drought.,So all the animalsnwere drawn to the water.,I found this one watering hole,,and felt if everything remainednthe same way it was behaving,,I had a real opportunitynto capture something unique. 
 We spent three days studying it,,and nothing could have prepared me,for what I witnessed during our shoot day.,I photographed for 26 hours,in a sealed crocodile blind,n18 feet in the air.,What I witnessed was unimaginable.,Frankly, it was Biblical.,We saw, for 26 hours,,all these competitive speciesnshare a single resource called water.,The same resource that humanitynis supposed to have wars over,during the next 50 years.,The animals never evenngrunted at each other.,They seem to understand somethingnthat we humans don't.,That this precious resource called water,is something we all have to share. 
 When I created this picture,,I realized that Day to Nightnis really a new way of seeing,,compressing time,,exploring the space-time continuumnwithin a photograph. 
 As technology evolvesnalong with photography,,photographs will not only communicatena deeper meaning of time and memory,,but they will compose a new narrativenof untold stories,,creating a timeless window into our world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)OK, first, some introductions.,My mom, Jennie, took this picture.,That's my dad, Frank, in the middle.,And on his left, my sisters:,Mary Catherine, Judith Ann,nTheresa Marie.,John Patrick's sitting on his lapnand Kevin Michael's on his right.,And in the pale-blue windbreaker,,Susan Diane. Me.,I loved growing up in a big family.,And one of my favorite thingsnwas picking names.,But by the time childnnumber seven came along,,we had nearly run out of middle names.,It was a long deliberation,before we finally settlednon Jennifer Bridget.,Every parent in this audience,knows the joy and excitement,of picking a new baby's name.,And I was excited and thrilled,to help my mom in that specialnceremonial moment. 
 But it's not like that everywhere.,I travel a lot and I see a lot.,But it took me by surprise to learn,in an area of Ethiopia,,parents delay picking the namesnfor their new babies,by a month or more.,Why delay?,Why not take advantagenof this special ceremonial time?,Well, they delay because they're afraid.,They're afraid their baby will die.,And this loss might be a little morenbearable without a name.,A face without a name might help them feel,just a little less attached. 
 So here we are in one part of the world --,a time of joy, excitement,ndreaming of the future of that child --,while in another world,,parents are filled with dread,,not daring to dreamnof a future for their child,beyond a few precious weeks.,How can that be?,How can it be that 2.6 million babies,die around the world,before they're even one month old?,2.6 million.,That's the population of Vancouver.,And the shocking thing is:,Why?,In too many cases, we simply don't know. 
 Now, I remember recently seeingnan updated pie chart.,And the pie chart was labeled,,"Causes of death in childrennunder five worldwide.",And there was a pretty big sectionnof that pie chart, about 40 percent --,40 percent was labeled "neonatal.",Now, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.,Neonatal is simply an adjective,,an adjective that means that the childnis less than one month old.,For me, "neonatal" said:n"We have no idea." 
 Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.,I want to fix things.,But you can't fixnwhat you can't define.,So our first step in restoringnthe dreams of those parents,is to answer the question:,Why are babies dying? 
 So today, I want to talknabout a new approach,,an approach that I feel,will not only help usnknow why babies are dying,,but is beginning to completely transform,the whole field of global health.,It's called "Precision Public Health." 
 For me, precision medicine comesnfrom a very special place.,I trained as a cancer doctor,nan oncologist.,I got into it because I wantednto help people feel better.,But too often my treatmentsnmade them feel worse.,I still remember young womennbeing driven to my clinic,by their moms --,adults, who had to be helpedninto my exam room by their mothers.,They were so weak,from the treatment I had given them.,But at the time, in those front linesnin the war on cancer,,we had few tools.,And the tools we did havencouldn't differentiate,between the cancer cellsnthat we wanted to hit hard,and those healthy cellsnthat we wanted to preserve.,And so the side effects that you'renall very familiar with --,hair loss, being sick to your stomach,,having a suppressed immune system,nso infection was a constant threat --,were always surrounding us. 
 And then I movednto the biotechnology industry.,And I got to work on a new approachnfor breast cancer patients,that could do a better jobnof telling the healthy cells,from the unhealthy or cancer cells.,It's a drug called Herceptin.,And what Herceptin allowed us to do,is to precisely targetnHER2-positive breast cancer,,at the time, the scariestnform of breast cancer.,And that precision let usnhit hard the cancer cells,,while sparing and being morengentle on the normal cells.,A huge breakthrough.,It felt like a miracle,,so much so that today,,we're harnessing all those tools --,big data, consumer monitoring,ngene sequencing and more --,to tackle a broad variety of diseases.,That's allowing us to target individuals,with the right remedies at the right time. 
 Precision medicinenrevolutionized cancer therapy.,Everything changed.,And I want everything to change again.,So I've been asking myself:,Why should we limit,this smarter, more precise,nbetter way to tackle diseases,to the rich world?,Now, don't misunderstand me --,I'm not talking about bringingnexpensive medicines like Herceptin,to the developing world,,although I'd actually kind of like that.,What I am talking about,is moving from this precisentargeting for individuals,to tackle public health problems,in populations. 
 Now, OK, I know probablynyou're thinking, "She's crazy.,You can't do that. That's too ambitious.",But here's the thing:,we're already doing this in a limited way,,and it's already startingnto make a big difference. 
 So here's what's happening.,Now, I told you I trainednas a cancer doctor.,But like many, many doctorsnwho trained in San Francisco in the '80s,,I also trained as an AIDS doctor.,It was a terrible time.,AIDS was a death sentence.,All my patients died.,Now, things are better,,but HIV/AIDS remainsna terrible global challenge.,Worldwide, about 17 million womennare living with HIV.,We know that when these womennbecome pregnant,,they can transfer the virus to their baby.,We also know in the absence of therapy,,half those babies will not survivenuntil the age of two.,But we know that antiretroviral therapyncan virtually guarantee,that she will not transmitnthe virus to the baby.,So what do we do? 
 Well, a one-size-fits-all approach,nkind of like that blast of chemo,,would mean we test and treatnevery pregnant woman in the world.,That would do the job.,But it's just not practical.,So instead, we target those areasnwhere HIV rates are the highest.,We know in certain countriesnin sub-Saharan Africa,we can test and treat pregnant womennwhere rates are highest.,This precision approachnto a public health problem,has cut by nearly half,HIV transmission from mothers to baby,in the last five years. 
 (Applause) 
 Screening pregnant womennin certain areas in the developing world,is a powerful example,of how precision public healthncan change things on a big scale. 
 So ...,How do we do that?,We can do that because we know.,We know who to target,,what to target,,where to target and how to target.,And that, for me, are the important nelements of precision public health:,who, what, where and how. 
 But let's go backnto the 2.6 million babies,who die before they're one month old.,Here's the problem: we just don't know.,It may seem unbelievable,,but the way we figure outnthe causes of infant mortality,in those countriesnwith the highest infant mortality,is a conversation with mom.,A health worker asks a momnwho has just lost her child,,"Was the baby vomiting?nDid they have a fever?",And that conversation may take place,as long as three monthsnafter the baby has died.,Now, put yourselfnin the shoes of that mom.,It's a heartbreaking,nexcruciating conversation.,And even worse -- it's not that helpful,,because we might knownthere was a fever or vomiting,,but we don't know why.,So in the absence of knowingnthat knowledge,,we cannot prevent that mom, that family,,or other families in that community,from suffering the same tragedy. 
 But what if we appliedna precision public health approach?,Let's say, for example,,we find out in certain areas of Africa,that babies are dyingnbecause of a bacterial infection,transferred from the mother to the baby,,known as Group B streptococcus.,In the absence of treatment,nmom has a seven times higher chance,that her next baby will die.,Once we define the problem,nwe can prevent that death,with something as cheapnand safe as penicillin.,We can do that because then we'll know.,And that's the point:,once we know, we can bringnthe right interventions,to the right populationnin the right places,to save lives. 
 With this approach,nand with these interventions,and others like them,,I have no doubt,that a precision public health approach,can help our world achievenour 15-year goal.,And that would translateninto a million babies' lives saved,every single year.,One million babies every single year. 
 And why would we stop there?,A much more powerful approachnto public health --,imagine what might be possible.,Why couldn't we more effectivelyntackle malnutrition?,Why wouldn't we preventncervical cancer in women?,And why not eradicate malaria? 
 (Applause) 
 Yes, clap for that! 
 (Applause) 
 So, you know, I livenin two different worlds,,one world populated by scientists,,and another world populatednby public health professionals.,The promise of precision public health,is to bring these two worlds together.,But you know, we all live in two worlds:,the rich world and the poor world.,And what I'm most excited aboutnabout precision public health,is bridging these two worlds.,Every day in the rich world,,we're bringing incrediblentalent and tools --,everything at our disposal --,to precisely target diseasesnin ways I never imagined,would be possible.,Surely, we can tap intonthat kind of talent and tools,to stop babies dying in the poor world.,If we did,,then every parent would haventhe confidence,to name their childnthe moment that child is born,,daring to dream that that child's lifenwill be measured in decades,,not days. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In case you are wondering,,no, I'm not wearing a dress,,and no, I'm not sayingnwhat I'm wearing underneath. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a gho.,This is my national dress.,This is how all men dress in Bhutan.,That is how our women dress.,Like our women,,we men get to wear pretty bright colors,,but unlike our women,,we get to show off our legs. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our national dress is unique,,but this is not the only thingnthat's unique about my country.,Our promise to remainncarbon neutral is also unique,,and this is what I'd likento speak about today,,our promise to remain carbon neutral. 
 But before I proceed,nI should set you the context.,I should tell you our story. 
 Bhutan is a small countrynin the Himalayas.,We've been called Shangri-La,,even the last Shangri-La.,But let me tell you right off the bat,nwe are not Shangri-La.,My country is not one big monastery,populated with happy monks. 
 (Laughter) 
 The reality is thatnthere are barely 700,000 of us,sandwiched between twonof the most populated countries on earth,,China and India.,The reality is that we are a small,nunderdeveloped country,doing our best to survive.,But we are doing OK. We are surviving.,In fact, we are thriving,,and the reason we are thrivingnis because we've been blessed,with extraordinary kings.,Our enlightened monarchsnhave worked tirelessly,to develop our country,,balancing economic growth carefully,with social development,nenvironmental sustainability,and cultural preservation,,all within the frameworknof good governance.,We call this holistic approachnto development,"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.,Back in the 1970s,,our fourth king famouslynpronounced that for Bhutan,,Gross National Happiness is more importantnthan Gross National Product. 
 (Applause) 
 Ever since,,all development in Bhutannis driven by GNH,,a pioneering visionnthat aims to improve the happiness,and well-being of our people. 
 But that's easier said than done,,especially when you are onenof the smallest economies in the world.,Our entire GDP is lessnthan two billion dollars.,I know that some of you herenare worth more -- 
 (Laughter) 
 individually,than the entire economy of my country. 
 So our economy is small,,but here is where it gets interesting.,Education is completely free.,All citizens are guaranteednfree school education,,and those that work hardnare given free college education.,Healthcare is also completely free.,Medical consultation,nmedical treatment, medicines:,they are all provided by the state.,We manage this,because we use our limitednresources very carefully,,and because we stay faithfulnto the core mission of GNH,,which is development with values.,Our economy is small,nand we must strengthen it.,Economic growth is important,,but that economic growth must not comenfrom undermining our unique culture,or our pristine environment. 
 Today, our culture is flourishing.,We continue to celebratenour art and architecture,,food and festivals,,monks and monasteries.,And yes, we celebratenour national dress, too.,This is why I can wear my gho with pride.,Here's a fun fact:,you're lookingnat the world's biggest pocket. 
 (Laughter) 
 It starts here,,goes around the back,,and comes out from inside here.,In this pocket,we store all manner of personal goods,from phones and wallets,to iPads, office files and books. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But sometimes --,sometimes even precious cargo. 
 So our culture is flourishing,,but so is our environment.,72 percent of my countrynis under forest cover.,Our constitution demandsnthat a minimum of 60 percent,of Bhutan's total landnshall remain under forest cover,for all time. 
 (Applause) 
 Our constitution,,this constitution,,imposes forest cover on us.,Incidentally, our kingnused this constitution,to impose democracy on us.,You see, we the peoplendidn't want democracy.,We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,,and we certainly didn't fight for it.,Instead, our king imposed democracy on us,by insisting that he include itnin the constitution.,But he went further.,He included provisions in the constitution,that empower the peoplento impeach their kings,,and included provisions in herenthat require all our kings to retire,at the age of 65. 
 (Applause) 
 Fact is, we already havena king in retirement:,our previous king, the Great Fourth,,retired 10 years ago,at the peak of his popularity.,He was all of 51 years at that time. 
 So as I was saying,,72 percent of our countrynis under forest cover,,and all that forest is pristine.,That's why we are one of the few remaining,global biodiversity hotspots in the world,,and that's why we arena carbon neutral country.,In a world that is threatenednwith climate change,,we are a carbon neutral country. 
 Turns out, it's a big deal.,Of the 200-odd countriesnin the world today,,it looks like we are the only one,that's carbon neutral.,Actually, that's not quite accurate.,Bhutan is not carbon neutral.,Bhutan is carbon negative.,Our entire country generatesn2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,,but our forests, they sequesternmore than three times that amount,,so we are a net carbon sink,for more than four million tonsnof carbon dioxide each year.,But that's not all. 
 (Applause) 
 We export mostnof the renewable electricity,we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.,So today, the clean energy that we export,offsets about six million tonsnof carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.,By 2020, we'll be exportingnenough electricity,to offset 17 million tonsnof carbon dioxide.,And if we were to harnessneven half our hydropower potential,,and that's exactly what we are working at,,the clean, green energy that we export,would offset something liken50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.,That is more CO2 than what the entire citynof New York generates in one year. 
 So inside our country,nwe are a net carbon sink.,Outside, we are offsetting carbon.,And this is important stuff.,You see, the world is getting warmer,,and climate change is a reality.,Climate change is affecting my country.,Our glaciers are melting,,causing flash floods and landslides,,which in turn are causing disasternand widespread destruction in our country.,I was at that lake recently.,It's stunning.,That's how it looked 10 years ago,,and that's how it looked 20 years ago.,Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.,It was a solid glacier.,A few years ago, a similar lake,breached its dams,and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.,That destructionnwas caused by one glacier lake.,We have 2,700 of them to contend with.,The point is this:,my country and my people have done nothing,to contribute to global warming,,but we are already bearing the bruntnof its consequences.,And for a small, poor country,none that is landlocked and mountainous,,it is very difficult.,But we are not going to sitnon our hands doing nothing.,We will fight climate change.,That's why we have promisednto remain carbon neutral. 
 We first made this promise in 2009,during COP 15 in Copenhagen,,but nobody noticed.,Governments were so busynarguing with one another,and blaming each othernfor causing climate change,,that when a small countrynraised our hands and announced,,"We promise to remainncarbon neutral for all time,",nobody heard us.,Nobody cared. 
 Last December in Paris,,at COP 21, we reiterated our promise,to remain carbon neutralnfor all time to come.,This time, we were heard.,We were noticed, and everybody cared.,What was different in Parisnwas that governments came round together,to accept the realities of climate change,,and were willing to come togethernand act together and work together.,All countries, from the very smallnto the very large,,committed to reducenthe greenhouse gas emissions.,The UN Framework Conventionnon Climate Change,says that if these so-callednintended commitments are kept,,we'd be closernto containing global warming,by two degrees Celsius. 
 By the way,,I've requested the TED organizers here,to turn up the heat in herenby two degrees,,so if some of younare feeling warmer than usual,,you know who to blame. 
 It's crucial that all of usnkeep our commitments.,As far as Bhutan is concerned,,we will keep our promisento remain carbon neutral.,Here are some of the ways we are doing it.,We are providing free electricitynto our rural farmers.,The idea is that, with free electricity,nthey will no longer have to use firewood,to cook their food.,We are investing in sustainable transport,and subsidizing the purchasenof electric vehicles.,Similarly, we are subsidizingnthe cost of LED lights,,and our entire governmentnis trying to go paperless.,We are cleaning up our entire countrynthrough Clean Bhutan, a national program,,and we are planting treesnthroughout our country,through Green Bhutan,,another national program. 
 But it is our protected areas,that are at the corenof our carbon neutral strategy.,Our protected areas are our carbon sink.,They are our lungs.,Today, more than halfnour country is protected,,as national parks, nature reserves,and wildlife sanctuaries.,But the beauty is that we've connectednthem all with one another,through a network of biological corridors.,Now, what this means,is that our animals are freento roam throughout our country.,Take this tiger, for example.,It was spottednat 250 meters above sea level,in the hot, subtropical jungles.,Two years later, that same tiger,was spotted near 4,000 meters,in our cold alpine mountains.,Isn't that awesome? 
 (Applause) 
 We must keep it that way.,We must keep our parks awesome.,So every year, we set aside resourcesnto prevent poaching, hunting,,mining and pollution in our parks,,and resources to help communitiesnwho live in those parks,manage their forests,,adapt to climate change,,and lead better lives while continuingnto live in harmony with Mother Nature. 
 But that is expensive.,Over the next few years,nour small economy won't have the resources,to cover all the costs that are requirednto protect our environment.,In fact, when we run the numbers,,it looks like it'll take usnat least 15 years,before we can fully financenall our conservation efforts.,But neither Bhutan,,nor the world,can afford to spend 15 yearsngoing backwards. 
 This is why His Majesty the King,started Bhutan For Life.,Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.,It gives us breathing room.,It is essentially a funding mechanism,to look after our parks,,to protect our parks,,until our governmentncan take over on our own fully.,The idea is to raise a transition fund,from individual donors,ncorporations and institutions,,but the deal is closed onlynafter predetermined conditions are met,and all funds committed.,So multiparty, single closing:,an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.,This means that individual donorsncan commit without having to worry,that they'll be leftnsupporting an underfunded plan.,It's something like a Kickstarter project,,only with a 15-year time horizon,and millions of tonsnof carbon dioxide at stake.,Once the deal is closed,,we use the transition fundnto protect our parks,,giving our government timento increase our own funding gradually,until the end of the 15-year period.,After that, our governmentnguarantees full funding forever. 
 We are almost there.,We expect to close later this year.,Naturally, I'm pretty excited. 
 (Applause) 
 The World Wildlife Fundnis our principle partner in this journey,,and I want to give them a big shoutout,for the excellent worknthey are doing in Bhutan,and across the world. 
 (Applause) 
 Whew, it is getting warm in here. 
 I thank you for listening to our story,,a story of how we are keepingnour promise to remain carbon neutral,,a story of how we are keepingnour country pristine,,for ourselves, our children,,for your children and for the world.,But we are not herento tell stories, are we?,We are here to dream together.,So in closing, I'd like to sharenone more dream that I have.,What if we could mobilizenour leadership and our resources,,our influence and our passion,,to replicate the Bhutan For Life ideanto other countries,so that they too,can conserve theirnprotected areas for all time.,After all, there are many other countriesnwho face the same issues that we face.,They too have natural resources,that can help win the world's fightnfor sustainability,,only they may not have the abilitynto invest in them now.,So what if we set up Earth For Life,,a global fund, to kickstartnthe Bhutan For Life throughout the world?,I invite you to help me,,to carry this dream beyond our borders,to all those who carenabout our planet's future.,After all, we're here to dream together,,to work together,,to fight climate change together,nto protect our planet together.,Because the reality is,we are in it together.,Some of us might dress differently,,but we are in it together. 
 Thank you very much,,and kadrin chhe la. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.So I'd like you to imagine for a moment,that you're a soldiernin the heat of battle.,Maybe you're a Roman foot soldiernor a medieval archer,or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.,Regardless of your time and place,nthere are some things that are constant.,Your adrenaline is elevated,,and your actions are stemmingnfrom these deeply ingrained reflexes,,reflexes rooted in a neednto protect yourself and your side,and to defeat the enemy. 
 So now, I'd like you to imaginenplaying a very different role,,that of the scout.,The scout's job is notnto attack or defend.,The scout's job is to understand.,The scout is the one going out,,mapping the terrain,nidentifying potential obstacles.,And the scout may hope to learnnthat, say, there's a bridge,in a convenient location across a river.,But above all, the scoutnwants to know what's really there,,as accurately as possible.,And in a real, actual army, bothnthe soldier and the scout are essential.,But you can also think of eachnof these roles as a mindset --,a metaphor for how all of usnprocess information and ideas,in our daily lives.,What I'm going to argue todaynis that having good judgment,,making accurate predictions,nmaking good decisions,,is mostly about which mindset you're in. 
 To illustrate these mindsets in action,,I'm going to take you backnto 19th-century France,,where this innocuous-lookingnpiece of paper,launched one of the biggestnpolitical scandals in history.,It was discovered in 1894nby officers in the French general staff.,It was torn up in a wastepaper basket,,but when they pieced it back together,,they discoverednthat someone in their ranks,had been sellingnmilitary secrets to Germany. 
 So they launched a big investigation,,and their suspicionsnquickly converged on this man,,Alfred Dreyfus.,He had a sterling record,,no past history of wrongdoing,nno motive as far as they could tell.,But Dreyfus was the onlynJewish officer at that rank in the army,,and unfortunately at this time,nthe French Army was highly anti-Semitic.,They compared Dreyfus's handwritingnto that on the memo,and concluded that it was a match,,even though outsidenprofessional handwriting experts,were much less confidentnin the similarity,,but never mind that.,They went and searchednDreyfus's apartment,,looking for any signs of espionage.,They went through his files,nand they didn't find anything.,This just convinced them morenthat Dreyfus was not only guilty,,but sneaky as well, because clearlynhe had hidden all of the evidence,before they had managed to get to it. 
 Next, they went and lookednthrough his personal history,for any incriminating details.,They talked to his teachers,,they found that he had studiednforeign languages in school,,which clearly showed a desirento conspire with foreign governments,later in life.,His teachers also said that Dreyfusnwas known for having a good memory,,which was highly suspicious, right?,You know, because a spynhas to remember a lot of things. 
 So the case went to trial,nand Dreyfus was found guilty.,Afterwards, they took him outninto this public square,and ritualistically torenhis insignia from his uniform,and broke his sword in two.,This was callednthe Degradation of Dreyfus.,And they sentenced himnto life imprisonment,on the aptly named Devil's Island,,which is this barren rocknoff the coast of South America.,So there he went,nand there he spent his days alone,,writing letters and lettersnto the French government,begging them to reopen his casenso they could discover his innocence.,But for the most part,nFrance considered the matter closed. 
 One thing that's really interestingnto me about the Dreyfus Affair,is this question of why the officersnwere so convinced,that Dreyfus was guilty.,I mean, you might even assumenthat they were setting him up,,that they were intentionally framing him.,But historians don't thinknthat's what happened.,As far as we can tell,,the officers genuinely believednthat the case against Dreyfus was strong.,Which makes you wonder:,What does it say about the human mind,that we can find such paltry evidence,to be compelling enough to convict a man? 
 Well, this is a case of what scientistsncall "motivated reasoning.",It's this phenomenon in whichnour unconscious motivations,,our desires and fears,,shape the way we interpret information.,Some information, some ideas,nfeel like our allies.,We want them to win.nWe want to defend them.,And other informationnor ideas are the enemy,,and we want to shoot them down.,So this is why I callnmotivated reasoning, "soldier mindset." 
 Probably most of you have never persecuted,a French-Jewish officer for high treason,,I assume,,but maybe you've followed sportsnor politics, so you might have noticed,that when the referee judgesnthat your team committed a foul,,for example,,you're highly motivatednto find reasons why he's wrong.,But if he judges that the other teamncommitted a foul -- awesome!,That's a good call,nlet's not examine it too closely.,Or, maybe you've readnan article or a study,that examined some controversial policy,,like capital punishment.,And, as researchers have demonstrated,,if you support capital punishment,and the study showsnthat it's not effective,,then you're highly motivatednto find all the reasons,why the study was poorly designed.,But if it showsnthat capital punishment works,,it's a good study.,And vice versa: if you don'tnsupport capital punishment, same thing. 
 Our judgment is stronglyninfluenced, unconsciously,,by which side we want to win.,And this is ubiquitous.,This shapes how we thinknabout our health, our relationships,,how we decide how to vote,,what we consider fair or ethical.,What's most scary to menabout motivated reasoning,or soldier mindset,,is how unconscious it is.,We can think we're beingnobjective and fair-minded,and still wind up ruining the lifenof an innocent man. 
 However, fortunately for Dreyfus,nhis story is not over.,This is Colonel Picquart.,He's another high-ranking officernin the French Army,,and like most people,nhe assumed Dreyfus was guilty.,Also like most people in the army,nhe was at least casually anti-Semitic.,But at a certain point,nPicquart began to suspect:,"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?",What happened was,nhe had discovered evidence,that the spying for Germany had continued,,even after Dreyfus was in prison.,And he had also discoverednthat another officer in the army,had handwriting that perfectlynmatched the memo,,much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.,So he brought these discoveriesnto his superiors,,but to his dismay,nthey either didn't care,or came up with elaborate rationalizationsnto explain his findings,,like, "Well, all you've really shown,nPicquart, is that there's another spy,who learned how to mimicnDreyfus's handwriting,,and he picked up the torch of spyingnafter Dreyfus left.,But Dreyfus is still guilty.",Eventually, Picquart managednto get Dreyfus exonerated.,But it took him 10 years,,and for part of that time,nhe himself was in prison,for the crime of disloyalty to the army. 
 A lot of people feel like Picquartncan't really be the hero of this story,because he was an anti-Semitenand that's bad, which I agree with.,But personally, for me,nthe fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic,actually makes his actions more admirable,,because he had the same prejudices,nthe same reasons to be biased,as his fellow officers,,but his motivation to find the truthnand uphold it trumped all of that. 
 So to me,,Picquart is a poster childnfor what I call "scout mindset.",It's the drive not to makenone idea win or another lose,,but just to see what's really there,as honestly and accurately as you can,,even if it's not prettynor convenient or pleasant.,This mindset is whatnI'm personally passionate about.,And I've spent the last few yearsnexamining and trying to figure out,what causes scout mindset.,Why are some people, sometimes at least,,able to cut through their own prejudicesnand biases and motivations,and just try to see the factsnand the evidence,as objectively as they can? 
 And the answer is emotional.,So, just as soldier mindsetnis rooted in emotions,like defensiveness or tribalism,,scout mindset is, too.,It's just rooted in different emotions.,For example, scouts are curious.,They're more likely to saynthey feel pleasure,when they learn new information,or an itch to solve a puzzle.,They're more likely to feel intriguednwhen they encounter something,that contradicts their expectations.,Scouts also have different values.,They're more likely to saynthey think it's virtuous,to test your own beliefs,,and they're less likely to saynthat someone who changes his mind,seems weak.,And above all, scouts are grounded,,which means their self-worth as a person,isn't tied to how right or wrongnthey are about any particular topic.,So they can believenthat capital punishment works.,If studies come out showingnthat it doesn't, they can say,,"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong.nDoesn't mean I'm bad or stupid." 
 This cluster of traitsnis what researchers have found --,and I've also found anecdotally --,predicts good judgment.,And the key takeaway I wantnto leave you with about those traits,is that they're primarilynnot about how smart you are,or about how much you know.,In fact, they don't correlatenvery much with IQ at all.,They're about how you feel.,There's a quote that I keepncoming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.,He's the author of "The Little Prince.",He said, "If you want to build a ship,,don't drum up your mennto collect wood and give orders,and distribute the work.,Instead, teach them to yearnnfor the vast and endless sea." 
 In other words, I claim,,if we really want to improvenour judgment as individuals,and as societies,,what we need mostnis not more instruction in logic,or rhetoric or probability or economics,,even though those thingsnare quite valuable.,But what we most neednto use those principles well,is scout mindset.,We need to change the way we feel.,We need to learn how to feel proudninstead of ashamed,when we notice we mightnhave been wrong about something.,We need to learn how to feel intriguedninstead of defensive,when we encounter some informationnthat contradicts our beliefs. 
 So the question I wantnto leave you with is:,What do you most yearn for?,Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?,Or do you yearn to see the worldnas clearly as you possibly can? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today 40 million Americans are indebtednfor their passage to the new economy.,Too poor to pay their way through college,,they now owe lendersnmore than one trillion US dollars.,They do find what jobs they can get,to pay off a debtnthat is secured on their person.,In America,,even a bankrupt gamblerngets a second chance.,But it is nearly impossible,for an American to get dischargedntheir student loan debts. 
 Once upon a time in America,,going to college did not meanngraduating with debt.,My friend Paul's fatherngraduated from Colorado State University,on the GI Bill.,For his generation,,higher education was free or almost free,,because it was thought ofnas a public good.,Not anymore.,When Paul also graduatednfrom Colorado State University,,he paid for his English degreenby working part-time.,30 years ago,,higher education tuitionnwas affordable, reasonable,,and what debts you accumulated,nyou paid off by graduation date.,Not anymore.,Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps,,but with one difference:,when she graduated five years ago,,it was with a whopping debt. 
 Students like Kate have to take on a loan,because the cost of higher educationnhas become unaffordable,for many if not most American families.,But so what?,Getting into debt to buynan expensive education,is not all bad if you could pay it off,with the increased incomenthat you earned from it.,But that's where the rubbernmeets the road.,Even a college gradnearned 10 percent more in 2001,than she did in 2013. 
 So ...,tuition costs up,,public funding down,,family incomes diminished,,personal incomes weak.,Is it any wonder that morenthan a quarter of those who must,cannot make their student loan payments?,The worst of timesncan be the best of times,,because certain truths flash upnin ways that you can't ignore.,I want to speak of three of them today. 
 1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas,make it abundantly obvious,that higher educationnis a consumer product you can buy.,All of us talk about educationnjust as the economists do now,,as an investment that you makento improve the human stock,by training them for work.,As an investment you makento sort and classify people,so that employersncan hire them more easily.,The U.S. News & World Reportnranks colleges,just as the consumer reportnrates washing machines.,The language is peppered with barbarisms.,Teachers are called "service providers,",students are called "consumers.",Sociology and Shakespearenand soccer and science,,all of these are "content." 
 Student debt is profitable.,Only not on you.,Your debt fattens the profitnof the student loan industry.,The two 800-pound gorillas of which --,Sallie Mae and Navient --,posted last year a combined profitnof 1.2 billion dollars.,And just like home mortgages,,student loans can be bundlednand packaged and sliced and diced,,and sold on Wall Street.,And colleges and universities,that invest in these securitized loans,profit twice.,Once from your tuition,,and then again from the interest on debt. 
 With all that money to be made,,are we surprised that somenin the higher education business,have begun to engage in false advertising,,in bait and switch ...,in exploiting the very ignorancenthat they pretend to educate? 
 Third:,diplomas are a brand.,Many years ago my teacher wrote,,"When students are treated as consumers,,they're made prisonersnof addiction and envy.",Just as consumers can be sold and resoldnupgraded versions of an iPhone,,so also people can be soldnmore and more education.,College is the new high school,,we already say that.,But why stop there?,People can be upsoldnon certifications and recertifications,,master's degrees, doctoral degrees. 
 Higher education is also marketednas a status object.,Buy a degree,,much like you do a Lexusnof a Louis Vuitton bag,,to distinguish yourself from others.,So you can be the objectnof envy of others.,Diplomas are a brand. 
 But these truths are often timesnhidden by a very noisy sales pitch.,There is not a day that goes by,without some policy guynon television telling us,,"A college degree is absolutely essential,to get on that up escalatornto a middle-class life.",And the usual evidence offerednis the college premium:,a college grad who makes on averagen56 percent more than a high school grad. 
 Let's look at that number more carefully,,because on the face of it,,it seems to belie the stories we all hear,about college gradsnworking as baristas and cashiers.,Of 100 people who enrollnin any form of post-secondary education,,45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,,for a number of reasons,nincluding financial.,Of the 55 that do graduate,,two will remain unemployed,,and another 18 are underemployed.,So, college grads earn morenthan high school grads,,but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition,and the lost wages while at college? 
 Now even economists admit,going to college pays offnfor only those who complete it.,But that's only because high school wagesnhave been cut to the bone,,for decades now.,For decades,,workers with a high school degree,have been denied a fair sharenof what they have produced.,And had they received as they should have,,then going to college would have beenna bad investment for many.,College premium?,I think it's a high school discount. 
 Two out of three people who enrollnare not going to find an adequate job.,And the future, for them,ndoesn't look particularly promising --,in fact, it's downright bleak.,And it is they who are going to suffer,the most punishing forms of student debt.,And it is they,,curiously and sadly,,who are marketed most loudlynabout this college premium thing.,That's not just cynical marketing,,that's cruel. 
 So what do we do?,What if students and parents treatednhigher education as a consumer product?,Everybody else seems to.,Then, like any other consumer product,,you would demand to knownwhat you're paying for.,When you buy medicines,,you get a list of side effects.,When you buy a higher educational product,,you should have a warning label,that allows consumers to choose,,make informed choices.,When you buy a car,,it tells you how manynmiles per gallon to expect.,Who knows what to expect,from a degree say, in Canadian Studies.,There is such a thing, by the way. 
 What if there was an app for that?,One that linked up the cost of a majornto the expected income.,Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.,One of you make this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Discover your reality. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are three advantages,,three benefits to Income-Based Tuition.,Any user can figure out,how much money he or she will makenfrom a given college and major.,Such informed users,are unlikely to fall victimnto the huckster's ploy,,to the sales pitch.,But also to choose wisely.,Why would anybody pay more for college,than let's say, 15 percentnof the additional income they earn? 
 There's a second benefitnto Income-Based Tuition.,By tying the cost to the income,,college administrators would be forcednto manage costs better,,to find innovative ways to do so.,For instance,,all of you students here pay roughlynthe same tuition for every major.,That is manifestly unfair,nand should change.,An engineering student uses more resources,and facilities and labs and faculty,than a philosophy student.,But the philosophy student,nas a consequence,,is subsidizing the engineering student.,Who then, by the way,ngoes on and earns more money.,Why should two peoplenbuy the same product,,pay the same,,but one person receivenhalf or a third of the service.,In fact, college grads, some majors,,pay 25 percent of their incomenservicing their student debt,,while others pay five percent.,That kind if inequity would endnwhen majors are priced more correctly. 
 Now of course, all this data --,and one of you is going to do this, right?,All this data has to be well designed,,maybe audited by public accounting firms,to avoid statistical lies.,We know about statistics, right? 
 But be that as it may,,the third and biggest benefitnof Income-Based Tuition,,is it would free Americans from the fearnand the fact of financial ruin,because they bought a defective product. 
 Perhaps, in time,,young and old Americans may rediscover,,as the gentleman said earlier,,their curiosity, their love of learning --,begin to study what they love,,love what they study,,follow their passion ...,getting stimulated by their intelligence,,follow paths of inquirynthat they really want to. 
 After all, it was Eric and Kevin,,two years ago,,just exactly these kinds of young men,,who prompted me and worked with me,,and still do,,in the study of indebtednstudents in America. 
 Thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)Hi, I'm an engineer,and I make robots.,Now, of course you all knownwhat a robot is, right?,If you don't, you'd probably go to Google,,and you'd ask Google what a robot is.,So let's do that.,We'll go to Googlenand this is what we get.,Now, you can see here there arenlots of different types of robots,,but they're predominantlynhumanoid in structure.,And they look pretty conventional,because they've got plastic,nthey've got metal,,they've got motors and gears and so on.,Some of them look quite friendly,,and you could go upnand you could hug them.,Some of them not so friendly,,they look like they'renstraight out of "Terminator,",in fact they may well benstraight out of "Terminator.",You can do lots of really coolnthings with these robots --,you can do really exciting stuff. 
 But I'd like to looknat different kinds of robots --,I want to make different kinds of robots.,And I take inspirationnfrom the things that don't look like us,,but look like these.,So these are natural biological organisms,and they do somenreally cool things that we can't,,and current robots can't either.,They do all sorts of great thingsnlike moving around on the floor;,they go into our gardensnand they eat our crops;,they climb trees;,they go in water, they come out of water;,they trap insects and digest them.,So they do really interesting things.,They live, they breathe, they die,,they eat things from the environment.,Our current robots don't really do that.,Now, wouldn't it be great,if you could use some of thosencharacteristics in future robots,so that you could solvensome really interesting problems?,I'm going to look at a couple of problemsnnow in the environment,where we can usenthe skills and the technologies,derived from these animals,and from the plants,,and we can use themnto solve those problems. 
 Let's have a looknat two environmental problems.,They're both of our making --,this is man interactingnwith the environment,and doing some rather unpleasant things.,The first one is to donwith the pressure of population.,Such is the pressurenof population around the world,that agriculture and farming is requirednto produce more and more crops.,Now, to do that,,farmers put more and morenchemicals onto the land.,They put on fertilizers,nnitrates, pesticides --,all sorts of thingsnthat encourage the growth of the crops,,but there are some negative impacts.,One of the negative impacts isnif you put lots of fertilizer on the land,,not all of it goes into the crops.,Lots of it stays in the soil,,and then when it rains,,these chemicals go into the water table.,And in the water table,,then they go into streams,ninto lakes, into rivers,and into the sea.,Now, if you put allnof these chemicals, these nitrates,,into those kinds of environments,,there are organisms in those environmentsnthat will be affected by that --,algae, for example.,Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,,so it will take in all these chemicals,,and if the conditions are right,nit will mass produce.,It will produce massesnand masses of new algae.,That's called a bloom.,The trouble is thatnwhen algae reproduces like this,,it starves the water of oxygen.,As soon as you do that,,the other organismsnin the water can't survive.,So, what do we do?,We try to produce a robotnthat will eat the algae,,consume it and make it safe. 
 So that's the first problem.,The second problem is also of our making,,and it's to do with oil pollution.,Now, oil comes outnof the engines that we use,,the boats that we use.,Sometimes tankersnflush their oil tanks into the sea,,so oil is released into the sea that way.,Wouldn't it be nicenif we could treat that in some way,using robots that could eat the pollutionnthe oil fields have produced?,So that's what we do.,We make robots that will eat pollution. 
 To actually make the robot,,we take inspiration from two organisms.,On the right therenyou see the basking shark.,The basking shark is a massive shark.,It's noncarnivorous,nso you can swim with it,,as you can see.,And the basking shark opens its mouth,,and it swims through the water,ncollecting plankton.,As it does that, it digests the food,,and then it uses that energynin its body to keep moving.,So, could we make a robot like that --,like the basking sharknthat chugs through the water,and eats up pollution?,Well, let's see if we can do that.,But also, we take the inspirationnfrom other organisms.,I've got a picture herenof a water boatman,,and the water boatman is really cute.,When it's swimming in the water,,it uses its paddle-like legsnto push itself forward. 
 So we take those two organisms,and we combine them togethernto make a new kind of robot.,In fact, because we're usingnthe water boatman as inspiration,,and our robot sits on top of the water,,and it rows,,we call it the "Row-bot.",So a Row-bot is a robot that rows.,OK. So what does it look like?,Here's some pictures of the Row-bot,,and you'll see,,it doesn't look anything like the robotsnwe saw right at the beginning.,Google is wrong;nrobots don't look like that,,they look like this. 
 So I've got the Row-bot here.,I'll just hold it up for you.,It gives you a sense of the scale,,and it doesn't looknanything like the others.,OK, so it's made out of plastic,,and we'll have a look nownat the components,that make up the Row-bot --,what makes it really special. 
 The Row-bot is made up of three parts,,and those three parts are reallynlike the parts of any organism.,It's got a brain,,it's got a body,and it's got a stomach.,It needs the stomach to create the energy.,Any Row-bot will haventhose three components,,and any organismnwill have those three components,,so let's go through them one at a time.,It has a body,,and its body is made out of plastic,,and it sits on top of the water.,And it's got flippers on the side here --,paddles that help it move,,just like the water boatman.,It's got a plastic body,,but it's got a soft rubber mouth here,,and a mouth here --nit's got two mouths.,Why does it have two mouths?,One is to let the food go in,and the other is to let the food go out.,So you can see reallynit's got a mouth and a derriere,,or a -- 
 (Laughter) 
 something where the stuff comes out,,which is just like a real organism.,So it's starting to looknlike that basking shark.,So that's the body. 
 The second component might be the stomach.,We need to get the energy into the robotnand we need to treat the pollution,,so the pollution goes in,,and it will do something.,It's got a cell in the middle herencalled a microbial fuel cell.,I'll put this down,nand I'll lift up the fuel cell.,Here. So instead of having batteries,,instead of havingna conventional power system,,it's got one of these.,This is its stomach.,And it really is a stomach,because you can put energy in this sidenin the form of pollution,,and it creates electricity. 
 So what is it?,It's called a microbial fuel cell.,It's a little bitnlike a chemical fuel cell,,which you might havencome across in school,,or you might've seen in the news.,Chemical fuel cellsntake hydrogen and oxygen,,and they can combine them togethernand you get electricity.,That's well-established technology;nit was in the Apollo space missions.,That's from 40, 50 years ago.,This is slightly newer.,This is a microbial fuel cell.,It's the same principle:,it's got oxygen on one side,,but instead of havingnhydrogen on the other,,it's got some soup,,and inside that soupnthere are living microbes.,Now, if you take some organic material --,could be some waste products, some food,,maybe a bit of your sandwich --,you put it in there,nthe microbes will eat that food,,and they will turn it into electricity.,Not only that, but if you selectnthe right kind of microbes,,you can use the microbial fuel cellnto treat some of the pollution.,If you choose the right microbes,,the microbes will eat the algae.,If you use other kinds of microbes,,they will eat petroleumnspirits and crude oil.,So you can seenhow this stomach could be used,to not only treat the pollution,but also to generate electricitynfrom the pollution.,So the robot will moventhrough the environment,,taking food into its stomach,,digest the food, create electricity,,use that electricitynto move through the environment,and keep doing this. 
 OK, so let's see what happensnwhen we run the Row-bot --,when it does some rowing.,Here we've got a couple of videos,,the first thing you'll see --nhopefully you can see here,is the mouth open.,The front mouth and the bottom mouth open,,and it will stay opened enough,,then the robot will start to row forward.,It moves through the water,so that food goes innas the waste products go out.,Once it's moved enough,,it stops and then it closes the mouth --,slowly closes the mouths --,and then it will sit there,,and it will digest the food. 
 Of course these microbial fuel cells,,they contain microbes.,What you really want is lots of energy,coming out of those microbesnas quickly as possible.,But we can't force the microbes,and they generate a small amountnof electricity per second.,They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.,Let's put that into context.,Your mobile phone for example,,one of these modern ones,,if you use it, it takes about one watt.,So that's a thousand or a million timesnas much energy that that uses,compared to the microbial fuel cell.,How can we cope with that?,Well, when the Row-botnhas done its digestion,,when it's taken the food in,,it will sit there and it will waitnuntil it has consumed all that food.,That could take some hours,nit could take some days.,A typical cycle for the Row-botnlooks like this:,you open your mouth,,you move,,you close your mouth,and you sit there for a while waiting.,Once you digest your food,,then you can go aboutndoing the same thing again.,But you know what, that looksnlike a real organism, doesn't it?,It looks like the kind of thing we do.,Saturday night,nwe go out, open our mouths,,fill our stomachs,,sit in front of the telly and digest.,When we've had enough,nwe do the same thing again. 
 OK, if we're lucky with this cycle,,at the end of the cyclenwe'll have enough energy left over,for us to be able to do something else.,We could send a message, for example.,We could send a message saying,,"This is how much pollutionnI've eaten recently,",or, "This is the kind of stuffnthat I've encountered,",or, "This is where I am.",That ability to send a messagensaying, "This is where I am,",is really, really important.,If you think about the oil slicksnthat we saw before,,or those massive algal blooms,,what you really want to donis put your Row-bot out there,,and it eats up all of those pollutions,,and then you have to go collect them.,Why?,Because these Row-bots at the moment,,this Row-bot I've got here,,it contains motors, it contains wires,,it contains componentsnwhich themselves are not biodegradable.,Current Row-bots containnthings like toxic batteries.,You can't leave those in the environment,,so you need to track them,,and then when they've finishedntheir job of work,,you need to collect them.,That limits the numbernof Row-bots you can use.,If, on the other hand,,you have robot a little bitnlike a biological organism,,when it comes to the end of its life,,it dies and it degrades to nothing. 
 So wouldn't it be nice if these robots,,instead of being like this,nmade out of plastic,,were made out of other materials,,which when you throw them out there,,they biodegrade to nothing?,That changes the waynin which we use robots.,Instead of putting 10 or 100nout into the environment,,having to track them,,and then when they die,,collect them,,you could put a thousand,,a million, a billion robotsninto the environment.,Just spread them around.,You know that at the end of their lives,nthey're going to degrade to nothing.,You don't need to worry about them.,So that changes the waynin which you think about robots,and the way you deploy them. 
 Then the question is: Can you do this?,Well, yes, we have shownnthat you can do this.,You can make robotsnwhich are biodegradable.,What's really interestingnis you can use household materials,to make these biodegradable robots.,I'll show you some;nyou might be surprised.,You can make a robot out of jelly.,Instead of having a motor,nwhich we have at the moment,,you can make thingsncalled artificial muscles.,Artificial muscles are smart materials,,you apply electricity to them,,and they contract,nor they bend or they twist.,They look like real muscles.,So instead of having a motor,nyou have these artificial muscles.,And you can makenartificial muscles out of jelly.,If you take some jelly and some salts,,and do a bit of jiggery-pokery,,you can make an artificial muscle. 
 We've also shown you can makenthe microbial fuel cell's stomach,out of paper.,So you could make the wholenrobot out of biodegradable materials.,You throw them out there,nand they degrade to nothing. 
 Well, this is really, really exciting.,It's going to totally change the waynin which we think about robots,,but also it allows younto be really creative,in the way in which you thinknabout what you can do with these robots.,I'll give you an example.,If you can use jelly to make a robot --,now, we eat jelly, right?,So, why not make something like this?,A robot gummy bear.,Here, I've got some I prepared earlier.,There we go. I've got a packet --,and I've got a lemon-flavored one.,I'll take this gummy bear --nhe's not robotic, OK?,We have to pretend.,And what you do with one of thesenis you put it in your mouth --,the lemon's quite nice.,Try not to chew it too much,nit's a robot, it may not like it.,And then you swallow it.,And then it goes into your stomach.,And when it's inside your stomach,nit moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends,,it does something.,It could go further downninto your intestines,,find out whether you've gotnsome ulcer or cancer,,maybe do an injection,nsomething like that.,You know that oncenit's done its job of work,,it could be consumed by your stomach,,or if you don't want that,,it could go straight through you,,into the toilet,,and be degraded safely in the environment.,So this changes the way, again,nin which we think about robots. 
 So, we started off lookingnat robots that would eat pollution,,and then we're lookingnat robots which we can eat.,I hope this gives you some idea,of the kinds of thingsnwe can do with future robots. 
 Thank you very much for your attention. 
 (Applause)My name is Katrina Spade,nand I grew up in a medical family,where it was fairly normal to talknabout death and dying at the dinner table.,But I didn't go into medicinenlike so many of my family members.,Instead, I went to architecture schoolnto learn how to design.,And while I was there,nI began to be curious,about what would happennto my physical body after I died.,What would my nearestnand dearest do with me? 
 So if the existencenand the fact of your own mortality,doesn't get you down,,the state of our currentnfunerary practices will.,Today, almost 50 percent of Americansnchoose conventional burial.,Conventional burial begins with embalming,,where funeral staff drain bodily fluid,and replace it with a mixturendesigned to preserve the corpse,and give it a lifelike glow.,Then, as you know,nbodies are buried in a casket,in a concrete-lined grave,in a cemetery.,All told, in US cemeteries,,we bury enough metalnto build a Golden Gate Bridge,,enough wood to buildn1,800 single family homes,,and enough formaldehyde-ladennembalming fluid,to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools. 
 In addition, cemeteriesnall over the world are reaching capacity.,Turns out, it doesn't reallynmake good business sense,to sell someonena piece of land for eternity. 
 (Laughter) 
 Whose idea was that? 
 In some places, you can't buy a plotnno matter how much money you have.,As a result, cremation ratesnhave risen fast.,In 1950, if you suggested your grandmothernbe incinerated after she died,,you'd probably be kickednfrom the family deathbed.,But today, almost halfnof Americans choose cremation,,citing simpler,,cheaper,and more ecological as reasons.,I used to think that cremationnwas a sustainable form of disposition,,but just think about it for a second.,Cremation destroys the potential we have,to give back to the earthnafter we've died.,It uses an energy-intensive processnto turn bodies into ash,,polluting the airnand contributing to climate change.,All told, cremations in the US,emit a staggering 600 millionnpounds of carbon dioxide,into the atmosphere annually.,The truly awful truth,is that the very last thingnthat most of us will do on this earth,is poison it. 
 It's like we've created, acceptednand death-denied our way into a status quo,that puts as much distancenbetween ourselves and nature,as is humanly possible.,Our modern funerary practicesnare designed to stave off,the natural processesnthat happen to a body after death.,In other words, they're meantnto prevent us from decomposing.,But the truth,is that nature is really,nreally good at death.,We've all seen it.,When organic material dies in nature,,microbes and bacterianbreak it down into nutrient-rich soil,,completing the life cycle.,In nature, death creates life. 
 Back in architecture school,nI was thinking about all this,,and I set out on a plannto redesign death care.,Could I create a system,that was beneficial to the earth,and that used nature as a guidenrather than something to be feared?,Something that was gentle to the planet?,That planet, after all,nsupports our living bodies,our whole lives. 
 And while I was mulling this all over,over the drawing board,,the phone rang.,It was my friend Kate.,She was like, "Hey,nhave you heard about the farmers,who are composting whole cows?",And I was like, "Mmmm." 
 (Laughter) 
 Turns out that farmersnin agricultural institutions,have been practicing somethingncalled livestock mortality composting,for decades.,Mortality composting is wherenyou take an animal high in nitrogen,and cover it with co-composting materialsnthat are high in carbon.,It's an aerobic process,nso it requires oxygen,,and it requiresnplenty of moisture as well.,In the most basic setup, a cownis covered with a few feet of wood chips,,which are high in carbon,,and left outside for nature,nfor breezes to provide oxygen,and rain to provide moisture.,In about nine months,,all that remainsnis a nutrient-rich compost.,The flesh has been decomposed entirely,,as have the bones.,I know. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I would definitelyncall myself a decomposition nerd,,but I am far, far from a scientist,,and one way you can tell this is true,is that I have often callednthe process of composting "magic." 
 (Laughter) 
 So basically, all we humans need to do,is create the right environmentnfor nature to do its job.,It's like the oppositenof antibacterial soap.,Instead of fighting them,,we welcome microbes and bacterianin with open arms.,These tiny, amazing creatures,break down moleculesninto smaller molecules and atoms,,which are then incorporatedninto new molecules.,In other words, that cow is transformed.,It's no longer a cow.,It's been cycled back into nature.,See? Magic. 
 You can probably imaginenthe light bulb that went off in my head,after I received that phone call.,I began designing a system,based on the principlesnof livestock mortality composting,that would take human beingsnand transform them into soil. 
 Fast-forward five years,and the project has grown in waysnI truly never could have imagined.,We've created a scalable,nreplicable non-profit urban model,based on the sciencenof livestock mortality composting,that turns human beings into soil.,We've partnered and collaboratednwith experts in soil science,,decomposition, alternative death care,,law and architecture.,We've raised fundsnfrom foundations and individuals,in order to designna prototype of this system,,and we've heard from tens of thousandsnof people all over the world,who want this option to be available.,OK.,In the next few years,,it's our goal to build the firstnfull-scale human composting facility,right in the city of Seattle. 
 (Applause) 
 Imagine it,,part public park,,part funeral home,,part memorial to the people we love,,a place where we can reconnectnwith the cycles of nature,and treat bodiesnwith gentleness and respect. 
 The infrastructure is simple.,Inside a vertical core,,bodies and wood chips undergonaccelerated natural decomposition,,or composting,,and are transformed into soil.,When someone dies, their bodynis taken to a human composting facility.,After wrapping the deceasednin a simple shroud,,friends and family carry the bodynto the top of the core,,which contains the naturalndecomposition system.,During a laying in ceremony,,they gently place the body into the core,and cover it with wood chips.,This begins the gentle transformationnfrom human to soil.,Over the next few weeks,nthe body decomposes naturally.,Microbes and bacterianbreak down carbon, then protein,,to create a new substance,,a rich, earthy soil.,This soil can then be usednto grow new life.,Eventually, you could be a lemon tree. 
 (Applause) 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Who's thinking aboutnlemon meringue pie right now? 
 (Laughter) 
 A lemon drop?,Something stronger? 
 So in addition to housing the core,,these buildings will functionnto support the grieving,by providing space for memorial servicesnand end-of-life planning.,The potential for repurposing is huge.,Old churches and industrial warehousesncan be converted into places,where we create soil and honor life. 
 We want to bring back the aspect of ritual,that's been dilutednover the past hundred years,as cremation rates have risen,and religious affiliation has declined.,Our Seattle facility will functionnas a model for these places,all over the world.,We've heard from communitiesnin South Africa, Australia,,the UK, Canada and beyond.,We're creating a design toolkit,that will help othersndesign and build facilities,that will contain technical specifications,and regulatory best practices.,We want to help individuals,norganizations,,and down the road, municipalities,design and build facilitiesnin their own cities.,The idea is that every one of these placesnshould look and feel completely different,with the same system inside.,They're really meant to be designednfor the neighborhood in which they reside,and the community which they serve. 
 The other idea isnfor supportive staff to be on hand,to help families with the carenand preparation of loved ones' bodies.,We're banishing practicesnthat bewilder and disempower,and creating a systemnthat is beautiful and meaningful,and transparent.,We believe that accessnto ecological death care,is a human right. 
 OK, so you know the old saying,,if you can compost a cow,nyou can compost a human? 
 (Laughter) 
 Turns out, it's true.,Since 2014, we've beennrunning a pilot project,in the hills of North Carolina,with the Forensic Anthropology Departmentnat Western Carolina University.,Six donor bodiesnhave been covered in wood chips,,oxygen provided by breezes,,microbes and bacteria doing their jobs.,This pilot program has allowed usnto demonstrate that it's possible,to harness the incredible powernof natural decomposition,to turn human bodies into soil,,and we're workingnwith other universities as well.,Soil scientistsnat Washington State University,,the grad students, anyway,,are working to compostnteeth with amalgam fillings,so that we can understandnwhat happens to the mercury therein.,Next up, we'll be beginning experiments,to determine what happensnto chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals,during the composting process,,and whether additionalnremediation will be needed. 
 By the way,,composting creates a great deal of heat,,especially this particularntype of composting.,One week after we beganncomposting our fifth donor body,,the temperature insidenthat mound of wood chips,reached 158 degrees Fahrenheit.,Imagine harnessing that heatnto create energy,or comfort the grieving on a cold day. 
 The death care revolution has begun.,It's an exciting time to be alive. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Some people think that there'sna TED Talk formula: 
 "Give a talk on a round, red rug." 
 "Share a childhood story." 
 "Divulge a personal secret." 
 "End with an inspiring call to action." 
 No.,That's not how to think of a TED Talk.,In fact, if you overuse those devices,,you're just going to come acrossnas clichéd or emotionally manipulative. 
 But there is one thing that allngreat TED Talks have in common,,and I would like to sharenthat thing with you, 
 because over the past 12 years,nI've had a ringside seat,,listening to many hundredsnof amazing TED speakers, like these.,I've helped them preparentheir talks for prime time,,and learned directly from them,their secrets of whatnmakes for a great talk. 
 And even though these speakersnand their topics all seem,completely different,,they actually do havenone key common ingredient.,And it's this:,Your number one task as a speaker,is to transfer into your listeners' mindsnan extraordinary gift --,a strange and beautiful objectnthat we call an idea. 
 Let me show you what I mean.,Here's Haley.,She is about to give a TED Talk,and frankly, she's terrified. 
 (Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck! 
 (Applause) 
 Over the course of 18 minutes,,1,200 people, many of whomnhave never seen each other before,,are finding that their brainsnare starting to sync with Haley's brain,and with each other.,They're literally beginning to exhibitnthe same brain-wave patterns.,And I don't just meannthey're feeling the same emotions.,There's something even morenstartling happening. 
 Let's take a look insidenHaley's brain for a moment.,There are billions of interconnectednneurons in an impossible tangle.,But look here, right here --,a few million of themnare linked to each other,in a way which represents a single idea.,And incredibly, this exact patternnis being recreated in real time,inside the minds of everyone listening.,That's right; in just a few minutes,,a pattern involving millions of neurons,is being teleported into 1,200 minds,,just by people listening to a voicenand watching a face. 
 But wait -- what is an idea anyway?,Well, you can think of itnas a pattern of information,that helps you understandnand navigate the world.,Ideas come in all shapes and sizes,,from the complex and analytical,to the simple and aesthetic. 
 Here are just a few examplesnshared from the TED stage.,Sir Ken Robinson -- creativitynis key to our kids' future. 
 (Video) Sir Ken Robinson:nMy contention is that creativity now,is as important in education as literacy,,and we should treat itnwith the same status. 
 Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy --nbuilding from bamboo is beautiful. 
 (Video) Elora Hardy:nIt is growing all around us,,it's strong, it's elegant,nit's earthquake-resistant. 
 CA: Chimamanda Adichie --npeople are more than a single identity. 
 (Video) Chimamanda Adichie:nThe single story creates stereotypes,,and the problem with stereotypesnis not that they are untrue,,but that they are incomplete. 
 CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,,and not just randomly.,They're carefully linked together.,Collectively they formnan amazingly complex structure,that is your personal worldview.,It's your brain's operating system.,It's how you navigate the world.,And it is built up out of millionsnof individual ideas. 
 So, for example, if one littlencomponent of your worldview,is the idea that kittens are adorable,,then when you see this,,you'll react like this.,But if another component of your worldview,is the idea that leopards are dangerous,,then when you see this,,you'll react a little bit differently.,So, it's pretty obvious,why the ideas that make upnyour worldview are crucial.,You need them to be as reliablenas possible -- a guide,,to the scary but wonderfulnreal world out there. 
 Now, different people's worldviewsncan be dramatically different.,For example,,how does your worldview reactnwhen you see this image: 
 (Video) Dalia Mogahed:nWhat do you think when you look at me?,"A woman of faith,"n"an expert," maybe even "a sister"?,Or "oppressed," "brainwashed,","a terrorist"? 
 CA: Whatever your answer,,there are millions of people out therenwho would react very differently.,So that's why ideas really matter.,If communicated properly,nthey're capable of changing, forever,,how someone thinks about the world,,and shaping their actions both nownand well into the future.,Ideas are the most powerful forcenshaping human culture. 
 So if you accept,that your number one tasknas a speaker is to build an idea,inside the minds of your audience,,here are four guidelinesnfor how you should go about that task: 
 One, limit your talknto just one major idea.,Ideas are complex things;,you need to slash back your contentnso that you can focus,on the single ideanyou're most passionate about,,and give yourself a chancento explain that one thing properly.,You have to give context,nshare examples, make it vivid.,So pick one idea,,and make it the through-linenrunning through your entire talk,,so that everything you saynlinks back to it in some way. 
 Two, give your listeners a reason to care.,Before you can start building thingsninside the minds of your audience,,you have to get their permissionnto welcome you in.,And the main tool to achieve that?,Curiosity.,Stir your audience's curiosity.,Use intriguing, provocative questions,to identify why somethingndoesn't make sense and needs explaining.,If you can reveal a disconnectionnin someone's worldview,,they'll feel the neednto bridge that knowledge gap.,And once you've sparked that desire,,it will be so much easiernto start building your idea. 
 Three, build your idea, piece by piece,,out of concepts that your audiencenalready understands.,You use the power of language,to weave togethernconcepts that already exist,in your listeners' minds --,but not your language, their language.,You start where they are.,The speakers often forget that manynof the terms and concepts they live with,are completely unfamiliarnto their audiences.,Now, metaphors can play a crucial rolenin showing how the pieces fit together,,because they revealnthe desired shape of the pattern,,based on an idea that the listenernalready understands. 
 For example, when Jennifer Kahn,wanted to explain the incrediblennew biotechnology called CRISPR,,she said, "It's as if, for the first time,,you had a word processor to edit DNA.,CRISPR allows you to cut and pastengenetic information really easily.",Now, a vivid explanation like thatndelivers a satisfying aha moment,as it snaps into place in our minds.,It's important, therefore,nto test your talk on trusted friends,,and find out which partsnthey get confused by. 
 Four, here's the final tip:,Make your idea worth sharing.,By that I mean, ask yourself the question:,"Who does this idea benefit?",And I need you to be honestnwith the answer.,If the idea only serves younor your organization,,then, I'm sorry to say,nit's probably not worth sharing.,The audience will see right through you.,But if you believe that the ideanhas the potential,to brighten up someone else's day,or change someone else'snperspective for the better,or inspire someone to donsomething differently,,then you have the core ingredientnto a truly great talk,,one that can be a gift to themnand to all of us.[On April 3, 2016 we sawnthe largest data leak in history.],[The Panama Papers exposednrich and powerful people],[hiding vast amounts of moneynin offshore accounts.],[What does this mean?],[We called Robert Palmernof Global Witness to explain.] 
 This week, there have beenna whole slew and deluge of stories,coming out from the leaknof 11 million documents,from a Panamanian-based law firmncalled Mossack Fonseca.,The release of these papers from Panamanlifts the veil on a tiny piece,of the secretive offshore world.,We get an insight into how clientsnand banks and lawyers,go to companies like Mossack Fonseca,and say, "OK, we wantnan anonymous company,,can you give us one?",So you actually get to see the emails,,you get to see the exchanges of messages,,you get to see the mechanicsnof how this works,,how this operates. 
 Now, this has already startednto have pretty immediate repercussions.,The Prime Ministernof Iceland has resigned.,We've also had news,that an ally of the brutalnSyrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad,has also got offshore companies.,There's been allegationsnof a $2 billion money trail,that leads back to PresidentnVladimir Putin of Russia,via his close childhood friend,,who happens to be a top cellist.,And there will be a lotnof rich individuals out there,and others who will be nervousnabout the next set of stories,and the next set of leaked documents. 
 Now, this sounds like the plotnof a spy thriller,or a John Grisham novel.,It seems very distantnfrom you, me, ordinary people.,Why should we care about this?,But the truth is that if richnand powerful individuals,are able to keep their money offshore,and not pay the taxes that they should,,it means that there is less moneynfor vital public services,like healthcare, education, roads.,And that affects all of us. 
 Now, for my organization Global Witness,,this exposé has been phenomenal.,We have the world's medianand political leaders,talking about how individualsncan use offshore secrecy,to hide and disguise their assets --,something we have been talking aboutnand exposing for a decade. 
 Now, I think a lot of people findnthis entire world baffling and confusing,,and hard to understand hownthis sort of offshore world works.,I like to think of it a bitnlike a Russian doll.,So you can have one companynstacked inside another company,,stacked inside another company,,making it almost impossiblento really understand,who is behind these structures.,It can be very difficultnfor law enforcement,or tax authorities,njournalists, civil society,to really understand what's going on. 
 I also think it's interesting,that there's been less coveragenof this issue in the United States.,And that's perhaps becausensome prominent US people,just haven't figurednin this exposé, in this scandal.,Now, that's not becausenthere are no rich Americans,who are stashing their assets offshore.,It's just because of the waynin which offshore works,,Mossack Fonseca has fewernAmerican clients.,I think if we saw leaksnfrom the Cayman Islands,or even from Delawarenor Wyoming or Nevada,,you would see many more casesnand examples linking back to Americans. 
 In fact, in a number of US statesnyou need less information,,you need to provide lessninformation to get a company,than you do to get a library card.,That sort of secrecy in Americanhas allowed employees of school districts,to rip off schoolchildren.,It has allowed scammersnto rip off vulnerable investors.,This is the sort of behaviornthat affects all of us. 
 Now, at Global Witness,,we wanted to see what thisnactually looked like in practice.,How does this actually work?,So what we did,is we sent in an undercover investigatornto 13 Manhattan law firms.,Our investigator posednas an African minister,who wanted to move suspect fundsninto the United States,to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.,Now, what was truly shockingnwas that all but one of those lawyers,provided our investigator with suggestions,on how to move those suspect funds.,These were all preliminary meetings,,and none of the lawyersntook us on as a client,and of course no money moved hands,,but it really shows the problemnwith the system. 
 It's also important,to not just think about thisnas individual cases.,This is not just aboutnan individual lawyer,who's spoken to our undercoverninvestigator and provided suggestions.,It's not just aboutna particular senior politician,who's been caught up in a scandal.,This is about how a system works,,that entrenches corruption,ntax evasion, poverty and instability.,And in order to tackle this,,we need to change the game.,We need to change the rules of the game,to make this sort of behavior harder. 
 This may seem like doom and gloom,,like there's nothing we can do about it,,like nothing has ever changed,,like there will always be richnand powerful individuals.,But as a natural optimist,,I do see that we are startingnto get some change. 
 Over the last couple of years,,we've seen a real push towardsngreater transparency,when it comes to company ownership.,This issue was put on the political agenda,by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron,at a big G8 Summit that was heldnin Northern Ireland in 2013.,And since then, the European Unionnis going to be creating,central registers at a national level,of who really owns and controlsncompanies across Europe. 
 One of the things that is sad is that,nactually, the US is lagging behind.,There's bipartisan legislationnthat had been introduced,in the House and the Senate,,but it isn't making as much progressnas we'd like to see.,So we'd really want to seenthe Panama leaks,,this huge peek into the offshore world,,be used as a way of opening upnin the US and around the world. 
 For us at Global Witness,nthis is a moment for change.,We need ordinary people to get angry,at the way in which peoplencan hide their identity,behind secret companies.,We need business leadersnto stand up and say,,"Secrecy like this is notngood for business.",We need political leadersnto recognize the problem,,and to commit to changing the lawnto open up this sort of secrecy. 
 Together, we can end the secrecy,that is currently allowing tax evasion,,corruption, money laundering to flourish.How many of you are creatives,,designers, engineers,nentrepreneurs, artists,,or maybe you just havena really big imagination?,Show of hands? (Cheers) 
 That's most of you.,I have some news for us creatives.,Over the course of the next 20 years,,more will change aroundnthe way we do our work,than has happened in the last 2,000.,In fact, I think we're at the dawnnof a new age in human history. 
 Now, there have been four major historicalneras defined by the way we work.,The Hunter-Gatherer Agenlasted several million years.,And then the Agricultural Agenlasted several thousand years.,The Industrial Age lastedna couple of centuries.,And now the Information Agenhas lasted just a few decades.,And now today, we're on the cuspnof our next great era as a species. 
 Welcome to the Augmented Age.,In this new era, your natural humanncapabilities are going to be augmented,by computational systemsnthat help you think,,robotic systems that help you make,,and a digital nervous system,that connects you to the worldnfar beyond your natural senses.,Let's start with cognitive augmentation.,How many of you are augmented cyborgs? 
 (Laughter) 
 I would actually arguenthat we're already augmented.,Imagine you're at a party,,and somebody asks you a questionnthat you don't know the answer to.,If you have one of these,nin a few seconds, you can know the answer.,But this is just a primitive beginning.,Even Siri is just a passive tool.,In fact, for the lastnthree-and-a-half million years,,the tools that we've hadnhave been completely passive.,They do exactly what we tell themnand nothing more.,Our very first tool only cutnwhere we struck it.,The chisel only carvesnwhere the artist points it.,And even our most advanced toolsndo nothing without our explicit direction.,In fact, to date, and thisnis something that frustrates me,,we've always been limited,by this need to manuallynpush our wills into our tools --,like, manual,nliterally using our hands,,even with computers.,But I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek." 
 (Laughter) 
 I want to have a conversationnwith a computer.,I want to say, "Computer,nlet's design a car,",and the computer shows me a car.,And I say, "No, more fast-looking,nand less German,",and bang, the computer shows me an option. 
 (Laughter) 
 That conversation might bena little ways off,,probably less than many of us think,,but right now,,we're working on it.,Tools are making this leapnfrom being passive to being generative.,Generative design toolsnuse a computer and algorithms,to synthesize geometry,to come up with new designsnall by themselves.,All it needs are your goalsnand your constraints. 
 I'll give you an example.,In the case of this aerial drone chassis,,all you would need to donis tell it something like,,it has four propellers,,you want it to benas lightweight as possible,,and you need it to benaerodynamically efficient.,Then what the computer doesnis it explores the entire solution space:,every single possibility that solvesnand meets your criteria --,millions of them.,It takes big computers to do this.,But it comes back to us with designs,that we, by ourselves,nnever could've imagined.,And the computer's coming upnwith this stuff all by itself --,no one ever drew anything,,and it started completely from scratch.,And by the way, it's no accident,that the drone body looks just likenthe pelvis of a flying squirrel. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's because the algorithmsnare designed to work,the same way evolution does. 
 What's exciting is we're startingnto see this technology,out in the real world.,We've been working with Airbusnfor a couple of years,on this concept plane for the future.,It's a ways out still.,But just recently we usedna generative-design AI,to come up with this.,This is a 3D-printed cabin partitionnthat's been designed by a computer.,It's stronger than the originalnyet half the weight,,and it will be flyingnin the Airbus A320 later this year.,So computers can now generate;,they can come up with their own solutionsnto our well-defined problems.,But they're not intuitive.,They still have to start from scratchnevery single time,,and that's because they never learn.,Unlike Maggie. 
 (Laughter) 
 Maggie's actually smarternthan our most advanced design tools.,What do I mean by that?,If her owner picks up that leash,,Maggie knows with a fairndegree of certainty,it's time to go for a walk.,And how did she learn?,Well, every time the owner picked upnthe leash, they went for a walk.,And Maggie did three things:,she had to pay attention,,she had to remember what happened,and she had to retain and createna pattern in her mind. 
 Interestingly, that's exactly what,computer scientistsnhave been trying to get AIs to do,for the last 60 or so years.,Back in 1952,,they built this computernthat could play Tic-Tac-Toe.,Big deal.,Then 45 years later, in 1997,,Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.,2011, Watson beats these twonhumans at Jeopardy,,which is much harder for a computernto play than chess is.,In fact, rather than workingnfrom predefined recipes,,Watson had to use reasoningnto overcome his human opponents.,And then a couple of weeks ago,,DeepMind's AlphaGo beatsnthe world's best human at Go,,which is the most difficultngame that we have.,In fact, in Go, there are morenpossible moves,than there are atoms in the universe.,So in order to win,,what AlphaGo had to donwas develop intuition.,And in fact, at some points,nAlphaGo's programmers didn't understand,why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing. 
 And things are moving really fast.,I mean, consider --nin the space of a human lifetime,,computers have gone from a child's game,to what's recognized as the pinnaclenof strategic thought.,What's basically happening,is computers are goingnfrom being like Spock,to being a lot more like Kirk. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? From pure logic to intuition.,Would you cross this bridge?,Most of you are saying, "Oh, hell no!" 
 (Laughter) 
 And you arrived at that decisionnin a split second.,You just sort of knewnthat bridge was unsafe.,And that's exactly the kind of intuition,that our deep-learning systemsnare starting to develop right now.,Very soon, you'll literally be able,to show something you've made,nyou've designed,,to a computer,,and it will look at it and say,,"Sorry, homie, that'll never work.nYou have to try again.",Or you could ask it if peoplenare going to like your next song,,or your next flavor of ice cream.,Or, much more importantly,,you could work with a computernto solve a problem,that we've never faced before.,For instance, climate change.,We're not doing a veryngood job on our own,,we could certainly usenall the help we can get.,That's what I'm talking about,,technology amplifyingnour cognitive abilities,so we can imagine and design thingsnthat were simply out of our reach,as plain old un-augmented humans. 
 So what about makingnall of this crazy new stuff,that we're going to invent and design?,I think the era of human augmentationnis as much about the physical world,as it is about the virtual,nintellectual realm.,How will technology augment us?,In the physical world, robotic systems.,OK, there's certainly a fear,that robots are going to takenjobs away from humans,,and that is true in certain sectors.,But I'm much more interested in this idea,that humans and robots working togethernare going to augment each other,,and start to inhabit a new space. 
 This is our applied research labnin San Francisco,,where one of our areas of focusnis advanced robotics,,specifically, human-robot collaboration.,And this is Bishop, one of our robots.,As an experiment, we set it up,to help a person working in constructionndoing repetitive tasks --,tasks like cutting out holes for outletsnor light switches in drywall. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, Bishop's human partnerncan tell what to do in plain English,and with simple gestures,,kind of like talking to a dog,,and then Bishop executesnon those instructions,with perfect precision.,We're using the humannfor what the human is good at:,awareness, perception and decision making.,And we're using the robotnfor what it's good at:,precision and repetitiveness. 
 Here's another cool projectnthat Bishop worked on.,The goal of this project,nwhich we called the HIVE,,was to prototype the experiencenof humans, computers and robots,all working together to solvena highly complex design problem.,The humans acted as labor.,They cruised around the construction site,nthey manipulated the bamboo --,which, by the way,nbecause it's a non-isomorphic material,,is super hard for robots to deal with.,But then the robotsndid this fiber winding,,which was almost impossiblenfor a human to do.,And then we had an AInthat was controlling everything.,It was telling the humans what to do,ntelling the robots what to do,and keeping track of thousandsnof individual components.,What's interesting is,,building this pavilionnwas simply not possible,without human, robot and AInaugmenting each other. 
 OK, I'll share one more project.nThis one's a little bit crazy.,We're working with Amsterdam-based artistnJoris Laarman and his team at MX3D,to generatively designnand robotically print,the world's first autonomouslynmanufactured bridge.,So, Joris and an AI are designingnthis thing right now, as we speak,,in Amsterdam.,And when they're done,nwe're going to hit "Go,",and robots will start 3D printingnin stainless steel,,and then they're going to keep printing,nwithout human intervention,,until the bridge is finished. 
 So, as computers are goingnto augment our ability,to imagine and design new stuff,,robotic systems are going to help usnbuild and make things,that we've never been able to make before.,But what about our abilitynto sense and control these things?,What about a nervous systemnfor the things that we make? 
 Our nervous system,nthe human nervous system,,tells us everythingnthat's going on around us.,But the nervous system of the thingsnwe make is rudimentary at best.,For instance, a car doesn't tellnthe city's public works department,that it just hit a pothole at the cornernof Broadway and Morrison.,A building doesn't tell its designers,whether or not the people insidenlike being there,,and the toy manufacturer doesn't know,if a toy is actually being played with --,how and where and whethernor not it's any fun.,Look, I'm sure that the designersnimagined this lifestyle for Barbie,when they designed her. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what if it turns out that Barbie'snactually really lonely? 
 (Laughter) 
 If the designers had known,what was really happeningnin the real world,with their designs -- the road,nthe building, Barbie --,they could've used that knowledgento create an experience,that was better for the user.,What's missing is a nervous system,connecting us to all of the thingsnthat we design, make and use.,What if all of you had that kindnof information flowing to you,from the things you createnin the real world?,With all of the stuff we make,,we spend a tremendous amountnof money and energy --,in fact, last year,nabout two trillion dollars --,convincing people to buynthe things we've made.,But if you had this connectionnto the things that you design and create,after they're out in the real world,,after they've been soldnor launched or whatever,,we could actually change that,,and go from making people want our stuff,,to just making stuff that peoplenwant in the first place. 
 The good news is, we're workingnon digital nervous systems,that connect us to the things we design.,We're working on one project,with a couple of guys down in Los Angelesncalled the Bandito Brothers,and their team.,And one of the things these guys donis build insane cars,that do absolutely insane things.,These guys are crazy -- 
 (Laughter) 
 in the best way.,And what we're doing with them,is taking a traditional race-car chassis,and giving it a nervous system. 
 So we instrumented itnwith dozens of sensors,,put a world-class driver behind the wheel,,took it out to the desertnand drove the hell out of it for a week.,And the car's nervous systemncaptured everything,that was happening to the car.,We captured four billion data points;,all of the forcesnthat it was subjected to.,And then we did something crazy.,We took all of that data,,and plugged it into a generative-design AInwe call "Dreamcatcher.",So what do get when you givena design tool a nervous system,,and you ask it to build younthe ultimate car chassis?,You get this.,This is something that a humanncould never have designed.,Except a human did design this,,but it was a human that was augmentednby a generative-design AI,,a digital nervous system,and robots that can actuallynfabricate something like this. 
 So if this is the future,nthe Augmented Age,,and we're going to be augmentedncognitively, physically and perceptually,,what will that look like?,What is this wonderland going to be like? 
 I think we're going to see a world,where we're movingnfrom things that are fabricated,to things that are farmed.,Where we're moving from thingsnthat are constructed,to that which is grown.,We're going to move from being isolated,to being connected.,And we'll move away from extraction,to embrace aggregation.,I also think we'll shiftnfrom craving obedience from our things,to valuing autonomy. 
 Thanks to our augmented capabilities,,our world is going to change dramatically.,We're going to have a worldnwith more variety, more connectedness,,more dynamism, more complexity,,more adaptability and, of course,,more beauty.,The shape of things to come,will be unlike anythingnwe've ever seen before.,Why?,Because what will be shaping those thingsnis this new partnership,between technology, nature and humanity.,That, to me, is a futurenwell worth looking forward to. 
 Thank you all so much. 
 (Applause)Back in 2003,,the UK government carried out a survey.,And it was a survey that measurednlevels of numeracy,in the population.,And they were shocked to find out,that for every 100 working agenadults in the country,,47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills.,Now, Level 1 numeracy skills --nthat's low-end GCSE score.,It's the ability to deal with fractions,npercentages and decimals.,So this figure promptedna lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.,Policies were changed,,investments were made,,and then they rannthe survey again in 2011.,So can you guessnwhat happened to this number?,It went up to 49. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in fact, when I reportednthis figure in the FT,,one of our readers joked and said,,"This figure is only shockingnto 51 percent of the population." 
 (Laughter) 
 But I preferred, actually,nthe reaction of a schoolchild,when I presentednat a school this information,,who raised their hand and said,,"How do we know that the personnwho made that number,isn't one of the 49 percent either?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So clearly, there's a numeracy issue,,because these arenimportant skills for life,,and a lot of the changesnthat we want to introduce in this century,involve us becomingnmore comfortable with numbers. 
 Now, it's not just an English problem.,OECD this year released some figuresnlooking at numeracy in young people,,and leading the way, the USA --,nearly 40 percent of young peoplenin the US have low numeracy.,Now, England is there too,,but there are seven OECD countriesnwith figures above 20 percent.,That is a problem,nbecause it doesn't have to be that way.,If you look at the far end of this graph,,you can see the Netherlands and Koreanare in single figures.,So there's definitely a numeracynproblem that we want to address. 
 Now, as useful as studies like these are,,I think we risk herding peopleninadvertently into one of two categories;,that there are two kinds of people:,those people that are comfortablenwith numbers, that can do numbers,,and the people who can't.,And what I'm tryingnto talk about here today,is to say that I believenthat is a false dichotomy.,It's not an immutable pairing.,I think you don't have to haventremendously high levels of numeracy,to be inspired by numbers,,and that should be the starting pointnto the journey ahead. 
 And one of the ways in whichnwe can begin that journey, for me,,is looking at statistics.,Now, I am the first to acknowledgenthat statistics has got somewhat,of an image problem. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's the part of mathematics,that even mathematiciansndon't particularly like,,because whereas the rest of mathsnis all about precision and certainty,,statistics is almost the reverse of that.,But actually, I was a late convertnto the world of statistics myself.,If you'd asked my undergraduate professors,what two subjects would I be least likelynto excel in after university,,they'd have told you statisticsnand computer programming,,and yet here I am, about to show younsome statistical graphics,that I programmed. 
 So what inspired that change in me?,What made me think that statisticsnwas actually an interesting thing?,It's really becausenstatistics are about us.,If you look at the etymologynof the word statistics,,it's the science of dealing with data,about the state or the communitynthat we live in.,So statistics are about us as a group,,not us as individuals.,And I think as social animals,,we share this fascination about hownwe as individuals relate to our groups,,to our peers.,And statistics in this waynare at their most powerful,when they surprise us. 
 And there's been some really wonderfulnsurveys carried out recently,by Ipsos MORI in the last few years.,They did a survey of overn1,000 adults in the UK,,and said, for every 100 peoplenin England and Wales,,how many of them are Muslim?,Now the average answer from this survey,,which was supposed to be representativenof the total population, was 24.,That's what people thought.,British people think 24 out of every 100npeople in the country are Muslim.,Now, official figures revealnthat figure to be about five.,So there's this big variationnbetween what we think, our perception,,and the reality as given by statistics.,And I think that's interesting.,What could possibly be causingnthat misperception? 
 And I was so thrilled with this study,,I started to take questions outnin presentations. I was referring to it.,Now, I did a presentation,at St. Paul's School for Girlsnin Hammersmith,,and I had an audience rather like this,,except it was comprised entirelynof sixth-form girls.,And I said, "Girls,,how many teenage girls do you thinknthe British public think,get pregnant every year?",And the girls were apoplectic when I said,the British public think that 15nout of every 100 teenage girls,get pregnant in the year.,And they had every right to be angry,,because in fact, I'd have to havencloser to 200 dots,before I could color one in,,in terms of whatnthe official figures tell us. 
 And rather like numeracy,nthis is not just an English problem.,Ipsos MORI expanded the surveynin recent years to go across the world.,And so, they asked Saudi Arabians,,for every 100 adults in your country,,how many of them are overweight or obese?,And the average answer from the Saudisnwas just over a quarter.,That's what they thought.,Just over a quarter of adultsnare overweight or obese.,The official figures show, actually,nit's nearer to three-quarters. 
 (Laughter) 
 So again, a big variation. 
 And I love this one: they asked in Japan,nthey asked the Japanese,,for every 100 Japanese people,,how many of them live in rural areas?,The average was about a 50-50 split,njust over halfway.,They thought 56 out of every 100nJapanese people lived in rural areas.,The official figure is seven. 
 So extraordinary variations,nand surprising to some,,but not surprising to peoplenwho have read the work,of Daniel Kahneman, for example,nthe Nobel-winning economist.,He and his colleague, Amos Tversky,nspent years researching this disjoint,between what people perceivenand the reality,,the fact that people are actuallynpretty poor intuitive statisticians.,And there are many reasons for this.,Individual experiences, certainly,ncan influence our perceptions,,but so, too, can things like the medianreporting things by exception,,rather than what's normal.,Kahneman had a nice waynof referring to that.,He said, "We can be blindnto the obvious" --,so we've got the numbers wrong --,"but we can be blindnto our blindness about it.",And that has enormousnrepercussions for decision making. 
 So at the statistics officenwhile this was all going on,,I thought this was really interesting.,I said, this is clearly a global problem,,but maybe geography is the issue here.,These were questions that were all about,nhow well do you know your country?,So in this case, it's how wellndo you know 64 million people?,Not very well, it turns out.nI can't do that.,So I had an idea,,which was to think aboutnthis same sort of approach,but to think about itnin a very local sense.,Is this a local?,If we reframe the questions and say,,how well do you know your local area,,would your answers be any more accurate? 
 So I devised a quiz:,How well do you know your area?,It's a simple Web app.,You put in a post code,and then it will ask you questionsnbased on census data,for your local area.,And I was very consciousnin designing this.,I wanted to make it opennto the widest possible range of people,,not just the 49 percentnwho can get the numbers.,I wanted everyone to engage with it.,So for the design of the quiz,,I was inspired by the isotypes,of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.,Now, these are methodsnfor representing numbers,using repeating icons.,And the numbers are there,nbut they sit in the background.,So it's a great waynof representing quantity,without resorting to using termsnlike "percentage,","fractions" and "ratios." 
 So here's the quiz.,The layout of the quiz is,,you have your repeating iconsnon the left-hand side there,,and a map showing you the areanwe're asking you questions about,on the right-hand side.,There are seven questions.,Each question, there's a possible answernbetween zero and a hundred,,and at the end of the quiz,,you get an overall scorenbetween zero and a hundred.,And so because this is TEDxExeter,,I thought we would havena quick look at the quiz,for the first few questions of Exeter.,And so the first question is:,For every 100 people,nhow many are aged under 16?,Now, I don't know Exeter very wellnat all, so I had a guess at this,,but it gives you an ideanof how this quiz works.,You drag the slidernto highlight your icons,,and then just click "Submit" to answer,,and we animate away the differencenbetween your answer and reality.,And it turns out, I was a prettynterrible guess: five. 
 How about the next question?,This is asking aboutnwhat the average age is,,so the age at which halfnthe population are younger,and half the population are older.,And I thought 35 -- that soundsnmiddle-aged to me. 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, in Exeter,nit's incredibly young,,and I had underestimated the impactnof the university in this area.,The questions get hardernas you go through.,So this one's now askingnabout homeownership:,For every 100 households, how manynare owned with a mortgage or loan?,And I hedged my bets here,,because I didn't want to benmore than 50 out on the answer. 
 (Laughter) 
 And actually, these get harder,nthese questions,,because when you're in an area,nwhen you're in a community,,things like age -- there are cluesnto whether a population is old or young.,Just by looking aroundnthe area, you can see it.,Something like homeownershipnis much more difficult to see,,so we revert to our own heuristics,,our own biases about how many peoplenwe think own their own homes. 
 Now the truth is,nwhen we published this quiz,,the census data that it's based onnwas already a few years old.,We've had online applicationsnthat allow you to put in a post code,and get statistics back for years.,So in some senses,,this was all a little bit oldnand not necessarily new.,But I was interested to seenwhat reaction we might get,by gamifying the datanin the way that we have,,by using animation,and playing on the factnthat people have their own preconceptions. 
 It turns out, the reaction was, um ...,was more than I could have hoped for.,It was a long-held ambition of minento bring down a statistics website,due to public demand. 
 (Laughter) 
 This URL contains the wordsn"statistics," "gov" and "UK,",which are three of people's leastnfavorite words in a URL.,And the amazing thing about thisnwas that the website came down,at quarter to 10 at night,,because people were actuallynengaging with this data,of their own free will,,using their own personal time.,I was very interested to see,that we got something likena quarter of a million people,playing the quiz within the spacenof 48 hours of launching it.,And it sparked an enormous discussionnonline, on social media,,which was largely dominated,by people having funnwith their misconceptions,,which is something thatnI couldn't have hoped for any better,,in some respects.,I also liked the fact that people startednsending it to politicians.,How well do you know the areanyou claim to represent? 
 (Laughter) 
 And then just to finish,,going back to the two kinds of people,,I thought it would benreally interesting to see,how people who are good with numbersnwould do on this quiz.,The national statisticiannof England and Wales, John Pullinger,,you would expect he would be pretty good.,He got 44 for his own area. 
 (Laughter) 
 Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly,nafter a glass of wine -- 36.,Even worse.,It just shows you that the numbersncan inspire us all.,They can surprise us all. 
 So very often, we talk about statistics,as being the science of uncertainty.,My parting thought for today is:,actually, statistics is the science of us.,And that's why we shouldnbe fascinated by numbers. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'd like you to imagine the world anew.,I'd like to show you some maps,,which have been drawn by Ben Hennig,,of the planet in a way,that most of you will nevernhave seen the planet depicted before. 
 Here's an imagenthat you're very familiar with.,I'm old enough that I was actually bornnbefore we saw this image.,Apparently some of my first wordsnwere "moona, moona,",but I think that's my momnhaving a particular fantasy,about what her baby boy could see,on the flickeringnblack and white TV screen.,It's only been a few centuries,since we've actually, most of us,nthought of our planet as spherical.,When we first sawnthese images in the 1960s,,the world was changingnat an incredible rate.,In my own little disciplinenof human geography,,a cartographer called Waldo Tobler,was drawing new maps of the planet,,and these maps have now spread,,and I'm going to show you one of them now.,This map is a map of the world,,but it's a map which looks to you,a little bit strange.,It's a map in which we stretched places,,so that those areas which containnmany people are drawn larger,,and those areas,nlike the Sahara and the Himalayas,,in which there are few people,nhave been shrunk away.,Everybody on the planetnis given an equal amount of space.,The cities are shown shining bright.,The lines are showing younsubmarine cables and trade routes.,And there's one particular linenthat goes from the Chinese port of Dalian,through past Singapore,,through the Suez Canal,,through the Mediterraneannand round to Rotterdam.,And it's showing you the route,of what was the world'snlargest ship just a year ago,,a ship which was takingnso many containers of goods,that when they were unloaded,,if the lorries had all gone in convoy,nthey would have been 100 kilometers long.,This is how our world is now connected.,This is the quantity of stuffnwe are now moving around the world,,just on one ship, on one voyage,,in five weeks. 
 We've lived in citiesnfor a very long time,,but most of us didn't live in cities.,This is Çatalhöyük,none of the world's first cities.,At its peak 9,000 years ago,,people had to walk over the roofsnof others' houses to get to their home.,If you look carefullynat the map of the city,,you'll see it has no streets,,because streets are something we invented.,The world changes.,It changes by trial and error.,We work out slowly and gradually,how to live in better ways.,And the world has changednincredibly quickly most recently.,It's only within the last six,nseven, or eight generations,that we have actually realizednthat we are a species.,It's only within the last few decades,that a map like this could be drawn.,Again, the underlying mapnis the map of world population,,but over it, you're seeing arrowsnshowing how we spread out of Africa,with dates showing younwhere we think we arrived,at particular times.,I have to redraw this mapnevery few months,,because somebody makes a discoverynthat a particular date was wrong.,We are learning about ourselvesnat an incredible speed.,And we're changing.,A lot of change is gradual.,It's accretion.,We don't notice the change,because we only have short lives,,70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.,This graph is showing you,the annual rate of populationngrowth in the world.,It was very low until around about 1850,,and then the rate of population growth,began to rise,so that around the time I was born,,when we first saw those imagesnfrom the moon of our planet,,our global populationnwas growing at two percent a year.,If it had carried on growingnat two percent a year,for just another couple of centuries,,the entire planet would be covered,with a seething mass of human bodies,all touching each other.,And people were scared.,They were scared of population growth,and what they calledn"the population bomb" in 1968.,But then, if you looknat the end of the graph,,the growth began to slow.,The decade --,the '70s, the '80s,nthe '90s, the noughties,,and in this decade, even faster --,our population growth is slowing.,Our planet is stabilizing.,We are heading towards nine,n10, or 11 billion people,by the end of the century.,Within that change, you can see tumult.,You can see the Second World War.,You can see the pandemicnin 1918 from influenza.,You can see the great Chinese famine.,These are the eventsnwe tend to concentrate on.,We tend to concentratenon the terrible events in the news.,We don't tend to concentratenon the gradual change,and the good news stories. 
 We worry about people.,We worry about how many people there are.,We worry about how you cannget away from people.,But this is the map of the worldnchanged again to make area large,,the further awaynpeople are from each area.,So if you want to knownwhere to go to get away from everybody,,here's the best places to go.,And every year, these areas get bigger,,because every year,nwe are coming off the land globally.,We are moving into the cities.,We are packing in more densely.,There are wolves again in Europe,,and the wolves are moving westnacross the continent.,Our world is changing. 
 You have worries.,This is a map showingnwhere the water falls on our planet.,We now know that.,And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,,where three continents meet,nAfrica, Asia, and Europe,,and you can see there arena large number of people living there,in areas with very little water.,And you can see areas in whichnthere is a great deal of rainfall as well.,And we can get a bit more sophisticated.,Instead of makingnthe map be shaped by people,,we can shape the map by water,,and then we can change it every month,to show the amount of water,falling on every small part of the globe.,And you see the monsoonsnmoving around the planet,,and the planet almost appearsnto have a heartbeat.,And all of this only became possible,within my lifetime,to see this is where we are living.,We have enough water. 
 This is a map of wherenwe grow our food in the world.,This is the areas that we will rely onnmost for rice and maize and corn.,People worry that there won'tnbe enough food, but we know,,if we just ate less meatnand fed less of the crops to animals,,there is enough food for everybody,as long as we think of ourselvesnas one group of people. 
 And we also know,about what we do,so terribly badly nowadays.,You will have seen this mapnof the world before.,This is the map,produced by taking satellite images,,if you remember those satellitesnaround the planet,in the very first slide I showed,,and producing an imagenof what the Earth looks like at night.,When you normally see that map,,on a normal map, the kind of mapnthat most of you will be used to,,you think you are seeingna map of where people live.,Where the lights are shining upnis where people live.,But here, on this image of the world,,remember we've stretched the map again.,Everywhere has the same densitynof people on this map.,If an area doesn't have people,,we've shrunk it away,to make it disappear.,So we're showing everybody,with equal prominence.,Now, the lights no longer show younwhere people are,,because people are everywhere.,Now the lights on the map,,the lights in London,nthe lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,,the lights on the Eastern Seaboardnof the United States,,the lights show you where people live,who are so profligate with energy,that they can afford,to spend money,powering lights to shine up into the sky,,so satellites can draw an image like this.,And the areas that are dark on the map,are either areas where peoplendo not have access to that much energy,,or areas where people do,,but they have learned to stopnshining the light up into the sky.,And if I could show you this mapnanimated over time,,you would see that Tokyonhas actually become darker,,because ever since the tsunami in Japan,,Japan has had to relynon a quarter less electricity,because it turnednthe nuclear power stations off.,And the world didn't end.,You just shone less light,up into the sky. 
 There are a huge number,of good news stories in the world.,Infant mortality is falling,and has been fallingnat an incredible rate.,A few years ago,,the number of babies dyingnin their first year of life in the world,fell by five percent in just one year.,More children are going to school,and learning to read and write,and getting connected to the Internet,and going on to go to university,than ever before at an incredible rate,,and the highest number of young peoplengoing to university in the world,are women, not men.,I can give you good news storynafter good news story,about what is gettingnbetter in the planet,,but we tend to concentrate,on the bad news that is immediate.,Rebecca Solnit, I think,nput it brilliantly,,when she explained: "The accretionnof incremental, imperceptible changes,which can constitute progressnand which render our era,dramatically different from the past" --,the past was much more stable --,"a contrast obscured by the undramaticnnature of gradual transformation,,punctuated by occasional tumult.",Occasionally, terrible things happen.,You are shown those terrible things,on the news every night of the week.,You are not told aboutnthe population slowing down.,You are not told about the worldnbecoming more connected.,You are not told about the incrediblenimprovements in understanding.,You are not told aboutnhow we are learning to begin,to waste less and consume less. 
 This is my last map.,On this map, we have taken the seas,and the oceans out.,Now you are just looking,at about 7.4 billion people,with the map drawnnin proportion to those people.,You're looking at over a billion in China,,and you can see the largestncity in the world in China,,but you do not know its name.,You can see that India,is in the center of this world.,You can see that Europe is on the edge.,And we in Exeter today,are on the far edge of the planet.,We are on a tiny scrap of rock,off Europe,which contains less than one percent,of the world's adults,,and less than half a percent,of the world's children.,We are living in a stabilizing world,nan urbanizing world,,an aging world,,a connecting world.,There are many, many thingsnto be frightened about,,but there is no need for usnto fear each other as much as we do,,and we need to seenthat we are now living in a new world. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)When I was a child,nI knew I had superpowers.,That's right. 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought I was absolutely amazingnbecause I could understand,and relate to the feelingsnof brown people,,like my grandfather,na conservative Muslim guy.,And also, I could understandnmy Afghan mother, my Pakistani father,,not so religiousnbut laid-back, fairly liberal.,And of course, I could understand,and relate to the feelingsnof white people.,The white Norwegians of my country.,You know, white, brown, whatever --,I loved them all.,I understood them all,,even if they didn't alwaysnunderstand each other;,they were all my people. 
 My father, though,nwas always really worried.,He kept saying thatneven with the best education,,I was not going to get a fair shake.,I would still face discrimination,naccording to him.,And that the only waynto be accepted by white people,would be to become famous.,Now, mind you, he had this conversationnwith me when I was seven years old.,So while I'm seven years old, he said,,"Look, so it's either got to be sports,nor it's got to be music.",He didn't know anything about sports --nbless him -- so it was music.,So when I was seven years old,nhe gathered all my toys, all my dolls,,and he threw them all away.,In exchange he gave mena crappy little Casio keyboard and -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. And singing lessons.,And he forced me, basically, to practicenfor hours and hours every single day.,Very quickly, he also had me performingnfor larger and larger audiences,,and bizarrely, I becamenalmost a kind of poster child,for Norwegian multiculturalism.,I felt very proud, of course.,Because even the newspapers at this point,were starting to writennice things about brown people,,so I could feelnthat my superpower was growing. 
 So when I was 12 years old,nwalking home from school,,I took a little detour,because I wanted to buynmy favorite sweets called "salty feet.",I know they sound kind of awful,,but I absolutely love them.,They're basically these littlensalty licorice bits in the shape of feet.,And now that I say it out loud,nI realize how terrible that sounds,,but be that as it may,nI absolutely love them.,So on my way into the store,,there was this grown white guynin the doorway blocking my way.,So I tried to walk around him,nand as I did that, he stopped me,and he was staring at me,,and he spit in my face, and he said,,"Get out of my way,you little black bitch,nyou little Paki bitch,,go back home where you came from.",I was absolutely horrified.,I was staring at him.,I was too afraidnto wipe the spit off my face,,even as it was mixing with my tears.,I remember looking around,nhoping that any minute now,,a grown-up is going to comenand make this guy stop.,But instead, people kept hurrying past menand pretended not to see me.,I was very confusednbecause I was thinking, well,,"My white people, come on!nWhere are they? What's going on?,How come they're notncoming and rescuing me?",So, needless to say,nI didn't buy the sweets.,I just ran home as fast as I could. 
 Things were still OK, though, I thought.,As time went on,nthe more successful I became,,I eventually started alsonattracting harassment from brown people.,Some men in my parent's communitynfelt that it was unacceptable,and dishonorable for a womannto be involved in music,and to be so present in the media.,So very quickly, I was startingnto become attacked at my own concerts.,I remember one of the concerts,nI was onstage, I lean into the audience,and the last thing I seenis a young brown face,,and the next thing I know is some sortnof chemical is thrown in my eyes,and I remember I couldn't really seenand my eyes were watering,but I kept singing anyway.,I was spit in the face in the streetsnof Oslo, this time by brown men.,They even tried to kidnap me at one point.,The death threats were endless.,I remember one older bearded guynstopped me in the street one time,,and he said, "The reasonnI hate you so much,is because you make our daughters think,they can do whatever they want.",A younger guy warned me to watch my back.,He said music is un-Islamicnand the job of whores,,and if you keep this up,nyou are going to be raped,and your stomach will be cut out so thatnanother whore like you will not be born. 
 Again, I was so confused.,I couldn't understand what was going on.,My brown people now startingnto treat me like this -- how come?,Instead of bridging the worlds,nthe two worlds,,I felt like I was fallingnbetween my two worlds.,I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite. 
 So by the time I was 17 years old,,the death threats were endless,nand the harassment was constant.,It got so bad, at one pointnmy mother sat me down and said,,"Look, we can no longer protect you,nwe can no longer keep you safe,,so you're going to have to go.",So I bought a one-way ticket to London,nI packed my suitcase and I left.,My biggest heartbreak at that pointnwas that nobody said anything.,I had a very public exit from Norway.,My brown people, my white people --nnobody said anything.,Nobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong.,Support this girl, protect this girl,nbecause she is one of us.",Nobody said that.,Instead, I felt like --nyou know at the airport,,on the baggage carouselnyou have these different suitcases,going around and around,,and there's alwaysnthat one suitcase left at the end,,the one that nobody wants,nthe one that nobody comes to claim.,I felt like that.,I'd never felt so alone.nI'd never felt so lost. 
 So, after coming to London,nI did eventually resume my music career.,Different place, but unfortunatelynthe same old story.,I remember a message sent to mensaying that I was going to be killed,and that rivers of bloodnwere going to flow,and that I was going to be rapednmany times before I died.,By this point, I have to say,,I was actually getting usednto messages like this,,but what became different was thatnnow they started threatening my family. 
 So once again, I packed my suitcase,nI left music and I moved to the US.,I'd had enough.,I didn't want to have anythingnto do with this anymore.,And I was certainly notngoing to be killed for something,that wasn't even my dream --nit was my father's choice. 
 So I kind of got lost.,I kind of fell apart.,But I decided that what I wanted to do,is spend the nextnhowever many years of my life,supporting young people,and to try to be there in some small way,,whatever way that I could.,I started volunteeringnfor various organizations,that were workingnwith young Muslims inside of Europe.,And, to my surprise, what I found was,so many of these young peoplenwere suffering and struggling.,They were facing so many problemsnwith their families and their communities,who seemed to care morenabout their honor and their reputation,than the happinessnand the lives of their own kids.,I started feeling like maybe I wasn'tnso alone, maybe I wasn't so weird.,Maybe there are morenof my people out there. 
 The thing is, what most peoplendon't understand,is that there are so many of usngrowing up in Europe,who are not free to be ourselves.,We're not allowed to be who we are.,We are not free to marry,or to be in relationshipsnwith people that we choose.,We can't even pick our own career.,This is the norm in the Muslimnheartlands of Europe.,Even in the freest societiesnin the world, we're not free.,Our lives, our dreams, our futurendoes not belong to us,,it belongs to our parentsnand their community.,I found endless stories of young people,who are lost to all of us,,who are invisible to all of us,but who are suffering,nand they are suffering alone.,Kids we are losing to forced marriages,nto honor-based violence and abuse. 
 Eventually, I realized after severalnyears of working with these young people,,that I will not be able to keep running.,I can't spend the rest of my lifenbeing scared and hiding,and that I'm actuallyngoing to have to do something.,And I also realizednthat my silence, our silence,,allows abuse like this to continue.,So I decided that I wanted to putnmy childhood superpower to some use,by trying to make people on the differentnsides of these issues understand,what it's like to be a young person stucknbetween your family and your country. 
 So I started making films,nand I started telling these stories.,And I also wanted people to understandnthe deadly consequences of us,not taking these problems seriously. 
 So the first film I made was about Banaz.,She was a 17-year-oldnKurdish girl in London.,She was obedient, she didnwhatever her parents wanted.,She tried to do everything right.,She married some guynthat her parents chose for her,,even though he beatnand raped her constantly.,And when she tried to gonto her family for help, they said,,"Well, you got to go backnand be a better wife.",Because they didn't wantna divorced daughter on their hands,because, of course, that wouldnbring dishonor on the family.,She was beaten so badlynher ears would bleed,,and when she finally leftnand she found a young man that she chose,and she fell in love with,,the community and the family found out,and she disappeared.,She was found three months later.,She'd been stuffed into a suitcasenand buried underneath the house.,She had been strangled,nshe had been beaten to death,by three men, three cousins,non the orders of her father and uncle.,The added tragedy of Banaz's story,is that she had gone to the policenin England five times asking for help,,telling them that she wasngoing to be killed by her family.,The police didn't believe hernso they didn't do anything. 
 And the problem with this,is that not only are so many of our kidsnfacing these problems,within their familiesnand within their families' communities,,but they're also meeting misunderstandings,and apathy in the countriesnthat they grow up in.,When their own families betray them,nthey look to the rest of us,,and when we don't understand,,we lose them. 
 So while I was making this film,nseveral people said to me,,"Well, Deeyah, you know,nthis is just their culture,,this is just what those peoplendo to their kids,and we can't really interfere.",I can assure younbeing murdered is not my culture.,You know?,And surely people who look like me,,young women who comenfrom backgrounds like me,,should be subject to the same rights,nthe same protections,as anybody else in our country, why not? 
 So, for my next film,nI wanted to try and understand,why some of our youngnMuslim kids in Europe,are drawn to extremism and violence.,But with that topic,,I also recognized that I was goingnto have to face my worst fear:,the brown men with beards.,The same men, or similar men,,to the ones that have hounded menfor most of my life.,Men that I've been afraid ofnmost of my life.,Men that I've also deeply disliked,,for many, many years. 
 So I spent the next two yearsninterviewing convicted terrorists,,jihadis and former extremists.,What I already knew,nwhat was very obvious already,,was that religion, politics,nEurope's colonial baggage,,also Western foreign policynfailures of recent years,,were all a part of the picture.,But what I was more interestednin finding out was what are the human,,what are the personal reasons,why some of our young peoplenare susceptible to groups like this.,And what really surprised menwas that I found wounded human beings.,Instead of the monstersnthat I was looking for,,that I was hoping to find --,quite frankly becausenit would have been very satisfying --,I found broken people.,Just like Banaz,,I found that these young mennwere torn apart,from trying to bridge the gaps,between their familiesnand the countries that they were born in.,And what I also learnednis that extremist groups, terrorist groups,are taking advantagenof these feelings of our young people,and channeling that -- cynically --nchanneling that toward violence.,"Come to us," they say.,"Reject both sides,nyour family and your country,because they reject you.,For your family, their honornis more important than you,and for your country,,a real Norwegian, Brit or a French personnwill always be white and never you.",They're also promising our young peoplenthe things that they crave:,significance, heroism,na sense of belonging and purpose,,a community that loves and accepts them.,They make the powerless feel powerful.,The invisible and the silentnare finally seen and heard.,This is what they're doingnfor our young people.,Why are these groups doing thisnfor our young people and not us? 
 The thing is,,I'm not trying to justify,or excuse any of the violence.,What I am trying to saynis that we have to understand,why some of our young peoplenare attracted to this.,I would like to also show you, actually --,these are childhood photosnof some of the guys in the film.,What really struck menis that so many of them --,I never would have thought this --,but so many of themnhave absent or abusive fathers.,And several of these young guys,ended up finding caringnand compassionate father figures,within these extremist groups.,I also found mennbrutalized by racist violence,,but who found a waynto stop feeling like victims,by becoming violent themselves.,In fact, I found something,nto my horror, that I recognized.,I found the same feelings that I feltnas a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway.,The same confusion, the same sorrow,,the same feeling of being betrayed,and not belonging to anyone.,The same feeling of being lostnand torn between cultures. 
 Having said that,nI did not choose destruction,,I chose to pick up a cameraninstead of a gun.,And the reason I did thatnis because of my superpower.,I could see that understandingnis the answer, instead of violence.,Seeing human beings,with all their virtues and all their flaws,instead of continuing the caricatures:,the us and them, the villains and victims.,I'd also finallyncome to terms with the fact,that my two culturesndidn't have to be on a collision course,but instead became a spacenwhere I found my own voice.,I stopped feelingnlike I had to pick a side,,but this took me many, many years.,There are so manynof our young people today,who are struggling with these same issues,,and they're struggling with this alone.,And this leaves them open like wounds.,And for some, the worldviewnof radical Islam,becomes the infectionnthat festers in these open wounds. 
 There's an African proverb that says,,"If the young are notninitiated into the village,,they will burn it downnjust to feel its warmth.",I would like to ask --,to Muslim parents and Muslim communities,,will you love and care for your children,without forcing themnto meet your expectations?,Can you choose them instead of your honor?,Can you understandnwhy they're so angry and alienated,when you put your honornbefore their happiness?,Can you try to be a friend to your child,so that they can trust you,and want to share with yountheir experiences,,rather than havingnto seek it somewhere else? 
 And to our young peoplentempted by extremism,,can you acknowledgenthat your rage is fueled by pain?,Will you find the strengthnto resist those cynical old men,who want to use your bloodnfor their own profits?,Can you find a way to live?,Can you see that the sweetest revenge,is for you to livena happy, full and free life?,A life defined by you and nobody else.,Why do you want to becomenjust another dead Muslim kid?,And for the rest of us, when will we startnlistening to our young people?,How can we support them,in redirecting their painninto something more constructive?,They think we don't like them.,They think we don't carenwhat happens to them.,They think we don't accept them.,Can we find a waynto make them feel differently?,What will it take for usnto see them and notice them,before they become either the victimsnor the perpetrators of violence?,Can we make ourselves care about themnand consider them to be our own?,And not just be outraged when the victimsnof violence look like ourselves?,Can we find a way to reject hatrednand heal the divisions between us?,The thing is we cannot affordnto give up on each other or on our kids,,even if they've given up on us. 
 We are all in this together.,And in the long term, revenge and violencenwill not work against extremists.,Terrorists want usnto huddle in our houses in fear,,closing our doors and our hearts.,They want us to tear opennmore wounds in our societies,so that they can use themnto spread their infection more widely.,They want us to become like them:,intolerant, hateful and cruel. 
 The day after the Paris attacks,,a friend of minensent this photo of her daughter.,This is a white girl and an Arab girl.,They're best friends.,This image is the kryptonitenfor extremists.,These two little girlsnwith their superpowers,are showing the way forward,towards a societynthat we need to build together,,a society that includes and supports,,rather than rejects our kids. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 (Applause)Today I stand before younas a man who lives life to the full,in the here and now.,But for a long time,,I lived for death. 
 I was a young man who believed,that jihad is to be understoodnin the language of force and violence.,I tried to right wrongsnthrough power and aggression.,I had deep concernsnfor the suffering of others,and a strong desirento help and bring relief to them.,I thought violent jihad was noble,,chivalrous,and the best way to help. 
 At a time when so many of our people --,young people especially --,are at risk of radicalization,through groups like al-Qaeda,,Islamic State and others,,when these groups are claiming,that their horrific brutalitynand violence are true jihad,,I want to say that their ideanof jihad is wrong --,completely wrong --,as was mine, then. 
 Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.,It includes exertion and spirituality,,self-purification,and devotion.,It refers to positive transformation,through learning, wisdomnand remembrance of God.,The word jihad standsnfor all those meanings as a whole.,Jihad may at timesntake the form of fighting,,but only sometimes,,under strict conditions,,within rules and limits. 
 In Islam,,the benefit of an act must outweighnthe harm or hardship it entails.,More importantly,,the verses in the Korannthat are connected to jihad or fighting,do not cancel out the versesnthat talk about forgiveness,,benevolence,or patience. 
 But now I believe that there arenno circumstances on earth,where violent jihad is permissible,,because it will lead to greater harm.,But now the idea of jihadnhas been hijacked.,It has been pervertednto mean violent struggle,wherever Muslimsnare undergoing difficulties,,and turned into terrorism,by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda,,Islamic State and others.,But I have come to understand,that true jihadnmeans striving to the utmost,to strengthen and liventhose qualities which God loves:,honesty, trustworthiness,,compassion, benevolence,,reliability, respect,,truthfulness --,human values that so many of us share. 
 I was born in Bangladesh,,but grew up mostly in England.,And I went to school here.,My father was an academic,,and we were in the UK through his work. 
 In 1971 we were in Bangladeshnwhen everything changed.,The War of Independencenimpacted upon us terribly,,pitting family against family,,neighbor against neighbor.,And at the age of 12 I experienced war,,destitution in my family,,the deaths of 22nof my relatives in horrible ways,,as well as the murder of my elder brother.,I witnessed killing ...,animals feeding on corpses in the streets,,starvation all around me,,wanton, horrific violence --,senseless violence.,I was a young man,,teenager, fascinated by ideas.,I wanted to learn,,but I could not go to schoolnfor four years. 
 After the War of Independence,,my father was put in prisonnfor two and a half years,,and I used to visit himnevery week in prison,,and homeschooled myself.,My father was released in 1973,and he fled to England as a refugee,,and we soon followed him.,I was 17. 
 So these experiences gave me,a sharp awareness of the atrocitiesnand injustices in the world.,And I had a strong desire --,a very keen, deep desire --,to right wrongs,and help the victims of oppression. 
 While studying at college in the UK,,I met others who showed menhow I could channel that desire,and help through my religion.,And I was radicalized --,enough to consider violence correct,,even a virtue under certain circumstances. 
 So I became involvednin the jihad in Afghanistan.,I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghannpopulation against the Soviet army.,And I thought that was jihad:,my sacred duty,,which would be rewarded by God. 
 I became a preacher.,I was one of the pioneersnof violent jihad in the UK.,I recruited,,I raised funds, I trained.,I confused true jihad,with this perversionnas presented by the fascist Islamists --,these people who use the idea of jihad,to justify their lust for power,nauthority and control on earth:,a perversion perpetuated todaynby fascist Islamist groups,like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others. 
 For a period of around 15 years,,I fought for short periods of time,in Kashmir and Burma,,besides Afghanistan.,Our aim was to remove the invaders,,to bring relief to the oppressed victims,and of course to establishnan Islamic state,,a caliphate for God's rule.,And I did this openly.,I didn't break any laws.,I was proud and grateful to be British --,I still am.,And I bore no hostilitynagainst this, my country,,nor enmity towardsnthe non-Muslim citizens,,and I still don't. 
 During one battle in Afghanistan,,some British men and Informed a special bond,with a 15-year-old Afghani boy,,Abdullah,,an innocent, loving and lovable kid,who was always eager to please.,He was poor.,And boys like himndid menial tasks in the camp.,And he seemed happy enough,,but I couldn't help wonder --,his parents must have missed him dearly.,And they must have dreamtnabout a better future for him.,A victim of circumstancencaught up in a war,,cruelly thrust upon him,by the cruel circumstances of the time. 
 One day I picked up this unexplodednmortar shell in a trench,,and I had it depositednin a makeshift mud hut lab.,And I went out on a short,npointless skirmish --,always pointless,,And I came back a few hours laternto discover he was dead.,He had tried to recovernexplosives from that shell.,It exploded, and he died a violent death,,blown to bits by the very same devicenthat had proved harmless to me.,So I started to question.,How did his death serve any purpose?,Why did he die and I lived? 
 I carried on.,I fought in Kashmir.,I also recruited for the Philippines,,Bosnia and Chechnya.,And the questions grew. 
 Later in Burma,,I came across Rohingya fighters,,who were barely teenagers,,born and brought up in the jungle,,carrying machine gunsnand grenade launchers.,I met two 13-year-oldsnwith soft manners and gentle voices.,Looking at me,,they begged mento take them away to England.,They simply wanted to go to school --,that was their dream.,My family --,my children of the same age --,were living at home in the UK,,going to school,,living a safe life.,And I couldn't help wonder,how much these young boysnmust have spoken to one another,about their dreams for such a life.,Victims of circumstances:,these two young boys,,sleeping rough on the ground,nlooking up at the stars,,cynically exploited by their leaders,for their personal lustnfor glory and power. 
 I soon witnessed boys like themnkilling one another,in conflicts between rival groups.,And it was the same everywhere ...,Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,,Philippines, Chechnya;,petty warlords got the youngnand vulnerable to kill one another,in the name of jihad.,Muslims against Muslims.,Not protecting anyonenagainst invaders or occupiers;,not bringing relief to the oppressed.,Children being used,,cynically exploited;,people dying in conflicts,which I was supportingnin the name of jihad.,And it still carries on today. 
 Realizing that the violent jihad,I had engaged in abroad,was so different --,such a chasm betweennwhat I had experienced,and what I thought was sacred duty --,I had to reflectnon my activities here in the UK.,I had to consider my preaching,,recruiting, fund-raising,,training,,but most importantly, radicalizing --,sending young people to fight and die,as I was doing --,all totally wrong. 
 So I got involvednin violent jihad in the mid '80s,,starting with Afghanistan.,And by the time I finishednit was in the year 2000.,I was completely immersed in it.,All around me people supported,,applauded,,even celebrated whatnwe were doing in their name.,But by the time I learned to get out,,completely disillusioned in the year 2000,,15 years had passed. 
 So what goes wrong?,We were so busy talking about virtue,,and we were blinded by a cause.,And we did not give ourselves a chancento develop a virtuous character.,We told ourselvesnwe were fighting for the oppressed,,but these were unwinnable wars.,We became the very instrumentnthrough which more deaths occurred,,complicit in causing further misery,for the selfish benefit of the cruel few. 
 So over time,,a very long time,,I opened my eyes.,I began to dare,to face the truth,,to think,,to face the hard questions.,I got in touch with my soul. 
 What have I learned?,That people who engagenin violent jihadism,,that people who are drawnnto these types of extremisms,,are not that different to everyone else.,But I believe such people can change.,They can regain their heartsnand restore them,by filling themnwith human values that heal. 
 When we ignore the realities,,we discover that we accept whatnwe are told without critical reflection.,And we ignore the gifts and advantagesnthat many of us would cherish,even for a single moment in their lives.,I engaged in actionsnI thought were correct.,But now I began to questionnhow I knew what I knew.,I endlessly told othersnto accept the truth,,but I failed to give doubtnits rightful place. 
 This conviction that people can changenis rooted in my experience,,my own journey.,Through wide reading,,reflecting,,contemplation, self-knowledge,,I discovered,,I realized that Islamists' worldnof us and them is false and unjust.,Through considering the uncertaintiesnin all that we had asserted,,to the inviolable truths,,incontestable truths,,I developed a more nuanced understanding. 
 I realized that in a world crowdednwith variation and contradiction,,foolish preachers,,only foolish preachersnlike I used to be,,see no paradox in the myths and fictionsnthey use to assert authenticity.,So I understood the vitalnimportance of self-knowledge,,political awareness,and the necessitynfor a deep and wide understanding,of our commitments and our actions,,how they affect others. 
 So my plea today to everyone,,especially those who sincerelynbelieve in Islamist jihadism ...,refuse dogmatic authority;,let go of anger, hatred and violence;,learn to right wrongs,without even attempting to justifyncruel, unjust and futile behavior.,Instead create a fewnbeautiful and useful things,that outlive us.,Approach the world, life,,with love.,Learn to develop,or cultivate your hearts,to see goodness, beauty and truthnin others and in the world.,That way we do matternmore to ourselves ...,to each other,,to our communities,and, for me, to God.,This is jihad --,my true jihad. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Whenever I get to travel for work,,I try to find out where myndrinking water comes from,,and where my poop and pee go. 
 (Laughter) 
 This has earned me the nicknamen"The Poo Princess" in my family,,and it's ruined many family vacations,nbecause this is not normal.,But thinking about where it all goesnis the first step in activating,what are actually superpowersnin our poop and pee. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah.,And if we use them well,,we can live healthiernand more beautifully. 
 Check out this landscapenin Santa Fe, New Mexico.,Just notice what kinds of wordsnand feelings come to mind.,This landscape was waterednwith treated sewage water.,Does that change anything for you?,I imagine it might.,And that's OK.,How we feel about this,is going to determine exactlynhow innovative we can be. 
 And I want to explain how it works,,but what words do I use?,I mean, I can use profane wordsnlike "shit" and "piss,",and then my grandma won't watch the video.,Or I can use childish wordsnlike "poo" and "pee." Eh.,Or I can use scientific wordsnlike "excrement" and "feces." Humph.,I'll use a mix. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's all I got. (Laughs) 
 So, in this suburb,,the poo and the pee and the wash waternare going to this treatment plant,right in the middle of the community.,It looks more like a parknthan a treatment plant.,The poo at the very bottomnof all those layers of gravel --,not touching anyone --,is providing solid foodnfor those marsh plants.,And the clean, clear waternthat comes out the other end,is traveling undergroundnto water each person's yard.,So even though they're in a desert,,they get their own personal oasis. 
 This approach is callednIntegrated Water Management,,or holistic or closed-loop.,Whatever you want to call it,,it's in conflict with the status quonof how we think about sanitation,,which is contain, treat, push it away.,But in this approach,nwe're doing one step better.,We're designing for reusenfrom the very beginning,,because everything does get reused,,only now we're planning for it.,And often, that makes fornreally beautiful spaces.,But the most important thingnabout this system,isn't the technicals of how it works.,It's how you feel about it.,Do you want this in your yard?,Why not? 
 I got really curious about this question.,Why don't we see moreninnovation in sanitation?,Why isn't that kind of thingnthe new normal?,And I care so much about this question,,that I work for a nonprofit called Recode.,We want to accelerate adoption,of sustainable buildingnand development practices.,We want more innovation.,But a lot of times,nwhole categories of innovation --,ones that can help usnlive more beautifully --,turn out to be illegal.,Today's regulations and codesnwere written under the assumption,that best practicesnwould remain best practices,,with incremental updates forever and ever.,But innovation isn't always incremental.,It turns out, how we feelnabout any particular new technique,gets into everything we do:,how we talk about it,,how we encourage people to study,,our jokes, our codes ...,And it ultimately determinesnhow innovative we can be. 
 So, that's the first reasonnwe don't innovate in sanitation.,We're kind of uncomfortablentalking about sanitation,,that's why I've gotten calledn"The Poo Princess" so much.,The second reason is:,we think the problem is solvednhere in the US.,But not so.,Here in the US we still get sicknfrom drinking shit in our sewage water.,Seven million people get sick every year,,900 die annually.,And we're not taking a holisticnapproach to making it better.,So we're not solving it. 
 Where I live in Portland, Oregon,,I can't take Echo for a swimnduring the rainy season,,because we dump raw sewagensometimes into our river.,Our rainwater and our sewagengo to the same treatment plant.,Too much rain overflows into the river.,And Portland is not alone here.,Forty percent of municipalities self-report,dumping raw or partially treatednsewage into our waterways. 
 The other bummer going on herenwith our status quo,is that half of all of your poop and peenis going to fertilize farmland.,The other half is being incinerated,or land-filled.,And that's a bummer to me,,because there are amazing nutrientsnin your daily doody.,It is comparable to pig manure;,we're omnivores, they're omnivores.,Think of your poo and peenas a health smoothie for a tree. 
 (Laughter) 
 The other bummer going on here,is that we're quickly movingnall the drugs we take into our waterways.,The average wastewater treatment plantncan remove maybe half of the drugs,that come in.,The other half goesnright out the other side.,Consider what a cocktailnof pharmaceuticals --,hormones, steroids, Vicodin --,does to a fish,,to a dog,,to a child. 
 But this isn't just some problemnthat we need to contain.,If we flip this around,nwe can create a resource,that can solve so manynof our other problems.,And I want to get youncomfortable with this idea,,so imagine the things I'm goingnto show you, these technologies,,and this attitude that says,,"We're going to reuse this.,Let's design to make it beautiful" --,as advanced potty training. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think you're ready for it.,I think we as a culture are readynfor advanced potty training.,And there are three greatnreasons to enroll today.,Number one:,we can fertilize our food.,Each one of us is poopingnand peeing something,that could fertilize halfnor maybe all of our food,,depending on our diet.,That dark brown poo in the toiletnis dark brown because of what?,Dead stuff, bacteria.,That's carbon.,And carbon, if we're gettingnthat into the soil,,is going to bind to the other mineralsnand nutrients in there.,Boom! Healthier food.,Voilà! Healthier people.,Chemical fertilizers by definitionndon't have carbon in them.,Imagine if we could move our animal manurenand our human manure to our soil,,we might not need to relynon fossil fuel-based fertilizers,,mine minerals from far away.,Imagine how much energy we could save. 
 Now, some of us are concerned,about industrial pollutantsncontaminating this reuse cycle.,That can be addressed.,But we need to separate our discomfortnabout talking about poo and pee,so we can calmly talknabout how we want to reuse it,and what things we don't want to reuse.,And get this:,if we change our approach to sanitation,,we can start to slow down climate change.,Remember that carbon in the poop?,If we can get that into our soil bank,,it's going to start to absorbncarbon dioxide that we put into the air.,And that could helpnslow down global warming. 
 I want to show you some brave souls,who've had the courage to embracenthis advanced potty training approach.,So those folks in New Mexico --,why did they do it?,'Cause they're in a desert?n'Cause they save money? Yeah.,But more importantly,nthey felt comfortable,seeing what was goingndown the toilet as a resource. 
 Here's an average housenin Portland, Oregon.,This house is specialnbecause they have a composting toilet,turning all their poo and pee,nover time, into a soil amendment.,Their wash water, their shower water,nis going underground,to a series of mulch basins,,and then watering that orchard downhill.,When they went to get this permitted,,it wasn't allowed in Oregon.,But it was allowednin five other states nearby.,That was Recode's -- my organization's --nfirst code-change campaign. 
 Here's a great example wherenthe Integrated Water Management approach,was the cheapest.,This is three high-rise residentialnbuildings in downtown Portland,,and they're not flushingnto the sewer system.,How?,Well, their wash waternis getting reused to flush toilets,,cool mechanical systems,,water the landscape.,And then once the buildingnhas thoroughly used everything --,aka, shat in it --,it's treated to highest standardnright on-site by plants and bacteria,,and then infiltratedninto the groundwater right below.,And all that was cheaper,than updating the surroundingnsewer infrastructure. 
 So that's the last reasonnwe should get really excited,about doing things differently:,we can save a lot of money.,This was the first permitnof its kind in Oregon.,Brave and open-minded peoplensat down and felt comfortable saying,,"Yeah, that shit makes sense." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Let's do it." 
 (Applause) 
 You know? 
 I keep showing examples,where everyone's reusingneverything on-site.,Why?,Well, when we look at our agingninfrastructure -- and it is old --,and we look at the cost of updating it,,three-quarters of that cost is justnthe pipes snaking through our city.,So as we build anew, as we renovate,,it might make more sensento treat and reuse everything on-site. 
 San Francisco realized that it made sense,to invest in rebates for every household,to reuse their wash waternand their rainwater,to water the backyard,,because the amount of water they wouldnsave as a community would be so big.,But why were allnthese projects so innovative?,The money piece, yeah.,But more importantly,,they felt comfortable with this ideanof advanced potty training. 
 Imagine if we embracedninnovation for sanitation,the way we have for, say, solar power.,Think about it -- solar power usednto be uncommon and unaffordable.,Now it's more a partnof our web of power than ever before.,And it's creating resiliency.,We now have sources of power like the sun,that don't vary with our earthly dramas.,What's driving all that innovation?,It's us.,We're talking about energy.,It's cool to talk about energy.,Some folks are even talkingnabout the problems,with the limited resourcesnwhere our current energy is coming from.,We encourage our best and brightestnto work on this issue --,better solar panels,nbetter batteries, everything. 
 So let's talk about wherenour drinking water is coming from,,where our poo and pee are actually going.,If we can get over this discomfortnwith this entire topic,,we could create somethingnthat creates our future goldmine.,Every time you flush the toilet,,I want you to think,,"Where is my poop and pee going?,Will they be gainfully employed?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Or are they going to be wreakingnhavoc in some waterway?" 
 If you don't know, find out.,And if you don't like the answer,,figure out how you can communicatento those who can drive this change,that you have advanced potty training,nthat you are ready for reuse.,How all of you feel,is going to determine exactlynhow innovative we can be. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)"We're declaring war against cancer,,and we will win this war by 2015." 
 This is what the US Congressnand the National Cancer Institute declared,just a few years ago, in 2003.,Now, I don't know about you,nbut I don't buy that.,I don't think we quite won this war yet,,and I don't thinknanyone here will question that.,Now, I will argue that a primary reason,why we're not winningnthis war against cancer,is because we're fighting blindly. 
 I'm going to start by sharing with youna story about a good friend of mine.,His name is Ehud,,and a few years ago,nEhud was diagnosed with brain cancer.,And not just any type of brain cancer:,he was diagnosed with onenof the most deadly forms of brain cancer.,In fact, it was so deadly,that the doctors told himnthat they only have 12 months,,and during those 12 months,nthey have to find a treatment.,They have to find a cure,,and if they cannotnfind a cure, he will die. 
 Now, the good news, they said,,is that there are tonsnof different treatments to choose from,,but the bad news is,that in order for them to tellnif a treatment is even working or not,,well, that takes themnabout three months or so.,So they cannot try that many things. 
 Well, Ehud is now goingninto his first treatment,,and during that first treatment,njust a few days into that treatment,,I'm meeting with him, and he tells me,n"Adam, I think this is working.,I think we really lucked out here.nSomething is happening." 
 And I ask him, "Really?nHow do you know that, Ehud?" 
 And he says, "Well,nI feel so terrible inside.,Something's gotta be working up there.,It just has to." 
 Well, unfortunately, three months later,nwe got the news, it didn't work.,And so Ehud goesninto his second treatment.,And again, the same story.,"It feels so bad, something'sngotta be working there.",And then three months later,nagain we get bad news.,Ehud is going into his third treatment,nand then his fourth treatment.,And then, as predicted, Ehud dies. 
 Now, when someone really close to younis going through such a huge struggle,,you get really swamped with emotions.,A lot of thingsnare going through your head.,For me, it was mostly outrage.,I was just outraged that, how comenthis is the best that we can offer?,And I started lookingnmore and more into this.,As it turns out, this is not justnthe best that doctors could offer Ehud.,It's not just the best doctors could offernpatients with brain cancer generally.,We're actually not doing that wellnall across the board with cancer. 
 I picked up one of those statistics,,and I'm sure some of younhave seen those statistics before.,This is going to show you herenhow many patients actually died of cancer,,in this case females in the United States,,ever since the 1930s.,You'll notice that there aren'tnthat many things that have changed.,It's still a huge issue.,You'll see a few changes, though.,You'll see lung cancer,nfor example, on the rise.,Thank you, cigarettes.,And you'll also see that,nfor example, stomach cancer,once used to be onenof the biggest killers of all cancers,,is essentially eliminated.,Now, why is that?nAnyone knows, by the way?,Why is it that humanity is no longernstruck by stomach cancer?,What was the huge, hugenmedical technology breakthrough,that came to our worldnthat saved humanity from stomach cancer?,Was it maybe a new drug,nor a better diagnostic?,You guys are right, yeah.,It's the invention of the refrigerator,,and the fact that we'renno longer eating spoiled meats.,So the best thingnthat happened to us so far,in the medical arena in cancer research,is the fact thatnthe refrigerator was invented. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so -- yeah, I know.,We're not doing so well here.,I don't want to miniaturize the progress,and everything that's been donenin cancer research.,Look, there is like 50-plus yearsnof good cancer research,that discovered major, major thingsnthat taught us about cancer.,But all that said,,we have a lot of heavy liftingnto still do ahead of us. 
 Again, I will argue that the primarynreason why this is the case,,why we have not done that remarkably well,,is really we're fighting blindly here.,And this is wherenmedical imaging comes in.,This is where my own work comes in. 
 And so to give you a sensenof the best medical imaging,that's offered todaynto brain cancer patients,,or actually generallynto all cancer patients,,take a look at this PET scan right here.,Let's see. There we go. 
 So this is a PET/CT scan,,and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan,is the CT scan will show younwhere the bones are,,and the PET scan will show younwhere tumors are.,Now, what you can see here,is essentially a sugar molecule,that was added a small little tag,that is signaling to usnoutside of the body,,"Hey, I'm here.",And those sugar molecules are injectedninto these patients by the billions,,and they're going all over the body,looking for cellsnthat are hungry for sugar.,You'll see that the heart,nfor example, lights up there.,That's because the heartnneeds a lot of sugar.,You'll also see that the bladdernlights up there.,That's because the bladdernis the thing that's clearing,the sugar away from our body.,And then you'll see a few other hot spots,,and these are in fact the tumors. 
 Now, this is a reallyna wonderful technology.,For the first time it allowed usnto look into someone's body,without picking upneach and every one of the cells,and putting them under the microscope,,but in a noninvasive waynallowing us to look into someone's body,and ask, "Hey,nhas the cancer metastasized?,Where is it?",And the PET scans herenare showing you very clearly,where are these hot spots,nwhere is the tumor. 
 So as miraculous as this might seem,,unfortunately, well, it's not that great.,You see, thosensmall little hot spots there.,Can anyone guess how many cancer cellsnare in any one of these tumors?,So it's about 100 million cancer cells,,and let me make surenthat this number sunk in.,In each and every onenof these small little blips,that you're seeing on the image,,there needs to benat least 100 million cancer cells,in order for it to be detected.,Now, if that seemed to younlike a very large number,,it is a very large number.,This is in factnan incredibly large number,,because what we really neednin order to pick up something early enough,to do something about it,nto do something meaningful about it,,well, we need to pick up tumorsnthat are a thousand cells in size,,and ideally justna handful of cells in size.,So we're clearlynpretty far away from this. 
 So we're going to playna little experiment here.,I'm going to ask each of younto now play and imagine,that you are brain surgeons.,And you guys are now at an operating room,,and there's a patient in front of you,,and your task is to make surenthat the tumor is out.,So you're looking down at the patient,,the skin and the skullnhave already been removed,,so you're looking at the brain.,And all you know about this patient,is that there's a tumornabout the size of a golf ball or so,in the right frontal lobenof this person's brain.,And that's more or less it.,So you're looking down, and unfortunatelyneverything looks the same,,because brain cancer tissuenand healthy brain tissue,really just look the same.,And so you're going in with your thumb,,and you start to pressna little bit on the brain,,because tumors tend to bena little harder, stiffer,,and so you go in and gona little bit like this and say,,"It seems like the tumor is right there.",Then you take out your knifenand start cutting the tumor,piece by piece by piece.,And as you're taking the tumor out,,then you're gettingnto a stage where you think,,"Alright, I'm done.nI took out everything.",And at this stage, if that's --,so far everything sounded,nlike, pretty crazy --,you're now about to face the mostnchallenging decision of your life here.,Because now you need to decide,,should I stop herenand let this patient go,,risking that there might bensome leftover cancer cells behind,that I just couldn't see,,or should I take away some extra margins,,typically about an inch or sonaround the tumor,just to be sure that I removed everything? 
 So this is not a simple decision to make,,and unfortunately this is the decision,that brain cancer surgeonsnhave to take every single day,as they're seeing their patients. 
 And so I remember talkingnto a few friends of mine in the lab,,and we say, "Boy,nthere's got to be a better way.",But not just like you tell a friendnthat there's got to be a better way.,There's just got to be a better way here.,This is just incredible. 
 And so we looked back.,Remember those PET scans I told you about,nthe sugar and so on.,We said, hey, how aboutninstead of using sugar molecules,,let's maybe take tiny, tinynlittle particles made of gold,,and let's program them with someninteresting chemistry around them.,Let's program themnto look for cancer cells.,And then we will injectnthese gold particles,into these patients by the billions again,,and we'll have them go all over the body,,and just like secret agents, if you will,,go and walk bynevery single cell in our body,and knock on the door of that cell,,and ask, "Are you a cancer cellnor are you a healthy cell?,If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.,If you're a cancer cell,nwe're sticking in and shining out,and telling us,n"Hey, look at me, I'm here.",And they'll do itnthrough some interesting cameras,that we developed in the lab.,And once we see that,nmaybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons,towards taking only the tumornand leaving the healthy brain alone.,And so we've tested that,nand boy, this works well. 
 So I'm going to show you an example now.,What you're looking at here,is an image of a mouse's brain,,and we've implantedninto this mouse's brain,a small little tumor.,And so this tumor is nowngrowing in this mouse's brain,,and then we've taken a doctornand asked the doctor,to please operate on the mousenas if that was a patient,,and take out piece by piecenout of the tumor.,And while he's doing that,,we're going to take imagesnto see where the gold particles are.,And so we're going to first start,by injecting these gold particlesninto this mouse,,and we're going to seenright here at the very left there,that image at the bottom,is the image that showsnwhere the gold particles are.,The nice thingnis that these gold particles,actually made it all the way to the tumor,,and then they shine out and tell us,n"Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor." 
 So now we can see the tumor,,but we're not showing thisnto the doctor yet.,We're asking the doctor,nnow please start cutting away the tumor,,and you'll see here the doctornjust took the first quadrant of the tumor,and you see that first quadrantnis now missing.,The doctor then tooknthe second quadrant, the third,,and now it appears to be everything.,And so at this stage,nthe doctor came back to us and said,,"Alright, I'm done.nWhat do you want me to do?,Should I keep things as they are,or do you want me to takensome extra margins around?" 
 And then we said, "Well, hang on.",We told the doctor,n"You've missed those two spots,,so rather than taking huge margins around,,only take out those tiny little areas.,Take them out,nand then let's take a look." 
 And so the doctor took them away,nand lo and behold,,the cancer is now completely gone.,Now, the important thing,is that it's not justnthat the cancer is completely gone,from this person's brain,,or from this mouse's brain.,The most important thing,is that we did not have to takenhuge amounts of healthy brain,in the process.,And so now we can actually imagine a world,where doctors and surgeons,nas they take away a tumor,,they actually know what to take out,,and they no longernhave to guess with their thumb. 
 Now, here's why it's extremely importantnto take those tiny little leftover tumors.,Those leftover tumors,neven if it's just a handful of cells,,they will grow to recur the tumor,,for the tumor to come back.,In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent,of those brain cancer surgeriesnultimately fail,is because of those small littlenextra margins that were left positive,,those small little leftover tumorsnthat were left there. 
 So this is clearly very nice,,but what I really want to share with younis where I think we're heading from here.,And so in my lab at Stanford,,my students and I are asking,nwhat should we be working on now?,And I think wherenmedical imaging is heading to,is the ability to look into the human body,and actually see each and every onenof these cells separately.,The ability like this would allow us,to actually pick up tumorsnway, way earlier in the process,,way before it's 100 million cells inside,nso we can actually do something about it. 
 An ability to see each and every onenof the cells might also allow us,to ask insightful questions.,So in the lab,nwe are now getting to a point,where we can actually start askingnthese cancer cells real questions,,like, for example, are you respondingnto the treatment we are giving you or not?,So if you're not responding, we'll knownto stop the treatment right away,,days into the treatment, not three months.,And so also for patients like Ehud,that are going through thesennasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,,for them not to suffer,through those horrendousnside effects of the drugs,when the drugs arenin fact not even helping them. 
 So to be frank here,,we're pretty far awaynfrom winning the war against cancer,,just to be realistic.,But at least I am hopeful,that we should be able to fight this warnwith better medical imaging techniques,in the way that is not blind. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a talk about sugar and cancer.,I became interested in sugarnwhen I was in college.,Not this kind of sugar.,It was the sugar that our biologynprofessors taught us about,in the context of the coatingnof your cells.,Maybe you didn't know that your cellsnare coated with sugar.,And I didn't know that, either,,until I took these courses in college,,but back then --,and this was in, let's justncall it the 1980s --,people didn't know much about whynour cells are coated with sugar.,And when I dug through my notes,nwhat I noticed I had written down,is that the sugar coating on our cellsnis like the sugar coating,on a peanut M and M.,And people thoughtnthe sugar coating on our cells,was like a protective coating,that somehow made our cellsnstronger or tougher. 
 But we now know, many decades later,,that it's much more complicated than that,,and that the sugars on our cellsnare actually very complex.,And if you could shrink yourself downnto a little miniature airplane,and fly right alongnthe surface of your cells,,it might look something like this --,with geographical features.,And now, the complex sugarsnare these trees and bushes --,weeping willows that arenswaying in the wind,and moving with the waves.,And when I started thinking aboutnall these complex sugars,that are like this foliage on our cells,,it became one of the most interestingnproblems that I encountered,as a biologist and also as a chemist.,And so now we tendnto think about the sugars,that are populatingnthe surface of our cells,as a language.,They have a lot of informationnstored in their complex structures. 
 But what are they trying to tell us?,I can tell you that we do knownsome information,that comes from these sugars,,and it's turned out alreadynto be incredibly important,in the world of medicine. 
 For example, one thingnyour sugars are telling us,is your blood type.,So your blood cells, your red bloodncells, are coated with sugars,,and the chemical structures of thosensugars determine your blood type.,So for example, I knownthat I am blood type O.,How many people are also blood type O?,Put your hands up.,It's a pretty common one,,so when so few hands go up,neither you're not paying attention,or you don't know your blood type,nand both of those are bad. 
 (Laughter) 
 But for those of you who sharenthe blood type O with me,,what this means is that we haventhis chemical structure,on the surface of our blood cells:,three simple sugars linked togethernto make a more complex sugar.,And that, by definition, is blood type O. 
 Now, how many people are blood type A?,Right here.,That means you havenan enzyme in your cells,that adds one more building block,,that red sugar,,to build a more complex structure.,And how many people are blood type B?,Quite a few.,You have a slightly different enzymenthan the A people,,so you build a slightlyndifferent structure,,and those of you that are AB,have the enzyme from your mother,nthe other enzyme from your father,,and now you make both of these structuresnin roughly equal proportions.,And when this was figured out,,which is now back in the previous century,,this enabled one of the most importantnmedical procedures in the world,,which, of course,nis the blood transfusion.,And by knowing what your blood type is,,we can make sure,nif you ever need a transfusion,,that your donor has the same blood type,,so that your bodyndoesn't see foreign sugars,,which it wouldn't likenand would certainly reject. 
 What else are the sugars on the surfacenof your cells trying to tell us?,Well, those sugars might be telling usnthat you have cancer.,So a few decades ago,,correlations began to emergenfrom the analysis of tumor tissue.,And the typical scenario is a patientnwould have a tumor detected,,and the tissue would be removednin a biopsy procedure,and then sent down to a pathology lab,where that tissue would be analyzednto look for chemical changes,that might inform the oncologistnabout the best course of treatment.,And what was discoverednfrom studies like that,is that the sugars have changed,when the cell transformsnfrom being healthy to being sick.,And those correlations have come upnagain and again and again.,But a big question in the fieldnhas been: Why?,Why do cancers have different sugars?nWhat's the importance of that?,Why does it happen, and whatncan we do about it if it does turn out,to be related to the disease process? 
 So, one of the changes that we study,is an increase in the densitynof a particular sugar,that's called sialic acid.,And I think this is going to benone of the most important sugars,of our times,,so I would encourage everybodynto get familiar with this word.,Sialic acid is notnthe kind of sugar that we eat.,Those are different sugars.,This is a kind of sugarnthat is actually found,at certain levels on allnof the cells in your body.,It's actually quite common on your cells.,But for some reason,,cancer cells, at least in a successful,nprogressive disease,,tend to have more sialic acid,than a normal, healthy cell would have.,And why?,What does that mean?,Well, what we've learned,is that it has to donwith your immune system. 
 So let me tell you a little bitnabout the importance of your immune system,in cancer.,And this is something that's, I think,nin the news a lot these days.,You know, people are startingnto become familiar with the term,"cancer immune therapy.",And some of you might even know people,who are benefiting from these very newnways of treating cancer.,What we now knownis that your immune cells,,which are the white blood cellsncoursing through your bloodstream,,protect you on a daily basisnfrom things gone bad --,including cancer.,And so in this picture,,those little green ballsnare your immune cells,,and that big pink cell is a cancer cell.,And these immune cells go aroundnand taste all the cells in your body.,That's their job.,And most of the time, the cells taste OK. 
 But once in a while,na cell might taste bad.,Hopefully, that's the cancer cell,,and when those immune cellsnget the bad taste,,they launch an all-out strikenand kill those cells.,So we know that.,We also know that if you cannpotentiate that tasting,,if you can encourage those immune cellsnto actually take a big old bite,out of a cancer cell,,you get a better job protectingnyourself from cancer every day,and maybe even curing a cancer.,And there are now a couple of drugsnout there in the market,that are used to treat cancer patients,that act exactly by this process.,They activate the immune system,so that the immune systemncan be more vigorous,in protecting us from cancer. 
 In fact, one of those drugs,may well have sparednPresident Jimmy Carter's life.,Do you remember, President Carternhad malignant melanoma,that had metastasized to his brain,,and that diagnosis is onenthat is usually accompanied by numbers,like "months to live.",But he was treated with onenof these new immune-stimulating drugs,,and now his melanomanappears to be in remission,,which is remarkable,,considering the situationnonly a few years ago.,In fact, it's so remarkable,that provocative statements like this one:,"Cancer is having a penicillin moment,"npeople are saying,,with these new immune therapy drugs.,I mean, that's an incredibly bold thingnto say about a disease,which we've been fighting for a long time,and mostly losing the battle with.,So this is very exciting. 
 Now what does this have to do with sugars?,Well, I'll tell you what we've learned.,When an immune cell snugglesnup against a cancer cell to take a taste,,it's looking for signs of disease,,and if it finds those signs,,the cell gets activated and it launchesna missile strike and kills the cell.,But if that cancer cell has a dense forestnof that sugar, sialic acid,,well, it starts to taste pretty good.,And there's a protein on immune cellsnthat grabs the sialic acid,,and if that proteinngets held at that synapse,between the immune cellnand the cancer cell,,it puts that immune cell to sleep.,The sialic acids are tellingnthe immune cell,,"Hey, this cell's all right.nNothing to see here, move along.,Look somewhere else.",So in other words,,as long as our cells are wearingna thick coat of sialic acid,,they look fabulous, right?,It's amazing.,And what if you could strip off that coat,and take that sugar away?,Well, your immune system,might be able to see that cancer cellnfor what it really is:,something that needs to be destroyed. 
 And so this is what we're doing in my lab.,We're developing new medicines,that are basicallyncell-surface lawnmowers --,molecules that go downnto the surface of these cancer cells,and just cut off those sialic acids,,so that the immune systemncan reach its full potential,in eliminating those cancerncells from our body. 
 So in closing,,let me just remind you again:,your cells are coated with sugars.,The sugars are telling cellsnaround that cell,whether the cell is good or bad.,And that's important,,because our immune system needsnto leave the good cells alone.,Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.,But once in a while,ncancers get the ability,to express these new sugars.,And now that we understand,how those sugars mesmerizenthe immune system,,we can come up with new medicinesnto wake up those immune cells,,tell them, "Ignorenthe sugars, eat the cell,and have a delicious snack, on cancer." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The word concussion evokes a fearnthese days more so than it ever has,,and I know this personally.,I played 10 years of football,,was struck in the head thousands of times.,And I have to tell you, though,nwhat was much worse than that,was a pair of bike accidents I hadnwhere I suffered concussions,,and I'm still dealing with the effectsnof the most recent one,today as I stand in front of you. 
 There is a fear around concussion,that does have some evidence behind it.,There is informationnthat a repeated history of concussion,can lead to early dementia,nsuch as Alzheimer's,,and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.,That was the subjectnof the Will Smith movie "Concussion.",And so everybody is caught up in footballnand what they see in the military,,but you may not know,that bike riding is the leading causenof concussion for kids,,sports-related concussion, that is.,And so another thingnthat I should tell you,that you may not know,is that the helmets that are wornnin bicycling and football,and many activities,,they're not designed or tested,for how well they can protectnyour children against concussion.,They're in fact designed and tested,for their ability to protectnagainst skull fracture. 
 And so I get this questionnall the time from parents,,and they ask me,,"Would you let your own childnplay football?",Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?",And I think that as a field,,we're a long way from giving an answernwith any kind of confidence there. 
 So I look at that questionnfrom a bit of a different lens,,and I want to know,nhow can we prevent concussion?,Is that even possible?,And most experts think that it's not,,but the work that we're doing in my lab,is starting to reveal morenof the details around concussion,so that we can havena better understanding.,The reason we're ablento prevent skull fracture with helmets,is because it's pretty simple.nWe know how it works.,Concussion has beennmuch more of a mystery. 
 So to give you a sense of what mightnbe happening in a concussion,,I want to show you the video here,that you see when you type into Google,,"What is a concussion?",The CDC website comes up,,and this video essentiallyntells the whole story.,What you see is the head moves forward,,the brain lags behind,,then the brain catches up,and smashes into the skull.,It rebounds off the skull,and then proceeds to runninto the other side of the skull.,And what you'll notice is highlightednin this video from the CDC,,which I'll note was funded by the NFL,,is that the outer surface of the brain,,where it was to havensmashed into the skull,,looks like it's been damaged or injured,nso it's on the outer surface of the brain.,And what I'd like to do with this video,is to tell you that there arensome aspects that are probably right,,indicative of what the scientistsnthink happens with concussion,,but there's probably morenthat's wrong with this video. 
 So one thing that I do agree with,nand I think most experts would,,is that the brainndoes have these dynamics.,It does lag behind the skull,and then catch up and movenback and forth and oscillate.,That we think is true.,However, the amount of motionnyou see in the brain in this video,is probably not right at all.,There's very little roomnin the cranial vault,,only a few millimeters,,and it's filled entirelynwith cerebral spinal fluid,,which acts as a protective layer.,And so the brain as a whole probablynmoves very little inside the skull. 
 The other problem with this video,is that the brain is shown,as a kind of rigid wholenas it moves around,,and that's not true either.,Your brain is one of the softestnsubstances in your body,,and you can think of itnkind of like jello.,So as your head is moving back and forth,,your brain is twistingnand turning and contorting,,and the tissue is getting stretched.,And so most experts, I think, would agree,that concussion is not likelynto be something that's happening,on this outer surface of the brain,,but rather it's somethingnthat's much deeper,towards the center of the brain. 
 Now, the way that we'renapproaching this problem,to try to understandnthe mechanisms of concussion,and to figure out if we can prevent it,is we are using a device like this.,It's a mouthguard.,It has sensors in itnthat are essentially the same,that are in your cell phone:,accelerometers, gyroscopes,,and when someone is struck in the head,,it can tell you how their head moved,at a thousand samples per second.,The principle behindnthe mouthguard is this:,it fits onto your teeth.,Your teeth are one of the hardestnsubstances in your body.,So it rigidly couples to your skull,and gives you the most precisenpossible measurement,of how the skull moves.,People have triednother approaches, with helmets.,We've looked at other sensorsnthat go on your skin,,and they all simply move around too much,,and so we found that thisnis the only reliable way,to take a good measurement. 
 So now that we've got this device,nwe can go beyond studying cadavers,,because you can onlynlearn so much about concussion,from studying a cadaver,,and we want to learnnand study live humans.,So where can we findna group of willing volunteers,to go out and smash their headsninto each other on a regular basis,and sustain concussion?,Well, I was one of them,,and it's your local friendlynStanford football team. 
 So this is our laboratory,,and I want to show you,the first concussionnwe measured with this device.,One of the things that I should point outnis the device has this gyroscope in it,,and that allows younto measure the rotation of the head.,Most experts thinknthat that's the critical factor,that might start to tell usnwhat is happening in concussion.,So please watch this video. 
 Announcer: Cougars bringnextra people late, but Luck has time,,and Winslow is crushed.,I hope he's all right. 
 (Audience roars) 
 Top of your screen,,you'll see him come onnjust this little post route,,get separation, safety.,Here it comes at you in real speed.nYou'll hear this.,The hit delivered by -- 
 David Camarillo: Sorry, three timesnis probably a little excessive there.,But you get the idea. 
 So when you look at just the film here,,pretty much the only thing you can seenis he got hit really hard and he was hurt.,But when we extract the data,out of the mouthguard that he was wearing,,we can see much more detail,nmuch richer information.,And one of the things that we noticed here,is that he was strucknin the lower left side of his face mask.,And so that did something firstnthat was a little counterintuitive.,His head did not move to the right.,In fact, it rotated first to the left.,Then as the neck began to compress,,the force of the blow caused itnto whip back to the right.,So this left-right motionnwas sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,,and we think that is probablynwhat led to the brain injury. 
 Now, this device is only limited in suchnthat it can measure the skull motion,,but what we really want to knownis what's happening inside of the brain.,So we collaborate withnSvein Kleiven's group in Sweden.,They've developed a finite elementnmodel of the brain.,And so this is a simulation,using the data from our mouthguardnfrom the injury I just showed you,,and what you see is the brain --,this is a cross-section right in the front,of the brain twistingnand contorting as I mentioned.,So you can see this doesn'tnlook a lot like the CDC video.,Now, the colors that you're looking at,are how much the brain tissuenis being stretched.,And so the red is 50 percent.,That means the brain has been stretchednto 50 percent of its original length,,the tissue in that particular area. 
 And the main thing I want to drawnyour attention to is this red spot.,So the red spot is very closento the center of the brain,,and relatively speaking,,you don't see a lot of colors like thatnon the exterior surface,as the CDC video showed. 
 Now, to explain a little more detail,about how we thinknconcussion might be happening,,one thing I should mention,is that we and others have observednthat a concussion is more likely,when you're struck and your headnrotates in this direction.,This is more commonnin sports like football,,but this seems to be more dangerous.nSo what might be happening there?,Well, one thing that you'll noticenin the human brain,that is different than other animals,is we have these two very large lobes.,We have the right brainnand the left brain.,And the key thingnto notice in this figure here,is that right down the centernof the right brain and the left brain,there's a large fissurenthat goes deep into the brain.,And in that fissure,nwhat you can't see in this image,,you'll have to trust me,,there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.,It's called the falx,,and it runs from the front of your headnall the way to the back of your head,,and it's quite stiff.,And so what that allows fornis when you're struck,and your head rotatesnin this left-right direction,,forces can rapidly transmitnright down to the center of your brain. 
 Now, what's therenat the bottom of this fissure?,It's the wiring of your brain,,and in fact this red bundlenhere at the bottom of that fissure,is the single largest fiber bundle,that is the wiring that connectsnthe right and left sides of your brain.,It's called the corpus callosum.,And we think that this might be,one of the most commonnmechanisms of concussion,,and as the forces move down,nthey strike the corpus callosum,,it causes a dissociationnbetween your right and your left brain,and could explain somenof the symptoms of concussion. 
 This finding is also consistentnof what we've seen,in this brain disease that I mentioned,nchronic traumatic encephalopathy.,So this is an image of a middle-agednex-professional football player,,and the thing that I want to point outnis if you look at the corpus callosum,,and I'll page back here so you can seenthe size of a normal corpus callosum,and the size of the person herenwho has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,,it is greatly atrophied.,And the same goesnfor all of the space in the ventricles.,These ventricles are much larger.,And so all of this tissuennear the center of the brain,has died off over time.,So what we're learningnis indeed consistent. 
 Now, there is some good news here,,and I hope to give you a sensenof hope by the end of this talk.,One of the things that we've noticed,,specifically aboutnthis mechanism of injury,,is although there's a rapid transmissionnof the forces down this fissure,,it still takes a defined amount of time.,And what we think is that if we cannslow the head down just enough,so that the brainndoes not lag behind the skull,but instead it movesnin synchrony with the skull,,then we might be able to preventnthis mechanism of concussion. 
 So how can we slow the head down? 
 (Laughter) 
 A gigantic helmet.,So with more space, you have more time,,and this is a bit of a joke,nbut some of you may have seen this.,This is bubble soccer,nand it's a real sport.,In fact, I saw some young adults,playing this sport down the streetnfrom my house the other day,,and as far as I knownthere have been no reported concussions. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in all seriousness,nthis principle does work,,but this has gone too far.,This isn't something that's practicalnfor bike riding or playing football.,And so we are collaboratingnwith a company in Sweden called Hövding.,Some of you may have seen their work,,and they're using the same principlenof air to give you some extra space,to prevent concussion.,Kids, don't try this at home please.,This stuntman does not have a helmet.,He instead has a neck collar,,and this neck collar has sensors in it,,the same type of sensorsnthat are in our mouthguard,,and it detects when he's likelynto have a fall,,and there's an airbagnthat explodes and triggers,,the same way that an airbagnworks in your car, essentially.,And in the experimentsnwe've done in my lab with their device,,we found that it can greatly reducenthe risk of concussion in some scenarios,compared to a normal bicycle helmet.,So it's a pretty exciting development. 
 But in order for us to actually realizenthe benefits of technology,that can prevent concussion,,it needs to meet regulations.,That's a reality.,And this device is for sale in Europe,but is not for sale in the US,nand probably won't be any time soon.,So I wanted to tell you why.,There are some good reasons and thennthere are some not so good reasons. 
 Bike helmets are federally regulated.,The Consumer Product Safety Commissionnhas been given jurisdiction,to approve any bike helmet for sale,,and this is the test they use.,This is back to what I was telling younat the beginning about skull fracture.,That's what this test is for.,And that's an important thing to do.,It can save your life,nbut it's not sufficient, I would say.,So for example, one thingnthis test doesn't evaluate,is it doesn't tell younis that airbag going to trigger,at the right time and place,nand not trigger when it doesn't need to?,Similarly, it's not going to tell you,is this helmet likelynto prevent concussion or not?,And if you look at football helmets,nwhich aren't regulated,,they still have a very similar test.,They're not regulatednby the government, anyway.,They have an industry body,nwhich is the way most industries work.,But this industry body, I can tell you,nhas been quite resistant,to updating their standards.,So in my lab, we are working on not onlynthe mechanism of concussion,,but we want to understandnhow can we have better test standards?,And we hope that the governmentncan use this type of information,to encourage innovation,by letting consumers know,how protected are you with a given helmet. 
 And I want to bring this back finallynto the original question I asked,,which is, would I feel comfortablenletting my child play football,or ride a bicycle?,And this might be just a resultnof my own traumatic experience.,I'm much more nervousnabout my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.,So she's a year and a half old,,and she's already, well, wants to anyway,nrace down the streets of San Francisco.,This is the bottomnof one of these streets.,And so my personal goalnis to -- and I believe this is possible --,is to further develop these technologies,,and in fact, we're workingnon something in my lab in particular,that really makes optimal usenof the given space of a helmet.,And I am confidentnthat we will be able to,,before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,,have something available,that can in fact really reducenthe risk of concussion,and comply with regulatory bodies. 
 And so what I'd like to do --,and I know that this is for some of younof more immediate nature,,I've got a couple years here --,is to be able to tell parentsnand grandparents when I'm asked,,it is safe and healthy for your childrennto engage in these activities.,And I'm very fortunatento have a wonderful team at Stanford,that's working hard on this. 
 So I hope to come back in a few yearsnwith the final story,,but for now I will tell you,,please don't just be afraidnwhen you hear the word concussion.,There is hope. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)One summer afternoon in 2013,,DC police detained, questionednand searched a man,who appeared suspiciousnand potentially dangerous.,This wasn't what I was wearingnthe day of the detention, to be fair,,but I have a picture of that as well.,I know it's very frightening --ntry to remain calm. 
 (Laughter) 
 At this time, I was interning,at the Public Defender Servicenin Washington DC,,and I was visitingna police station for work.,I was on my way out,,and before I could make it to my car,,two police cars pulled upnto block my exit,,and an officer approached me from behind.,He told me to stop, take my backpack off,and put my hands on the police carnparked next to us.,About a dozen officersnthen gathered near us.,All of them had handguns,,some had assault rifles.,They rifled through my backpack.,They patted me down.,They took pictures of menspread on the police car,,and they laughed. 
 And as all this was happening --,as I was on the police car tryingnto ignore the shaking in my legs,,trying to think clearlynabout what I should do --,something stuck out to me as odd.,When I look at myself in this photo,,if I were to describe myself,,I think I'd say something like,,"19-year-old Indian male,nbright T-shirt, wearing glasses.",But they weren't includingnany of these details.,Into their police radiosnas they described me,,they kept saying, "Middle Easternnmale with a backpack.,Middle Eastern male with a backpack.",And this description carried onninto their police reports.,I never expected to be describednby my own government in these terms:,"lurking,","nefarious,","terrorist.",And the detention dragged on like this. 
 They sent dogs trained to smell explosivesnto sweep the area I'd been in.,They called the federal governmentnto see if I was on any watch lists.,They sent a couple of detectivesnto cross-examine me on why,,if I claimed I had nothing to hide,,I wouldn't consent to a search of my car.,And I could seenthey weren't happy with me,,but I felt I had no way of knowingnwhat they'd want to do next.,At one point, the officernwho patted me down,scanned the side of the police stationnto see where the security camera was,to see how much of thisnwas being recorded.,And when he did that,,it really sank in how completelynI was at their mercy. 
 I think we're all normalizednfrom a young age,to the idea of police officersnand arrests and handcuffs,,so it's easy to forget how demeaningnand coercive a thing it is,to seize control overnanother person's body.,I know it sounds likenthe point of my story,is how badly treated I wasnbecause of my race --,and yes, I don't think I would've beenndetained if I were white.,But actually, what I have in mindntoday is something else.,What I have in mind is hownmuch worse things might've been,if I weren't affluent.,I mean, they thought I might be tryingnto plant an explosive,,and they investigated that possibilitynfor an hour and a half,,but I was never put in handcuffs,,I was never taken to a jail cell.,I think if I were from one of WashingtonnDC's poor communities of color,,and they thought I wasnendangering officers' lives,,things might've ended differently.,And in fact, in our system, I thinknit's better to be an affluent person,suspected of tryingnto blow up a police station,than it is to be a poor person,who's suspected of much,nmuch less than this. 
 I want to give you an examplenfrom my current work.,Right now, I'm workingnat a civil rights organization in DC,,called Equal Justice Under Law.,Let me start by asking you all a question.,How many of you have ever gottenna parking ticket in your life?,Raise your hand.,Yeah. So have I.,And when I had to pay it,,it felt annoying and it felt bad,,but I paid it and I moved on.,I'm guessing most of younhave paid your tickets as well.,But what would happen if youncouldn't afford the amount on the ticket,and your family doesn't haventhe money either, what happens then? 
 Well, one thing that's not supposednto happen under the law is,,you're not supposed to benarrested and jailed,simply because you can't afford to pay.,That's illegal under federal law.,But that's what local governmentsnacross the country are doing,to people who are poor.,And so many of our lawsuitsnat Equal Justice Under Law,target these modern-day debtors' prisons. 
 One of our cases is againstnFerguson, Missouri.,And I know when I say Ferguson,,many of you will think of police violence.,But today I want to talknabout a different aspect,of the relationship betweenntheir police force and their citizens.,Ferguson was issuing an averagenof over two arrest warrants,,per person, per year,,mostly for unpaid debt to the courts.,When I imagine what that would feel likenif, every time I left my house,,there was a chance a police officernwould run my license plate,,see a warrant for unpaid debt,,seize my body they way the did in DC,and then take me to a jail cell,,I feel a little sick. 
 I've met many of the people in Fergusonnwho have experienced this,,and I've heard some of their stories.,In Ferguson's jail,,in each small cell,nthere's a bunk bed and a toilet,,but they'd pack four peopleninto each cell.,So there'd be two people on the bunksnand two people on the floor,,one with nowhere to go exceptnright next to the filthy toilet,,which was never cleaned.,In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,,so the floor and the walls were linednwith blood and mucus.,No water to drink,,except coming out of a spigotnconnected to the toilet.,The water looked and tasted dirty,,there was never enough food,,never any showers,,women menstruatingnwithout any hygiene products,,no medical attention whatsoever.,When I asked a womannabout medical attention,,she laughed, and she said, "Oh, no, no.,The only attention you getnfrom the guards in there is sexual." 
 So, they'd take the debtorsnto this place and they'd say,,"We're not letting you leavenuntil you make a payment on your debt.",And if you could -- if youncould call a family member,who could somehow come up with some money,,then maybe you were out.,If it was enough money, you were out.,But if it wasn't, you'd stay therenfor days or weeks,,and every day the guardsnwould come down to the cells,and haggle with the debtorsnabout the price of release that day.,You'd stay until, at some point,nthe jail would be booked to capacity,,and they'd want to book someone new in.,And at that point, they'd think,,"OK, it's unlikely this personncan come up with the money,,it's more likely this new person will.",You're out, they're in,nand the machine kept moving like that. 
 I met a man who,,nine years ago, was arrestednfor panhandling in a Walgreens.,He couldn't afford his finesnand his court fees from that case.,When he was youngnhe survived a house fire,,only because he jumped outnof the third-story window to escape.,But that fall left himnwith damage to his brain,and several parts of this body,nincluding his leg.,So he can't work,,and he relies on social securitynpayments to survive.,When I met him in his apartment,,he had nothing of value there --nnot even food in his fridge.,He's chronically hungry.,He had nothing of value in his apartmentnexcept a small piece of cardboard,on which he'd writtennthe names of his children.,He cherished this a lot.nHe was happy to show it to me.,But he can't pay his fines and feesnbecause he has nothing to give.,In the last nine years,nhe's been arrested 13 times,,and jailed for a total of 130 daysnon that panhandling case.,One of those stretches lasted 45 days.,Just imagine spending from right nownuntil sometime in June,in the place that I described to youna few moments ago. 
 He told me about all the suicide attemptsnhe's seen in Ferguson's jail;,about the time a man foundna way to hang himself,out of reach of the other inmates,,so all they could donwas yell and yell and yell,,trying to get the guards' attention,so they could come down and cut him down.,And he told me that it took the guardsnover five minutes to respond,,and when they came,nthe man was unconscious.,So they called the paramedicsnand the paramedics went to the cell.,They said, "He'll be OK,",so they just left him there on the floor.,I heard many stories like thisnand they shouldn't have surprised me,,because suicide is the single leadingncause of death in our local jails.,This is related to the lacknof mental health care in our jails. 
 I met a woman, single mother of three,nmaking seven dollars an hour.,She relies on food stampsnto feed herself and her children.,About a decade ago,,she got a couple of traffic ticketsnand a minor theft charge,,and she can't afford her finesnand fees on those cases.,Since then, she's been jailednabout 10 times on those cases,,but she has schizophrenianand bipolar disorder,,and she needs medication every day.,She doesn't have accessnto those medications in Ferguson's jail,,because no one has accessnto their medications.,She told me about what it was likento spend two weeks in a cage,,hallucinating people and shadowsnand hearing voices,,begging for the medicationnthat would make it all stop,,only to be ignored.,And this isn't anomalous, either:,thirty percent of women in our local jailsnhave serious mental health needs,just like hers,,but only one in six receivesnany mental health care while in jail. 
 And so, I heard all these storiesnabout this grotesque dungeon,that Ferguson was operatingnfor its debtors,,and when it came timenfor me to actually see it,and to go visit Ferguson's jail,,I'm not sure what I was expecting to see,,but I wasn't expecting this.,It's an ordinary government building.,It could be a post office or a school.,It reminded me that these illegalnextortion schemes,aren't being run somewhere in the shadows,,they're being run out in the opennby our public officials.,They're a matter of public policy.,And this reminded menthat poverty jailing in general,,even outside the debtors' prison context,,plays a very visible and central rolenin our justice system. 
 What I have in mind is our policy of bail.,In our system, whethernyou're detained or free,,pending trial is not a matternof how dangerous you are,or how much of a flight risk you pose.,It's a matter of whether you can affordnto post your bail amount.,So Bill Cosby, whose bailnwas set at a million dollars,,immediately writes the check,nand doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.,But Sandra Bland, who died in jail,,was only there because her familynwas unable to come up with 500 dollars.,In fact, there are half a millionnSandra Blands across the country --,500,000 people who are in jail right now,,only because they can't affordntheir bail amount. 
 We're told that our jailsnare places for criminals,,but statistically that's not the case:,three out of every five peoplenin jail right now are there pretrial.,They haven't been convicted of any crime;,they haven't pled guilty to any offense.,Right here in San Francisco,,85 percent of the inmatesnin our jail in San Francisco,are pretrial detainees.,This means San Francisco is spendingnsomething like 80 million dollars,every year,to fund pretrial detention. 
 Many of these people who are in jailnonly because they can't post bail,are facing allegations so minor,that the amount of time it would takenfor them to sit waiting for trial,is longer than the sentencenthey would receive if convicted,,which means they're guaranteednto get out faster,if they just plead guilty.,So now the choice is:,Should I stay here in this horrible place,,away from my family and my dependents,,almost guaranteed to lose my job,,and then fight the charges?,Or should I just plead guilty to whatevernthe prosecutor wants and get out?,And at this point, they're pretrialndetainees, not criminals.,But once they take that plea deal,nwe'll call them criminals,,even though an affluent personnwould never have been in this situation,,because an affluent personnwould have simply been bailed out. 
 At this point you might be wondering,,"This guy's in the inspiration section,nwhat is he doing -- 
 (Laughter) 
 "This is extremely depressing.nI want my money back." 
 (Laughter) 
 But in actuality,,I find talking about jailing much lessndepressing than the alternative,,because I think if we don't talknabout these issues,and collectively changenhow we think about jailing,,at the end of all of our lives,,we'll still have jails full of poor peoplenwho don't belong there.,That really is depressing to me.,But what's exciting to me is the thoughtnthat these stories can move us,to think about jailing in different terms.,Not in sterile policy termsnlike "mass incarceration,",or "sentencing of nonviolent offenders,",but in human terms. 
 When we put a human being in a cagenfor days or weeks or months,or even years,,what are we doingnto that person's mind and body?,Under what conditionsnare we really willing to do that?,And so if starting with a fewnhundred of us in this room,,we can commit to thinking aboutnjailing in this different light,,then we can undo that normalizationnI was referring to earlier. 
 If I leave you with anything today,nI hope it's with the thought,that if we want anythingnto fundamentally change --,not just to reform our policiesnon bail and fines and fees --,but also to make sure that whatevernnew policies replace those,don't punish the poor and the marginalizednin their own new way.,If we want that kind of change,,then this shift in thinkingnis required of each of us. 
 Thank you.

 Historically, one of those areasnhas been perception,,the process by which thingsnout there in the world --,sounds and images --,can turn into concepts in the mind.,This is essential for our own brains,,and it's also pretty useful on a computer.,The machine perception algorithms,nfor example, that our team makes,,are what enable your picturesnon Google Photos to become searchable,,based on what's in them.,The flip side of perception is creativity:,turning a concept into somethingnout there into the world.,So over the past year,nour work on machine perception,has also unexpectedly connectednwith the world of machine creativity,and machine art. 
 I think Michelangelonhad a penetrating insight,into to this dual relationshipnbetween perception and creativity.,This is a famous quote of his:,"Every block of stonenhas a statue inside of it,,and the job of the sculptornis to discover it.",So I think that whatnMichelangelo was getting at,is that we create by perceiving,,and that perception itselfnis an act of imagination,and is the stuff of creativity. 
 The organ that does all the thinkingnand perceiving and imagining,,of course, is the brain.,And I'd like to beginnwith a brief bit of history,about what we know about brains.,Because unlike, say,nthe heart or the intestines,,you really can't say very muchnabout a brain by just looking at it,,at least with the naked eye.,The early anatomists who looked at brains,gave the superficial structuresnof this thing all kinds of fanciful names,,like hippocampus, meaning "little shrimp.",But of course that sort of thingndoesn't tell us very much,about what's actually going on inside. 
 The first person who, I think, reallyndeveloped some kind of insight,into what was going on in the brain,was the great Spanish neuroanatomist,nSantiago Ramón y Cajal,,in the 19th century,,who used microscopy and special stains,that could selectively fill innor render in very high contrast,the individual cells in the brain,,in order to start to understandntheir morphologies.,And these are the kinds of drawingsnthat he made of neurons,in the 19th century. 
 This is from a bird brain.,And you see this incredible varietynof different sorts of cells,,even the cellular theory itselfnwas quite new at this point.,And these structures,,these cells that have these arborizations,,these branches that can gonvery, very long distances --,this was very novel at the time.,They're reminiscent, of course, of wires.,That might have been obviousnto some people in the 19th century;,the revolutions of wiring and electricitynwere just getting underway.,But in many ways,,these microanatomical drawingsnof Ramón y Cajal's, like this one,,they're still in some ways unsurpassed. 
 We're still more than a century later,,trying to finish the jobnthat Ramón y Cajal started.,These are raw data from our collaborators,at the Max Planck Institutenof Neuroscience.,And what our collaborators have done,is to image little pieces of brain tissue.,The entire sample herenis about one cubic millimeter in size,,and I'm showing you a very,nvery small piece of it here.,That bar on the left is about one micron.,The structures you see are mitochondria,that are the size of bacteria.,And these are consecutive slices,through this very, veryntiny block of tissue.,Just for comparison's sake,,the diameter of an average strandnof hair is about 100 microns.,So we're looking at somethingnmuch, much smaller,than a single strand of hair. 
 And from these kinds of serialnelectron microscopy slices,,one can start to make reconstructionsnin 3D of neurons that look like these.,So these are sort of in the samenstyle as Ramón y Cajal.,Only a few neurons lit up,,because otherwise we wouldn'tnbe able to see anything here.,It would be so crowded,,so full of structure,,of wiring all connectingnone neuron to another. 
 So Ramón y Cajal was a little bitnahead of his time,,and progress on understanding the brain,proceeded slowlynover the next few decades.,But we knew that neurons used electricity,,and by World War II, our technologynwas advanced enough,to start doing real electricalnexperiments on live neurons,to better understand how they worked.,This was the very same timenwhen computers were being invented,,very much based on the ideanof modeling the brain --,of "intelligent machinery,"nas Alan Turing called it,,one of the fathers of computer science. 
 Warren McCulloch and Walter Pittsnlooked at Ramón y Cajal's drawing,of visual cortex,,which I'm showing here.,This is the cortex that processesnimagery that comes from the eye.,And for them, this lookednlike a circuit diagram.,So there are a lot of detailsnin McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram,that are not quite right.,But this basic idea,that visual cortex works like a seriesnof computational elements,that pass informationnone to the next in a cascade,,is essentially correct. 
 Let's talk for a moment,about what a model for processingnvisual information would need to do.,The basic task of perception,is to take an image like this one and say,,"That's a bird,",which is a very simple thingnfor us to do with our brains.,But you should all understandnthat for a computer,,this was pretty much impossiblenjust a few years ago.,The classical computing paradigm,is not one in whichnthis task is easy to do. 
 So what's going on between the pixels,,between the image of the birdnand the word "bird,",is essentially a set of neuronsnconnected to each other,in a neural network,,as I'm diagramming here.,This neural network could be biological,ninside our visual cortices,,or, nowadays, we startnto have the capability,to model such neural networksnon the computer.,And I'll show you whatnthat actually looks like. 
 So the pixels you can thinknabout as a first layer of neurons,,and that's, in fact,nhow it works in the eye --,that's the neurons in the retina.,And those feed forward,into one layer after another layer,nafter another layer of neurons,,all connected by synapsesnof different weights.,The behavior of this network,is characterized by the strengthsnof all of those synapses.,Those characterize the computationalnproperties of this network.,And at the end of the day,,you have a neuronnor a small group of neurons,that light up, saying, "bird." 
 Now I'm going to representnthose three things --,the input pixels and the synapsesnin the neural network,,and bird, the output --,by three variables: x, w and y.,There are maybe a million or so x's --,a million pixels in that image.,There are billions or trillions of w's,,which represent the weights of allnthese synapses in the neural network.,And there's a very small number of y's,,of outputs that that network has.,"Bird" is only four letters, right?,So let's pretend that thisnis just a simple formula,,x "x" w = y.,I'm putting the times in scare quotes,because what's reallyngoing on there, of course,,is a very complicated seriesnof mathematical operations. 
 That's one equation.,There are three variables.,And we all knownthat if you have one equation,,you can solve one variablenby knowing the other two things.,So the problem of inference,,that is, figuring outnthat the picture of a bird is a bird,,is this one:,it's where y is the unknownnand w and x are known.,You know the neural network,nyou know the pixels.,As you can see, that's actuallyna relatively straightforward problem.,You multiply two times threenand you're done.,I'll show you an artificial neural network,that we've built recently,ndoing exactly that. 
 This is running in real timenon a mobile phone,,and that's, of course,namazing in its own right,,that mobile phones can do so manynbillions and trillions of operations,per second.,What you're looking at is a phone,looking at one after anothernpicture of a bird,,and actually not only saying,n"Yes, it's a bird,",but identifying the species of birdnwith a network of this sort.,So in that picture,,the x and the w are known,nand the y is the unknown.,I'm glossing over the veryndifficult part, of course,,which is how on earthndo we figure out the w,,the brain that can do such a thing?,How would we ever learn such a model? 
 So this process of learning,nof solving for w,,if we were doing thisnwith the simple equation,in which we think about these as numbers,,we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w,,well, we divide by two and we're done.,The problem is with this operator.,So, division --,we've used division becausenit's the inverse to multiplication,,but as I've just said,,the multiplication is a bit of a lie here.,This is a very, very complicated,nvery non-linear operation;,it has no inverse.,So we have to figure out a waynto solve the equation,without a division operator.,And the way to do thatnis fairly straightforward.,You just say, let's playna little algebra trick,,and move the six overnto the right-hand side of the equation.,Now, we're still using multiplication.,And that zero -- let's thinknabout it as an error.,In other words, if we've solvednfor w the right way,,then the error will be zero.,And if we haven't gotten it quite right,,the error will be greater than zero. 
 So now we can just take guessesnto minimize the error,,and that's the sort of thingncomputers are very good at.,So you've taken an initial guess:,what if w = 0?,Well, then the error is 6.,What if w = 1? The error is 4.,And then the computer cannsort of play Marco Polo,,and drive down the error close to zero.,As it does that, it's gettingnsuccessive approximations to w.,Typically, it never quite gets there,nbut after about a dozen steps,,we're up to w = 2.999,nwhich is close enough.,And this is the learning process. 
 So remember that what's been going on here,is that we've been takingna lot of known x's and known y's,and solving for the w in the middlenthrough an iterative process.,It's exactly the same waynthat we do our own learning.,We have many, many images as babies,and we get told, "This is a bird;nthis is not a bird.",And over time, through iteration,,we solve for w, we solvenfor those neural connections. 
 So now, we've heldnx and w fixed to solve for y;,that's everyday, fast perception.,We figure out how we can solve for w,,that's learning, which is a lot harder,,because we need to do error minimization,,using a lot of training examples. 
 And about a year ago,nAlex Mordvintsev, on our team,,decided to experimentnwith what happens if we try solving for x,,given a known w and a known y.,In other words,,you know that it's a bird,,and you already have your neural networknthat you've trained on birds,,but what is the picture of a bird?,It turns out that by using exactlynthe same error-minimization procedure,,one can do that with the networkntrained to recognize birds,,and the result turns out to be ...,a picture of birds.,So this is a picture of birdsngenerated entirely by a neural network,that was trained to recognize birds,,just by solving for xnrather than solving for y,,and doing that iteratively. 
 Here's another fun example.,This was a work madenby Mike Tyka in our group,,which he calls "Animal Parade.",It reminds me a little bitnof William Kentridge's artworks,,in which he makes sketches, rubs them out,,makes sketches, rubs them out,,and creates a movie this way.,In this case,,what Mike is doing is varying ynover the space of different animals,,in a network designednto recognize and distinguish,different animals from each other.,And you get this strange, Escher-likenmorph from one animal to another. 
 Here he and Alex togethernhave tried reducing,the y's to a space of only two dimensions,,thereby making a mapnout of the space of all things,recognized by this network.,Doing this kind of synthesis,or generation of imagerynover that entire surface,,varying y over the surface,nyou make a kind of map --,a visual map of all the thingsnthe network knows how to recognize.,The animals are all here;n"armadillo" is right in that spot. 
 You can do this with other kindsnof networks as well.,This is a network designednto recognize faces,,to distinguish one face from another.,And here, we're puttingnin a y that says, "me,",my own face parameters.,And when this thing solves for x,,it generates this rather crazy,,kind of cubist, surreal,npsychedelic picture of me,from multiple points of view at once.,The reason it looks likenmultiple points of view at once,is because that network is designednto get rid of the ambiguity,of a face being in one posenor another pose,,being looked at with one kind of lighting,nanother kind of lighting.,So when you donthis sort of reconstruction,,if you don't use some sort of guide image,or guide statistics,,then you'll get a sort of confusionnof different points of view,,because it's ambiguous.,This is what happens if Alex usesnhis own face as a guide image,during that optimization processnto reconstruct my own face.,So you can see it's not perfect.,There's still quite a lot of work to do,on how we optimizenthat optimization process.,But you start to get somethingnmore like a coherent face,,rendered using my own face as a guide. 
 You don't have to startnwith a blank canvas,or with white noise.,When you're solving for x,,you can begin with an x,nthat is itself already some other image.,That's what this little demonstration is.,This is a networknthat is designed to categorize,all sorts of different objects --nman-made structures, animals ...,Here we're startingnwith just a picture of clouds,,and as we optimize,,basically, this network is figuring outnwhat it sees in the clouds.,And the more timenyou spend looking at this,,the more things you alsonwill see in the clouds.,You could also use the face networknto hallucinate into this,,and you get some pretty crazy stuff. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or, Mike has done some other experiments,in which he takes that cloud image,,hallucinates, zooms, hallucinates,nzooms hallucinates, zooms.,And in this way,,you can get a sort of fugue statenof the network, I suppose,,or a sort of free association,,in which the networknis eating its own tail.,So every image is now the basis for,,"What do I think I see next?,What do I think I see next?nWhat do I think I see next?" 
 I showed this for the first time in public,to a group at a lecture in Seattlencalled "Higher Education" --,this was right afternmarijuana was legalized. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'd like to finish up quickly,by just noting that this technologynis not constrained.,I've shown you purely visual examplesnbecause they're really fun to look at.,It's not a purely visual technology.,Our artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin,,has done experiments involvingna camera that takes a picture,,and then a computer in his backpacknwrites a poem using neural networks,,based on the contents of the image.,And that poetry neural networknhas been trained,on a large corpus of 20th-century poetry.,And the poetry is, you know,,I think, kind of not bad, actually. 
 (Laughter) 
 In closing,,I think that per Michelangelo,,I think he was right;,perception and creativitynare very intimately connected.,What we've just seen are neural networks,that are entirely trained to discriminate,,or to recognize differentnthings in the world,,able to be run in reverse, to generate.,One of the things that suggests to me,is not only thatnMichelangelo really did see,the sculpture in the blocks of stone,,but that any creature,nany being, any alien,that is able to donperceptual acts of that sort,is also able to create,because it's exactly the samenmachinery that's used in both cases. 
 Also, I think that perceptionnand creativity are by no means,uniquely human.,We start to have computer modelsnthat can do exactly these sorts of things.,And that ought to be unsurprising;nthe brain is computational. 
 And finally,,computing began as an exercisenin designing intelligent machinery.,It was very much modeled after the idea,of how could we make machines intelligent.,And we finally are starting to fulfill now,some of the promisesnof those early pioneers,,of Turing and von Neumann,and McCulloch and Pitts.,And I think that computingnis not just about accounting,or playing Candy Crush or something.,From the beginning,nwe modeled them after our minds.,And they give us both the abilitynto understand our own minds better,and to extend them. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Have you ever noticednwhen you ask someone to talk,about a change they're makingnfor the better in their personal lives,,they're often really energetic?,Whether it's training for a marathon,,picking up an old hobby,,or learning a new skill,,for most people,,self-transformation projectsnoccupy a very positive emotional space. 
 Self-transformation is empowering,,energizing, even exhilarating.,I mean just take a looknat some of the titles of self-help books:,"Awaken the Giant Within,","Practicing the Power of Now,",or here's a great onenwe can all relate to,,"You are a Badass:,How to Stop Doubting Your Greatnessnand Start Living an Awesome Life." 
 (Laughter) 
 When it comes to self-transformation,,you can't help but getna sense of the excitement.,But there's another type of transformation,that occupies a very differentnemotional space.,The transformation of organizations.,If you're like most people,,when you hear the words "Our organizationnis going to start a transformation,",you're thinking, "Uh-oh." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Layoffs.",The blood drains from your face,,your mind goes into overdrive,,frantically searchingnfor some place to run and hide. 
 Well, you can run,,but you really can't hide.,Most of us spendnthe majority of our waking hours,involved in organizations.,And due to changes in globalization,,changes due to advances in technology,and other factors,,the reality is our organizationsnare constantly having to adapt.,In fact,,I call this the eranof "always-on" transformation. 
 When I shared this ideanwith my wife Nicola,,she said, "Always-on transformation?,That sounds exhausting.",And that may benexactly what you're thinking --,and you would be right.,Particularly if we continue to approachnthe transformation of organizations,the way we always have been. 
 But because we can't hide,,we need to sort out two things.,First,,why is transformation so exhausting?,And second, how do we fix it? 
 First of all,,let's acknowledge that change is hard.,People naturally resist change,,especially when it's imposed on them.,But there are things that organizations donthat make change even harder,and more exhaustingnfor people than it needs to be.,First of all,,leaders often wait too long to act.,As a result,,everything is happening in crisis mode.,Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.,Or, given the urgency,,what they'll do is they'll just focusnon the short-term results,,but that doesn't givenany hope for the future.,Or they'll just takena superficial, one-off approach,,hoping that they can returnnback to business as usual,as soon as the crisis is over. 
 This kind of approach,is kind of the way some studentsnapproach preparing for standardized tests.,In order to get test scores to go up,,teachers will end up teaching to the test.,Now, that approach can work;,test results often do go up.,But it fails the fundamentalngoal of education:,to prepare studentsnto succeed over the long term. 
 So given these obstacles,,what can we do,to transform the waynwe transform organizations,so rather than being exhausting,,it's actually empowering and energizing?,To do that, we need to focusnon five strategic imperatives,,all of which have one thing in common:,putting people first. 
 The first imperativenfor putting people first,is to inspire through purpose.,Most transformations havenfinancial and operational goals.,These are importantnand they can be energizing to leaders,,but they tend not to be very motivatingnto most people in the organization.,To motivate more broadly,,the transformation needs to connectnwith a deeper sense of purpose. 
 Take LEGO.,The LEGO Group has becomenan extraordinary global company.,Under their very capable leadership,,they've actually undergonena series of transformations.,While each of thesenhas had a very specific focus,,the North Star,,linking and guiding all of them,,has been Lego's powerful purpose:,inspire and developnthe builders of tomorrow.,Expanding globally?,It's not about increasing sales,,but about giving millions of additionalnchildren access to LEGO building bricks.,Investment and innovation?,It's not about developing new products,,but about enabling more children,to experience the joynof learning through play.,Not surprisingly,,that deep sense of purpose tendsnto be highly motivating to LEGO's people. 
 The second imperativenfor putting people first,is to go all in.,Too many transformations,are nothing more thannhead-count cutting exercises;,layoffs under the guise of transformation.,In the face of relentless competition,,it may well be that you willnhave to take the painful decision,to downsize the organization,,just as you may have to lose some weightnin order to run a marathon.,But losing weight alone,will not get you acrossnthe finish line with a winning time.,To win,you need to go all in.,You need to go all in.,Rather than just cutting costs,,you need to think about initiatives,that will enable younto win in the medium term,,initiatives to drive growth,,actions that will fundamentallynchange the way the company operates,,and very importantly,,investments to developnthe leadership and the talent. 
 The third imperativenfor putting people first,is to enable people with the capabilities,that they need to succeednduring the transformation and beyond.,Over the years I've competednin a number of triathlons.,You know, frankly, I'm not that good,,but I do have one distinct capability;,I am remarkably fast at finding my bike. 
 (Laughter) 
 By the time I finish the swim,,almost all the bikes are already gone. 
 (Laughter) 
 Real triathletes know that each leg --,the swim, the bike, the run --,really requires different capabilities,,different tools,,different skills, different techniques.,Likewise when we transform organizations,,we need to be surenthat we're giving our people,the skills and the toolsnthey need along the way. 
 Chronos,,a global software company,,recognized the neednto transfer from building products --,software products --,to building software as a service.,To enable its peoplento take that transformation,,first of all they invested in new tools,that would enable their employeesnto monitor the usage of the features,as well as customer satisfactionnwith the new service.,They also invested in skill development,,so that their employees would be able,to resolve customer servicenproblems on the spot.,And very importantly,,they also reinforced the collaborativenbehaviors that would be required,to deliver an end-to-endnseamless customer experience.,Because of these investments,,rather than feeling overwhelmednby the transformation,,Chronos employees actually felt energized,and empowered in their new roles. 
 In the era of "always-on" transformation,,change is a constant.,My fourth imperative therefore,is to instill a culturenof continuous learning.,When Satya Nadellanbecame the CEO of Microsoft,in February 2014,,he embarked on an ambitiousntransformation journey,to prepare the company to competenin a mobile-first, cloud-first world.,This included changes to strategy,,the organization,and very importantly, the culture.,Microsoft's culture at the time was onenof silos and internal competition --,not exactly conducive to learning.,Nadella took this head-on.,He rallied his leadershipnaround his vision,for a living, learning culture,,shifting from a fixed mindset,,where your role was to show upnas the smartest person in the room,,to a growth mindset,,where your role was to listen, to learnnand to bring out the best in people.,Well, early days,,Microsoft employees alreadynnoticed this shift in the culture --,clear evidence of Microsoftnputting people first. 
 My fifth and final imperativenis specifically for leaders.,In a transformation,,a leader needs to have a vision,,a clear road map with milestones,,and then you need to hold peoplenaccountable for results.,In other words, you need to be directive.,But in order to capturenthe hearts and minds of people,,you also need to be inclusive.,Inclusive leadershipnis critical to putting people first. 
 I live in the San Francisco Bay area.,And right now,,our basketball teamnis the best in the league.,We won the 2015 championship,,and we're favored to win again this year.,There are many explanations for this.,They have some fabulous players,,but one of the key reasons,is their head coach, Steve Kerr,nis an inclusive leader.,When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,,the Warriors were lookingnfor a major transformation.,They hadn't won a nationalnchampionship since 1975. 
 Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision,,and he immediately got to work.,From the outset,,he reached out and engagednthe players and the staff.,He created an environment of open debatenand solicited suggestions.,During games he would often ask,,"What are you seeing that I'm missing?" 
 One the best examples of thisncame in game four of the 2015 finals.,The Warriors were down two games to one,when Kerr made the decisionnto change the starting lineup;,a bold move by any measure.,The Warriors won the gamenand went on to win the championship.,And it is widely viewed,that that move wasnthe pivotal move in their victory. 
 Interestingly, it wasn'tnactually Kerr's idea.,It was the idea of his 28-year-oldnassistant, Nick U'Ren.,Because of Kerr's leadership style,,U'Ren felt comfortablenbringing the idea forward.,And Kerr not only listened,,but he implemented the idea,and then afterwards,,gave U'Ren all the credit --,actions all consistent with Kerr'snhighly inclusive approach to leadership. 
 In the era of "always-on" transformation,,organizations are alwaysngoing to be transforming.,But doing so does notnhave to be exhausting.,We owe it to ourselves,,to our organizations,and to society more broadly,to boldly transformnour approach to transformation.,To do that,,we need to start putting people first. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)"Mom, who are these people?",It was an innocent questionnfrom my young daughter Alia,around the time when she was three.,We were walking along with my husband,in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.,Alia was peering at a huge posternstanding tall in the middle of the mall.,It featured the three rulersnof the United Arab Emirates.,As she tucked in my side,,I bent down and explainednthat these were the rulers of the UAE,who had worked hardnto develop their nation,and preserve its unity.,She asked, "Mom, why is itnthat here where we live,,and back in Lebanon,nwhere grandma and grandpa live,,we never see the picturesnof powerful women on the walls?,Is it because women are not important?" 
 This is probably the hardest questionnI've had to answer in my years as a parent,and in my 16-plus yearsnof professional life, for that matter.,I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,,the younger of two daughtersnto a very hard-working pilot,and director of operationsnfor the Lebanese Airlines,and a super-supportivenstay-at-home mom and grandma.,My father had encouragednmy sister and I to pursue our education,even though our culturenemphasized at the time,that it was sons and not daughtersnwho should be professionally motivated.,I was one of very few girlsnof my generation,who left home at 18 to study abroad.,My father didn't have a son,,and so I, in a sense, became his. 
 Fast-forward a couple of decades,nand I hope I didn't do too badly,in making my father proudnof his would-be son.,As I got my Bachelor's and PhDnin electrical engineering,,did R&D in the UK,nthen consulting in the Middle East,,I have always beennin male-dominated environments.,Truth be told, I have never foundna role model I could truly identify with.,My mother's generationnwasn't into professional leadership.,There were somenencouraging men along the way,,but none knew the demandsnand pressures I was facing,,pressures that got particularly acutenwhen I had my own two beautiful children.,And although Western women love to give usnpoor, oppressed Arab women advice,,they live different livesnwith different constraints. 
 So Arab women of my generationnhave had to become our own role models.,We have had to juggle more than Arab men,,and we have had to facenmore cultural rigidity than Western women.,As a result, I would like to thinknthat we poor, oppressed women,actually have some useful,ncertainly hard-earned lessons to share,,lessons that might turn out useful,for anyone wishing to thrivenin the modern world.,Here are three of mine. 
 ["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 There is this word that everybodynis touting as the key to success:,resilience.,Well, what exactly is resilience,nand how do you develop it?,I believe resilience is simplynthe ability to transform shit into fuel. 
 In my previous job,nwell before my current firm,,I was working with a mannwe will call John.,I had teamed up with Johnnand was working hard,,hoping he would notice how great I was,and that he would come to supportnmy case to make partner at the firm.,I was, in addition to deliveringnon my consulting projects,,writing passionately on the topicnof women economic empowerment.,One day, I got to present my researchnto a roomful of MBA students.,John was part of the audience,listening for the first timento the details of my study.,As I proceeded with my presentation,,I could see John in the corner of my eye.,He had turned a dark shade of pink,and had slid under his chairnin apparent shame. 
 I finished my presentationnto an applauding audience,and we rushed out and jumped into the car.,There he exploded.,"What you did up there was unacceptable!,You are a consultant, not an activist!",I said, "John, I don't understand.,I presented a couple ofngender parity indices,,and some conclusions about the Arab world.,Yes, we do happen to be todaynat the bottom of the index,,but what is it that I said or presentednthat was not factual?" 
 To which he replied,n"The whole premise of your study is wrong.,What you are doing is dangerous and willnbreak the social fabric of our society.",He paused, then added,,"When women have children,ntheir place is in the home." 
 Time stood still for a long while,,and all I could think and repeatnin the chaos of my brain was:,"You can forget aboutnthat partnership, Leila.,It's just never going to happen.",It took me a couple of days to fullynabsorb this incident and its implications,,but once I did,nI reached three conclusions.,One, that these were his issues,,his complexes.,There may be many like him in our society,,but I would never letntheir issues become mine.,Two, that I needednanother sponsor, and fast. 
 (Laughter) 
 I got one, by the way,nand boy, was he great.,And three, that I would get to show Johnnwhat women with children can do.,I apply this lesson equally wellnto my personal life.,As I have progressed in my career,,I have received many wordsnof encouragement,,but I have also often been metnby women, men and couples,who have clearly had an issuenwith my husband and I,having chosen the pathnof a dual-career couple. 
 So you get this well-meaning couple,who tells you straight outnat a family gathering,or at a friends gathering,,that, come on, you must knownyou're not a great mom,,given how much you're investingnin your career, right?,I would lie if I saidnthese words didn't hurt.,My children are the mostnprecious thing to me,,and the thought that I could benfailing them in any way is intolerable.,But just like I did with John,,I quickly reminded myselfnthat these were their issues,,their complexes.,So instead of replying,,I gave back one of my largest smiles,as I saw, in flashing light,,the following sign in my mind's eye. 
 [Be happy, it drives people crazy.] 
 (Applause) 
 You see, as a young womannin these situations, you have two options.,You can either decidento internalize these negative messages,that are being thrown at you,,to let them make you feel like a failure,,like success is way too hardnto ever achieve,,or you can choose to see that others'nnegativity is their own issue,,and instead transform itninto your own personal fuel.,I have learnednto always go for option two,,and I have found that it has taken menfrom strength to strength.,And it's true what they say:,success is the best revenge. 
 Some women in the Middle East,are lucky enough to be marriednto someone supportive of their career.,Correction: I should say "smart enough,",because who you marry is your own choice,,and you'd better marry someone supportivenif you plan to have a long career.,Still today, the Arab mannis not an equal contributor in the home.,It's simply not expected by our society,,and even frowned upon as not very manly.,As for the Arab woman,nour society still assumes,that her primary source of happinessnshould be the happiness and prosperity,of her children and husband.,She mostly exists for her family.,Things are changing,nbut it will take time. 
 For now, it meansnthat the professional Arab woman,has to somehow maintain the perfect home,,make sure that her children's every neednis being taken care of,and manage her demanding career.,To achieve this, I have found the hard way,that you need to apply your hard-earnednprofessional skills to your personal life.,You need to work your life. 
 Here is how I do this in my personal life.,One thing to know about the Middle East,is that nearly every familynhas access to affordable domestic help.,The challenge therefore becomesnhow to recruit effectively.,Just like I would in my business life,nI have based the selection,of who would support menwith my children while I'm at work,on a strong referral.,Cristina had workednfor four years with my sister,and the quality of her worknwas well-established.,She is now an integralnmember of our family,,having been with usnsince Alia was six months old.,She makes sure that the housenis running smoothly while I'm at work,,and I make sure to empower her,in the most optimal conditionsnfor her and my children,,just like I would my best talent at work.,This lesson appliesnwhatever your childcare situation,,whether an au pair, nursery,,part-time nannynthat you share with someone else.,Choose very carefully, and empower. 
 If you look at my calendar,,you will see every working day,one and a half hoursnfrom 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time,blocked and called "family time.",This is sacred time.,I have done thisnever since Alia was a baby.,I do everything in my powernto protect this time,so that I can be home by thennto spend quality time with my children,,asking them about their day,,checking up on homework,nreading them a bedtime story,and giving themnlots of kisses and cuddles.,If I'm traveling,nin whatever the time zone,,I use Skype to connect with my childrenneven if I am miles away.,Our son Burhan is five years old,,and he's learning to readnand do basic maths. 
 Here's another confession:,I have found that our daughternis actually more successful,at teaching him these skills than I am. 
 (Laughter) 
 It started as a game, but Alia lovesnplaying teacher to her little brother,,and I have found that these sessionsnactually improve Burhan's literacy,,increase Alia's sense of responsibility,,and strengthen the bonding between them,,a win-win all around. 
 The successful Arab women I know,have each found their unique approachnto working their life,as they continue to shoulder,the lion's sharenof responsibility in the home. 
 But this is not justnabout surviving in your dual role,as a career woman and mother.,This is also about being in the present.,When I am with my children,,I try to leave work out of our lives.,Instead of worrying about how many minutesnI can spend with them every day,,I focus on turning these minutesninto memorable moments,,moments where I'm seeing my kids,,hearing them, connecting with them. 
 ["Join forces, don't compete."] 
 Arab women of my generationnhave not been very visible,in the public eye as they grew up.,This explains, I think, to some extent,,why you find so few womennin politics in the Arab world.,The upside of this, however,,is that we have spent a lot of time,developing a social skillnbehind the scenes,,in coffee shops, in living rooms,,on the phone,,a social skill that isnvery important to success:,networking.,I would say the average Arab woman,has a large networknof friends and acquaintances.,The majority of those are also women. 
 In the West, it seems like ambitious womennoften compare themselves to other women,hoping to be noticed as the mostnsuccessful woman in the room.,This leads to the much-spoken-aboutncompetitive behavior,between professional women.,If there's only roomnfor one woman at the top,,then you can't make room for others,nmuch less lift them up. 
 Arab women, generally speaking,,have not fallennfor this psychological trap.,Faced with a patriarchal society,,they have foundnthat by helping each other out,,all benefit. 
 In my previous job, I was the mostnsenior woman in the Middle East,,so one could think that investingnin my network of female colleagues,couldn't bring many benefits,and that I should instead invest my time,developing my relationshipsnwith male seniors and peers.,Yet two of my biggest breaksncame through the support of other women.,It was the head of marketingnwho initially suggested,I be considered as a young global leadernto the World Economic Forum.,She was familiar with my media engagementsnand my publications,,and when she was askednto voice her opinion,,she highlighted my name.,It was a young consultant,na Saudi lady and friend,,who helped me sellnmy first project in Saudi Arabia,,a market I was finding hardnto gain traction in as a woman.,She introduced me to a client,,and that introduction led to the firstnof very many projects for me in Saudi.,Today, I have two senior women on my team,,and I see making them successfulnas key to my own success.,Women continue to advance in the world,,not fast enough, but we're moving. 
 The Arab world, too, is making progress,ndespite many recent setbacks.,Just this year, the UAE appointednfive new female ministers to its cabinet,,for a total of eight female ministers.,That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,,and more than manyndeveloped countries can claim.,This is today my daughternAlia's favorite picture.,This is the result,nno doubt, of great leadership,,but it is also the resultnof strong Arab women,not giving up and continuouslynpushing the boundaries.,It is the result of Arab womenndeciding every day like me,to convert shit into fuel,,to work their lifento keep work out of their life,,and to join forces and not compete. 
 As I look to the future,,my hopes for my daughternwhen she stands on this stage,some 20, 30 years from now,are that she be as proudnto call herself her mother's daughter,as her father's daughter. 
 My hopes for my son,are that by then, the expressionn"her mother's son" or "mama's boy",would have taken onna completely different meaning. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Imagine you are a partnof a crew of astronauts,traveling to Mars or some distant planet.,The travel time could take a year,or even longer.,The space on board and the resources,would be limited.,So you and the crew would havento figure out how to produce food,with minimal inputs.,What if you could bring with younjust a few packets of seeds,,and grow crops in a matter of hours?,And what if those cropsnwould then make more seeds,,enabling you to feed the entire crew,with just those few packets of seedsnfor the duration of the trip? 
 Well, the scientists at NASA actuallynfigured out a way to do this.,What they came up withnwas actually quite interesting.,It involved microorganisms,,which are single-celled organisms.,And they also used hydrogen from water.,The types of microbes that they usednwere called hydrogenotrophs,,and with these hydrogenotrophs,nyou can create a virtuous carbon cycle,that would sustain lifenonboard a spacecraft.,Astronauts would breathe outncarbon dioxide,,that carbon dioxide would thennbe captured by the microbes,and converted into a nutritious,ncarbon-rich crop.,The astronauts would then eatnthat carbon-rich crop,and exhale the carbon outnin the form of carbon dioxide,,which would then be capturednby the microbes,,to create a nutritious crop,,which then would be exhalednin the form of carbon dioxide,by the astronauts.,So in this way, a closed-loopncarbon cycle is created. 
 So why is this important?,We need carbon to survive as humans,,and we get our carbon from food.,On a long space journey,,you simply wouldn't be able to pick upnany carbon along the way,,so you'd have to figure outnhow to recycle it on board. 
 This is a clever solution, right?,But the thing is, that researchndidn't really go anywhere.,We haven't yet gone to Mars.nWe haven't yet gone to another planet.,And this was actually donenin the '60s and '70s.,So a colleague of mine,nDr. John Reed, and I,,were interested, actually,nin carbon recycling here on Earth.,We wanted to come upnwith technical solutions,to address climate change.,And we discovered this research,by reading some papers publishednin the '60s -- 1967 and later --,articles about this work.,And we thought it was a really good idea.,So we said, well, Earthnis actually like a spaceship.,We have limited spacenand limited resources,,and on Earth, we really donneed to figure out,how to recycle our carbon better. 
 So we had the idea,,can we take some of thesenNASA-type ideas and apply them,to our carbon problem here on Earth?,Could we cultivatenthese NASA-type microbes,in order to makenvaluable products here on Earth?,We started a company to do it.,And in that company, we discoverednthat these hydrogenotrophs --,which I'll actually callnnature's supercharged carbon recyclers --,we found that they are a powerfulnclass of microbes,that had been largely overlookednand understudied,,and that they could makensome really valuable products. 
 So we began cultivating these products,nthese microbes, in our lab.,We found that we can makenessential amino acids from carbon dioxide,using these microbes.,And we even made a protein-rich meal,that has an amino acid profilensimilar to what you might find,in some animal proteins.,We began cultivating them even further,,and we found that we can make oil.,Oils are used to manufacturenmany products.,We made an oil that was similarnto a citrus oil,,which can be used for flavoringnand for fragrances,,but it also can be usednas a biodegradable cleaner,or even as a jet fuel.,And we made an oilnthat's similar to palm oil.,Palm oil is used to manufacture,a wide range of consumernand industrial goods. 
 We began working with manufacturersnto scale up this technology,,and we're currently working with them,to bring some of these products to market.,We believe this type of technologyncan indeed help us,profitably recycle carbon dioxideninto valuable products --,something that's beneficialnfor the planet,but also beneficial for business.,That's what we're doing today.,But tomorrow, this type of technologynand using these types of microbes,actually could help usndo something even greater,if we take it to the next level.,We believe that this type of technology,can actually help us addressnan issue with agriculture,and allow us to createna type of agriculture that's sustainable,,that will allow us to scalento meet the demands of tomorrow. 
 And why might we needna sustainable agriculture?,Well, actually, it is estimated,that the population will reachnabout 10 billion by 2050,,and we're projecting that we will neednto increase food production,by 70 percent.,In addition, we will need many morenresources and raw materials,to make consumer goodsnand industrial goods.,So how will we scale to meet that demand? 
 Well, modern agriculture simply cannotnsustainably scale to meet that demand.,There are a number of reasons why.,One of them is that modern agriculturenis one of the largest emitters,of greenhouse gases.,In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases,than our cars, our trucks, our planes,and our trains combined.,Another reason is that modern agnsimply takes up a whole lot of land.,We have cleared 19.4 million square milesnfor crops and livestock.,What does that look like?,Well, that's roughly the sizenof South America and Africa combined. 
 Let me give you a specific example.,In Indonesia, an amountnof virgin rainforest was cleared,totaling the sizenof approximately Ireland,,between 2000 and 2012.,Just think of allnof the species, the diversity,,that was removed in the process,,whether plant life, insectsnor animal life.,And a natural carbon sinknwas also removed. 
 So let me make this real for you.,This clearing happened primarilynto make room for palm plantations.,And as I mentioned before,,palm oil is usednto manufacture many products.,In fact, it is estimatednthat over 50 percent of consumer products,are manufactured using palm oil.,And that includes thingsnlike ice cream, cookies ...,It includes cooking oils.,It also includes detergents,nlotions, soaps.,You and I bothnprobably have numerous items,in our kitchens and our bathrooms,that were manufactured using palm oil.,So you and I are direct beneficiariesnof removed rainforests. 
 Modern ag has some problems,,and we need solutionsnif we want to scale sustainably.,I believe that microbesncan be a part of the answer --,specifically, these superchargedncarbon recyclers.,These supercharged carbon recyclers,,like plants, serve asnthe natural recyclers,in their ecosystems where they thrive.,And they thrive in exotic places on Earth,,like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.,In those ecosystems,nthey take carbon and recycle it,into the nutrients needednfor those ecosystems.,And they're rich in nutrients,,such as oils and proteins,nminerals and carbohydrates. 
 And actually, microbes are alreadynan integral part of our everyday lives.,If you enjoy a glass of pinot noirnon a Friday night,,after a long, hard work week,,then you are enjoyingna product of microbes.,If you enjoy a beernfrom your local microbrewery --,a product of microbes.,Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt.,These are all products of microbes.,But the beauty and power associatednwith these supercharged carbon recyclers,lies in the fact that they cannactually produce in a matter of hours,versus months.,That means we can make crops,much faster than we're making them today.,They grow in the dark,,so they can grow in any season,and in any geography and any location.,They can grow in containersnthat require minimal space.,And we can get to a typenof vertical agriculture.,Instead of our traditionalnhorizontal agriculture,that requires so much land,,we can scale vertically,,and as a resultnproduce much more product per area. 
 If we implement this type of approachnand use these carbon recyclers,,then we wouldn't have to removenany more rainforests,to make the food and the goodsnthat we consume.,Because, at a large scale,,you can actually make 10,000 timesnmore output per land area,than you could -- for instance,nif you used soybeans --,if you planted soybeansnon that same area of land,over a period of a year.,Ten thousand timesnover a period of a year.,So this is what I meannby a new type of agriculture.,And this is what I meannby developing a system,that allows us to sustainably scalento meet the demands of 10 billion. 
 And what would be the productsnof this new type of agriculture?,Well, we've already made a protein meal,,so you can imagine somethingnsimilar to a soybean meal,,or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.,We've already made oils,,so you can imagine somethingnsimilar to coconut oil,or olive oil or soybean oil.,So this type of crop cannactually produce the nutrients,that would give us pasta and bread,,cakes, nutritional items of many sorts.,Furthermore, since oil is usednto manufacture multiple other goods,,industrial products and consumer products,,you can imagine being able to makendetergents, soaps, lotions, etc.,,using these types of crops. 
 Not only are we running out of space,,but if we continue to operatenunder the status quo,with modern agriculture,,we run the risk of robbing our progenynof a beautiful planet.,But it doesn't have to be this way.,We can imagine a future of abundance.,Let us create systems that keepnplanet Earth, our spaceship,,not only from not crashing,,but let us also develop systemsnand ways of living,that will be beneficialnto the lives of ourselves,and the 10 billion that willnbe on this planet by 2050. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Imagine that you are a product designer.,And you've designed a product,,a new type of product,ncalled the human immune system.,You're pitching this product,to a skeptical, strictlynno-nonsense manager.,Let's call him Bob.,I think we all knownat least one Bob, right?,How would that go? 
 Bob, I've got this incredible idea,for a completely new typenof personal health product.,It's called the human immune system.,I can see from your face thatnyou're having some problems with this.,Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.,I don't want to take younthrough the gory details,,I just want to tell you about somenof the amazing features of this product.,First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy,by having millions of copiesnof each component --,leukocytes, white blood cells --,before they're actually needed,,to create a massive buffernagainst the unexpected.,And it cleverly leverages diversity,by having not just leukocytesnbut B cells, T cells,,natural killer cells, antibodies.,The components don't really matter.,The point is that together,,this diversity of different approachesncan cope with more or less anything,that evolution has been able to throw up.,And the design is completely modular.,You have the surface barriernof the human skin,,you have the very rapidly reactingninnate immune system,and then you have the highly targetednadaptive immune system.,The point is, that if one system fails,nanother can take over,,creating a virtually foolproof system. 
 I can see I'm losing you, Bob,nbut stay with me,,because here is the really killer feature.,The product is completely adaptive.,It's able to actually developntargeted antibodies,to threats that it's neverneven met before.,It actually also does thisnwith incredible prudence,,detecting and reactingnto every tiny threat,,and furthermore, rememberingnevery previous threat,,in case they are ever encountered again.,What I'm pitching you todaynis actually not a stand-alone product.,The product is embeddednin the larger system of the human body,,and it works in complete harmonynwith that system,,to create this unprecedented levelnof biological protection.,So Bob, just tell me honestly,nwhat do you think of my product? 
 And Bob may say something like,,I sincerely appreciatenthe effort and passion,that have gone into your presentation,,blah blah blah -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But honestly, it's total nonsense.,You seem to be saying that the keynselling points of your product,are that it is inefficient and complex.,Didn't they teach you 80-20?,And furthermore, you're sayingnthat this product is siloed.,It overreacts,,makes things up as it goes along,and is actually designednfor somebody else's benefit.,I'm sorry to break it to you,nbut I don't think this one is a winner. 
 If we went with Bob's philosophy,,I think we'd actually end upnwith a more efficient immune system.,And efficiency is always importantnin the short term.,Less complex, more efficient,nmore bang for the buck.,Who could say no to that?,Unfortunately, there's onenvery tiny problem,,and that is that the usernof this product, you or I,,would probably dienwithin one week of the next winter,,when we encountered a new strainnof the influenza virus. 
 I first became interestednin biology and business,,and longevity and resilience,,when I was asked a very unusual question,by the CEO of a global tech company.,And the question was:,What do we have to do to make surenthat our company lasts 100 years?,A seemingly innocent question,,but actually, it's a little trickiernthan you might think,,considering that the averagenUS public company now,can expect a life span of only 30 years.,That is less than half of the life span,that its employees can expect to enjoy. 
 Now, if you were the CEOnof such a company,,badgered by investorsnand buffeted by change,,we might forgive younfor not even worrying too much,about what happens 30 years out.,But here's something that shouldnkeep you awake at night:,the probability that your companynwill not be around in five year's time,,on average, is nowna staggering 32 percent.,That's a one in three chancenthat your company will be taken over,or will fail within just five years. 
 Let's come backnto our tech CEO's question.,Where better to turnnfor advice than nature,,that's been in the businessnof life and death,for longer than any company?,As a lapsed biologist,,I decided to immediately callna real biologist,,my friend Simon Levin,,Professor of Biology and Mathematicsnat Princeton University.,Together, we looked at a varietynof biological systems,,ranging from natural tropical rainforests,through to managed forests and fisheries.,And we asked ourselves the question:,What makes these systemsnresilient and enduring? 
 And what we foundnwas that the same six principles,that we saw underpinningnthe miracle of the human immune system,actually cropped up again and again,,from redundancy through to embeddedness.,In fact, we saw these principlesnnot only in biologically enduring systems,,we also found themnbeing very characteristic,of long-lived social systems,,like the Roman Empirenand the Catholic Church,,believe it or not.,We also went on to look at business,,and found that these very same propertiesnalso characterized businesses,that were resilient and long-lived,,and we noted their absencenfrom ones which were short-lived. 
 Let's first take a look at what happensnwhen the corporate immune system,collapses.,This beautiful building is partnof the Shitennoji Temple Complex,in Osaka, Japan.,In fact, it's one of the oldestntemples in Japan.,It was built by a Korean artisan,,because at the time,nJapan was not yet building temples.,And this Korean artisan went onnto found a temple-building company.,Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi,,was still around 1,428 years later.,In fact, it became the oldestncontinuously operating company,in the world. 
 So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?,Not too well, I'm afraid.,It borrowed very heavily,during the bubble periodnof the Japanese economy,,to invest in real estate.,And when the bubble burst,nit couldn't refinance its loans.,The company failed,,and it was taken overnby a major construction company.,Tragically, after 40 generationsnof very careful stewardship,by the Kongō family,,Kongō Gumi succumbednto a spectacular lapse,in the ability to applyna principle of prudence. 
 Speaking of company failures:,we're all familiarnwith the failure of Kodak,,the company that declared bankruptcy,in January 2012.,Much more interesting,nhowever, is the question:,Why did Fujifilm --,same product, same pressuresnfrom digital technology, same time --,why was Fujifilmnable to survive and flourish? 
 Fujifilm used its capabilitiesnin chemistry, material science and optics,to diversify into a number of areas,,ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,,to medical systems to biomaterials.,Some of these diversificationnattempts failed.,But in aggregate,,it was able to adaptnits portfolio sufficiently,to survive and flourish.,As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,,the strategy succeedednbecause it had "more pockets and drawers",than the rivals.,He meant, of course,,that they were able to createnmore options than the rivals.,Fujifilm survived because it appliednthe principles of prudence,,diversity,and adaptation. 
 A catastrophic factory fire,nlike the one we see here,,completely wiped out, in one evening,,the only plant which supplied Toyotanwith valves for car-braking systems.,The ultimate test of resilience.,Car production groundnto a screeching halt.,How was it, then, that Toyotanwas able to recover car production?,Can you imagine how long it took?,Just five days.,From having no braking valvesnto complete recovery in five days.,How was this possible?,Toyota managed its network of suppliersnin such a collaborative manner,that it could work very quicklynand smoothly with suppliers,to repurpose production,,fill the missing braking valve capacity,and have car production come online again.,Toyota applied the principlesnof modularity of its supply network,,embeddedness in an integrated system,and the functional redundancynto be able to repurpose, smoothly,,existing capacity. 
 Now fortunately, few companiesnsuccumb to catastrophic fires.,But we do read in the newspapernevery day about companies,succumbing to the disruptionnof technology.,How is it, then, that the consumernoptics giant Essilor,is able to avoid technology disruption,nand even profit from it?,And yes, technology disruptionnis not only a big deal,in software and electronics.,Essilor carefully scansnthe competitive environment,for potentially disruptive technologies.,It acquires those technologies very early,,before they've become expensivenor competitors have mobilized around them,,and it then developsnthose technologies itself,,even at the risk of failure,or the risk of self-disruption.,Essilor stays ahead of its game,,and has delivered spectacular performance,for over 40 years,,by using the principlesnof prudence and adaptation. 
 OK, if these principles are so powerful,nyou might be thinking,,why are they not commonplace in business?,Why do we not use these words every day?,Well, change has to firstnstart in the mind.,If we think back to our pitch to Bob,,in order to apply the principles,that underpin the miraclenof the human immune system,,we first need to think differently,about business.,Now typically, when we thinknabout business,,we use what I call "mechanical thinking.",We set goals,,we analyze problems,,we construct and we adhere to plans,,and more than anything else,,we stress efficiencynand short-term performance.,Now, don't get me wrong --,this is a splendidly practicalnand effective way,of addressing relatively simple challenges,in relatively stable environments.,It's the way that Bob -- and probablynmany of us, myself included --,process most business problemsnwe're faced with every day.,In fact, it was a pretty goodnmental model for business --,overall --,until about the mid-1980s,,when the conjunction of globalization,and a revolution in technologynand telecommunications,made business far morendynamic and unpredictable. 
 But what about those more dynamicnand unpredictable situations,that we now increasingly face?,I think in additionnto the mechanical thinking,,we now need to master the artnof biological thinking,,as embodied by our six principles.,In other words, we need to thinknmore modestly and subtly,about when and how,we can shape, rather than control,,unpredictable and complex situations.,It's a little like the differencenbetween throwing a ball,and releasing a bird.,The ball would head in a straight line,,probably towards the intended target,,and the bird certainly would not. 
 So what do you think?,Sounds a little impractical,na little theoretical, perhaps?,Not at all.,Every small entrepreneurial company,naturally thinks and acts biologically.,Why?,Because it lacks the resourcesnto shape its environment,through brute force.,It lacks the scale to buffer change,,and it's constantly thinkingnabout the tough odds,for a start-up to survive.,Now, the irony is, of course,,that every large company started offnas a small, entrepreneurial company.,But along the way somewhere,,many have lost this abilitynto think and act biologically.,They need to rejuvenatentheir ability to think biologically,in order to survive and thrivenin today's environment. 
 So let's not just thinknabout short-term performance.,Every company I know spends plenty of time,thinking about the centralnquestion of strategy:,How good is our competitive game?,In addition, let's also consider,the second, more biologicalnand equally important question:,How long will that game last? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I want to tell younabout the future of money.,Let's start with a storynabout this culture,that lived in Micronesianin the early 1900s, called the Yap.,Now, I want to tell you about the Yap,because their form of moneynis really interesting.,They use these limestone discsncalled Rai stones.,Now, the Yap don't actuallynmove these Rai stones around,or exchange them the waynwe do with our coins,,because Rai stones can getnto be pretty massive.,The largest is about four tonsnand 12 feet across.,So the Yap just keep tracknof who owns part of what stone. 
 There's a story about these sailors,that were transporting a stonenacross the ocean,when they ran into some troublenand the stone actually fell in.,The sailors got back to the main island,and they told everyone what had happened.,And everyone decided that, actually, yes,,the sailors had the stonenand -- why not? -- it still counted.,Even though it wasnat the bottom of the ocean,,it was still part of the Yap economy. 
 You might think that thisnwas just a small culture,a hundred years ago.,But things like this happennin the Western world as well,,and the Yap actually still usena form of these stones. 
 In 1932, the Bank of Francenasked the United States,to convert their holdingsnfrom dollars into gold.,But it was too inconvenientnto think about actually shipping,all of that gold over to Europe.,So instead, someone went to wherenthat gold was being stored,and they just labeled itnas belonging to France now.,And everyone agreednthat France owned the gold.,It's just like those Rai stones. 
 The point I want to makenwith these two examples,is that there's nothingninherently valuable,about a dollar or a stone or a coin.,The only reason these thingsnhave any value,is because we've all decided they should.,And because we've decided that,,they do.,Money is about the exchangesnand the transactions,that we have with each other.,Money isn't anything objective.,It's about a collective storynthat we tell each other about value.,A collective fiction.,And that's a really powerful concept. 
 In the past two decades,,we've begun to use digital money.,So I get paid via direct deposit,,I pay my rent via bank transfer,,I pay my taxes online.,And every month,,a small amount of moneynis deducted from my paycheck,and invested in mutual fundsnin my retirement account.,All of these interactions,are literally just changingn1's and 0's on computers.,There's not even anything physical,nlike a stone or a coin.,Digital money makes itnso that I can pay someone around the world,in seconds. 
 Now when this works,,it's because there are large institutionsnunderwriting every 1 or 0,that changes on a computer.,And when it doesn't,,it's often the faultnof those large institutions.,Or at least, it's up to themnto fix the problem.,And a lot of times, they don't.,There's a lot of friction in the system.,How long did it takenthe US credit card companies,to implement chip and pin?,Half my credit cardsnstill don't work in Europe.,That's friction.,Transferring money across bordersnand across currencies,is really expensive:,friction.,An entrepreneur in Indiancan set up an online business in minutes,,but it's hard for hernto get loans and to get paid:,friction.,Our access to digital moneynand our ability to freely transact,is being held captivenby these gatekeepers.,And there's a lot of impedimentsnin the system slowing things down. 
 That's because digital moneynisn't really mine,,it's entries in databasesnthat belong to my bank,,my credit card companynor my investment firm.,And these companiesnhave the right to say "no.",If I'm a PayPal merchant,and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,,that's it.,My account gets frozen,nand I can't get paid. 
 These institutions are standingnin the way of innovation.,How many of you usenFacebook photos, Google Photos,,Instagram?,My photos are everywhere.,They are on my phone,nthey're on my laptop,,they're on my old phone,nthey're in Dropbox.,They're on all these differentnwebsites and services.,And most of these servicesndon't work together.,They don't inter-operate.,And as a result,,my photo library is a mess. 
 The same thing happens,when institutions controlnthe money supply.,A lot of these servicesndon't inter-operate,,and as a result, this blocksnwhat we can do with payment.,And it makes transaction costs go up.,So far, we've been throughntwo phases of money.,In an analog world, we hadnto deal with these physical objects,,and money moved at a certain speed --nthe speed of humans.,In a digital world, money can reachnmuch farther and is much faster,,but we're at the mercynof these gatekeeper institutions.,Money only moves at the speed of banks. 
 We're about to enter a new phase of money.,The future of money is programmable.,When we combine software and currency,,money becomes morenthan just a static unit of value,,and we don't have to relynon institutions for security.,In a programmable world,,we remove humansnand institutions from the loop.,And when this happens,,we won't even feel likenwe're transacting anymore.,Money will be directed by software,,and it will just safely and securely flow. 
 Cryptocurrencies are the first stepnof this evolution.,Cryptocurrencies are digital money,that isn't run by any government or bank.,It's money designed to worknin a world without intermediaries.,Bitcoin is the most ubiquitousncryptocurrency,,but there are hundreds of them.,There's Ethereum, Litecoin,nStellar, Dogecoin,,and those are just a fewnof the more popular ones.,And these things are real money.,The sushi restaurant down my street,takes Bitcoin.,I have an app on my phonenthat I can use to buy sashimi.,But it's not just for small transactions.,In March, there was a transactionnthat moved around 100,000 bitcoins.,That's the equivalentnof 40 million US dollars. 
 Cryptocurrencies are based onna special field of mathematics,called cryptography.,Cryptography is the studynof how to secure communication,,and it's about twonreally important things:,masking information so it cannbe hidden in plain sight,,and verifying a piecenof information's source.,Cryptography underpinsnso many of the systems around us.,And it's so powerful that at times,the US government has actuallynclassified it as a weapon. 
 During World War II,nbreaking cryptosystems like Enigma,was critical to decodingnenemy transmissions,and turning the tide of the war.,Today, anyone with a modernnweb browser is running,a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.,It's what we use to securenour interactions on the Internet.,It's what makes it safe for usnto type our passwords in,and to send financialninformation to websites.,So what the banks used to give us --,trustworthy digital money transfer --,we can now get with a clevernapplication of cryptography.,And this means that we don'tnhave to rely on the banks anymore,to secure our transactions.,We can do it ourselves. 
 Bitcoin is based on the very samenidea that the Yap used,,this collective globalnknowledge of transfers.,In Bitcoin, I spendnby transferring Bitcoin,,and I get paid when someonentransfers Bitcoin to me. 
 Imagine that we had this magic paper.,So the way that this paper worksnis I can give you a sheet of it,and if you write something on it,,it will magically appearnon my piece as well.,Let's say we just give everyone this paper,and everyone writes downnthe transfers that they're doing,in the Bitcoin system.,All of these transfers get copiednaround to everyone else's pieces of paper.,And I can look at mine,and I'll have a list of allnof the transfers that are happening,in the entire Bitcoin economy.,This is actually what's happeningnwith the Bitcoin blockchain,,which is a list of allnof the transactions in Bitcoin.,Except, it's not done through paper.,It's done through computer code,,running on thousandsnof networked computers,around the world.,All of these computersnare collectively confirming,who owns what Bitcoin.,So the Bitcoin blockchainnis core to how Bitcoin works. 
 But where do bitcoins actually come from?,Well, the code is designednto create new Bitcoin,according to a schedule.,And the way that it worksnis that to get those Bitcoin,,I have to solve a puzzle --na random cryptographic puzzle.,Imagine that we had 15 dice,,and we were throwing these dicenover and over again.,Whenever the dice come up all sixes,,we say that we win.,This is very close to what these computersnare all actually doing.,They're trying over and over againnto land on the right number.,And when they do,,we say that they've solved the puzzle. 
 The computer that solves the puzzle,publishes its solutionnto the rest of the network,and collects its reward: new bitcoins.,And in the act of solving this puzzle,,these computers are actuallynhelping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain,and add to the list of transactions. 
 There are actually peoplenall over the world running this software,,and we call them Bitcoin miners.,Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.,You can go download the software right now,and run it in your computernand try to collect some bitcoins.,I can't say that I would recommend it,,because right now, the puzzle is so hardnand the network is so powerful,,that if I tried to minenBitcoin on my laptop,,I probably wouldn't see anynfor about two million years.,The miners, professional miners,nuse this special hardware,that's designed to solventhe puzzle really fast.,Now, the Bitcoin networknand all of this special hardware,,there are estimatesnthat the amount of energy it uses,is equivalent to that of a small country.,So, the first set of cryptocurrencies,are a little bit slownand a little bit cumbersome.,But the next generation is goingnto be so much better and so much faster. 
 Cryptocurrencies are the first step,to a world with a globalnprogrammable money.,And in a world with programmable money,,I can pay anyone else securely,without having to sign upnor ask permission,,or do a conversion or worrynabout my money getting stuck.,And I can send money around the world.,This is a really amazing thing.,It's the idea of permission-less innovation.,The Internet causednan explosion of innovation,,because it was built uponnan open architecture.,And just like the Internetnchanged the way we communicate,,programmable money is goingnto change the way we pay,,allocate and decide on value. 
 So what kind of worldndoes programmable money create?,Imagine a world where I cannrent out my healthcare data,to a pharmaceutical company.,They can run large-scale data analysis,and provide me with a cryptographic proof,that shows they're only using my datanin a way that we agreed.,And they can pay menfor what they find out.,Instead of signing upnfor streaming services,and getting a cable bill,,what if my television analyzednmy watching habits,and recommended well-priced contentnthat fit within my budget,that I would enjoy?,Imagine an Internet without ads,,because instead of payingnwith our attention when we view content,,we just pay. 
 Interestingly, things like micro-payments,are actually going to changenthe way security works in our world,,because once we're better ablento allocate value,,people will use their moneynand their energies,for more constructive things.,If it cost a fraction of a centnto send an email,,would we still have spam? 
 We're not at this world yet,,but it's coming.,Right now, it's like we're in a worldnthat is seeing the first automobile.,The first cryptocurrency,nlike the first car,,is slow and hard to understandnand hard to use.,Digital money,nlike the horse and carriage,,works pretty well,,and the whole world economynis built on it.,If you were the first person on your block,to get a car with an internalncombustion engine,,your neighbors would probablynthink you were crazy:,"Why would you wantnthis large, clunky machine,that breaks down all the time,nthat lights on fire,,and is still slower than a horse?",But we all know how that story turns out. 
 We're entering a new eranof programmable money.,And it's very exciting,nbut it's also a little bit scary.,Cryptocurrencies can be usednfor illegal transactions,,just like cash is used for crimenin the world today.,When all of our transactions are online,,what does that mean for surveillance --nwho can see what we do?,Who's advantagednin this new world and who isn't?,Will I have to start to pay for thingsnthat I didn't have to pay for before?,Will we all become slavesnto algorithms and utility functions? 
 All new technology comes with trade-offs.,The Internet brought usna lot of ways to waste time.,But it also greatlynincreased productivity.,Mobile phones are annoying,because they make me feelnlike I have to stay connected to work,all the time.,But they also help me stay connectednto friends and family.,The new sharing economynis going to eliminate some jobs.,But it's also going to creatennew, flexible forms of employment.,With programmable money,,we decouple the neednfor large, trusted institutions,from the architecture of the network.,And this pushes innovation in moneynout to the edges, where it belongs.,Programmable money democratizes money.,And because of this,nthings are going to change and unfold,in ways that we can't even predict. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Two hundred years of modern science.,We have to admit,that our performance is not great.,The machines we build continuento suffer from mechanical failures.,The houses we buildndo not survive severe earthquakes.,But we shouldn't be so criticalnof our scientists for a simple reason:,they didn't have much time.,Two hundred years is not a lot of time,,while nature had three billion years,to perfect some of the mostnamazing materials,,that we wish we had in our possession.,Remember, these materialsncarry a quality assurance,of three billion years. 
 Take, for example, sequoia trees.,They carry hundreds of tonsnfor hundreds of years,in cold weather, in warm climates,,UV light.,Yet, if you look at the structurenby high-resolution electron microscopy,,and you ask yourself, what is it made of,,surprisingly, it's made of sugar.,Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.,It's actually a nanofiberncalled nanocrystalline cellulose.,And this nanocrystalline cellulosenis so strong, on a weight basis,,it's about 10 times stronger than steel.,Yet it's made of sugar. 
 So scientists all over the worldnbelieve that nanocellulose,is going to be one of the most importantnmaterials for the entire industry.,But here's the problem:,say you want to buyna half a ton of nanocellulose,to build a boat or an airplane.,Well, you can Google, you can eBay,nyou can even Alibaba.,You won't find it.,Of course, you're going to findnthousands of scientific papers --,great papers, where scientistsnare going to say this is a great material,,there are lots of thingsnwe can do with it.,But no commercial source. 
 So we at the Hebrew University,ntogether with our partners in Sweden,,decided to focus on the developmentnof an industrial-scale process,to produce this nanocellulose.,And, of course,nwe didn't want to cut trees.,So we were looking for another source,of raw material,,and we found one -- in fact,nthe sludge of the paper industry.,The reason: there is a lot of it.,Europe alone produces 11 million tons,of that material annually.,It's the equivalent of a mountainnthree kilometers high,,sitting on a soccer field.,And we produce this mountain every year.,So for everybody,nit's an environmental problem,,and for us, it's a gold mine. 
 So now, we are actually producing,non an industrial scale in Israel,,nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.,We can do a lot of thingsnwith the material.,For example,,we have shown that by addingnonly a small percent of nanocellulose,into cotton fibers, the samenas my shirt is made of,,it increases its strength dramatically.,So this can be usednfor making amazing things,,like super-fabrics for industrialnand medical applications.,But this is not the only thing.,For example, self-standing,nself-supporting structures,,like the shelters that you can see now,,actually are now showcasingnin the Venice Biennale for Architecture. 
 Nature actually didn't stop its wonders,in the plant kingdom.,Think about insects.,Cat fleas, for example,,have the ability to jumpnabout a hundred times their height.,That's amazing.,It's the equivalent of a person,standing in the middlenof Liberty Island in New York,,and in a single jump,,going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.,I'm sure everybody would like to do that.,So the question is:,How do cat fleas do it? 
 It turns out, they makenthis wonderful material,,which is called resilin.,In simple words, resilin,nwhich is a protein,,is the most elastic rubber on Earth.,You can stretch it,,you can squish it,,and it doesn't lose almost any energynto the environment.,When you release it -- snap!,It brings back all the energy.,So I'm sure everybodynwould like to have that material.,But here's the problem:,to catch cat fleas is difficult. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why? Because they are jumpy. 
 (Laughter) 
 But now, it's actuallynenough to catch one.,Now we can extract its DNA,and read how cat fleas make the resilin,,and clone it into a less-jumpynorganism like a plant.,So that's exactly what we did.,Now we have the abilitynto produce lots of resilin. 
 Well, my team decided to do somethingnreally cool at the university.,They decided to combine,the strongest materialnproduced by the plant kingdom,with the most elastic materialnproduced by the insect kingdom --,nanocellulose with resilin.,And the result is amazing.,This material, in fact, is tough,nelastic and transparent.,So there are lots of thingsnthat can be done with this material.,For example, next-generation sport shoes,,so we can jump higher, run faster.,And even touch screensnfor computers and smartphones,,that won't break. 
 Well, the problem is,nwe continue to implant,synthetic implants in our body,,which we glue and screw into our body.,And I'm going to saynthat this is not a good idea.,Why? Because they fail.,This synthetic material fails,,just like this plastic fork,,that is not strong enoughnfor its performance.,But sometimes they are too strong,,and therefore their mechanicalnproperties do not really fit,their surrounding tissues. 
 But in fact, the reasonnis much more fundamental.,The reason is that in nature,,there is no one there,that actually takes my headnand screws it onto my neck,,or takes my skinnand glues it onto my body.,In nature, everything is self-assembled.,So every living cell,,whether coming from a plant,ninsect or human being,,has a DNA that encodesnfor nanobio building blocks.,Many times they are proteins.,Other times, they are enzymesnthat make other materials,,like polysaccharides, fatty acids.,And the common featurenabout all these materials,is that they need no one.,They recognize each othernand self-assemble,into structures -- scaffoldsnon which cells are proliferating,to give tissues.,They develop into organs,nand together bring life. 
 So we at the Hebrew University,nabout 10 years ago, decided to focus,on probably the most importantnbiomaterial for humans,,which is collagen.,Why collagen?,Because collagen accounts fornabout 25 percent of our dry weight.,We have nothing more than collagen,nother than water, in our body.,So I always like to say,,anyone who is in the replacementnparts of human beings,would like to have collagen. 
 Admittedly, before we started our project,,there were already morenthan 1,000 medical implants,made of collagen.,You know, simple things likendermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,,augment lips,,and other, more sophisticatednmedical implants, like heart valves.,So where is the problem?,Well, the problem is the source.,The source of all that collagen,is actually coming from dead bodies:,dead pigs, dead cows,and even human cadavers.,So safety is a big issue.,But it's not the only one.,Also, the quality. 
 Now here, I have a personal interest.,This is my father, Zvi,nin our winery in Israel.,A heart valve, very similarnto the one that I showed you before,,seven years ago,nwas implanted in his body.,Now, the scientific literature saysnthat these heart valves start to fail,10 years after the operation.,No wonder:,they are made from old, used tissues,,just like this wall made of bricksnthat is falling apart.,Yeah, of course, I can takenthose bricks and build a new wall.,But it's not going to be the same.,So the US Food and Drug Administration,made a notice already in 2007,,asking the companies to start to looknfor better alternatives. 
 So that's exactly what we did.,We decided to clone all the fivenhuman genes responsible,for making type I collagen in humans,into a transgenic tobacco plant.,So now, the plant has the abilitynto make human collagen brand new,,untouched.,This is amazing.,Actually, it's happening now.,Today in Israel, we grow itnin 25,000 square meters of greenhouses,all over the country.,The farmers receivensmall plantlets of tobacco.,It looks exactly like regular tobacco,,except that they have five human genes.,They're responsible for makingntype I collagen.,We grow them for about 50 to 70 days,,we harvest the leaves,,and then the leaves are transportednby cooling trucks to the factory.,There, the process of extractingnthe collagen starts. 
 Now, if you ever made a pesto --nessentially, the same thing. 
 (Laughter) 
 You crush the leaves, you getnthe juice that contains the collagen.,We concentrate the protein,,transfer the protein to clean roomsnfor the final purification,,and the end result is a collagennidentical to what we have in our body --,untouched, brand new,and from which we makendifferent medical implants:,bone void fillers, for example,,for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.,And more recently, even,,we've been able to launchninto the market here in Europe,a flowable gel that is usednfor diabetic foot ulcers,,that is now approvednfor use in the clinic. 
 This is not science fiction.,This is happening now.,We are using plantsnto make medical implants,for replacement parts for human beings.,In fact, more recently,nwe've been able to make collagen fibers,which are six times strongernthan the Achilles tendon.,That's amazing. 
 Together with our partners from Ireland,,we thought about the next thing:,adding resilin to those fibers.,By doing that,,we've been able to make a superfiber,which is about 380 percent tougher,,and 300 percent more elastic.,So oddly enough, in the future,,when a patient is transplantednwith artificial tendons or ligaments,made from these fibers,,we'll have better performancenafter the surgery,than we had before the injury. 
 So what's for the future?,In the future, we believenwe'll be able to make,many nanobio building blocksnthat nature provided for us --,collagen, nanocellulose,nresilin and many more.,And that will enable us to makenbetter machines perform better,,even the heart.,Now, this heartnis not going to be the same,as we can get from a donor.,It will be better.,It actually will perform better,and will last longer. 
 My friend Zion Suliman once told me,a smart sentence.,He said, "If you want a new idea,,you should open an old book.",And I'm going to saynthat the book was written.,It was written over three billion years,of evolution.,And the text is the DNA of life.,All we have to do,is read this text,,embrace nature's gift to us,and start our progress from here. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Imagine that you're a pig farmer.,You live on a small farmnin the Philippines.,Your animals are your family'snsole source of income --,as long as they're healthy.,You know that any day,,one of your pigs can catch the flu,,the swine flu.,Living in tight quarters,none pig coughing and sneezing,may soon lead to the next pigncoughing and sneezing,,until an outbreak of swine flunhas taken over your farm.,If it's a bad enough virus,,the health of your herd may be gonenin the blink of an eye.,If you called in a veterinarian,,he or she would visit your farmnand take samples,from your pigs' noses and mouths.,But then they would have to drivenback into the city,to test those samplesnin their central lab.,Two weeks later,nyou'd hear back the results.,Two weeks may be just enough timenfor infection to spread,and take away your way of life. 
 But it doesn't have to be that way.,Today, farmers can takenthose samples themselves.,They can jump right into the pennand swab their pigs' noses and mouths,with a little filter paper,,place that little filter papernin a tiny tube,,and mix it with some chemicalsnthat will extract genetic material,from their pigs' noses and mouths.,And without leaving their farms,,they take a drop of that genetic material,and put it into a little analyzernsmaller than a shoebox,,program it to detect DNA or RNAnfrom the swine flu virus,,and within one hour get back the results,nvisualize the results.,This reality is possible,because today we're living in the eranof personal DNA technology.,Every one of us can actuallyntest DNA ourselves. 
 DNA is the fundamental moleculenthe carries genetic instructions,that help build the living world.,Humans have DNA.,Pigs have DNA.,Even bacteria and somenviruses have DNA too.,The genetic instructions encoded in DNAninform how our bodies develop,,grow, function.,And in many cases, that same informationncan trigger disease.,Your genetic information,is strung into a long and twistednmolecule, the DNA double helix,,that has over three billion letters,,beginning to end.,But the lines that carrynmeaningful information,are usually very short --,a few dozen to severalnthousand letters long.,So when we're looking to answerna question based on DNA,,we actually don't need to read,all those three billionnletters, typically.,That would be like getting hungry at night,and having to flip throughnthe whole phone book,from cover to cover,,pausing at every line,,just to find the nearest pizza joint. 
 (Laughter) 
 Luckily, three decades ago,,humans started to invent tools,that can find any specific linenof genetic information.,These DNA machines are wonderful.,They can find any line in DNA.,But once they find it,,that DNA is still tiny, and surroundednby so much other DNA,,that what these machines then donis copy the target gene,,and one copy piles on top of another,,millions and millionsnand millions of copies,,until that gene stands outnagainst the rest;,until we can visualize it,,interpret it, read it, understand it,,until we can answer:,Does my pig have the flu?,Or other questions buried in our own DNA:,Am I at risk of cancer?,Am I of Irish descent?,Is that child my son? 
 (Laughter) 
 This ability to make copies of DNA,nas simple as it sounds,,has transformed our world.,Scientists use it every daynto detect and address disease,,to create innovative medicines,,to modify foods,,to assess whether our food is safe to eat,or whether it's contaminatednwith deadly bacteria.,Even judges use the outputnof these machines in court,to decide whether someone is innocentnor guilty based on DNA evidence.,The inventor of this DNA-copying technique,was awarded the Nobel Prizenin Chemistry in 1993.,But for 30 years,,the power of genetic analysisnhas been confined to the ivory tower,,or bigwig PhD scientist work.,Well, several companies around the world,are working on makingnthis same technology accessible,to everyday people like the pig farmer,,like you. 
 I cofounded one of these companies.,Three years ago,,together with a fellow biologistnand friend of mine,,Zeke Alvarez Saavedra,,we decided to make personal DNA machines,that anyone could use.,Our goal was to bring DNA sciencento more people in new places.,We started working in our basements.,We had a simple question:,What could the world look like,if everyone could analyze DNA?,We were curious,,as curious as you would have beennif I had shown you this picture in 1980. 
 (Laughter) 
 You would have thought, "Wow!,I can now callnmy Aunt Glenda from the car,and wish her a happy birthday.,I can call anyone, anytime.,This is the future!",Little did you know,,you would tap on that phonento make dinner reservations,for you and Aunt Glendanto celebrate together.,With another tap,nyou'd be ordering her gift.,And yet one more tap,,and you'd be "liking"nAuntie Glenda on Facebook.,And all of this,nwhile sitting on the toilet. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is notoriously hard to predictnwhere new technology might take us.,And the same is truenfor personal DNA technology today. 
 For example, I could never have imagined,that a truffle farmer, of all people,,would use personal DNA machines.,Dr. Paul Thomas growsntruffles for a living.,We see him pictured here,,holding the first UK-cultivated trufflenin his hands, on one of his farms.,Truffles are this delicacy,that stems from a fungusngrowing on the roots of living trees.,And it's a rare fungus.,Some species may fetch 3,000,n7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.,I learned from Paul,that the stakes for a truffle farmerncan be really high.,When he sources new trufflesnto grow on his farms,,he's exposed to the threatnof knockoffs --,truffles that look and feelnlike the real thing,,but they're of lower quality.,But even to a trained eye like Paul's,,even when looked at under a microscope,,these truffles can pass for authentic.,So in order to grownthe highest quality truffles,,the ones that chefsnall over the world will fight over,,Paul has to use DNA analysis.,Isn't that mind-blowing?,I bet you will never looknat that black truffle risotto again,without thinking of its genes. 
 (Laughter) 
 But personal DNA machinesncan also save human lives.,Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologistnat the University of Cambridge.,Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.,When the Ebola outbreaknbroke out in Western Africa,,he quickly realized that doctors therenlacked the basic tools,to detect and combat disease.,Results could takenup to a week to come back --,that's way too long for the patientsnand the families who are suffering.,Ian decided to move his labninto Makeni, Sierra Leone.,Here we see Ian Goodfellow,moving over 10 tons of equipmentninto a pop-up tent,that he would equip to detectnand diagnose the virus,and sequence it within 24 hours.,But here's a surprise:,the same equipment that Ian could usenat his lab in the UK,to sequence and diagnose Ebola,,just wouldn't work under these conditions.,We're talking 35 Celsius heatnand over 90 percent humidity here.,But instead, Ian could usenpersonal DNA machines,small enough to be placednin front of the air-conditioning unit,to keep sequencing the virus,and keep saving lives. 
 This may seem likenan extreme place for DNA analysis,,but let's move on to an evennmore extreme environment:,outer space.,Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.,When astronauts live aboardnthe International Space Station,,they're orbiting the planetn250 miles high.,They're travelingnat 17,000 miles per hour.,Picture that --,you're seeing 15 sunsetsnand sunrises every day.,You're also living in microgravity,,floating.,And under these conditions,nour bodies can do funky things.,One of these things is thatnour immune systems get suppressed,,making astronauts more prone to infection. 
 A 16-year-old girl,,a high school student from New York,nAnna-Sophia Boguraev,,wondered whether changesnto the DNA of astronauts,could be relatednto this immune suppression,,and through a science competitionncalled "Genes In Space,",Anna-Sophia designed an experimentnto test this hypothesis,using a personal DNA machinenaboard the International Space Station.,Here we see Anna-Sophianon April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,,watching her experiment launchnto the International Space Station.,That cloud of smoke is the rocket,that brought Anna-Sophia's experimentnto the International Space Station,,where, three days later,,astronaut Tim Peakencarried out her experiment --,in microgravity.,Personal DNA machines are nownaboard the International Space Station,,where they can help monitornliving conditions,and protect the lives of astronauts. 
 A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment,to protect the lives of astronauts,may seem like a rarity,nthe mark of a child genius.,Well, to me, it signalsnsomething bigger:,that DNA technology is finallynwithin the reach of every one of you. 
 A few years ago,,a college student armednwith a personal computer,could code an app,,an app that is now a social networknwith more than one billion users.,Could we be moving into a world,of one personal DNA machine in every home? 
 I know families who are alreadynliving in this reality.,The Daniels family, for example,,set up a DNA lab in the basementnof their suburban Chicago home.,This is not a familynmade of PhD scientists.,This is a family like any other.,They just like to spend time togetherndoing fun, creative things.,By day, Brian is an executivenat a private equity firm.,At night and on weekends,nhe experiments with DNA,alongside his kids, ages seven and nine,,as a way to explore the living world.,Last time I called them,,they were checking out homegrown producenfrom the backyard garden.,They were testing tomatoesnthat they had picked,,taking the flesh of their skin,nputting it in a test tube,,mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA,and then using their home DNA copier,to test those tomatoesnfor genetically engineered traits. 
 For the Daniels family,,the personal DNA machinenis like the chemistry set,for the 21st century.,Most of us may not yetnbe diagnosing genetic conditions,in our kitchen sinks,or doing at-home paternity testing. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we've definitely reachedna point in history,where every one of you could actuallynget hands-on with DNA,in your kitchen.,You could copy, paste and analyze DNA,and extract meaningfulninformation from it.,And it's at times like thisnthat profound transformation,is bound to happen;,moments when a transformative,npowerful technology,that was before limitednto a select few in the ivory tower,,finally becomes within the reachnof every one of us,,from farmers to schoolchildren.,Think about the moment,when phones stopped beingnplugged into the wall by cords,,or when computers left the mainframe,and entered your home or your office. 
 The ripples of the personal DNA revolution,may be hard to predict,,but one thing is certain:,revolutions don't go backwards,,and DNA technology is already spreadingnfaster than our imagination. 
 So if you're curious,,get up close and personalnwith DNA -- today.,It is in our DNA to be curious. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So we all have our own biases.,For example, some of us tend to think,that it's very difficult to transformnfailing government systems.,When we think of government systems,,we tend to think that they're archaic,nset in their ways,,and perhaps, the leadershipnis just too bureaucratic,to be able to change things.,Well, today, I wantnto challenge that theory.,I want to tell you a storynof a very large government system,that has not only put itselfnon the path of reform,but has also shownnfairly spectacular results,in less than three years. 
 This is what a classroomnin a public school in India looks like.,There are 1 million such schools in India.,And even for me,nwho's lived in India all her life,,walking into one of these schoolsnis fairly heartbreaking.,By the time kids are 11,,50 percent of them have fallennso far behind in their education,that they have no hope to recover.,11-year-olds cannot do simple addition,,they cannot constructna grammatically correct sentence.,These are things that you and Inwould expect an 8-year-old,to be able to do.,By the time kids are 13 or 14,,they tend to drop out of schools.,In India, public schoolsnnot only offer free education --,they offer free textbooks,nfree workbooks, free meals,,sometimes even cash scholarships.,And yet, 40 percent of the parents today,are choosing to pull their childrennout of public schools,and pay out of their pocketsnto put them in private schools.,As a comparison,nin a far richer country, the US,,that number is only 10 percent.,That's a huge statement on how brokennthe Indian public education system is. 
 So it was with that backgroundnthat I got a call in the summer of 2013,from an absolutely brilliant ladyncalled Surina Rajan.,She was, at that time, the headnof the Department of School Education,in a state called Haryana in India.,So she said to us, "Look, I've beennheading this department,for the last two years.,I've tried a number of things,nand nothing seems to work.,Can you possibly help?" 
 Let me describe Haryanana little bit to you.,Haryana is a statenwhich has 30 million people.,It has 15,000 public schools,and 2 million plusnchildren in those public schools.,So basically, with that phone call,,I promised to help a state and system,which was as large as that of Perunor Canada transform itself.,As I started this project,nI was very painfully aware of two things.,One, that I had never donenanything like this before.,And two, many others had,nperhaps without too much success.,As my colleagues and Inlooked across the country,and across the world,,we couldn't find another example,that we could just pick upnand replicate in Haryana.,We knew that we had to craftnour own journey. 
 But anyway, we jumped right innand as we jumped in,,all sorts of ideas started flying at us.,People said, "Let's changenthe way we recruit teachers,,let's hire new principals and train them,and send them on internationalnlearning tours,,let's put technology inside classrooms.",By the end of week one,nwe had 50 ideas on the table,,all amazing, all sounded right.,There was no way we werengoing to be able to implement 50 things. 
 So I said, "Hang on, stop.,Let's first at least decidenwhat is it we're trying to achieve.",So with a lot of push and pull and debate,,Haryana set itself a goalnwhich said: by 2020,,we want 80 percent of our childrennto be at grade-level knowledge.,Now the specifics of the goalndon't matter here,,but what mattersnis how specific the goal is.,Because it really allowed usnto take all those ideas,which were being thrown at us,and say which onesnwe were going to implement.,Does this idea support this goal?nIf yes, let's keep it.,But if it doesn't or we're not sure,nthen let's put it aside.,As simple as it sounds,nhaving a very specific goal right up front,has really allowed us to benvery sharp and focused,in our transformation journey.,And looking back overnthe last two and a half years,,that has been a huge positive for us. 
 So we had the goal,,and now we needed to figure outnwhat are the issues, what is broken.,Before we went into schools,na lot of people told us,that education quality is poor,because either the teachers are lazy,nthey don't come into schools,,or they're incapable,nthey actually don't know how to teach.,Well, when we went inside schools,nwe found something completely different.,On most days, most teachersnwere actually inside schools.,And when you spoke with them,,you realized they were perfectly capablenof teaching elementary classes.,But they were not teaching.,I went to a school,where the teachers were gettingnthe construction of a classroom,and a toilet supervised.,I went to another school,where two of the teachersnhad gone to a nearby bank branch,to deposit scholarship moneyninto kids' accounts.,At lunchtime, most teachersnwere spending all of their time,getting the midday meal cooking,nsupervised and served to the students. 
 So we asked the teachers,,"What's going on,nwhy are you not teaching?",And they said, "This isnwhat's expected of us.,When a supervisor comes to visit us,,these are exactly the thingsnthat he checks.,Has the toilet been made,nhas the meal been served.,When my principalngoes to a meeting at headquarters,,these are exactly the thingsnwhich are discussed." 
 You see, what had happened was,nover the last two decades,,India had been fighting the challengenof access, having enough schools,,and enrollment, bringing childrenninto the schools.,So the governmentnlaunched a whole host of programs,to address these challenges,,and the teachers becamenthe implicit executors of these programs.,Not explicitly, but implicitly.,And now, what was actually needednwas not to actually train teachers further,or to monitor their attendance,but to tell themnthat what is most important,is for them to go backninside classrooms and teach.,They needed to be monitorednand measured and awarded,on the quality of teaching,and not on all sorts of other things. 
 So as we went throughnthe education system,,as we delved into it deeper,nwe found a few such core root causes,which were determining, which werenshaping how people behaved in the system.,And we realized that unless we changenthose specific things,,we could do a number of other things.,We could train, we could putntechnology into schools,,but the system wouldn't change.,And addressing these non-obviousncore issues,became a key part of the program. 
 So, we had the goal and we had the issues,,and now we needed to figure outnwhat the solutions were.,We obviously did not wantnto recreate the wheel,,so we said, "Let's look aroundnand see what we can find.",And we found these beautiful,nsmall pilot experiments,all over the countrynand all over the world.,Small things being done by NGOs,nbeing done by foundations.,But what was also interestingnwas that none of them actually scaled.,All of them were limitednto 50, 100 or 500 schools.,And here, we were lookingnfor a solution for 15,000 schools. 
 So we looked into why,,if these things actually work,nwhy don't they actually scale?,What happens is thatnwhen a typical NGO comes in,,they not only bring in their expertise,but they also bring innadditional resources.,So they might bring in money,,they might bring in people,,they might bring in technology.,And in the 50 or 100 schoolsnthat they actually operate in,,those additional resourcesnactually create a difference.,But now imagine that the head of this NGO,goes to the headnof the School Education Department,and says, "Hey, now let's do thisnfor 15,000 schools.",Where is that guy or girlngoing to find the money,to actually scale this upnto 15,000 schools?,He doesn't have the additional money,,he doesn't have the resources.,And hence, innovations don't scale.,So right at the beginningnof the project, what we said was,,"Whatever we have to donhas to be scalable,,it has to work in all 15,000 schools.",And hence, it has to worknwithin the existing budgets,and resources that the state actually has.,Much easier said than done.,(Laughter) 
 I think this was definitelynthe point in time,when my team hated me.,We spent a lot of long hoursnin office, in cafés,,sometimes even in bars,,scratching out heads and saying,,"Where are the solutions,nhow are we going to solve this problem?" 
 In the end, I think we didnfind solutions to many of the issues.,I'll give you an example.,In the context of effective learning,,one of the things people talk aboutnis hands-on learning.,Children shouldn't memorizenthings from books,,they should do activities,,and that's a more effective way to learn.,Which basically meansngiving students things,like beads, learning rods, abacuses.,But we did not haventhe budgets to give that,to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.,We needed another solution.,We couldn't think of anything.,One day, one of our team membersnwent to a school,and saw a teacher pick up sticksnand stones from the garden outside,and take them into the classroom,and give them to the students.,That was a huge eureka moment for us.,So what happens nownin the textbooks in Haryana,is that after every concept,nwe have a little box,which are instructionsnfor the teachers which say,,"To teach this concept,nhere's an activity that you can do.,And by the way, in ordernto actually do this activity,,here are things that you can usenfrom your immediate environment,,whether it be the garden outsidenor the classroom inside,,which can be usednas learning aids for kids.",And we see teachers all over Haryana,using lots of innovative thingsnto be able to teach students.,So in this way, whatever we designed,,we were actually able to implement it,across all 15,000 schools from day one. 
 Now, this brings me to my last point.,How do you implement somethingnacross 15,000 schools,and 100,000 teachers?,The department used to have a process,which is very interesting.,I like to call it "The Chain of Hope.",They would write a letternfrom the headquarters,and send it to the next level,,which was the district offices.,They would hope that in eachnof these district offices,,an officer would get the letter,nwould open it, read it,and then forward it to the next level,,which was the block offices.,And then you would hopenthat at the block office,,somebody else got the letter,,opened it, read it and forwarded itneventually to the 15,000 principals.,And then one would hopenthat the principals,got the letter, received it,nunderstood it,and started implementing it.,It was a little bit ridiculous.,Now, we knew technology was the answer,,but we also knewnthat most of these schools,don't have a computer or email.,However, what the teachers do havenare smartphones.,They're constantly on SMS,non Facebook and on WhatsApp. 
 So what now happens in Haryana is,,all principals and teachers are dividedninto hundreds of WhatsApp groups,and anytime something needsnto be communicated,,it's just posted acrossnall WhatsApp groups.,It spreads like wildfire.,You can immediately checknwho has received it,,who has read it.,Teachers can ask clarificationnquestions instantaneously.,And what's interesting is,,it's not just the headquartersnwho are answering these questions.,Another teacher fromna completely different part of the state,will stand up and answer the question.,Everybody's actingnas everybody's peer group,,and things are getting implemented.,So today, when you gonto a school in Haryana,,things look different.,The teachers are back inside classrooms,,they're teaching.,Often with innovative techniques.,When a supervisorncomes to visit the classroom,,he or she not only checksnthe construction of the toilet,but also what is the quality of teaching.,Once a quarter,nall students across the state,are assessed on their learning outcomes,and schools which arendoing well are rewarded.,And schools which are not doing so well,find themselves havingndifficult conversations.,Of course, they also getnadditional support,to be able to do better in the future.,In the context of education,,it's very difficultnto see results quickly. 
 When people talk about systemic,nlarge-scale change,,they talk about periodsnof 7 years and 10 years.,But not in Haryana.,In the last one year, there have beennthree independent studies,,all measuring student learning outcomes,,which indicate that something fundamental,,something unique is happening in Haryana.,Learning levels of childrennhave stopped declining,,and they have started going up.,Haryana is one of the fewnstates in the country,which is showing an improvement,,and certainly the one that is showingnthe fastest rate of improvement.,These are still early signs,,there's a long way to go,,but this gives us a lot of hopenfor the future.,I recently went to a school,,and as I was leaving,,I ran into a lady,,her name was Parvati,,she was the mother of a child,,and she was smiling.,And I said, "Why are you smiling,nwhat's going on?",And she said, "I don't knownwhat's going on,,but what I do knownis that my children are learning,,they're having fun,,and for the time being, I'll stopnmy search for a private school,to send them to." 
 So I go back to where I started:,Can government systems transform?,I certainly believe so.,I think if you give them the right levers,,they can move mountains. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a man-made forest.,It can spread over acresnand acres of area,,or it could fit in a small space --,as small as your house garden.,Each of these forestsnis just two years old.,I have a forest in the backyardnof my own house.,It attracts a lot of biodiversity. 
 (Bird call) 
 I wake up to this every morning,,like a Disney princess. 
 (Laughter) 
 I am an entrepreneur,who facilitates the makingnof these forests professionally.,We have helped factories,,farms,,schools,,homes,,resorts,,apartment buildings,,public parks,and even a zoo,to have one of such forests.,A forest is not an isolated piece of landnwhere animals live together.,A forest can be an integral partnof our urban existence.,A forest, for me,,is a place so dense with treesnthat you just can't walk into it.,It doesn't matternhow big or small they are. 
 Most of the worldnwe live in today was forest.,This was before human intervention.,Then we built up our citiesnon those forests,,like São Paulo,,forgetting that we belongnto nature as well,,as much as 8.4 millionnother species on the planet.,Our habitat stopped beingnour natural habitat.,But not anymore for some of us.,A few others and I today makenthese forests professionally --,anywhere and everywhere. 
 I'm an industrial engineer.,I specialize in making cars.,In my previous job at Toyota,,I learned how to convertnnatural resources into products.,To give you an example,,we would drip the sapnout of a rubber tree,,convert it into raw rubber,and make a tire out of it -- the product.,But these products can nevernbecome a natural resource again.,We separate the elements from nature,and convert themninto an irreversible state.,That's industrial production. 
 Nature, on the other hand,nworks in a totally opposite way.,The natural system producesnby bringing elements together,,atom by atom.,All the natural productsnbecome a natural resource again.,This is something which I learned,when I made a forestnin the backyard of my own house.,And this was the first timenI worked with nature,,rather than against it.,Since then,,we have made 75 such forestsnin 25 cities across the world.,Every time we work at a new place,,we find that every single elementnneeded to make a forest,is available right around us.,All we have to do is to bringnthese elements together,and let nature take over. 
 To make a forest we start with soil.,We touch, feel and even taste it,to identify what properties it lacks.,If the soil is made up of small particlesnit becomes compact --,so compact, that water cannot seep in.,We mix some local biomassnavailable around,,which can help soil become more porous.,Water can now seep in.,If the soil doesn't haventhe capacity to hold water,,we will mix some more biomass --,some water-absorbent materialnlike peat or bagasse,,so soil can hold this waternand it stays moist. 
 To grow, plants need water,nsunlight and nutrition.,What if the soil doesn't havenany nutrition in it?,We don't just add nutritionndirectly to the soil.,That would be the industrial way.,It goes against nature.,We instead add microorganisms to the soil.,They produce the nutrientsnin the soil naturally.,They feed on the biomassnwe have mixed in the soil,,so all they have to donis eat and multiply.,And as their number grows,,the soil starts breathing again.,It becomes alive. 
 We survey the nativentree species of the place.,How do we decide what's native or not?,Well, whatever existednbefore human intervention is native.,That's the simple rule.,We survey a national park,to find the last remainsnof a natural forest.,We survey the sacred groves,,or sacred forests around old temples.,And if we don't find anything at all,,we go to museums,to see the seeds or wood of treesnexisting there a long time ago.,We research old paintings,npoems and literature from the place,,to identify the tree speciesnbelonging there. 
 Once we know our trees,,we divide them in four different layers:,shrub layer, sub-tree layer,ntree layer and canopy layer.,We fix the ratios of each layer,,and then we decide the percentagenof each tree species in the mix.,If we are making a fruit forest,,we increase the percentagenof fruit-bearing trees.,It could be a flowering forest,,a forest that attractsna lot of birds or bees,,or it could simply be a native,nwild evergreen forest. 
 We collect the seedsnand germinate saplings out of them.,We make sure that treesnbelonging to the same layer,are not planted next to each other,,or they will fight for the samenvertical space when they grow tall.,We plant the saplings close to each other.,On the surface, we spreadna thick layer of mulch,,so when it's hot outsidenthe soil stays moist.,When it's cold,,frost formation happens only on the mulch,,so soil can still breathenwhile it's freezing outside.,The soil is very soft --,so soft, that rootsncan penetrate into it easily,,rapidly. 
 Initially, the forest doesn'tnseem like it's growing,,but it's growing under the surface.,In the first three months,,roots reach a depth of one meter.,These roots form a mesh,,tightly holding the soil.,Microbes and fungi liventhroughout this network of roots.,So if some nutrition is not availablenin the vicinity of a tree,,these microbes are going to getnthe nutrition to the tree.,Whenever it rains,,magically,,mushrooms appear overnight.,And this means the soil belownhas a healthy fungal network. 
 Once these roots are established,,forest starts growing on the surface.,As the forest grows we keep watering it --,for the next two to three years,nwe water the forest.,We want to keep all the waternand soil nutrition only for our trees,,so we remove the weedsngrowing on the ground.,As this forest grows,nit blocks the sunlight.,Eventually, the forest becomes so dense,that sunlight can't reachnthe ground anymore.,Weeds cannot grow now,nbecause they need sunlight as well. 
 At this stage,,every single drop of waternthat falls into the forest,doesn't evaporate backninto the atmosphere.,This dense forest condenses the moist air,and retains its moisture.,We gradually reduce and eventuallynstop watering the forest.,And even without watering,,the forest floor stays moistnand sometimes even dark.,Now, when a single leafnfalls on this forest floor,,it immediately starts decaying.,This decayed biomass forms humus,,which is food for the forest.,As the forest grows,,more leaves fall on the surface --,it means more humus is produced,,it means more food so the forestncan grow still bigger.,And this forest keepsngrowing exponentially. 
 Once established,,these forests are going to regeneratenthemselves again and again --,probably forever.,In a natural forest like this,,no management is the best management.,It's a tiny jungle party. 
 (Laughter) 
 This forest grows as a collective.,If the same trees --,same species --,would have been planted independently,,it wouldn't grow so fast.,And this is how we createna 100-year-old forest,in just 10 years. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Guys, we have an issue. 
 (Laughter) 
 Growth is fading away,nand it's a big deal.,Our global economy stops growing.,And it's not new.,Growth has actually declinednfor the last 50 years.,If we continue like this, we need to learn,how to live in a worldnwith no growth in the next decade.,This is scary becausenwhen the economy doesn't grow,,our children don't get better lives.,What's even scarier is thatnwhen the pie does not grow,,each of us get a smaller piece.,We're then ready to fightnfor a bigger one.,This creates tensionsnand serious conflicts.,Growth matters a lot. 
 If we look at the history of growth,,times of big growthnhave always been fueled,by big manufacturing revolutions.,It happened three times,nevery 50-60 years.,The steam enginenin the middle of the 19th century,,the mass-production modelnin the beginning of the 20th century --,thanks, Mr. Ford.,And the first automationnwave in the 1970s. 
 Why did these manufacturing revolutions,create huge growth in our economies?,Because they have injectednhuge productivity improvement.,It's rather simple:,in order to grow,nyou need to be producing more,,putting more into our economy.,This means either more labornor more capital or more productivity.,Each time, productivitynhas been the growth lever. 
 I'm here today to tell you,that we are on the vergenof another huge change,,and that this change, surprisingly enough,,is going to comenfrom manufacturing, again.,It will get us out of our growth slump,and it will change radicallynthe way globalization has been shaped,over the last decade.,I'm here to tell you about the amazingnfourth manufacturing revolution,that is currently underway. 
 It's not as if we've done nothingnwith manufacturing,since the last revolution.,Actually, we've madensome pretty lame attempts,to try to revitalize it.,But none of themnhave been the big overhaul,we really need to get us growing again.,For example, we've triednto relocate our factories offshore,in order to reduce costnand take advantage of cheap labor.,Not only did this notninspire productivity,,but it only saved moneynfor a short period of time,,because cheap laborndidn't stay cheap for long.,Then, we've tried to makenour factories larger,and we specialized them by product.,The idea was that we cannmake a lot of one product,and stockpile it to be sold with demand. 
 This did help productivity for a while.,But it introduced a lot of rigiditiesnin our supply chain.,Let's take fashion retail.,Traditional clothing companies,have built offshore,nglobal, rigid supply chains.,When fast-fashion competitors like Zara,started replenishing their stocks faster,from two collections a yearnto one collection a month,,none of them have been ablento keep up with the pace.,Most of them arenin great difficulties today. 
 Yet, with all of their shortcomings,,those are the factories we know today.,When you open the doors,,they look the samenas they did 50 years ago.,We've just changed the location,nthe size, the way they operate.,Can you name anything elsenthat looks the same,as it did 50 years ago?,It's crazy.,We've made all the tweaksnto the model that we could,,and now we hit its limits. 
 After all of our attempts to fixnthe manufacturing model failed,,we thought growth could comenfrom elsewhere.,We turned to the tech sector --,there's been quite a lotnof innovations there.,Just to name one: the Internet.,We hoped it could produce growth.,And indeed, it changed our lives.,It made big waves in the media,nthe service, the entertainment spaces.,But it hasn't done much for productivity.,Actually, what's surprisingnis that productivity is on the decline,despite all of those innovation efforts.,Imagine that -- sitting at work,nscrolling through Facebook,,watching videos on YouTubenhas made us less productive.,Weird. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is why we are not growing.,We failed at reinventingnthe manufacturing space,,and large technological innovationsnhave played away from it.,But what if we could combine those forces?,What if the existing manufacturingnand large technological innovation,came together to createnthe next big manufacturing reinvention. 
 Bingo!,This is the fourthnmanufacturing revolution,,and it's happening right now.,Major technologies are enteringnthe manufacturing space,,big time.,They will boost industrial productivitynby more than a third.,This is massive, and it will dona lot in creating growth.,Let me tell you about some of them. 
 Have you already met advancednmanufacturing robots?,They are the size of humans,,they actually collaborate with them,,and they can be programmed,in order to performncomplex, non-repetitive tasks.,Today in our factories, onlyn8 percent of the tasks are automated.,The less complex,nthe more repetitive ones.,It will be 25 percent in 10 years.,It means that by 2025,,advanced robots will complement workers,to be, together,n20 percent more productive,,to manufacture 20 percent more outputs,,to achieve 20 percent additional growth. 
 This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.,These robots are working for us right now.,Last year in the US, they helpednAmazon prepare and ship all the products,required for Cyber Monday,,the annual peak of online retail.,Last year in the US,,it was the biggest online shopping daynof the year and of history.,Consumers spent 3 billion dollarsnon electronics that day.,That's real economic growth. 
 Then there's additivenmanufacturing, 3D printing.,3D printing has already improvednplastic manufacturing,and it's now making its way through metal.,Those are not small industries.,Plastic and metals represent 25 percent,of global manufacturing production. 
 Let's take a real example.,In the aerospace industry,,fuel nozzles are some of the mostncomplex parts to manufacture,,for one reason:,they are made up of 20 different parts,that need to be separately produced,and then painstakingly assembled.,Aerospace companiesnare now using 3D printing,,which allows them to turnnthose 20 different parts,into just one.,The results?,40 percent more productivity,,40 percent more output produced,n40 percent more growth,for this specific industry. 
 But actually, the most exciting partnof this new manufacturing revolution,goes much beyond productivity.,It's about producing better,nsmarter products.,It's about scale customization.,Imagine a world where you can buynthe exact products you want,with the functionalities you need,,with the design you want,,with the same cost and lead time,as a product that's been mass produced,,like your car, or your clothesnor your cell phone.,The new manufacturing revolutionnmakes it possible. 
 Advanced robots can be programmed,in order to performnany product configuration,without any setup time or ramp up.,3D printers instantaneously producenany customized design.,We are now able to producena batch of one product, your product,,at the same cost and lead timenas a batch of many.,Those are only a few examplesnof the manufacturing revolution at play. 
 Not only will manufacturingnbecome more productive,,it will also become more flexible,,and those were exactly the elementsnof growth that we are missing.,But actually, there are evennsome bigger implications,for all of us when manufacturingnwill find its way back into the limelight.,It will create a huge macroeconomic shift. 
 First, our factories will be relocatedninto our home markets.,In the world of scale customization,,consumer proximity is the new norm. 
 Then, our factoriesnwill be smaller, agile.,Scale does not matter anymore,nflexibility does.,They will be operating on a multi-product,nmade-to-order basis.,The change will be drastic. 
 Globalization will enter a new era.,The East-to-West trade flows,will be replaced by regional trade flows.,East for East, West for West.,When you think about that,,the old model was pretty much insane.,Piling up stocks, making productsntravel the whole world,before they reach their end consumers.,The new model, producingnjust next to the consumer market,,will be much cleaner,nmuch better for our environment.,In mature economies,nmanufacturing will be back home,,creating more employment,,more productivity and more growth.,Good news, isn't it? 
 But here's the thing with growth --,it does not come automatically.,Mature economies will have to seize it.,We'll have to massivelynre-train our workforce.,In most countries,nlike in my country, France,,we've told our childrennthat manufacturing had no future.,That it was something happening far away.,We need to reverse that,and teach manufacturing againnat university.,Only the countriesnthat will boldly transform,will be able to seize this growth. 
 It's also a chancenfor developing economies.,Of course Chinanand other emerging economies,won't be the factory of the world anymore.,Actually, it was not a sustainablenmodel in the long term,,as those countries are becoming richer.,Last year, it was alreadynas expensive to produce in Brazil,as to produce in France.,By 2018, manufacturing costs in Chinanwill be on par with the US. 
 The new manufacturing revolution,will accelerate the transitionnof those emerging economies,towards a model drivennby domestic consumption.,And this is good,,because this is where growthnwill be created.,In the next five years,,the next billion consumers in Chinanwill inject more growth in our economies,than the top fivenEuropean markets together. 
 This fourth manufacturing revolutionnis a chance for all of us.,If we play it right,,we'll see sustainable growthnin all of our economies.,This means more wealthndistributed to all of us,and a better future for our children. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)If I asked you to picture the air,,what do you imagine?,Most people think about either empty space,or clear blue sky,or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.,And then I remember my high schoolnchemistry teacher with really long socks,at the blackboard,,drawing diagrams of bubblesnconnected to other bubbles,,and describing how they vibratenand collide in a kind of frantic soup. 
 But really, we tend not to thinknabout the air that much at all.,We notice it mostly,when there's some kind of unpleasantnsensory intrusion upon it,,like a terrible smellnor something visible like smoke or mist.,But it's always there.,It's touching all of us right now.,It's even inside us.,Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.,And yet, it's so easily forgotten. 
 So what is the air?,It's the combination of the invisiblengases that envelop the Earth,,attracted by the Earth'sngravitational pull.,And even though I'm a visual artist,,I'm interested innthe invisibility of the air.,I'm interested in how we imagine it,,how we experience it,and how we all have an innatenunderstanding of its materiality,through breathing.,All life on Earth changes the airnthrough gas exchange,,and we're all doing it right now.,Actually, why don't we allnright now together take,one big, collective, deep breath in. 
 Ready? In. (Inhales),And out. (Exhales) 
 That air that you just exhaled,,you enriched a hundred timesnin carbon dioxide.,So roughly five liters of air per breath,n17 breaths per minute,of the 525,600 minutes per year,,comes to approximatelyn45 million liters of air,,enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,,just for you.,Now, that's equivalent to about 18nOlympic-sized swimming pools. 
 For me, air is plural.,It's simultaneouslynas small as our breathing,and as big as the planet.,And it's kind of hard to picture.,Maybe it's impossible,nand maybe it doesn't matter. 
 Through my visual arts practice,,I try to make air, not so much picture it,,but to make it visceralnand tactile and haptic.,I try to expand this notionnof the aesthetic, how things look,,so that it can include thingsnlike how it feels on your skin,and in your lungs,,and how your voice soundsnas it passes through it.,I explore the weight, density and smell,nbut most importantly,,I think a lot about the stories we attachnto different kinds of air. 
 This is a work I made in 2014.,It's called "Different Kindsnof Air: A Plant's Diary,",where I was recreating the airnfrom different eras in Earth's evolution,,and inviting the audiencento come in and breathe them with me.,And it's really surprising,nso drastically different. 
 Now, I'm not a scientist,,but atmospheric scientistsnwill look for traces,in the air chemistry in geology,,a bit like how rocks can oxidize,,and they'll extrapolatenthat information and aggregate it,,such that they cannpretty much form a recipe,for the air at different times.,Then I come in as the artistnand take that recipe,and recreate it using the component gases. 
 I was particularly interestednin moments of time,that are examplesnof life changing the air,,but also the air that can influencenhow life will evolve,,like Carboniferous air.,It's from about 300 to 350nmillion years ago.,It's an era knownnas the time of the giants.,So for the first timenin the history of life,,lignin evolves.,That's the hard stuffnthat trees are made of.,So trees effectively inventntheir own trunks at this time,,and they get really big,nbigger and bigger,,and pepper the Earth,,releasing oxygen, releasingnoxygen, releasing oxygen,,such that the oxygen levelsnare about twice as high,as what they are today.,And this rich air supportsnmassive insects --,huge spiders and dragonfliesnwith a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.,To breathe, this air is really cleannand really fresh.,It doesn't so much have a flavor,,but it does give your bodyna really subtle kind of boost of energy.,It's really good for hangovers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or there's the air of the Great Dying --,that's about 252.5 million years ago,,just before the dinosaurs evolve.,It's a really short time period,ngeologically speaking,,from about 20- to 200,000 years.,Really quick.,This is the greatest extinction eventnin Earth's history,,even bigger than whennthe dinosaurs died out.,Eighty-five to 95 percent of speciesnat this time die out,,and simultaneous to that is a huge,ndramatic spike in carbon dioxide,,that a lot of scientists agree,comes from a simultaneousneruption of volcanoes,and a runaway greenhouse effect.,Oxygen levels at this time gonto below half of what they are today,,so about 10 percent.,So this air would definitely notnsupport human life,,but it's OK to just have a breath.,And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.,It's really calming, it's quite warm,and it has a flavor a little bitnlike soda water.,It has that kind of spritz,nquite pleasant. 
 So with all this thinkingnabout air of the past,,it's quite natural to start thinkingnabout the air of the future.,And instead of being speculative with air,and just making up what I thinknmight be the future air,,I discovered this human-synthesized air.,That means that it doesn't occurnanywhere in nature,,but it's made by humans in a laboratory,for application in differentnindustrial settings. 
 Why is it future air?,Well, this air is a really stable molecule,that will literally be part of the airnonce it's released,,for the next 300 to 400 years,nbefore it's broken down.,So that's about 12 to 16 generations.,And this future air hasnsome very sensual qualities.,It's very heavy.,It's about eight times heaviernthan the air we're used to breathing.,It's so heavy, in fact,nthat when you breathe it in,,whatever words you speaknare kind of literally heavy as well,,so they dribble down your chinnand drop to the floor,and soak into the cracks.,It's an air that operatesnquite a lot like a liquid. 
 Now, this air comesnwith an ethical dimension as well.,Humans made this air,,but it's also the most potentngreenhouse gas,that has ever been tested.,Its warming potential is 24,000 timesnthat of carbon dioxide,,and it has that longevitynof 12 to 16 generations.,So this ethical confrontationnis really central to my work.,(In a lowered voice) It hasnanother quite surprising quality.,It changes the sound of your voicenquite dramatically. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when we start to think -- ooh!nIt's still there a bit. 
 (Laughter) 
 When we think about climate change,,we probably don't think aboutngiant insects and erupting volcanoes,or funny voices.,The images that more readily come to mind,are things like retreating glaciersnand polar bears adrift on icebergs.,We think about pie chartsnand column graphs,and endless politiciansntalking to scientists wearing cardigans. 
 But perhaps it's time we startnthinking about climate change,on the same visceral levelnthat we experience the air.,Like air, climate change is simultaneouslynat the scale of the molecule,,the breath and the planet.,It's immediate, vital and intimate,,as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.,And yet, it's so easily forgotten. 
 Climate change is the collectivenself-portrait of humanity.,It reflects our decisions as individuals,,as governments and as industries.,And if there's anythingnI've learned from looking at air,,it's that even thoughnit's changing, it persists.,It may not support the kind of lifenthat we'd recognize,,but it will support something.,And if we humans are such a vitalnpart of that change,,I think it's importantnthat we can feel the discussion.,Because even though it's invisible,,humans are leavingna very vibrant trace in the air. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I could never have imagined,that a 19-year-old suicide bomber,would actually teach me a valuable lesson.,But he did.,He taught me to never presume anything,about anyone you don't know. 
 On a Thursday morning in July 2005,,the bomber and I, unknowingly,,boarded the same train carriagenat the same time,,standing, apparently, just feet apart.,I didn't see him.,Actually, I didn't see anyone.,You know not to looknat anyone on the Tube,,but I guess he saw me.,I guess he looked at all of us,,as his hand hoverednover the detonation switch.,I've often wondered: What was he thinking?,Especially in those final seconds. 
 I know it wasn't personal.,He didn't set out to killnor maim me, Gill Hicks.,I mean -- he didn't know me.,No.,Instead, he gave me,an unwarranted and an unwanted label.,I had become the enemy.,To him, I was the "other,",the "them," as opposed to "us.",The label "enemy" allowed himnto dehumanize us.,It allowed him to push that button.,And he wasn't selective.,Twenty-six precious lives were takennin my carriage alone,,and I was almost one of them. 
 In the time it takes to draw a breath,,we were plunged into a darkness so immense,that it was almost tangible;,what I imagine wadingnthrough tar might be like.,We didn't know we were the enemy.,We were just a bunch of commutersnwho, minutes earlier,,had followed the Tube etiquette:,no direct eye contact,,no talking,and absolutely no conversation. 
 But in the lifting of the darkness,,we were reaching out.,We were helping each other.,We were calling out our names,,a little bit like a roll call,,waiting for responses. 
 "I'm Gill. I'm here.,I'm alive.,OK." 
 "I'm Gill.,Here.,Alive.,OK." 
 I didn't know Alison.,But I listened for her check-insnevery few minutes.,I didn't know Richard.,But it mattered to me that he survived. 
 All I shared with them,was my first name.,They didn't know,that I was a head of a departmentnat the Design Council.,And here is my beloved briefcase,,also rescued from that morning.,They didn't know that I publishednarchitecture and design journals,,that I was a Fellownof the Royal Society of Arts,,that I wore black --,still do --,that I smoked cigarillos.,I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.,I drank gin and I watched TED Talks,,of course, never dreamingnthat one day I would be standing,,balancing on prosthetic legs,,giving a talk. 
 I was a young Australian womanndoing extraordinary things in London.,And I wasn't ready for that all to end.,I was so determined to survive,that I used my scarf to tie tourniquetsnaround the tops of my legs,,and I just shut everythingnand everyone out,,to focus, to listen to myself,,to be guided by instinct alone.,I lowered my breathing rate.,I elevated my thighs.,I held myself upright,and I fought the urge to close my eyes. 
 I held on for almost an hour,,an hour to contemplatenthe whole of my life,up until this point.,Perhaps I should have done more.,Perhaps I could havenlived more, seen more.,Maybe I should have gone running,ndancing, taken up yoga.,But my priority and my focusnwas always my work.,I lived to work.,Who I was on my business card,mattered to me.,But it didn't matter down in that tunnel. 
 By the time I felt that first touch,from one of my rescuers,,I was unable to speak,,unable to say evenna small word, like "Gill.",I surrendered my body to them.,I had done all I possibly could,,and now I was in their hands. 
 I understood,just who and what humanity really is,,when I first saw the ID tag,that was given to menwhen I was admitted to hospital.,And it read:,"One unknown estimated female.",One unknown estimated female.,Those four words were my gift.,What they told me very clearly,was that my life was saved,,purely because I was a human being.,Difference of any kind made no difference,to the extraordinary lengthsnthat the rescuers were prepared to go,to save my life,,to save as many unknowns as they could,,and putting their own lives at risk.,To them, it didn't matternif I was rich or poor,,the color of my skin,,whether I was male or female,,my sexual orientation,,who I voted for,,whether I was educated,,if I had a faith or no faith at all.,Nothing mattered,other than I was a precious human life. 
 I see myself as a living fact.,I am proof,that unconditional love and respectncan not only save,,but it can transform lives.,Here is a wonderful imagenof one of my rescuers, Andy, and I,taken just last year.,Ten years after the event,,and here we are, arm in arm. 
 Throughout all the chaos,,my hand was held tightly.,My face was stroked gently.,What did I feel?,I felt loved.,What's shielded me from hatrednand wanting retribution,,what's given me the courage to say:,this ends with me,is love.,I was loved. 
 I believe the potentialnfor widespread positive change,is absolutely enormous,because I know what we're capable of.,I know the brilliance of humanity.,So this leaves me with somenpretty big things to ponder,and some questions for us all to consider:,Is what unites us not far greaternthan what can ever divide?,Does it have to takena tragedy or a disaster,for us to feel deeplynconnected as one species,,as human beings?,And when will we embracenthe wisdom of our era,to rise above mere tolerance,and move to an acceptance,for all who are only a labelnuntil we know them? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm here today to talk to younabout a very powerful little word,,one that people will do almost anything,to avoid becoming.,Billion-dollar industries thrive,because of the fear of it,,and those of us who undeniably are it,are left to navigate a relentless storm,surrounding it. 
 I'm not sure if any of you have noticed,,but I'm fat.,Not the lowercase,nmuttered-behind-my-back kind,,or the seemingly harmlessnchubby or cuddly.,I'm not even the more sophisticatednvoluptuous or curvaceous kind. 
 Let's not sugarcoat it.,I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.,I am the elephant in the room.,When I walked out on stage,,some of you may have been thinking,,"Aww, this is going to be hilarious,,because everybody knowsnthat fat people are funny." 
 (Laughter) 
 Or you may have been thinking,n"Where does she get her confidence from?",Because a confident fat womannis almost unthinkable.,The fashion-consciousnmembers of the audience,may have been thinking how fabulous I look,in this Beth Ditto dress -- 
 (Cheers) 
 thank you very much.,Whereas some of you might have thought,,"Hmm, black would have beennso much more slimming." 
 (Laughter) 
 You may have wondered, consciously or not,,if I have diabetes, or a partner,,or if I eat carbs after 7pm. 
 (Laughter) 
 You may have worriednthat you ate carbs after 7pm last night,,and that you really should renewnyour gym membership. 
 These judgments are insidious.,They can be directednat individuals and groups,,and they can alsonbe directed at ourselves.,And this way of thinkingnis known as fatphobia. 
 Like any form of systematic oppression,,fatphobia is deeply rootednin complex structures,like capitalism, patriarchy and racism,,and that can make itnreally difficult to see,,let alone challenge.,We live in a culture,where being fatnis seen as being a bad person --,lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible,and morally suspect.,And we tend to see thinness,as being universally good --,responsible, successful,,and in control of our appetites,nbodies and lives.,We see these ideas again and again,in the media, in public health policy,,doctors' offices,,in everyday conversations,and in our own attitudes.,We may even blame fat people themselves,for the discrimination they face,because, after all, if we don't like it,nwe should just lose weight.,Easy.,This antifat bias has becomenso integral, so ingrained,to how we value ourselves and each other,that we rarely question whynwe have such contempt for people of size,and where that disdain comes from. 
 But we must question it,,because the enormous valuenwe place on how we look,affects every one of us.,And do we really want to live in a society,where people are deniedntheir basic humanity,if they don't subscribento some arbitrary form of acceptable? 
 So when I was six years old,,my sister used to teach balletnto a bunch of little girls in our garage.,I was about a foot taller and a foot widernthan most of the group.,When it came to doingnour first performance,,I was so excitednabout wearing a pretty pink tutu.,I was going to sparkle.,As the other girls slipped easilyninto their Lycra and tulle creations,,not one of the tutusnwas big enough to fit me.,I was determined not to benexcluded from the performance,,so I turned to my mother,and loud enough for everyone to hear,said, "Mom, I don't need a tutu.,I need a fourfour." 
 (Laughter) 
 Thanks, Mom. 
 (Applause) 
 And although I didn'tnrecognize it at the time,,claiming space for myselfnin that glorious fourfour,was the first step towards becomingna radical fat activist. 
 Now, I'm not sayingnthat this whole body-love thing,has been an easy skip alongna glittering path of self-acceptance,since that day in class.,Far from it.,I soon learned that living outsidenwhat the mainstream considers normal,can be a frustrating and isolating place.,I've spent the last 20 years unpackingnand deprogramming these messages,,and it's been quite the roller coaster.,I've been openly laughed at,nabused from passing cars,and been told that I'm delusional.,I also receive smiles from strangers,who recognize what it takesnto walk down the street,with a spring in your stepnand your head held high. 
 (Cheer) 
 Thanks.,And through it all, that fiercenlittle six-year-old has stayed with me,,and she has helped menstand before you today,as an unapologetic fat person,,a person that simply refuses to subscribe,to the dominant narrative,about how I should moventhrough the world in this body of mine. 
 (Applause) 
 And I'm not alone.,I am part of an internationalncommunity of people,who choose to, rathernthan passively accepting,that our bodies arenand probably always will be big,,we actively choose to flourishnin these bodies as they are today.,People who honor our strengthnand work with, not against,,our perceived limitations,,people who value health,as something much more holistic,than a number on an outdated BMI chart.,Instead, we value mental health,nself-worth and how we feel in our bodies,as vital aspectsnto our overall well-being.,People who refuse to believenthat living in these fat bodies,is a barrier to anything, really. 
 There are doctors, academics and bloggers,who have written countless volumes,on the many facetsnof this complex subject.,There are fatshionistasnwho reclaim their bodies and their beauty,by wearing fatkinis and crop tops,,exposing the fleshnthat we're all taught to hide.,There are fat athletes,who run marathons,nteach yoga or do kickboxing,,all done with a middle fingernfirmly held up to the status quo.,And these people have taught menthat radical body politics,is the antidotento our body-shaming culture. 
 But to be clear, I'm not sayingnthat people shouldn't change their bodies,if that's what they want to do.,Reclaiming yourself can be onenof the most gorgeous acts of self-love,and can look likena million different things,,from hairstyles to tattoosnto body contouring,to hormones to surgerynand yes, even weight loss.,It's simple: it's your body,,and you decide what's best to do with it. 
 My way of engaging in activism,is by doing all the thingsnthat we fatties aren't supposed to do,,and there's a lot of them,,inviting other people to join menand then making art about it.,The common threadnthrough most of this work,has been reclaiming spaces that arenoften prohibitive to bigger bodies,,from the catwalk to club shows,,from public swimming poolsnto prominent dance stages.,And reclaiming spaces en massenis not only a powerful artistic statement,but a radical community-building approach.,This was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the fat fem synchronized swim team,I started with a groupnof friends in Sydney.,The impact of seeingna bunch of defiant fat women,in flowery swimming caps and bathers,throwing their legs in the airnwithout a care,should not be underestimated. 
 (Laughter) 
 Throughout my career, I have learnednthat fat bodies are inherently political,,and unapologetic fat bodies,can blow people's minds.,When director Kate Champion,,of acclaimed dance theaterncompany Force Majeure,,asked me to be the artistic associate,on a work featuring all fat dancers,,I literally jumped at the opportunity.,And I mean literally.,"Nothing to Lose" is a work madenin collaboration with performers of size,who drew from their lived experiences,to create a work as variednand authentic as we all are.,And it was as far from balletnas you could imagine. 
 The very idea of a fat dance worknby such a prestigious company,was, to put it mildly, controversial,,because nothing like it had ever been donenon mainstream dance stages before,anywhere in the world. 
 People were skeptical.,"What do you mean, 'fat dancers?',Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat?,Where did they do their dance training?,Are they going to have the staminanfor a full-length production?" 
 But despite the skepticism,,"Nothing to Lose" becamena sellout hit of Sydney Festival.,We received rave reviews, toured,,won awards and were written aboutnin over 27 languages.,These incredible images of our castnwere seen worldwide.,I've lost count of how many timesnpeople of all sizes,have told me that the shownhas changed their lives,,how it helped themnshift their relationship,to their own and other people's bodies,,and how it made them confrontntheir own bias. 
 But of course, worknthat pushes people's buttons,is not without its detractors.,I have been toldnthat I'm glorifying obesity.,I have received violent death threats,and abuse for daring to make worknthat centers fat people's bodies and lives,and treats us as worthwhile human beingsnwith valuable stories to tell.,I've even been called,"the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a comment so absurd that it is funny.,But it also speaks to the panic,,the literal terror,,that the fear of fat can evoke.,It is this fear that's feedingnthe diet industry,,which is keeping so many of usnfrom making peace with our own bodies,,for waiting to be the after-photo,before we truly start to live our lives.,Because the real elephantnin the room here is fatphobia.,Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear.,By advocating for self-determinationnand respect for all of us,,we can shift society's reluctancento embrace diversity,and start to celebrate the myriad waysnthere are to have a body. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)These are some photos of menvolunteering in a Cambodian orphanage,in 2006.,When these photos were taken,,I thought I was doing a really good thing,and that I was really helping those kids.,I had a lot to learn. 
 It all started for menwhen I was 19 years old,and went backpackingnthrough Southeast Asia.,When I reached Cambodia,,I felt uncomfortable being on holidaynsurrounded by so much poverty,and wanted to do something to give back.,So I visited some orphanagesnand donated some clothes and books,and some money,to help the kids that I met. 
 But one of the orphanages I visitednwas desperately poor.,I had never encountered povertynlike that before in my life.,They didn't have funds for enough food,,clean water,or medical treatment,,and the sad little faces on those kids,were heartbreaking.,So I was compellednto do something more to help.,I fund-raised in Australia and returnednto Cambodia the following year,to volunteer at the orphanagenfor a few months.,I taught English and boughtnwater filters and food,and took all of the kids to the dentistnfor the first time in their lives. 
 But over the course of the next year,,I came to discover that this orphanagenthat I had been supporting,was terribly corrupt.,The director had been embezzlingnevery cent donated to the orphanage,,and in my absence, the childrennwere suffering such gross neglect,that they were forced to catch micento feed themselves.,I also found out later,that the director had been physicallynand sexually abusing the kids.,I couldn't bring myselfnto turn my back on children,who I had come to know and care about,and return to my life in Australia.,So I worked with a local teamnand the local authorities,to set up a new orphanagenand rescue the kids,to give them a safe new home. 
 But this is where my story takesnanother unexpected turn.,As I adjusted to my new lifenrunning an orphanage in Cambodia,,(Khmer) I learnednto speak Khmer fluently,,which means that I learnednto speak the Khmer language fluently.,And when I could communicatenproperly with the kids,,I began to uncover some strange things.,Most of the children we had removednfrom the orphanage,were not, in fact, orphans at all.,They had parents,,and the few that were orphanednhad other living relatives,,like grandparents and aunties and uncles,and other siblings. 
 So why were these childrennliving in an orphanage,when they weren't orphans?,Since 2005, the numbernof orphanages in Cambodia,has risen by 75 percent,,and the number of childrennliving in Cambodian orphanages,has nearly doubled,,despite the fact,that the vast majority of childrennliving in these orphanages,are not orphans in the traditional sense.,They're children from poor families.,So if the vast majority of childrennliving in orphanages,are not orphans,,then the term "orphanage",is really just a euphemistic namenfor a residential care institution.,These institutions gonby other names as well,,like "shelters," "safe houses,"n"children's homes," "children's villages,",even "boarding schools." 
 And this problem is not justnconfined to Cambodia.,This map shows some of the countriesnthat have seen a dramatic increase,in the numbers of residentialncare institutions,and the numbers of childrennbeing institutionalized.,In Uganda, for example,,the number of childrennliving in institutions,has increased by more thann1,600 percent since 1992.,And the problems posednby putting kids into institutions,don't just pertain to the corruptnand abusive institutions,like the one that I rescued the kids from.,The problems are with all formsnof residential care. 
 Over 60 years of internationalnresearch has shown us,that children who grow up in institutions,,even the very best institutions,,are at serious risknof developing mental illnesses,,attachment disorders,,growth and speech delays,,and many will strugglenwith an inability to reintegrate,back into society later in life,and form healthy relationships as adults.,These kids grow upnwithout any model of family,or of what good parenting looks like,,so they then can strugglento parent their own children.,So if you institutionalizenlarge numbers of children,,it will affect not only this generation,,but also the generations to come. 
 We've learned these lessonsnbefore in Australia.,It's what happenednto our "Stolen Generations,",the indigenous childrennwho were removed from their families,with the beliefnthat we could do a better job,of raising their children. 
 Just imagine for a moment,what residential carenwould be like for a child.,Firstly, you have a constantnrotation of caregivers,,with somebody new coming onnto the shift every eight hours.,And then on top of thatnyou have a steady stream of visitors,and volunteers coming in,,showering you in the lovenand affection you're craving,and then leaving again,,evoking all of those feelingsnof abandonment,,and proving again and again,that you are not worthy of being loved. 
 We don't have orphanagesnin Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,,and for a very good reason:,one study has shown that young adultsnraised in institutions,are 10 times more likelynto fall into sex work than their peers,,40 times more likelynto have a criminal record,,and 500 times more likely,to take their own lives.,There are an estimatedneight million children around the world,living in institutions like orphanages,,despite the fact that aroundn80 percent of them are not orphans.,Most have familiesnwho could be caring for them,if they had the right support. 
 But for me,,the most shocking thing of all to realize,is what's contributing to this boom,in the unnecessary institutionalizationnof so many children:,it's us --,the tourists, the volunteers,and the donors.,It's the well-meaning supportnfrom people like me back in 2006,,who visit these childrennand volunteer and donate,,who are unwittingly fueling an industrynthat exploits children,and tears families apart. 
 It's really no coincidencenthat these institutions are largely set up,in areas where touristsncan most easily be lured in,to visit and volunteernin exchange for donations.,Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,,over 90 percent of them are locatednin the most popular tourist hotspots.,The cold, hard truth is,,the more money that floods innin support of these institutions,,the more institutions open,and the more childrennare removed from their families,to fill their beds.,It's just the laws of supply and demand. 
 I had to learn all of thesenlessons the hard way,,after I had already set upnan orphanage in Cambodia.,I had to eat a big piecenof humble pie to admit,that I had made a mistake,and inadvertently becomena part of the problem.,I had been an orphanage tourist,,a voluntourist.,I then set up my own orphanagenand facilitated orphanage tourism,in order to generate fundsnfor my orphanage,,before I knew better.,What I came to learn,is that no matter how goodnmy orphanage was,,it was never going to give those kidsnwhat they really needed:,their families. 
 I know that it can feelnincredibly depressing,to learn that helping vulnerable childrennand overcoming poverty,is not as simple as we've allnbeen led to believe it should be.,But thankfully, there is a solution.,These problems are reversiblenand preventable,,and when we know better,,we can do better. 
 The organization that I run today,,the Cambodian Children's Trust,,is no longer an orphanage.,In 2012, we changed the modelnin favor of family-based care.,I now lead an amazing teamnof Cambodian social workers,,nurses and teachers.,Together, we work within communities,to untangle a complex web of social issues,and help Cambodiannfamilies escape poverty.,Our primary focus is on preventingnsome of the most vulnerable families,in our community,from being separated in the first place.,But in cases where it's not possible,for a child to livenwith its biological family,,we support them in foster care.,Family-based care is always better,than placing a child in an institution. 
 Do you remember that first photonthat I showed you before?,See that girl who is just aboutnto catch the ball?,Her name is Torn,She's a strong, bravenand fiercely intelligent girl.,But in 2006, when I first met her,living in that corruptnand abusive orphanage,,she had never been to school.,She was suffering terrible neglect,,and she yearned desperately,for the warmth and love of her mother.,But this is a photo of Torn todaynwith her family.,Her mother now has a secure job,,her siblings are doing well in high school,and she is just about to finishnher nursing degree at university.,For Torn's family -- 
 (Applause) 
 for Torn's family,,the cycle of poverty has been broken.,The family-based care modelnthat we have developed at CCT,has been so successful,,that it's now being put forwardnby UNICEF Cambodia,and the Cambodian government,as a national solutionnto keep children in families.,And one of the best -- 
 (Applause) 
 And one of the best waysnthat you can help to solve this problem,is by giving these eight millionnchildren a voice,and become an advocatenfor family-based care. 
 If we work together to raise awareness,,we can make sure the world knows,that we need to put an endnto the unnecessary institutionalization,of vulnerable children.,How do we achieve that?,By redirecting our supportnand our donations,away from orphanagesnand residential care institutions,towards organizations that are committednto keeping children in families. 
 I believe we can make this happennin our lifetime,,and as a result, we will seendeveloping communities thrive,and ensure that vulnerablenchildren everywhere,have what all children need and deserve:,a family. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is the Bop. 
 The Bop is a type of social dance. 
 Dance is a language,,and social dance is an expressionnthat emerges from a community.,A social dance isn't choreographednby any one person.,It can't be traced to any one moment. 
 Each dance has stepsnthat everyone can agree on,,but it's about the individualnand their creative identity.,Because of that,,social dances bubble up,,they change,and they spread like wildfire. 
 They are as old as our remembered history.,In African-American social dances,,we see over 200 years,of how African and African-Americanntraditions influenced our history.,The present always contains the past.,And the past shapes who we are,and who we will be. 
 (Clapping) 
 The Juba dance was bornnfrom enslaved Africans' experience,on the plantation.,Brought to the Americas,,stripped of a common spoken language,,this dance was a way for enslaved Africansnto remember where they're from.,It may have looked something like this. 
 Slapping thighs,,shuffling feet,and patting hands:,this was how they got aroundnthe slave owners' ban on drumming,,improvising complex rhythms,just like ancestors didnwith drums in Haiti,or in the Yoruba communitiesnof West Africa.,It was about keepingncultural traditions alive,and retaining a sense of inner freedom,under captivity. 
 It was the same subversive spiritnthat created this dance:,the Cakewalk,,a dance that parodied the mannerismsnof Southern high society --,a way for the enslavednto throw shade at the masters.,The crazy thing about this dance,is that the Cakewalknwas performed for the masters,,who never suspectednthey were being made fun of. 
 Now you might recognize this one.,1920s --,the Charleston.,The Charleston was all aboutnimprovisation and musicality,,making its way into Lindy Hop,,swing dancing,and even the Kid n Play,,originally called the Funky Charleston. 
 Started by a tight-knit Black communitynnear Charleston, South Carolina,,the Charleston permeated dance halls,where young women suddenly hadnthe freedom to kick their heels,and move their legs. 
 Now, social dance is aboutncommunity and connection;,if you knew the steps,,it meant you belonged to a group.,But what if it becomes a worldwide craze?,Enter the Twist.,It's no surprise that the Twistncan be traced back to the 19th century,,brought to America from the Congo,during slavery.,But in the late '50s,,right before the Civil Rights Movement,,the Twist is popularizednby Chubby Checker and Dick Clark.,Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist:,white teenagers,,kids in Latin America,,making its way into songs and movies.,Through social dance,,the boundaries between groupsnbecome blurred. 
 The story continues in the 1980s and '90s.,Along with the emergence of hip-hop,,African-American social dancentook on even more visibility,,borrowing from its long past,,shaping culture and being shaped by it. 
 Today, these dances continuento evolve, grow and spread. 
 Why do we dance?,To move,,to let loose,,to express.,Why do we dance together?,To heal,,to remember,,to say: "We speak a common language.,We exist,and we are free."Why do people deliberatelyndestroy cultural heritage?,By doing so,,do they believenthey're erasing our history?,Our cultural memory?,It's true that we are losingncultural heritage to erosion,and natural disasters,,but this is somethingnthat is simply difficult to avoid.,I'm here to show you todaynhow we can use pictures --,your pictures --,to reclaim the history that is being lost,using innovative technology,and the effort of volunteers. 
 In the early 20th century,,archaeologists discoverednhundreds of statues and artifacts,at the ancient city of Hatra,,in northern Iraq.,Statues like this onenwere found in fragments,,some of them missing their heads or arms,,yet the clothing that they are wearing,and their pose,can still tell us their story.,For example,,we believe that by wearingna knee-length tunic,and open bare feet,,this was representative of a priest.,However, with a closer looknat this particular piece,,we can see that this tunic being wornnwas elaborately decorated,,which has led many researchers to believe,this was actually a statue of a kingnperforming his religious functions. 
 When the Mosul Cultural Museumnopened in 1952 in northern Iraq,,this statue, as well as others,,were placed there to preserve themnfor future generations.,Following the US-led invasionnof Iraq in 2003,,a few statues and artifactsnwere relocated to Baghdad,,but this statue remained.,Then in February of last year,na video was released,,and it instantly went viral.,Maybe some of you remember seeing it.,Here's a short clip. 
 (Video) (Singing in Arabic) 
 (Singing ends) 
 Not a very pleasant sight, right?,Did you notice anythingnfamiliar in the video?,There it is.,There is that very statue,,as it was toppled over,,breaking into pieces. 
 When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video,,we were shocked.,Since we are archaeologistsnusing innovative technology,for digital preservation,,an idea sprung to mind.,Maybe we can crowdsource the imagesnthat were taken of these artifacts,before they were destroyed,,to create digital reconstructions.,If we can do that,,maybe we can put themninto a virtual museum,to tell that story.,And so two weeks after we saw this video,,we started the projectncalled Project Mosul. 
 Remember the pictures of the statuenI showed you before?,This is actually the crowdsourcednreconstruction of it,before it was destroyed.,Now, many of you may be wondering,,how exactly does this work?,Well, the key to this technologynis called photogrammetry,,and it was invented here, in Germany.,It is the technology that allows usnto use two-dimensional images,taken of the same objectnfrom different angles,to create a 3D model.,I know you may be thinkingnthis sounds like magic -- but it's not.,Let me show you how it works.,Here are two crowdsourced imagesnof the same statue.,What the computer can do,is it can detect similar featuresnbetween the photographs --,similar features of the object.,Then, by using multiple photos,,in this case, it can beginnto reconstruct the object in 3D.,In this case,,you have the position of the camerasnwhen each image was taken,,shown in blue. 
 Now, this is a partialnreconstruction, I admit,,but why would I say partial?,Well, simply because the statuenwas positioned against a wall.,We don't have photographsntaken of it from the back.,If I wanted to complete a fullndigital reconstruction of this statue,,I would need a proper camera,,tripods, proper lighting,,but we simply can't do thatnwith crowdsourced images.,Think about it:,How many of you, when you visit a museum,,take photographsnof all parts of the statue,,even the back side of it?,Well, maybe if some of you findnMichelangelo's David interesting,,I guess -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But the thing is,,if we can find more images of this object,,we can improve the 3D model. 
 When we started the project,,we started it withnthe Mosul Museum in mind.,We figured we may get a few images,,some people interested,,make one or two virtual reconstructions,,but we had no idea that we had sparkednsomething that would grow so quickly.,Before we knew it,,we realized it was obvious:,we could apply this same ideanto lost heritage anywhere.,And so, we decided to changenthe name of the project to Rekrei.,Then, in the summer of last year,,"The Economist" magazine's media labnreached out to us.,They asked us,,"Hey, would you like usnto build a virtual museum,to put the reconstructions back inside,,to tell the story?",Can you imagine us saying no?,Of course not.,We said yes!,We were so excited.,This was exactlynthe initial dream of that project.,And so now,,any of you can experiencenRecoVR Mosul on your phone,,using Google Cardboard,or a tablet or even YouTube 360. 
 Here is a screenshotnfrom the virtual museum.,And there it is ...,the partial reconstruction of the statue,,as well as the Lion of Mosul,,the first reconstructionncompleted by our project.,Although the video doesn't explicitly shownthe Lion of Mosul being destroyed,,we have many other examplesnof large artifacts being destroyed,that were simply too largento have been stolen.,For example,,the Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.,This is a digitalnreconstruction from before,,and this is actuallynduring the destruction.,Or the Lion of Al-Lāt, in Palmyra, Syria:,before ...,and after. 
 Although virtual reconstructionsnare primarily the main focus,of our project,,some people have been asking the question:,Can we print them in 3D?,We believe 3D printingndoesn't offer a straightforward solution,to lost heritage.,Once an object is destroyed,,it's gone.,But 3D printing does offernan addition to tell that story.,For example, I can show you here ...,There is the statue from Hatra,and the Lion of Mosul. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Now, if you look closely,,you'll notice that there are some partsnthat have been printed in color,,and some parts that are in white or gray.,This part was addednsimply to hold the statues up.,This works the same waynif you visit a museum,,and a statue is found in fragments;,it's put togethernfor the people to see it.,This makes sense, right?,However, we're much more interested,in what virtual realitynhas to offer for lost heritage. 
 Here is an examplenof one of the tower tombs,that was destroyed in Palmyra.,Using Sketchfab's online viewer,,we can show that we have reconstructednthree parts of the exterior of the tomb,,but we also have photos of the inside,,so we're beginning to createna reconstruction of the wall,and the ceiling.,Archaeologists worked therenfor many, many years,,so we also have architecturalndrawing plans of this lost heritage. 
 Unfortunately, we are not only losingncultural heritage to areas of conflict,and at war --,we're also losing it to natural disasters.,This is a 3D modelnof Durbar Square in Kathmandu,,before the earthquakenthat occurred last April ...,and this is after.,You may be thinking,,you didn't create these 3D modelsnwith only tourist photographs,,and that's true.,But what this represents,is the ability for large, publicnorganizations and private industry,to come togethernfor initiatives like ours. 
 And so one of the major challengesnof our project, really,,is to find photographs that were takennbefore something happens, right?,Well, the internet is basically a databasenwith millions of images, right?,Exactly.,So we have begun to develop a tool,that allows us to extract imagesnfrom websites like Flickr,,based on their geotags,,to complete reconstructions. 
 Because we're not only losing culturalnheritage to natural disasters and in war,,but we're also losing itnto something else.,Any idea, just lookingnat these two pictures?,Maybe it's a little difficult to remember,,but only a few weeks ago,,this was the example of humanndestruction by human stupidity.,Because a tourist in Lisbonnwanted to climb onto this statue,and take a selfie with it -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and pulled it down with him.,So we're already finding photographs,to complete a digitalnreconstruction of this. 
 We need to remember,that the destruction of cultural heritagenisn't a recent phenomenon.,In the 16th century,,European priests and explorers burnednthousands of Maya books in the Americas,,of which we only have a handful left.,Fast-forward to 2001,,when the Taliban blew upnthe Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan. 
 You see,,cultural heritagenis about our shared global history.,It helps us connectnwith our ancestors and their stories,,but we're losing pieces of itnevery day to natural disasters,and in areas of conflict.,Of course, the loss of human lifenis the most heartbreaking loss ...,but cultural heritage offers us a waynto preserve the memory of the people,for future generations.,We need your help to reclaimnthe history that is being lost.,Will you join us? 
 (Applause)So in 2011, I altered my name,so that I could participatenin Far Right youth camp in Hungary.,I was doing a PhD looking atnyouth political socialization --,why young people were developingnpolitical ideologies,in a post-communist setting,,and I saw that a lotnof young people I was talking to,were joining the Far Right,,and this was astounding to me.,So I wanted to enroll in this youth camp,to get a better understandingnof why people were joining. 
 So a colleague enrolled me,,and my last name soundsna little bit too Jewish.,So Erin got turned into Iréna,,and Saltman got turned into Sós,,which means "salty" in Hungarian.,And in Hungarian,nyour last name goes first,,so my James Bond namenturned into "Salty Irena,",which is not somethingnI would have naturally chosen for myself. 
 But going to this camp,,I was further shocked to realizenthat it was actually really fun.,They talked very little about politics.,It was mostly learning how to ride horses,,shooting a bow and arrow,,live music at night,,free food and alcohol,,also some air-gun target practice,using mainstream politicians'nfaces as targets.,And this seemed like a very,nactually, friendly, inclusive group,until you started talking or mentioningnanything to do with the Roma population,,Jewish people or immigrants,,and then the discourse would becomenvery hate-based very quickly. 
 So it led me into my work now,,where we pose the question,,"Why do people joinnviolent extremist movements,,and how do we effectivelyncounter these processes?",In the aftermath of horriblenatrocities and attacks,in places like Belgium, France,nbut all over the world,,sometimes it's easier for us to think,,"Well, these must be sociopaths,,these must be naturallynviolent individuals.,They must have something wrongnwith their upbringing.",And what's really tragic,is that oftentimes there's no one profile.,Many people comenfrom educated backgrounds,,different socioeconomic backgrounds,,men and women, different ages,,some with families, some single.,So why? What is this allure?,And this is whatnI want to talk you through,,as well as how do wenchallenge this in a modern era? 
 We do know, through research,,that there are quite a numbernof different things,that affect somebody'snprocess of radicalization,,and we categorize theseninto push and pull factors.,And these are pretty much similarnfor Far Right, neo-Nazi groups,all the way to Islamist extremistnand terrorist groups.,And push factors are basicallynwhat makes you vulnerable,to a process of radicalization,,to joining a violent extremist group.,And these can bena lot of different things,,but roughly, a sense of alienation,na sense of isolation,,questioning your own identity,,but also feeling that your in-groupnis under attack,,and your in group might be basednon a nationality or an ethnicity,or a religion,,and feeling that larger powers around younare doing nothing to help. 
 Now, push factors alonendo not make you a violent extremist,,because if that were the fact,,those same factors would gontowards a group like the Roma population,,and they're notna violently mobilized group.,So we have to look at the pull factors.,What are these violentnextremist organizations offering,that other groups are not offering?,And actually, this is usuallynvery positive things,,very seemingly empowering things,,such as brotherhood and sisterhood,and a sense of belonging,,as well as giving somebodyna spiritual purpose,,a divine purposento build a utopian society,if their goals can be met,,but also a sense of empowermentnand adventure. 
 When we looknat foreign terrorist fighters,,we see young mennwith the wind in their hair,out in the desertnand women going to join them,to have nuptials out in the sunset.,It's very romantic, and you become a hero.,For both men and women,nthat's the propaganda being given.,So what extremist groups are very good at,is taking a very complicated,nconfusing, nuanced world,and simplifying that worldninto black and white,,good and evil.,And you become what is good,,challenging what is evil. 
 So I want to talk a little bitnabout ISIS, Daesh,,because they have been a game changernin how we look at these processes,,and through a lot of the materialnand their tactics.,They're very much a modern movement.,One of the aspects is the internetnand the usage of social media,,as we've all seen in headlinesntweeting and videos of beheadings.,But the internet alonendoes not radicalize you.,The internet is a tool.,You don't go online shopping for shoes,and accidentally become a jihadist.,However, what the Internetndoes do is it is a catalyst. 
 It provides tools and scale and rapidity,that doesn't exist elsewhere.,And with ISIS, all of a sudden,,this idea of a cloaked, dark figurenof a jihadist changed for us.,All of a sudden,nwe were in their kitchens.,We saw what they were eating for dinner.,They were tweeting.,We had foreign terrorist fightersntweeting in their own languages.,We had women going out therentalking about their wedding day,,about the births of their children.,We had gaming culture, all of a sudden,,and referencesnto Grand Theft Auto being made. 
 So all of a sudden, they were homey.,They became human.,And the problemnis that trying to counter it,,lots of governmentsnand social media companies,just tried to censor.,How do we get rid of terrorist content?,And it became a cat-and-mouse game,where we would see accounts taken downnand they'd just come back up,,and an arrogance around somebodynhaving a 25th account,and material that wasndisseminated everywhere. 
 But we also saw a dangerous trend --,violent extremists know the rulesnand regulations of social media, too.,So we would see a banalnconversation with a recruiter,start on a mainstream platform,,and at the pointnat which that conversation,was going to become illegal,,they would jump to a smaller,nless regulated,,more encrypted platform.,So all of a sudden, we couldn'tntrack where that conversation went.,So this is a problem with censorship,,which is why we need to developnalternatives to censorship. 
 ISIS is also a game-changernbecause it's state-building.,It's not just recruiting combatants;,it's trying to build a state.,And what that means is all of a sudden,,your recruitment model is much more broad.,You're not just trying to get fighters --,now you need architects, engineers,naccountants, hackers and women.,We've actually seenna huge increase of women going,in the last 24, but especially 12 months.,Some countries, one in fournof the people going over to join,are now women.,And so, this really changes,who we're trying to counternthis process with. 
 Now, not all doom and gloom.,So the rest I'd like to talk aboutnsome of the positive things,and the new innovation in tryingnto prevent and counter violent extremism. 
 Preventing is very differentnthan countering,,and actually, you can think of itnin medical terms.,So preventative medicine is,,how do we make itnso you are naturally resilient,to this process of radicalization,,whereas that is going to be different,if somebody is already showingna symptom or a sign,of belonging to a violentnextremist ideology.,And so in preventative measures,,we're talking morenabout really broad groups of people,and exposure to ideas,to make them resilient.,Whereas it's very different,if somebody is starting to questionnand agree with certain things online,,and it's also very differentnif somebody already has a swastika tattoo,and is very much embedded within a group.,How do you reach them? 
 So I'd like to go through three examplesnof each one of those levels,and talk you through,what some of the new waysnof engaging with people are becoming. 
 One is "Extreme Dialogue,",and it's an educational programnthat we helped develop.,This one is from Canada,,and it's meant to create dialoguesnwithin a classroom setting,,using storytelling,,because violent extremismncan be very hard to try to explain,,especially to younger individuals.,So we have a network of former extremistsnand survivors of extremism,that tell their stories through videonand create question-giving to classrooms,,to start a conversation about the topic. 
 These two examples show Christianne,,who lost her son,,who radicalized and diednfighting for ISIS,,and Daniel is a former neo-Nazi,who was an extremely violent neo-Nazi,,and they pose questions about their livesnand where they're at and regret,,and force a classroomnto have a dialogue around it. 
 Now, looking at that middle rangenof individuals,,actually, we need a lotnof civil society voices.,How do you interact with peoplenthat are looking for information online,,that are starting to toy with an ideology,,that are doing those searchingnidentity questions?,How do we provide alternatives for that?,And that's when we combinenlarge groups of civil society voices,with creatives, techies,napp developers, artists, comedians,,and we can create really specified content,and actually, online, disseminate itnto very strategic audiences.,So one example would bencreating a satirical video,which makes fun of Islamophobia,,and targeting itnto 15- to 20-year-olds online,that have an interest in white power music,and live specifically in Manchester. 
 We can use these marketing toolsnto be very specific,,so that we knownwhen somebody's viewing, watching,and engaging with that content,,it's not just the average person,nit's not me or you --,it's a very specific audiencenthat we are looking to engage with. 
 Even more downstream, we developedna pilot program called "One to One,",where we took former extremists,and we had them reach out directlynto a group of labeled neofascists,as well as Islamist extremists,,and put direct messages through FacebooknMessenger into their inbox, saying,,"Hey, I see where you're going.nI've been there.,If you want to talk, I'm here.",Now, we kind of expected death threatsnfrom this sort of interaction.,It's a little alarming to havena former neo-Nazi say, "Hey, how are you?",But actually, we foundnthat around 60 percent,of the people reached out to responded,,and of that, around another 60 percentnhad sustained engagement,,meaning that they werenhaving conversations,with the hardest people to reachnabout what they were going through,,planting seeds of doubt,and giving them alternativesnfor talking about these subjects,,and that's really important. 
 So what we're trying to do,is actually bringnunlikely sectors to the table.,We have amazing activistsnall over the world,,but oftentimes,ntheir messages are not strategic,or they don't actually reachnthe audiences they want to reach.,So we work with networksnof former extremists.,We work with networks of young peoplenin different parts of the world.,And we work with themnto bring the tech sector to the table,with artists and creativesnand marketing expertise,so that we can actually havena more robust and challenging of extremism,that works together. 
 So I would saynthat if you are in the audience,and you happen to be a graphic designer,,a poet, a marketing expert,,somebody that works in PR,,a comedian --,you might not thinknthat this is your sector,,but actually, the skillsnthat you have right now,might be exactly what is needed,to help challenge extremism effectively. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What is a parent? 
 What is a parent? 
 It's not an easy question.,Today we have adoption,,stepfamilies,,surrogate mothers.,Many parents face tough questions,and tough decisions.,Shall we tell our childnabout the sperm donation?,If so, when?,What words to use?,Sperm donors are often referrednto as "biological fathers,",but should we reallynbe using the word "father?" 
 As a philosopher and social scientist,,I have been studying these questionsnabout the concept of parenthood.,But today, I will talk to younabout what I learned,from talking to parents and children.,I will show you that they knownwhat matters most in a family,,even though their familynlooks a little different.,I will show you their creative waysnof dealing with tough questions.,But I will also show younthe parents' uncertainties. 
 We interviewed couples,who received fertility treatmentnat Ghent University Hospital,,using sperm from a donor.,In this treatment timeline,,you can see two pointsnat which we conducted interviews.,We included heterosexual couples,,where the man for some reasonndid not have good-quality sperm,,and lesbian couples who obviouslynneeded to find sperm elsewhere.,We also included children.,I wanted to know,how those children define conceptsnlike parenthood and family.,In fact, that is what I asked them,,only not in that way.,I drew an apple tree instead.,This way, I could ask abstract,nphilosophical questions,in a way that did not make them run off. 
 So as you can see,,the apple tree is empty.,And that illustrates my research approach.,By designing techniques like this,,I can bring as little meaning and contentnas possible to the interview,,because I want to hear that from them. 
 I asked them:,What would your family look likenif it were an apple tree?,And they could take a paper applenfor everyone who, in their view,,was a member of the family,,write a name on itnand hang it wherever they wanted.,And I would ask questions.,Most children startednwith a parent or a sibling.,One started with "Boxer,",the dead dog of his grandparents. 
 At this point, none of the childrennstarted mentioning the donor.,So, I asked them about their birth story.,I said, "Before you were born,,it was just your mom and dad,,or mom and mommy.,Can you tell me how you cameninto the family?",And they explained.,One said,,"My parents did not have good seeds,,but there are friendly men out therenwho have spare seeds.,They bring them to the hospital,,and they put them in a big jar.,My mommy went there,,and she took two from the jar,,one for me and one for my sister.,She put the seeds in her belly --,somehow --,and her belly grew really big,,and there I was." 
 Hmm.,So only when they startednmentioning the donor,,I asked questions about him,nusing their own words.,I said,,"If this would be an applenfor the friendly man with the seeds,,what would you do with it?",And one boy was thinking out loud,,holding the apple.,And he said,,"I won't put this onenup there with the others.,He's not part of my family.,But I will not put him on the ground.,That's too cold and too hard.,I think he should be in the trunk,,because he made my family possible.,If he would not have done this,,that would really be sadnbecause my family would not be here,,and I would not be here." 
 So also, parentsnconstructed family tales --,tales to tell their children.,One couple explained their insemination,by taking their children to a farm,to watch a vet inseminate cows.,And why not?,It's their way of explaining;,their do-it-yourselfnwith family narratives.,DIY.,And we had another couplenwho made books --,a book for each child.,They were really works of art,containing their thoughts and feelingsnthroughout the treatment.,They even had the hospitalnparking tickets in there. 
 So it is DIY:,finding ways, words and images,to tell your family story to your child.,And these stories were highly diverse,,but they all had one thing in common:,it was a tale of longing for a child,and a quest for that child.,It was about how specialnand how deeply loved their child was.,And research so far showsnthat these children are doing fine.,They do not havenmore problems than other kids. 
 Yet, these parents also wantednto justify their decisions,through the tales they tell.,They hoped that their childrennwould understand their reasons,for making the family in this way.,Underlying was a fearnthat their children might disapprove,and would reject the non-genetic parent.,And that fear is understandable,,because we live in a very heteronormative,and geneticized society --,a world that still believes,that true families consistnof one mom, one dad,and their genetically related children. 
 Well.,I want to tell you about a teenage boy.,He was donor-conceivednbut not part of our study.,One day, he had an argumentnwith his father,,and he yelled,,"You're telling me what to do?,You're not even my father!",That was exactly whatnthe parents in our study feared.,Now, the boy soon felt sorry,nand they made up.,But it is the reaction of his fathernthat is most interesting. 
 He said,,"This outburst had nothing to donwith the lack of a genetic link.,It was about puberty --,being difficult.,It's what they do at that age.,It will pass." 
 What this man shows us,is that when something goes wrong,,we should not immediately think,it is because the familynis a little different.,These things happen in all families.,And every now and then,,all parents may wonder:,Am I a good enough parent?,These parents, too.,They, above all, wanted to donwhat's best for their child.,But they also sometimes wondered:,Am I a real parent?,And their uncertainties were presentnlong before they even were parents. 
 At the start of treatment,,when they first saw the counselor,,they paid close attentionnto the counselor,,because they wanted to do it right.,Even 10 years later,,they still remembernthe advice they were given. 
 So when they thought about the counselor,and the advice they were given,,we discussed that.,And we saw one lesbian couple who said,,"When our son asks us,,'Do I have a dad?',we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.',But we will say nothing more,nnot unless he asks,,because he might not be ready for that.,The counselor said so." 
 Well.,I don't know; that's quite different,from how we respondnto children's questions.,Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?",We will say, "No, it comes from cows,",and we will talk about the farmer,,and the way the milk ends up in the shop.,We will not say,,"No, milk is not made in a factory.",So something strange happened here,,and of course these children noticed that. 
 One boy said,,"I asked my parents loads of questions,,but they acted really weird.,So, you know, I have a friend at school,nand she's made in the same way.,When I have a question,nI just go and ask her.",Clever guy.,Problem solved.,But his parents did not notice,,and it certainly was notnwhat they had in mind,,nor what the counselor had in mind,when they were saying how importantnit is to be an open-communication family. 
 And that's the strange thing about advice.,When we offer people pills,nwe gather evidence first.,We do tests,,we do follow-up studies.,We want to know, and rightly so,nwhat this pill is doing,and how it affects people's lives.,And advice?,It is not enough for advice,,or for professionals to give advicenthat is theoretically sound,,or well-meant.,It should be advicenthat there is evidence for --,evidence that it actuallynimproves patients' lives. 
 So the philosopher in menwould now like to offer you a paradox:,I advise you to stop following advice.,But, yes. 
 (Applause) 
 I will not end here with what went wrong;,I would not be doing justicento the warmth we found in those families.,Remember the booksnand the trip to the farmer?,When parents do things that work for them,,they do brilliant things.,What I want you to remembernas members of families,,in no matter what form or shape,,is that what families neednare warm relationships.,And we do not need to benprofessionals to create those.,Most of us do just fine,,although it may be hard work,,and from time to time,nwe can do with some advice. 
 In that case,,bear in mind three things.,Work with advicenthat works for your family.,Remember -- you're the expert,nbecause you live your family life.,And finally,,believe in your abilitiesnand your creativity,,because you can do it yourself. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)People have been using medianto talk about sex for a long time.,Love letters, phone sex, racy Polaroids.,There's even a story of a girl who elopednwith a man that she met over the telegraph,in 1886.,Today we have sexting,nand I am a sexting expert.,Not an expert sexter.,Though, I do know what this means --nI think you do too. 
 [it's a penis] 
 (Laughter) 
 I have been studying sexting sincenthe media attention to it began in 2008.,I wrote a book on the moralnpanic about sexting.,And here's what I found:,most people are worryingnabout the wrong thing.,They're trying to just preventnsexting from happening entirely.,But let me ask you this:,As long as it's completely consensual,nwhat's the problem with sexting?,People are into all sorts of thingsnthat you may not be into,,like blue cheese or cilantro. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sexting is certainly risky,nlike anything that's fun,,but as long as you're not sending an imagento someone who doesn't want to receive it,,there's no harm.,What I do think is a serious problem,is when people sharenprivate images of others,without their permission.,And instead of worrying about sexting,,what I think we need to donis think a lot more about digital privacy. 
 The key is consent.,Right now most peoplenare thinking about sexting,without really thinkingnabout consent at all.,Did you know that we currentlyncriminalize teen sexting?,It can be a crime becausenit counts as child pornography,,if there's an image of someone under 18,,and it doesn't even matter,if they took that image of themselvesnand shared it willingly.,So we end up with thisnbizarre legal situation,where two 17-year-oldsncan legally have sex in most US states,but they can't photograph it.,Some states have also triednpassing sexting misdemeanor laws,but these laws repeat the same problem,because they stillnmake consensual sexting illegal.,It doesn't make sense,to try to ban all sextingnto try to address privacy violations.,This is kind of like saying,,let's solve the problem of date rapenby just making dating completely illegal.,Most teens don't get arrested for sexting,nbut can you guess who does?,It's often teens who are dislikednby their partner's parents.,And this can be because of class bias,nracism or homophobia.,Most prosecutors are,nof course, smart enough,not to use child pornography chargesnagainst teenagers, but some do. 
 According to researchersnat the University of New Hampshire,seven percent of all child pornographynpossession arrests are teens,,sexting consensually with other teens.,Child pornography is a serious crime,,but it's just notnthe same thing as teen sexting.,Parents and educatorsnare also responding to sexting,without really thinkingntoo much about consent.,Their message to teens is often:njust don't do it. 
 And I totally get it --nthere are serious legal risks,and of course, that potentialnfor privacy violations.,And when you were a teen,,I'm sure you did exactlynas you were told, right? 
 You're probably thinking,nmy kid would never sext.,And that's true, your little angelnmay not be sexting,because only 33 percent,of 16- and 17-year-olds are sexting.,But, sorry, by the time they're older,nodds are they will be sexting.,Every study I've seen puts the ratenabove 50 percent for 18- to 24-year-olds.,And most of the time, nothing goes wrong.,People ask me all the time things like,nisn't sexting just so dangerous, though?,It's like you wouldn'tnleave your wallet on a park bench,and you expect it's going to get stolennif you do that, right?,Here's how I think about it:,sexting is like leaving your walletnat your boyfriend's house.,If you come back the next day,and all the money is just gone,,you really need to dump that guy.,(Laughter),So instead of criminalizing sexting,to try to preventnthese privacy violations,,instead we need to make consent central,to how we think about the circulationnof our private information. 
 Every new media technologynraises privacy concerns.,In fact, in the US the very firstnmajor debates about privacy,were in response to technologiesnthat were relatively new at the time.,In the late 1800s,npeople were worried about cameras,,which were just suddenlynmore portable than ever before,,and newspaper gossip columns.,They were worried that the cameranwould capture information about them,,take it out of contextnand widely disseminate it.,Does this sound familiar?,It's exactly what we're worrying aboutnnow with social media and drone cameras,,and, of course, sexting.,And these fears about technology,,they make sense,because technologiesncan amplify and bring out,our worst qualities and behaviors.,But there are solutions.,And we've been here beforenwith a dangerous new technology. 
 In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T car.,Traffic fatality rates were rising.,It was a serious problem --nit looks so safe, right?,Our first responsenwas to try to change drivers' behavior,,so we developed speed limitsnand enforced them through fines.,But over the following decades,,we started to realize the technologynof the car itself is not just neutral.,We could design the car to make it safer.,So in the 1920s, we gotnshatter-resistant windshields.,In the 1950s, seat belts.,And in the 1990s, airbags.,All three of these areas:,laws, individuals and industryncame together over time,to help solve the problemnthat a new technology causes.,And we can do the same thingnwith digital privacy.,Of course, it comes back to consent.,Here's the idea.,Before anyone can distributenyour private information,,they should have to get your permission.,This idea of affirmative consentncomes from anti-rape activists,who tell us that we need consentnfor every sexual act.,And we have really high standardsnfor consent in a lot of other areas. 
 Think about having surgery.,Your doctor has to make sure,that you are meaningfully and knowinglynconsenting to that medical procedure.,This is not the type of consentnlike with an iTunes Terms of Service,where you just scroll to the bottomnand you're like, agree, agree, whatever. 
 (Laughter) 
 If we think more about consent,nwe can have better privacy laws.,Right now, we just don't haventhat many protections.,If your ex-husband or your ex-wifenis a terrible person,,they can take your nude photosnand upload them to a porn site.,It can be really hardnto get those images taken down.,And in a lot of states,,you're actually better offnif you took the images of yourself,because then you cannfile a copyright claim. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right now, if someonenviolates your privacy,,whether that's an individualnor a company or the NSA,,you can try filing a lawsuit,,though you may not be successful,because many courts assumenthat digital privacy is just impossible.,So they're not willingnto punish anyone for violating it.,I still hear peoplenasking me all the time,,isn't a digital image somehow blurringnthe line between public and private,because it's digital, right?,No! No!,Everything digitalnis not just automatically public.,That doesn't make any sense. 
 As NYU legal scholarnHelen Nissenbaum tells us,,we have laws and policies and norms,that protect all kindsnof information that's private,,and it doesn't make a differencenif it's digital or not.,All of your health records are digitized,but your doctor can'tnjust share them with anyone.,All of your financial informationnis held in digital databases,,but your credit card company can'tnjust post your purchase history online.,Better laws could help addressnprivacy violations after they happen,,but one of the easiest thingsnwe can all do is make personal changes,to help protect each other's privacy.,We're always told that privacy,is our own, sole,nindividual responsibility.,We're told, constantly monitornand update your privacy settings.,We're told, never share anythingnyou wouldn't want the entire world to see.,This doesn't make sense.,Digital media are social environments,and we share thingsnwith people we trust all day, every day. 
 As Princeton researchernJanet Vertesi argues,,our data and our privacy,nthey're not just personal,,they're actually interpersonal.,And so one thing you can donthat's really easy,is just start asking for permission beforenyou share anyone else's information.,If you want to post a photonof someone online, ask for permission.,If you want to forward an email thread,,ask for permission.,And if you want to sharensomeone's nude selfie,,obviously, ask for permission. 
 These individual changes can reallynhelp us protect each other's privacy,,but we need technology companiesnon board as well.,These companies have very littlenincentive to help protect our privacy,because their business modelsndepend on us sharing everything,with as many people as possible.,Right now, if I send you an image,,you can forward thatnto anyone that you want.,But what if I got to decidenif that image was forwardable or not?,This would tell you, you don'tnhave my permission to send this image out.,We do this kind of thing all the timento protect copyright.,If you buy an e-book, you can't justnsend it out to as many people as you want.,So why not try this with mobile phones?,What you can do is we can demandnthat tech companies add these protections,to our devices and our platformsnas the default.,After all, you can choosenthe color of your car,,but the airbags are always standard. 
 If we don't think morenabout digital privacy and consent,,there can be serious consequences.,There was a teenager from Ohio --,let's call her Jennifer,nfor the sake of her privacy.,She shared nude photos of herselfnwith her high school boyfriend,,thinking she could trust him.,Unfortunately, he betrayed her,and sent her photosnaround the entire school.,Jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated,,but instead of being compassionate,nher classmates harassed her.,They called her a slut and a whore,and they made her life miserable.,Jennifer started missing schoolnand her grades dropped.,Ultimately, Jennifer decidednto end her own life. 
 Jennifer did nothing wrong.,All she did was share a nude photo,with someone she thoughtnthat she could trust.,And yet our laws tell her,that she committed a horrible crimenequivalent to child pornography.,Our gender norms tell her,that by producingnthis nude image of herself,,she somehow did the mostnhorrible, shameful thing.,And when we assume that privacynis impossible in digital media,,we completely write off and excusenher boyfriend's bad, bad behavior.,People are still saying all the timento victims of privacy violations,,"What were you thinking?,You should have never sent that image." 
 If you're trying to figure outnwhat to say instead, try this.,Imagine you've run into your friendnwho broke their leg skiing.,They took a risk to do something fun,nand it didn't end well.,But you're probablynnot going to be the jerk who says,,"Well, I guess you shouldn'tnhave gone skiing then.",If we think more about consent,,we can see that victimsnof privacy violations,deserve our compassion,,not criminalization, shaming,nharassment or punishment.,We can support victims,nand we can prevent some privacy violations,by making these legal,nindividual and technological changes.,Because the problem is not sexting,nthe issue is digital privacy.,And one solution is consent. 
 So the next time a victimnof a privacy violation comes up to you,,instead of blaming them,nlet's do this instead:,let's shift our ideasnabout digital privacy,,and let's respond with compassion. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There's a man out there, somewhere,,who looks a little bitnlike the actor Idris Elba,,or at least he did 20 years ago.,I don't know anything else about him,,except that he once saved my life,by putting his own life in danger.,This man ran across four lanes of freewayntraffic in the middle of the night,to bring me back to safety,after a car accidentnthat could have killed me.,And the whole thingnleft me really shaken up, obviously,,but it also left me with thisnkind of burning, gnawing need,to understand why he did it,,what forces within himncaused him to make the choice,that I owe my life to,,to risk his own lifento save the life of a stranger?,In other words, what are the causes of hisnor anybody else's capacity for altruism? 
 But first let me tell you what happened.,That night, I was 19 years old,and driving back to my homenin Tacoma, Washington,,down the Interstate 5 freeway,,when a little dogndarted out in front of my car.,And I did exactlynwhat you're not supposed to do,,which is swerve to avoid it.,And I discovered whynyou're not supposed to do that.,I hit the dog anyways,,and that sent the car into a fishtail,,and then a spin across the freeway,,until finally it wound upnin the fast lane of the freeway,faced backwards into oncoming traffic,and then the engine died.,And I was sure in that momentnthat I was about to die too,,but I didn't,because of the actionsnof that one brave man,who must have made the decision,within a fraction of a secondnof seeing my stranded car,to pull over and runnacross four lanes of freeway traffic,in the dark,to save my life.,And then after he got my car working again,and got me back to safetynand made sure I was going to be all right,,he drove off again.,He never even told me his name,,and I'm pretty surenI forgot to say thank you. 
 So before I go any further,,I really want to take a moment,to stop and say thank younto that stranger. 
 (Applause) 
 I tell you all of this,because the events of that night changednthe course of my life to some degree.,I became a psychology researcher,,and I've devoted my work to understandingnthe human capacity to care for others.,Where does it come from,nand how does it develop,,and what are the extreme formsnthat it can take?,These questions are really importantnto understanding basic aspects,of human social nature.,A lot of people,nand this includes everybody,from philosophersnand economists to ordinary people,believe that human naturenis fundamentally selfish,,that we're only ever really motivatednby our own welfare.,But if that's true, why do some people,nlike the stranger who rescued me,,do selfless things,nlike helping other people,at enormous risk and cost to themselves?,Answering this question,requires exploring the rootsnof extraordinary acts of altruism,,and what might make peoplenwho engage in such acts,different than other people.,But until recently, very little worknon this topic had been done. 
 The actions of the man who rescued me,meet the most stringentndefinition of altruism,,which is a voluntary, costly behavior,motivated by the desirento help another individual.,So it's a selfless actnintended to benefit only the other.,What could possiblynexplain an action like that?,One answer is compassion, obviously,,which is a key driver of altruism.,But then the question becomes,,why do some peoplenseem to have more of it than others?,And the answer may be that the brainsnof highly altruistic people,are different in fundamental ways. 
 But to figure out how,,I actually started from the opposite end,,with psychopaths.,A common approach to understandingnbasic aspects of human nature,,like the desire to help other people,,is to study peoplenin whom that desire is missing,,and psychopaths are exactly such a group.,Psychopathy is a developmental disorder,with strongly genetic origins,,and it results in a personalitynthat's cold and uncaring,and a tendency to engage in antisocialnand sometimes very violent behavior.,Once my colleagues and Inat the National Institute of Mental Health,conducted some of the first evernbrain imaging research,of psychopathic adolescents,,and our findings, and the findingsnof other researchers now,,have shown that peoplenwho are psychopathic,pretty reliably exhibitnthree characteristics.,First, although they're not generallyninsensitive to other people's emotions,,they are insensitive to signsnthat other people are in distress.,And in particular,,they have difficulty recognizingnfearful facial expressions like this one.,And fearful expressions conveynurgent need and emotional distress,,and they usually elicitncompassion and a desire to help,in people who see them,,so it makes sense that peoplenwho tend to lack compassion,also tend to be insensitive to these cues. 
 The part of the brain,that's the most importantnfor recognizing fearful expressions,is called the amygdala.,There are very rare cases of peoplenwho lack amygdalas completely,,and they're profoundly impairednin recognizing fearful expressions.,And whereas healthy adults and children,usually show big spikesnin amygdala activity,when they look at fearful expressions,,psychopaths' amygdalasnare underreactive to these expressions.,Sometimes they don't react at all,,which may be why they haventrouble detecting these cues.,Finally, psychopaths' amygdalasnare smaller than average,by about 18 or 20 percent. 
 So all of these findingsnare reliable and robust,,and they're very interesting.,But remember that my main interest,is not understandingnwhy people don't care about others.,It's understanding why they do.,So the real question is,,could extraordinary altruism,,which is the opposite of psychopathy,in terms of compassionnand the desire to help other people,,emerge from a brain that is alsonthe opposite of psychopathy?,A sort of antipsychopathic brain,,better able to recognizenother people's fear,,an amygdala that's more reactivento this expression,and maybe larger than average as well? 
 As my research has now shown,,all three things are true.,And we discovered this,by testing a populationnof truly extraordinary altruists.,These are people who have givennone of their own kidneys,to a complete stranger.,So these are people who have volunteerednto undergo major surgery,so that one of their ownnhealthy kidneys can be removed,and transplanted into a very ill stranger,that they've never met and may never meet.,"Why would anybody do this?"nis a very common question.,And the answer may be,that the brains of thesenextraordinary altruists,have certain special characteristics.,They are better at recognizingnother people's fear.,They're literally better at detectingnwhen somebody else is in distress.,This may be in part because their amygdalanis more reactive to these expressions.,And remember, this is the same partnof the brain that we found,was underreactivenin people who are psychopathic.,And finally, their amygdalasnare larger than average as well,,by about eight percent.,So together, what these data suggest,is the existence of somethingnlike a caring continuum in the world,that's anchored at the one endnby people who are highly psychopathic,,and at the other by peoplenwho are very compassionate,and driven to acts of extreme altruism. 
 But I should add that what makesnextraordinary altruists so different,is not just that they'renmore compassionate than average.,They are,,but what's even more unusual about them,is that they're compassionatenand altruistic,not just towards peoplenwho are in their own innermost circle,of friends and family. Right?,Because to have compassion for peoplenthat you love and identify with,is not extraordinary.,Truly extraordinary altruists' compassionnextends way beyond that circle,,even beyond their widerncircle of acquaintances,to people who are outsidentheir social circle altogether,,total strangers,,just like the man who rescued me. 
 And I've had the opportunity nownto ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors,how it is that they manage to generatensuch a wide circle of compassion,that they were willing to givena complete stranger their kidney.,And I found it's a really difficultnquestion for them to answer. 
 I say, "How is it thatnyou're willing to do this thing,when so many other people don't?,You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans,who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.,What is it that makes you so special?" 
 And what do they say? 
 They say, "Nothing.,There's nothing special about me.,I'm just the same as everybody else." 
 And I think that's actuallyna really telling answer,,because it suggests that the circlesnof these altruists don't look like this,,they look more like this.,They have no center.,These altruists literallyndon't think of themselves,as being at the center of anything,,as being better or more inherentlynimportant than anybody else.,When I asked one altruistnwhy donating her kidney made sense to her,,she said, "Because it's not about me.",Another said,,"I'm not different. I'm not unique.,Your study here is going to find outnthat I'm just the same as you." 
 I think the best descriptionnfor this amazing lack of self-centeredness,is humility,,which is that qualitynthat in the words of St. Augustine,makes men as angels.,And why is that?,It's because if there'snno center of your circle,,there can be no inner ringsnor outer rings,,nobody who is more or less worthynof your care and compassion,than anybody else.,And I think that this is what reallyndistinguishes extraordinary altruists,from the average person. 
 But I also think that this is a viewnof the world that's attainable by many,and maybe even most people.,And I think thisnbecause at the societal level,,expansions of altruism and compassionnare already happening everywhere.,The psychologist Steven Pinkernand others have shown,that all around the world peoplenare becoming less and less accepting,of suffering in ever-wideningncircles of others,,which has led to declinesnof all kinds of cruelty and violence,,from animal abuse to domestic violencento capital punishment.,And it's led to increasesnin all kinds of altruism.,A hundred years ago, peoplenwould have thought it was ludicrous,how normal and ordinary it is,for people to donatentheir blood and bone marrow,to complete strangers today.,Is it possible thatna hundred years from now,people will thinknthat donating a kidney to a stranger,is just as normal and ordinary,as we think donating bloodnand bone marrow is today?,Maybe. 
 So what's at the rootnof all these amazing changes?,In part it seems to be,increases in wealthnand standards of living.,As societies becomenwealthier and better off,,people seem to turnntheir focus of attention outward,,and as a result, all kinds of altruismntowards strangers increases,,from volunteering to charitable donationsnand even altruistic kidney donations.,But all of these changes also yield,a strange and paradoxical result,,which is that even as the world isnbecoming a better and more humane place,,which it is,,there's a very common perceptionnthat it's becoming worse,and more cruel, which it's not.,And I don't know exactly why this is,,but I think it may benthat we now just know so much more,about the sufferingnof strangers in distant places,,and so we now care a lot more,about the sufferingnof those distant strangers.,But what's clear is the kindsnof changes we're seeing show,that the roots of altruism and compassion,are just as much a part of human naturenas cruelty and violence,,maybe even more so,,and while some people do seemnto be inherently more sensitive,to the suffering of distant others,,I really believe that the abilitynto remove oneself,from the center of the circle,and expand the circle of compassionnoutward to include even strangers,is within reach for almost everyone. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hello, everybody.,I brought with me today a baby diaper.,You'll see why in a second.,Baby diapers have interesting properties.,They can swell enormouslynwhen you add water to them,,an experiment donenby millions of kids every day. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the reason why,is that they're designednin a very clever way.,They're made out of a thingncalled a swellable material.,It's a special kind of material that,nwhen you add water,,it will swell up enormously,,maybe a thousand times in volume.,And this is a very useful,nindustrial kind of polymer.,But what we're trying to donin my group at MIT,is to figure out if we can donsomething similar to the brain.,Can we make it bigger,,big enough that youncan peer inside,and see all the tiny building blocks,nthe biomolecules,,how they're organized in three dimensions,,the structure, the ground truthnstructure of the brain, if you will?,If we could get that,,maybe we could have a better understandingnof how the brain is organized,to yield thoughts and emotions,and actions and sensations.,Maybe we could try to pinpointnthe exact changes in the brain,that result in diseases,,diseases like Alzheimer'snand epilepsy and Parkinson's,,for which there are fewntreatments, much less cures,,and for which, very often,nwe don't know the cause or the origins,and what's really causing them to occur.,Now, our group at MIT,is trying to takena different point of view,from the way neuroscience hasnbeen done over the last hundred years.,We're designers. We're inventors.,We're trying to figure outnhow to build technologies,that let us look at and repair the brain.,And the reason is,,the brain is incredibly,nincredibly complicated. 
 So what we've learnednover the first century of neuroscience,is that the brain is a veryncomplicated network,,made out of very specializedncells called neurons,with very complex geometries,,and electrical currents will flownthrough these complexly shaped neurons.,Furthermore, neuronsnare connected in networks.,They're connected by little junctionsncalled synapses that exchange chemicals,and allow the neuronsnto talk to each other.,The density of the brain is incredible.,In a cubic millimeter of your brain,,there are about 100,000 of these neurons,and maybe a billion of those connections.,But it's worse.,So, if you could zoom in to a neuron,,and, of course, this is justnour artist's rendition of it.,What you would see are thousandsnand thousands of kinds of biomolecules,,little nanoscale machinesnorganized in complex, 3D patterns,,and together they mediatenthose electrical pulses,,those chemical exchangesnthat allow neurons to work together,to generate things like thoughtsnand feelings and so forth. 
 Now, we don't know hownthe neurons in the brain are organized,to form networks,,and we don't know hownthe biomolecules are organized,within neurons,to form these complex, organized machines.,If we really want to understand this,,we're going to need new technologies.,But if we could get such maps,,if we could look at the organizationnof molecules and neurons,and neurons and networks,,maybe we could really understandnhow the brain conducts information,from sensory regions,,mixes it with emotion and feeling,,and generates our decisions and actions.,Maybe we could pinpoint the exact setnof molecular changes that occur,in a brain disorder.,And once we know hownthose molecules have changed,,whether they've increased in numbernor changed in pattern,,we could use thosenas targets for new drugs,,for new ways of deliveringnenergy into the brain,in order to repair the brainncomputations that are afflicted,in patients who suffernfrom brain disorders. 
 We've all seen lots of differentntechnologies over the last century,to try to confront this.,I think we've all seen brain scans,taken using MRI machines.,These, of course, have the great powernthat they are noninvasive,,they can be used on living human subjects.,But also, they're spatially crude.,Each of these blobs that you see,nor voxels, as they're called,,can contain millionsnand millions of neurons.,So it's not at the level of resolution,where it can pinpointnthe molecular changes that occur,or the changes in the wiringnof these networks,that contributes to our abilitynto be conscious and powerful beings. 
 At the other extreme,nyou have microscopes.,Microscopes, of course, will use lightnto look at little tiny things.,For centuries, they've been usednto look at things like bacteria.,For neuroscience,,microscopes are actually how neuronsnwere discovered in the first place,,about 130 years ago.,But light is fundamentally limited.,You can't see individual moleculesnwith a regular old microscope.,You can't look at these tiny connections.,So if we want to make our abilitynto see the brain more powerful,,to get down to the ground truth structure,,we're going to need to haveneven better technologies. 
 My group, a couple years ago,nstarted thinking:,Why don't we do the opposite?,If it's so darn complicatednto zoom in to the brain,,why can't we make the brain bigger?,It initially started,with two grad students in my group,nFei Chen and Paul Tillberg.,Now many others in my groupnare helping with this process.,We decided to try to figure outnif we could take polymers,,like the stuff in the baby diaper,,and install it physicallynwithin the brain.,If we could do it just right,nand you add water,,you can potentially blow the brain up,to where you could distinguishnthose tiny biomolecules from each other.,You would see those connectionsnand get maps of the brain.,This could potentially be quite dramatic. 
 We brought a little demo here.,We got some purified baby diaper material.,It's much easiernjust to buy it off the Internet,than to extract the few grainsnthat actually occur in these diapers.,I'm going to put just one teaspoon here,of this purified polymer.,And here we have some water.,What we're going to do,is see if this teaspoonnof the baby diaper material,can increase in size.,You're going to see it increase in volumenby about a thousandfold,before your very eyes.,I could pour much more of this in there,,but I think you've got the idea,that this is a very,nvery interesting molecule,,and if can use it in the right way,,we might be ablento really zoom in on the brain,in a way that you can't donwith past technologies. 
 OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.,What's going onnin the baby diaper polymer?,If you could zoom in,,it might look something likenwhat you see on the screen.,Polymers are chains of atomsnarranged in long, thin lines.,The chains are very tiny,,about the width of a biomolecule,,and these polymers are really dense.,They're separated by distances,that are around the size of a biomolecule.,This is very good,because we could potentiallynmove everything apart in the brain.,If we add water, what will happen is,,this swellable materialnis going to absorb the water,,the polymer chains will movenapart from each other,,and the entire materialnis going to become bigger.,And because these chains are so tiny,and spaced by biomolecular distances,,we could potentially blow up the brain,and make it big enough to see. 
 Here's the mystery, then:,How do we actually makenthese polymer chains inside the brain,so we can move all the biomolecules apart?,If we could do that,,maybe we could getnground truth maps of the brain.,We could look at the wiring.,We can peer insidenand see the molecules within.,To explain this, we made some animations,where we actually looknat, in these artist renderings,,what biomolecules might looknlike and how we might separate them.,Step one: what we'd havento do, first of all,,is attach every biomolecule,nshown in brown here,,to a little anchor, a little handle.,We need to pull the moleculesnof the brain apart from each other,,and to do that, we neednto have a little handle,that allows those polymers to bind to them,and to exert their force. 
 Now, if you just take baby diapernpolymer and dump it on the brain,,obviously, it's going to sit there on top.,So we need to find a waynto make the polymers inside.,And this is where we're really lucky.,It turns out, you cannget the building blocks,,monomers, as they're called,,and if you let them go into the brain,and then trigger the chemical reactions,,you can get them to formnthose long chains,,right there inside the brain tissue.,They're going to wind their waynaround biomolecules,and between biomolecules,,forming those complex webs,that will allow you, eventually,nto pull apart the molecules,from each other.,And every time onenof those little handles is around,,the polymer will bind to the handle,nand that's exactly what we need,in order to pull the moleculesnapart from each other. 
 All right, the moment of truth.,We have to treat this specimen,with a chemical to kind of loosen upnall the molecules from each other,,and then, when we add water,,that swellable material is goingnto start absorbing the water,,the polymer chains will move apart,,but now, the biomoleculesnwill come along for the ride.,And much like drawingna picture on a balloon,,and then you blow up the balloon,,the image is the same,,but the ink particles have movednaway from each other.,And that's what we've been ablento do now, but in three dimensions. 
 There's one last trick.,As you can see here,,we've color-codednall the biomolecules brown.,That's because they allnkind of look the same.,Biomolecules are madenout of the same atoms,,but just in different orders.,So we need one last thing,in order to make them visible.,We have to bring in little tags,,with glowing dyesnthat will distinguish them.,So one kind of biomoleculenmight get a blue color.,Another kind of biomoleculenmight get a red color.,And so forth.,And that's the final step.,Now we can look at something like a brain,and look at the individual molecules,,because we've moved themnfar apart enough from each other,that we can tell them apart. 
 So the hope here is thatnwe can make the invisible visible.,We can turn things that might seemnsmall and obscure,and blow them up,until they're like constellationsnof information about life.,Here's an actual videonof what it might look like.,We have here a little brain in a dish --,a little piece of a brain, actually.,We've infused the polymer in,,and now we're adding water.,What you'll see is that,nright before your eyes --,this video is sped up about sixtyfold --,this little piece of brain tissuenis going to grow.,It can increase by a hundredfoldnor even more in volume.,And the cool part is, becausenthose polymers are so tiny,,we're separating biomoleculesnevenly from each other.,It's a smooth expansion.,We're not losing the configurationnof the information.,We're just making it easier to see. 
 So now we can takenactual brain circuitry --,here's a piece of the brainninvolved with, for example, memory --,and we can zoom in.,We can start to actually look atnhow circuits are configured.,Maybe someday we could read out a memory.,Maybe we could actually looknat how circuits are configured,to process emotions,,how the actual wiringnof our brain is organized,in order to make us who we are.,And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,,the actual problems in the brainnat a molecular level.,What if we could actuallynlook into cells in the brain,and figure out, wow, here are the 17nmolecules that have altered,in this brain tissue that has beennundergoing epilepsy,or changing in Parkinson's disease,or otherwise being altered?,If we get that systematic listnof things that are going wrong,,those become our therapeutic targets.,We can build drugs that bind those.,We can maybe aim energynat different parts of the brain,in order to help peoplenwith Parkinson's or epilepsy,or other conditions that affectnover a billion people,around the world. 
 Now, something interestingnhas been happening.,It turns out that throughout biomedicine,,there are other problemsnthat expansion might help with.,This is an actual biopsynfrom a human breast cancer patient.,It turns out that if you look at cancers,,if you look at the immune system,,if you look at aging,nif you look at development --,all these processes are involvingnlarge-scale biological systems.,But of course, the problems beginnwith those little nanoscale molecules,,the machines that make the cellsnand the organs in our body tick.,So what we're tryingnto do now is to figure out,if we can actually use this technologynto map the building blocks of life,in a wide variety of diseases.,Can we actually pinpointnthe molecular changes in a tumor,so that we can actuallyngo after it in a smart way,and deliver drugs that might wipe outnexactly the cells that we want to? 
 You know, a lot of medicinenis very high risk.,Sometimes, it's even guesswork.,My hope is we can actually turnnwhat might be a high-risk moon shot,into something that's more reliable.,If you think about the original moon shot,,where they actually landed on the moon,,it was based on solid science.,We understood gravity;,we understood aerodynamics.,We knew how to build rockets.,The science risk was under control.,It was still a great, greatnfeat of engineering.,But in medicine, we don'tnnecessarily have all the laws.,Do we have all the lawsnthat are analogous to gravity,,that are analogous to aerodynamics?,I would argue that with technologies,like the kinds I'm talking about today,,maybe we can actually derive those.,We can map the patternsnthat occur in living systems,,and figure out how to overcomenthe diseases that plague us. 
 You know, my wife and Inhave two young kids,,and one of my hopes as a bioengineernis to make life better for them,than it currently is for us.,And my hope is, if we cannturn biology and medicine,from these high-risk endeavorsnthat are governed by chance and luck,,and make them thingsnthat we win by skill and hard work,,then that would be a great advance. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So when I decided to createnan art piece in Manshiyat Naser,,the neighborhood of the Cairongarbage collectors in Egypt,,I never thought this project would be,the most amazing human experiencenthat I would ever live.,As an artist, I hadnthis humanist intention,of beautifying a poornand neglected neighborhood,by bringing art to it and hopefullynshining light on this isolated community. 
 The first time I heard aboutnthis Christian Coptic community,was in 2009 when the Egyptian authoritiesnunder the regime of Hosni Mubarak,decided to slaughter 300,000 pigsnusing the pretext of H1N1 virus.,Originally, they are pig breeders.,Their pigs and other animalsnare fed with the organic waste,that they collect on a daily basis.,This event killed their livelihood.,The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser,nit felt like a maze.,I was looking for the St. Simon Monasterynon the top of the Muqattam Mountain.,So you go right, then straight,nthen right again, then left,to reach all the way to the top.,But to reach there, you must dodge betweennthe trucks overpacked with garbage,and slalom between the tuk-tuks,,the fastest vehicle to move aroundnin the neighborhood.,The smell of the garbagenunloaded from those trucks was intense,,and the noise of the trafficnwas loud and overbearing.,Add to it the din created by the crushersnin those warehouses along the way.,From outside it looks chaotic,nbut everything is perfectly organized. 
 The Zaraeeb, that’s hownthey call themselves,,which means the pig breeders,,have been collecting the garbage of Cairo,and sorting it in their ownnneighborhood for decades.,They have developednone of the most efficient,and highly profitable systemsnon a global level.,Still, the place is perceivednas dirty, marginalized and segregated,because of their associationnwith the trash.,So my initial ideanwas to create an anamorphic piece,,a piece that you can only seenfrom one vantage point.,I wanted to challenge myself artisticallynby painting over several buildings,and having it only fully visiblenfrom one point on the Muqattam Mountain.,The Muqattam Mountainnis the pride of the community.,This is where they builtnthe St. Simon Monastery,,a 10,000-seat cave churchnthat they carved into the mountain itself. 
 So, the first timenI stood on top of the mountain,and I looked at the neighborhood,,I asked myself, how on earthnwill I convince all those owners,to let me paint on their buildings?,And then Magd came.,Magd is a guide from the Church.,He told me the only person I needednto convince was Father Samaan,,who is the leader of the community.,But to convince Father Samaan,nI needed to convince Mario,,who is a Polish artistnwho moved to Cairo 20 years ago,and who created all the artworknof the Cave Church.,I am really grateful to Mario.nHe was the key of the project.,He managed to get mena meeting with Father Samaan,,and surprisingly, he loved the idea.,He asked me about where I painted before,and how I will make it happen.,And he was mainly concernednby what I was going to write. 
 In every work that I create,nI write messages,with my style of Arabic calligraphy.,I make sure those messages are relevantnto the place where I am painting,but have this universal dimension,,so anybody around the worldncan relate to it. 
 So for Manshiyat Naser,,I decided to write in Arabicnthe words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,,a Coptic bishop from the third century,,who said: (Arabic),,which means in English,,"Anyone who wantsnto see the sunlight clearly,needs to wipe his eyes first." 
 It was really important for me,that the communitynfelt connected to the words.,And for me this quote was perfectlynreflecting the spirit of the project. 
 So Father Samaan blessed the project,,and his approval broughtnall the residents on board.,Hundreds of liters of paint,na dozen blue manual lifts,,several trips back and forth to Cairo,,a strong and solid team from France,nNorth Africa, Middle East and the US,,and after a year of planningnand logistics, there we are,,my team and some membersnfrom the local community,creating a piece that willnspread over 50 buildings,,some filling up the spacenof the calligraphy,that I trace with colors.,Here some blue, there some yellow,nthere some orange.,Some others carrying some sand bags,and putting themnon the top of the buildings,to hold those manual lifts,,and some others assemblingnand disassembling those same lifts,and moving them aroundnthe different buildings. 
 At the beginning of the project,,I numbered all thosenbuildings on my sketch,,and there was no real interactionnwith the community.,People didn’t get the point of all this.,But fast enough, those building numbersnbecame family names. 
 The first buildingnwas the house of Uncle Ibrahim.,Uncle Ibrahim is suchnan enthusiastic person.,He was always singing and making jokes,,and his daughters and sonsnsaved me from his bull,who wanted to attack menon the fourth floor. 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, the bull saw me from the windownand came out on the balcony. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. 
 Uncle Ibrahim was alwaysnhanging out on the balcony,and talking to me while I was painting.,I remember him saying that he didn’tngo to the mountain for 10 years,,and that he never takes a day off.,He said that if he stopped working,nwho will stop the garbage?,But surprisingly,nat the end of the project,,he came all the way to the mountainnto look at the piece.,He was really proudnto see his house painted,,and he said that this projectnwas a project of peace and --,sorry -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 He said that it was a projectnof peace and unity,and that it brought people together. 
 So his perceptionntowards the project changed,,and my perception towardsnthe community changed also,,and towards what they do.,All the garbage that everybodynis disgusted by is not theirs.,They just work out of it.,Actually, they don’t live in the garbage.nThey live from the garbage.,So I started doubting myself and wondering,what was the real purposenof this whole project?,It was not about beautifyingna place by bringing art to it.,It was about switching perceptionnand opening a dialogue,on the connection that we havenwith communities that we don’t know.,So day after day,,the calligraphy circle was taking shape,,and we were always excited to go backnon the mountain to look at the piece.,And standing exactly at this pointnevery day made my realize,the symbolism behindnthis anamorphic piece.,If you want to seenthe real image of somebody,,maybe you should change your angle. 
 There was doubts and difficulties,,like fears and stress.,It wasn't simplento work in such environments,,sometimes having pigs under younwhile you paint,or climbing a stack of garbagento reach a lift.,But we all got over the fearnof the heights, the swinging lifts,,the strength of the smell,and also the stressnof not finishing on time. 
 But the kindness of all those peoplenmade us forget everything.,The building number 3 was the housenof Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.,In Egyptian, they haventhis expression that says, "Ahsen Nas,",which means "the best people.",They were the best people.,We used to take our breaknin front of their houses,,and all the kids of the neighborhood,used to join us.,I was impressed and amazednby the kids of Manshiyat Naser.,For the first few days, they were alwaysnrefusing anything we were offering them,,even a snack or a drink.,So I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?",And she told me they teachntheir kids to refuse anything,from somebody that they don't know,because maybe this personnneeds it more than they do. 
 So at this exact point I realized actually,the Zaraeeb communitynwas the ideal context,to raise the topic of perception.,We need to questionnour level of misconception,and judgment we can have as a society,upon communitiesnbased on their differences.,I remember how we got delayednon Uncle Ibrahim's house,when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop,were eating the sand bagsnthat hold the lifts. 
 (Laughter) 
 The house of Uncle Bakheetnand Aunty Fareeda,was this kind of meeting point.,Everybody used to gather there.,I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant,when he said that wasna project of peace and unity,,because I really feltnthat people were coming together.,Everyone was greeting usnwith a smile, offering us a drink,or inviting us into theirnown house for lunch.,Sometime, you arenat the first level of a building,,and somebody opens his windownand offers you some tea.,And then the same thing happensnon the second floor.,And you keep going all the way to the top. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I think I never drink as much teanas I did in Egypt. 
 (Laughter) 
 And to be honest with you,nwe could have finished earlier,,but I think it took us three weeksnbecause of all those tea breaks. 
 (Laughter) 
 In Egypt, they have another expression,nwhich is "Nawartouna,",which means, "You brought light to us.",In Manshiyat Nasernthey were always telling us this.,The calligraphy, actually --,I used a white glow-in-the-dark paintnfor the calligraphy,so at the end of the project,nwe rented some black light projectors,and lit up the whole neighborhood,,surprising everybody around.,We wanted to tell them,that they are the onesnwho brought light to us. 
 (Applause) 
 The Zaraeeb communitynare strong, honest, hard workers,,and they know their value.,The people of Caironcall them "the Zabaleen,",which means "the people of the garbage,",but ironically,nthe people of Manshiyat Naser,call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.,They say, they are the onesnwho produce the garbage, not them. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The goal was to leave somethingnto this community,,but I feel that they are the onesnwho left something in our lives.,You know, the art projectnwas just a pretext,for this amazing human experience.,The art piece at some pointnwill disappear, vanish,,and actually there is somebodynwho is building a second floor,in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,,so it's covering part of the painting,,so I might need to go backnand paint over it. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was about the experience,,about the story,,about the moment. 
 From the streets of the neighborhood,,the painting appears in fragments,,isolated from one another,,standing alone.,But connected with the sign of calligraphy,that today reveals the powerful messagenthat we should all think about,before we want to judge somebody. 
 Anyone who wants to seenthe sunlight clearly,needs to wipe his eyes first. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We are stealing nature from our children.,Now, when I say this, I don't meannthat we are destroying nature,that they will have wanted us to preserve,,although that isnunfortunately also the case.,What I mean here is that we've startednto define nature in a way,that's so purist and so strict,that under the definitionnwe're creating for ourselves,,there won't be any naturenleft for our children,when they're adults.,But there's a fix for this.,So let me explain. 
 Right now, humans use half of the world,to live, to grow their cropsnand their timber,,to pasture their animals.,If you added up all the human beings,,we would weigh 10 times as muchnas all the wild mammals put together.,We cut roads through the forest.,We have added little plastic particlesnto the sand on ocean beaches.,We've changed the chemistry of the soilnwith our artificial fertilizers.,And of course, we've changednthe chemistry of the air.,So when you take your next breath,,you'll be breathing inn42 percent more carbon dioxide,than if you were breathing in 1750.,So all of these changes, and many others,,have come to be kind of lumped togethernunder this rubric of the "Anthropocene.",And this is a termnthat some geologists are suggesting,we should give to our current epoch,,given how pervasivenhuman influence has been over it.,Now, it's still just a proposed epoch,nbut I think it's a helpful way,to think about the magnitudenof human influence on the planet. 
 So where does this put nature?,What counts as nature in a worldnwhere everything is influenced by humans? 
 So 25 years ago, environmental writernBill McKibben said,that because naturenwas a thing apart from man,and because climate change meant,that every centimeter of the Earthnwas altered by man,,then nature was over.,In fact, he called his bookn"The End of Nature." 
 I disagree with this.nI just disagree with this.,I disagree with this definition of nature,nbecause, fundamentally, we are animals.,Right? Like, we evolved on this planet,in the context of all the other animalsnwith which we share a planet,,and all the other plants,nand all the other microbes.,And so I think that nature,is not that which is untouchednby humanity, man or woman.,I think that naturenis anywhere where life thrives,,anywhere where there arenmultiple species together,,anywhere that's green and bluenand thriving and filled with life,and growing.,And under that definition,,things look a little bit different. 
 Now, I understand that therenare certain parts of this nature,that speak to us in a special way.,Places like Yellowstone,,or the Mongolian steppe,,or the Great Barrier Reef,or the Serengeti.,Places that we think ofnas kind of Edenic representations,of a nature beforenwe screwed everything up.,And in a way, they are less impactednby our day to day activities.,Many of these placesnhave no roads or few roads,,so on, like such.,But ultimately, even these Edensnare deeply influenced by humans. 
 Now, let's just takenNorth America, for example,,since that's where we're meeting.,So between about 15,000 years agonwhen people first came here,,they started a processnof interacting with the nature,that led to the extinctionnof a big slew of large-bodied animals,,from the mastodonnto the giant ground sloth,,saber-toothed cats,,all of these cool animalsnthat unfortunately are no longer with us.,And when those animals went extinct,,you know, the ecosystemsndidn't stand still.,Massive ripple effectsnchanged grasslands into forests,,changed the composition of forestnfrom one tree to another.,So even in these Edens,,even in these perfect-looking places,that seem to remind usnof a past before humans,,we're essentially lookingnat a humanized landscape.,Not just these prehistoric humans,nbut historical humans, indigenous people,all the way up until the momentnwhen the first colonizers showed up.,And the case is the samenfor the other continents as well.,Humans have just been involved in nature,in a very influential waynfor a very long time. 
 Now, just recently, someone told me, 
 "Oh, but there are still wild places." 
 And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go." 
 And he said, "The Amazon." 
 And I was like, "Oh, the Amazon.nI was just there.,It's awesome. National Geographicnsent me to Manú National Park,,which is in the Peruvian Amazon,,but it's a big chunk of rainforest,nuncleared, no roads,,protected as a national park,,one of the most, in fact,nbiodiverse parks in the world.,And when I got in there with my canoe,nwhat did I find, but people.,People have been living therenfor hundreds and thousands of years.,People live there, and they don'tnjust float over the jungle.,They have a meaningful relationshipnwith the landscape.,They hunt. They grow crops.,They domesticate crops.,They use the natural resourcesnto build their houses,,to thatch their houses.,They even make pets out of animalsnthat we consider to be wild animals.,These people are there,and they're interactingnwith the environment,in a way that's really meaningfulnand that you can see in the environment. 
 Now, I was withnan anthropologist on this trip,,and he told me, as we werenfloating down the river,,he said, "There arenno demographic voids in the Amazon.",This statement has really stuck with me,,because what it meansnis that the whole Amazon is like this.,There's people everywhere.,And many otherntropical forests are the same,,and not just tropical forests.,People have influencednecosystems in the past,,and they continuento influence them in the present,,even in places wherenthey're harder to notice. 
 So, if all of the definitions of naturenthat we might want to use,that involve it beingnuntouched by humanity,or not having people in it,,if all of those actually give usna result where we don't have any nature,,then maybe they're the wrong definitions.,Maybe we should define itnby the presence of multiple species,,by the presence of a thriving life. 
 Now, if we do it that way,,what do we get?,Well, it's this kind of miracle.,All of a sudden,nthere's nature all around us.,All of a sudden,nwe see this Monarch caterpillar,munching on this plant,,and we realize that there it is,,and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.,And look at this empty lot.,I mean, there's, like, probably,,a dozen, minimum,nplant species growing there,,supporting all kinds of insect life,,and this is a completely unmanaged space,na completely wild space.,This is a kind of wild naturenright under our nose,,that we don't even notice. 
 And there's an interestingnlittle paradox, too.,So this nature,,this kind of wild, untended part,of our urban, peri-urban,nsuburban agricultural existence,that flies under the radar,,it's arguably more wildnthan a national park,,because national parksnare very carefully managed,in the 21st century.,Crater Lake in southern Oregon,nwhich is my closest national park,,is a beautiful example of a landscapenthat seems to be coming out of the past.,But they're managing it carefully.,One of the issues they have nownis white bark pine die-off.,White bark pinenis a beautiful, charismatic --,I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora,that grows up at high altitude --,and it's got all these problemsnright now with disease.,There's a blister rustnthat was introduced,,bark beetle.,So to deal with this,nthe park service has been planting,rust-resistant white barknpine seedlings in the park,,even in areas that they arenotherwise managing as wilderness.,And they're also putting outnbeetle repellent in key areas,as I saw last time I went hiking there.,And this kind of thing is reallynmuch more common than you would think.,National parks are heavily managed.,The wildlife is kept to a certainnpopulation size and structure.,Fires are suppressed.,Fires are started.,Non-native species are removed.,Native species are reintroduced.,And in fact, I took a look,,and Banff National Parknis doing all of the things I just listed:,suppressing fire, having fire,,radio-collaring wolves,nreintroducing bison.,It takes a lot of work to makenthese places look untouched. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And in a further irony,nthese places that we love the most,are the places that we lovena little too hard, sometimes.,A lot of us like to go there,,and because we're managingnthem to be stable,in the face of a changing planet,,they often are becomingnmore fragile over time. 
 Which means that they'renthe absolute worst places,to take your children on vacation,,because you can't do anything there.,You can't climb the trees.,You can't fish the fish.,You can't make a campfirenout in the middle of nowhere.,You can't take home the pinecones.,There are so many rules and restrictions,that from a child's point of view,,this is, like, the worst nature ever.,Because children don't want to hike,through a beautiful landscapenfor five hours,and then look at a beautiful view.,That's maybe what we want to do as adults,,but what kids want to donis hunker down in one spot,and just tinker with it,njust work with it,,just pick it up, build a house,nbuild a fort, do something like that. 
 Additionally, these sort of Edenic places,are often distant from where people live.,And they're expensive to get to.nThey're hard to visit.,So this means that they'renonly available to the elites,,and that's a real problem.,The Nature Conservancyndid a survey of young people,,and they asked them, how oftenndo you spend time outdoors?,And only two out of fivenspent time outdoors,at least once a week.,The other three out of fivenwere just staying inside.,And when they asked them why,nwhat are the barriers to going outside,,the response of 61 percent was,,"There are no natural areas near my home." 
 And this is crazy.nThis is just patently false.,I mean, 71 percent of people in the US,live within a 10-minute walknof a city park.,And I'm sure the figuresnare similar in other countries.,And that doesn't even countnyour back garden,,the urban creek, the empty lot.,Everybody lives near nature.,Every kid lives near nature.,We've just somehownforgotten how to see it.,We've spent too much timenwatching David Attenborough documentaries,where the nature is really sexy -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and we've forgotten how to see the naturenthat is literally right outside our door,,the nature of the street tree. 
 So here's an example: Philadelphia.,There's this cool elevated railway,that you can see from the ground,nthat's been abandoned.,Now, this may sound like the beginningnof the High Line story in Manhattan,,and it's very similar, except they haven'tndeveloped this into a park yet,,although they're working on it.,So for now, it's still this littlensort of secret wilderness,in the heart of Philadelphia,,and if you know where the hole isnin the chain-link fence,,you can scramble up to the top,and you can find thisncompletely wild meadow,just floating aboventhe city of Philadelphia.,Every single one of these plantsngrew from a seed,that planted itself there.,This is completely autonomous,nself-willed nature.,And it's right in the middle of the city.,And they've sent people up therento do sort of biosurveys,,and there are over 50nplant species up there.,And it's not just plants.,This is an ecosystem,na functioning ecosystem.,It's creating soil.nIt's sequestering carbon.,There's pollination going on.,I mean, this is really an ecosystem. 
 So scientists have started callingnecosystems like these "novel ecosystems,",because they're oftenndominated by non-native species,,and because they're just super weird.,They're just unlike anythingnwe've ever seen before.,For so long, we dismissednall these novel ecosystems as trash.,We're talking aboutnregrown agricultural fields,,timber plantations that are notnbeing managed on a day-to-day basis,,second-growth forests generally,nthe entire East Coast,,where after agriculture moved west,nthe forest sprung up.,And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,,where novel ecosystems are the norm,,where exotic species totally dominate.,This forest here has Queensland maple,,it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.,You can make your ownnnovel ecosystem, too.,It's really simple.,You just stop mowing your lawn. 
 (Laughter) 
 Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland,nand he did this experiment himself.,He just stopped mowing his lawn,,and after a few years,nhe had some grad students come,,and they did sort ofna bio-blitz of his backyard,,and they found 375 plant species,,including two endangered species. 
 So when you're up therenon that future High Line of Philadelphia,,surrounded by this wildness,,surrounded by this diversity,nthis abundance, this vibrance,,you can look over the side,and you can see a local playgroundnfor a local school,,and that's what it looks like.,These children have, that --,You know, under my definition,,there's a lot of the planetnthat counts as nature,,but this would be one of the few placesnthat wouldn't count as nature.,There's nothing there except humans,nno other plants, no other animals.,And what I really wanted to do,was just, like,nthrow a ladder over the side,and get all these kids to come up with meninto this cool meadow.,In a way, I feel like this isnthe choice that faces us.,If we dismiss these new naturesnas not acceptable or trashy or no good,,we might as well just pave them over.,And in a world whereneverything is changing,,we need to be very carefulnabout how we define nature. 
 In order not to steal itnfrom our children,,we have to do two things.,First, we cannot define naturenas that which is untouched.,This never made any sense anyway.,Nature has not been untouchednfor thousands of years.,And it excludes most of the naturenthat most people can visit,and have a relationship with,,including only naturenthat children cannot touch.,Which brings me to the second thingnthat we have to do,,which is that we have tonlet children touch nature,,because that whichnis untouched is unloved. 
 (Applause) 
 We face some pretty grimnenvironmental challenges on this planet.,Climate change is among them.,There's others too:nhabitat loss is my favorite thing,to freak out aboutnin the middle of the night.,But in order to solve them,,we need people --nsmart, dedicated people --,who care about nature.,And the only way we're going to raise upna generation of people,who care about nature,is by letting them touch nature. 
 I have a Fort Theory of Ecology,,Fort Theory of Conservation.,Every ecologist I know,nevery conservation biologist I know,,every conservation professional I know,,built forts when they were kids.,If we have a generationnthat doesn't know how to build a fort,,we'll have a generation that doesn'tnknow how to care about nature. 
 And I don't wantnto be the one to tell this kid,,who is on a special program,that takes Philadelphia kidsnfrom poor neighborhoods,and takes them to city parks,,I don't want to be the one to tell himnthat the flower he's holding,is a non-native invasive weednthat he should throw away as trash.,I think I would much rathernlearn from this boy,that no matternwhere this plant comes from,,it is beautiful, and it deservesnto be touched and appreciated. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What do you do if you hadnto figure out the information,behind 11.5 million documents,,verify it and make sense of it?,That was a challenge,that a group of journalistsnhad to face late last year.,An anonymous personncalling himself John Doe,had somehow managed to copynnearly 40 years of records,of the Panamanian law firmnMossack Fonseca.,This is one of many firms around the world,that specialize in setting up accountsnin offshore tax havens,like the British Virgin Islands,,for rich and powerful peoplenwho like to keep secrets. 
 John Doe had managed to copynevery spreadsheet from this firm,,every client file,,every email,,from 1977 to the present day.,It represented the biggest cache,of inside informationninto the tax haven system,that anyone had ever seen.,But it also presented a gigantic challengento investigative journalism.,Think about it:n11.5 million documents,,containing the secrets of peoplenfrom more than 200 different countries.,Where do you startnwith such a vast resource?,Where do you even begin to tell a story,that can trail offninto every corner of the globe,,and that can affect almostnany person in any language,,sometimes in waysnthey don't even know yet. 
 John Doe had given the informationnto two journalists,at the German newspapernSüddeutsche Zeitung.,He said he was motivatednby -- and I quote --,"The scale of the injusticenthat the documents would reveal.",But one user alone can never make sense,of such a vast amount of information.,So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out,to my organization in Washington, DC,,The International Consortiumnof Investigative Journalists.,We decided to do somethingnthat was the very opposite,of everything we'd been taughtnto do as journalists:,share. 
 (Laughter) 
 By nature, investigativenreporters are lone wolves.,We fiercely guard our secrets,,at times even from our editors,,because we know that the momentnwe tell them what we have,,they'll want that story right away.,And to be frank,,when you get a good story,,you like to keep the glory to yourself. 
 But there's no doubtnthat we live in a shrinking world,,and that the media has largelynbeen slow to wake up to this.,The issues we report onnare more and more transnational.,Giant corporations operatenon a global level.,Environmental and healthncrises are global.,So, too, are financial flowsnand financial crises.,So it seems staggeringnthat journalism has been so late,to cover stories in a truly global way.,And it also seems staggeringnthat journalism has been so slow,to wake up to the possibilitiesnthat technology brings,,rather than being frightened of it.,The reason journalistsnare scared of technology is this:,the profession's largest institutionsnare going through tough times,because of the changing waynthat people are consuming news.,The advertising business modelsnthat have sustained reporting are broken.,And this has plungednjournalism into crisis,,forcing those institutionsnto reexamine how they function. 
 But where there is crisis,,there is also opportunity.,The first challenge presented,by what would eventually becomenknown as the Panama Papers,was to make the documentsnsearchable and readable.,There were nearly five million emails,,two million PDFs that needednto be scanned and indexed,,and millions more filesnand other kinds of documents.,They all needed to be housednin a safe and secure location,in the cloud.,We next invited reportersnto have a look at the documents.,In all, reporters from morenthan 100 media organizations,in 76 countries --,from the BBC in Britain,to Le Monde newspaper in France,to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.,"Native eyes on native names,"nwe called it, the idea being,,who best to tell younwho was important to Nigeria,than a Nigerian journalist?,Who best in Canada than a Canadian?,There were only two rulesnfor everyone who was invited:,we all agreed to share everythingnthat we found with everybody else,,and we all agreed to publishntogether on the same day. 
 We chose our media partners based on trust,that had been built up throughnprevious smaller collaborations,and also from leadsnthat jumped out from the documents.,Over the next few months,,my small nonprofit organizationnof less than 20 people,was joined by more than 350 othernreporters from 25 language groups.,The biggest information leak in history,had now spawned the biggestnjournalism collaboration in history:,376 sets of native eyes doingnwhat journalists normally never do,,working shoulder to shoulder,,sharing information,,but telling no one.,For it became clear at this point,that in order to makenthe biggest kind of noise,,we first needednthe biggest kind of silence. 
 To manage the projectnover the many months it would take,,we built a secure virtual newsroom.,We used encrypted communication systems,,and we built a speciallyndesigned search engine.,Inside the virtual newsroom,,the reporters could gathernaround the themes,that were emerging from the documents.,Those interested in blood diamondsnor exotic art, for instance,,could share information about hownthe offshore world was being used,to hide the trade in bothnof those commodities.,Those interested in sportncould share information,about how famous sports starsnwere putting their image rights,into offshore companies,,thereby likely avoiding taxes,in the countriesnwhere they plied their trade. 
 But perhaps most exciting of all,were the number of world leadersnand elect politicians,that were emerging from the documents --,figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,,close associatesnof Vladimir Putin in Russia,and the British Prime Minister,nDavid Cameron, who is linked,through his late father, Ian Cameron. 
 Buried in the documentsnwere secret offshore entities,,such as Wintris Inc.,,a company in the British Virgin Islands,that had actually belongednto the sitting Icelandic prime minister.,I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,,the Icelandic reporternwe invited to join the project,,as the loneliest man in the world.,For nine months, he refused paid work,and lived off the earnings of his wife.,He pasted tarpsnover the windows of his home,to prevent prying eyesnduring the long Icelandic winter.,And he soon ran out of excusesnto explain his many absences,,as he worked red-eyed,,night after night,,month after month.,In all that time, he sat on information,that would eventually bring downnthe leader of his country. 
 Now, when you're an investigative reporternand you make an amazing discovery,,such as your prime minster can be linkednto a secret offshore company,,that that company has a financialninterest in Icelandic banks --,the very issue he's been elected on --,well, your instinctnis to scream out very loud.,Instead, as one of the few peoplenthat he could speak to,,Johannes and I sharedna kind of gallows humor.,"Wintris is coming," he used to say. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We were big fans of "Game of Thrones." 
 When reporters like Johannesnwanted to scream,,they did so inside the virtual newsroom,,and then they turnednthose screams into stories,by going outside the documentsnto court records,,official company registers,,and by eventually putting questionsnto those that we intended to name.,Panama Papers actually allowednthe reporters to look at the world,through a different lensnfrom everybody else. 
 As we were researching the story,,unconnected to us,,a major political bribery scandalnhappened in Brazil.,A new leader was elected in Argentina.,The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,,the organization that controlsnthe world of professional soccer.,The Panama Papersnactually had unique insights,into each one of these unfolding events.,So you can imagine the pressurenand the ego dramas,that could have ruinednwhat we were trying to do.,Any of one of these journalists,,they could have broken the pact.,But they didn't.,And on April 3 this year,,at exactly 8pm German time,,we published simultaneouslynin 76 countries. 
 (Applause) 
 The Panama Papers quickly becamenone of the biggest stories of the year.,This is the scene in Icelandnthe day after we published.,It was the first of many protests.,The Icelandic prime ministernhad to resign.,It was a first of many resignations.,We spotlighted many famous peoplensuch as Lionel Messi,,the most famousnsoccer player in the world.,And there were somenunintended consequences.,These alleged membersnof a Mexican drug cartel were arrested,after we published detailsnabout their hideout.,They'd been using the address,to register their offshore company. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's a kind of ironynin what we've been able to do.,The technology -- the Internet --nthat has broken the business model,is allowing us to reinventnjournalism itself.,And this dynamic is producing,unprecedented levelsnof transparency and impact.,We showed how a group of journalistsncan effect change across the world,by applying new methodsnand old-fashioned journalism techniques,to vast amounts of leaked information.,We put all-important contextnaround what was given to us by John Doe.,And by sharing resources,,we were able to dig deep --,much deeper and longer than mostnmedia organizations allow these days,,because of financial concerns. 
 Now, it was a big risk,,and it wouldn't work for every story,,but we showed with the Panama Papers,that you can write about any countrynfrom just about anywhere,,and then choose your preferrednbattleground to defend your work.,Try obtaining a court injunction,that would prevent the tellingnof a story in 76 different countries.,Try stopping the inevitable. 
 Shortly after we published,nI got a three-word text from Johannes:,"Wintris has arrived." 
 (Laughter) 
 It had arrived and so, too, perhapsnhas a new era for journalism. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you. 
 I guess you're going to sendnthat applause to the 350 journalists,who worked with you, right? 
 Now, a couple of questionsnI would like to ask.,The first one is,,you'd been workingnin secrecy for over a year,with 350-something colleaguesnfrom all over the world --,was there ever a moment when you thought,that the leak may be leaked,,that the collaboration may just be broken,by somebody publishing a story?,Or somebody not in the groupnreleasing some information,that they got to know? 
 Gerard Ryle: We had a seriesnof crises along the way,,including when something majornwas happening in the world,,the journalists from that countrynwanted to publish right away.,We had to calm them down.,Probably the biggest crisis we hadnwas a week before publication.,We'd sent a series of questionsnto the associates of Vladimir Putin,,but instead of responding,,the Kremlin actually heldna press conference and denounced us,,and denounced the whole thingnas being, I guess, a plot from the West.,At that point, Putin thoughtnit was just about him.,And, of course, a lot of editorsnaround the world,were very nervous about this.,They thought the storynwas going to get out.,You can imagine the amountnof time they'd spent,,the amount of resources,nmoney spent on this.,So I had to basically spendnthe last week calming everyone down,,a bit like a general,nwhere you're holding your troops back:,"Calm, remain calm.",And then eventually,nof course, they all did. 
 BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,,you released a lot of the documentsnas an open database,for everybody to searchnvia keyword, essentially. 
 GR: We very much believe,that the basic informationnabout the offshore world,should be made public.,Now, we didn't publishnthe underlying documents,of the journalists we're working with.,But the basic informationnsuch as the name of a person,,what their offshore company wasnand the name of that company,,is now all available online.,In fact, the biggest resourcenof its kind basically is out there now 
 BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do. 
 GR: Thank you. 
 (Applause)When Dorothy was a little girl,,she was fascinated by her goldfish.,Her father explained to her that fish swimnby quickly wagging their tails,to propel themselves through the water.,Without hesitation,nlittle Dorothy responded,,"Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwardsnby wagging their heads." 
 (Laughter) 
 In her mind, it was a factnas true as any other.,Fish swim backwardsnby wagging their heads.,She believed it. 
 Our lives are fullnof fish swimming backwards.,We make assumptionsnand faulty leaps of logic.,We harbor bias.,We know that we are right,nand they are wrong.,We fear the worst.,We strive for unattainable perfection.,We tell ourselvesnwhat we can and cannot do.,In our minds, fish swim by in reversenfrantically wagging their heads,and we don't even notice them. 
 I'm going to tell younfive facts about myself.,One fact is not true.,One: I graduated from Harvard at 19nwith an honors degree in mathematics.,Two: I currently runna construction company in Orlando.,Three: I starred on a television sitcom.,Four: I lost my sightnto a rare genetic eye disease.,Five: I served as a law clerknto two US Supreme Court justices.,Which fact is not true?,Actually, they're all true.,Yeah. They're all true. 
 (Applause) 
 At this point, most people reallynonly care about the television show. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know this from experience.,OK, so the show was NBC'sn"Saved by the Bell: The New Class.",And I played Weasel Wyzell,,who was the sort of dorky,nnerdy character on the show,,which made it a verynmajor acting challenge,for me as a 13-year-old boy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, did you strugglenwith number four, my blindness?,Why is that?,We make assumptionsnabout so-called disabilities.,As a blind man, I confrontnothers' incorrect assumptions,about my abilities every day.,My point today is notnabout my blindness, however.,It's about my vision.,Going blind taught mento live my life eyes wide open.,It taught me to spotnthose backwards-swimming fish,that our minds create.,Going blind cast them into focus. 
 What does it feel like to see?,It's immediate and passive.,You open your eyes and there's the world.,Seeing is believing. Sight is truth.,Right?,Well, that's what I thought. 
 Then, from age 12 to 25,nmy retinas progressively deteriorated.,My sight became an increasingly bizarre,carnival funhouse hallnof mirrors and illusions.,The salesperson I was relievednto spot in a store,was really a mannequin.,Reaching down to wash my hands,,I suddenly saw it wasna urinal I was touching, not a sink,,when my fingers felt its true shape.,A friend describednthe photograph in my hand,,and only then I could seenthe image depicted.,Objects appeared, morphednand disappeared in my reality.,It was difficult and exhausting to see.,I pieced together fragmented,ntransitory images,,consciously analyzed the clues,,searched for some logicnin my crumbling kaleidoscope,,until I saw nothing at all. 
 I learned that what we see,is not universal truth.,It is not objective reality.,What we see is a unique,npersonal, virtual reality,that is masterfullynconstructed by our brain. 
 Let me explain with a bitnof amateur neuroscience.,Your visual cortex takes upnabout 30 percent of your brain.,That's compared to approximatelyneight percent for touch,and two to three percent for hearing.,Every second, your eyesncan send your visual cortex,as many as two billionnpieces of information.,The rest of your body can send your brainnonly an additional billion.,So sight is one thirdnof your brain by volume,and can claim about two thirdsnof your brain's processing resources.,It's no surprise then,that the illusionnof sight is so compelling.,But make no mistake about it:nsight is an illusion. 
 Here's where it gets interesting.,To create the experience of sight,,your brain references your conceptualnunderstanding of the world,,other knowledge, your memories,nopinions, emotions, mental attention.,All of these things and far morenare linked in your brain to your sight.,These linkages work both ways,nand usually occur subconsciously.,So for example,,what you see impacts how you feel,,and the way you feelncan literally change what you see.,Numerous studies demonstrate this.,If you are asked to estimate,the walking speed of a mannin a video, for example,,your answer will be different if you'rentold to think about cheetahs or turtles.,A hill appears steepernif you've just exercised,,and a landmark appears farther away,if you're wearing a heavy backpack.,We have arrivednat a fundamental contradiction.,What you see is a complexnmental construction of your own making,,but you experience it passively,as a direct representationnof the world around you.,You create your own reality,nand you believe it.,I believed mine until it broke apart.,The deterioration of my eyesnshattered the illusion. 
 You see, sight is just one way,we shape our reality.,We create our own realitiesnin many other ways.,Let's take fear as just one example.,Your fears distort your reality.,Under the warped logic of fear,nanything is better than the uncertain.,Fear fills the void at all costs,,passing off what you dreadnfor what you know,,offering up the worstnin place of the ambiguous,,substituting assumption for reason.,Psychologists havena great term for it: awfulizing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right?,Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.,Now, fear is self-realizing.,When you face the greatest need,to look outside yourselfnand think critically,,fear beats a retreatndeep inside your mind,,shrinking and distorting your view,,drowning your capacitynfor critical thought,with a flood of disruptive emotions.,When you face a compellingnopportunity to take action,,fear lulls you into inaction,,enticing you to passively watchnits prophecies fulfill themselves. 
 When I was diagnosednwith my blinding disease,,I knew blindness would ruin my life.,Blindness was a death sentencenfor my independence.,It was the end of achievement for me.,Blindness meant I would livenan unremarkable life,,small and sad,,and likely alone.,I knew it.,This was a fiction born of my fears,nbut I believed it.,It was a lie, but it was my reality,,just like those backwards-swimming fishnin little Dorothy's mind.,If I had not confrontednthe reality of my fear,,I would have lived it.,I am certain of that. 
 So how do you live your lifeneyes wide open?,It is a learned discipline.,It can be taught. It can be practiced.,I will summarize very briefly. 
 Hold yourself accountable,for every moment, every thought,,every detail.,See beyond your fears.,Recognize your assumptions.,Harness your internal strength.,Silence your internal critic.,Correct your misconceptionsnabout luck and about success.,Accept your strengths and your weaknesses,nand understand the difference.,Open your hearts,to your bountiful blessings. 
 Your fears, your critics,,your heroes, your villains --,they are your excuses,,rationalizations, shortcuts,,justifications, your surrender.,They are fictions you perceive as reality.,Choose to see through them.,Choose to let them go.,You are the creator of your reality.,With that empowermentncomes complete responsibility. 
 I chose to step out of fear's tunnelninto terrain uncharted and undefined.,I chose to build there a blessed life.,Far from alone,,I share my beautiful life with Dorothy,,my beautiful wife,,with our triplets,nwhom we call the Tripskys,,and with the latest additionnto the family,,sweet baby Clementine. 
 What do you fear?,What lies do you tell yourself?,How do you embellish your truthnand write your own fictions?,What reality are youncreating for yourself? 
 In your career and personal life,nin your relationships,,and in your heart and soul,,your backwards-swimming fishndo you great harm.,They exact a toll in missed opportunitiesnand unrealized potential,,and they engender insecurity and distrust,where you seek fulfillment and connection.,I urge you to search them out. 
 Helen Keller said that the only thingnworse than being blind,is having sight but no vision.,For me, going blindnwas a profound blessing,,because blindness gave me vision.,I hope you can see what I see. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before younleave the stage, just a question.,This is an audience of entrepreneurs,nof doers, of innovators.,You are a CEO of a companyndown in Florida,,and many are probably wondering,,how is it to be a blind CEO?,What kind of specific challengesndo you have, and how do you overcome them? 
 Isaac Lidsky: Well,nthe biggest challenge became a blessing.,I don't get visual feedback from people. 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah.,So, for example,nin my leadership team meetings,,I don't see facialnexpressions or gestures.,I've learned to solicitna lot more verbal feedback.,I basically force peoplento tell me what they think.,And in this respect,,it's become, like I said, a real blessingnfor me personally and for my company,,because we communicatenat a far deeper level,,we avoid ambiguities,,and most important, my team knowsnthat what they think truly matters. 
 BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.nIL: Thank you, Bruno. 
 (Applause)Here's a question that matters. 
 [Is it ethical to evolve the human body?] 
 Because we're beginning to get allnthe tools together to evolve ourselves.,And we can evolve bacterianand we can evolve plants,and we can evolve animals,,and we're now reaching a pointnwhere we really have to ask,,is it really ethicalnand do we want to evolve human beings?,And as you're thinking about that,,let me talk about thatnin the context of prosthetics,,prosthetics past, present, future. 
 So this is the iron hand,that belonged to one of the German counts.,Loved to fight, lost his armnin one of these battles.,No problem, he just made a suit of armor,,put it on,,perfect prosthetic.,That's where the conceptnof ruling with an iron fist comes from. 
 And of course these prostheticsnhave been getting more and more useful,,more and more modern.,You can hold soft-boiled eggs.,You can have all types of controls,nand as you're thinking about that,,there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr,who have been buildingnabsolutely extraordinary prosthetics.,So the wonderful Aimee Mullinsnwill go out and say,,how tall do I want to be tonight?,Or Hugh will say what type of cliffndo I want to climb?,Or does somebody want to run a marathon,nor does somebody want to ballroom dance?,And as you adapt these things,,the interesting thing about prostheticsnis they've been coming inside the body.,So these external prostheticsnhave now become artificial knees.,They've become artificial hips.,And then they've evolved further,to become not just nice to have,but essential to have. 
 So when you're talkingnabout a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,,you're talking about somethingnthat isn't just, "I'm missing my leg,",it's, "if I don't have this, I can die.",And at that point, a prostheticnbecomes a symbiotic relationship,with the human body. 
 And four of the smartest peoplenthat I've ever met --,Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr,nJoe Jacobson, Bob Lander --,are working on a Centernfor Extreme Bionics.,And the interesting thingnof what you're seeing here is,these prostheticsnnow get integrated into the bone.,They get integrated into the skin.,They get integrated into the muscle.,And one of the other sides of Ed,is he's been thinkingnabout how to connect the brain,using light or other mechanisms,directly to things like these prosthetics.,And if you can do that,,then you can begin changingnfundamental aspects of humanity.,So how quickly you react to somethingndepends on the diameter of a nerve.,And of course, if you have nervesnthat are external or prosthetic,,say with light or liquid metal,,then you can increase that diameter,and you could even increase itntheoretically to the point where,,as long as you could see the muzzle flash,nyou could step out of the way of a bullet.,Those are the order of magnitudenof changes you're talking about. 
 This is a fourthnsort of level of prosthetics.,These are Phonak hearing aids,,and the reasonnwhy these are so interesting,is because they cross the thresholdnfrom where prosthetics are something,for somebody who is "disabled",and they become somethingnthat somebody who is "normal",might want to actually have,,because what this prosthetic does,nwhich is really interesting,,is not only does it help you hear,,you can focus your hearing,,so it can hear the conversationngoing on over there.,You can have superhearing.,You can have hearing in 360 degrees.nYou can have white noise.,You can record, and oh, by the way,nthey also put a phone into this.,So this functions as your hearing aidnand also as your phone.,And at that point, somebody might actuallynwant to have a prosthetic voluntarily. 
 All of these thousandsnof loosely connected little pieces,are coming together,,and it's about time we ask the question,,how do we want to evolve human beingsnover the next century or two?,And for that we turnnto a great philosopher,who was a very smart manndespite being a Yankee fan. 
 (Laughter) 
 And Yogi Berra used to say, of course,nthat it's very tough to make predictions,,especially about the future. 
 (Laughter) 
 So instead of making a predictionnabout the future to begin with,,let's take what's happening in the presentnwith people like Tony Atala,,who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.,And maybe the ultimate prostheticnisn't having something external, titanium.,Maybe the ultimate prostheticnis take your own gene code,,remake your own body parts,,because that's a whole lot more effectiventhan any kind of a prosthetic.,But while you're at it, then you can takenthe work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.,And one of the thingsnthat we've been doing,is trying to figure outnhow to reprogram cells.,And if you can reprogram a cell,,then you can change the cellsnin those organs.,So if you can changenthe cells in those organs,,maybe you make those organsnmore radiation-resistant.,Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen.,Maybe you make them more efficient,to filter out stuffnthat you don't want in your body. 
 And over the last few weeks,nGeorge Church has been in the news a lot,because he's been talking about takingnone of these programmable cells,and inserting an entire human genome,into that cell.,And once you can insertnan entire human genome into a cell,,then you begin to ask the question,,would you wantnto enhance any of that genome?,Do you want to enhance a human body?,How would you wantnto enhance a human body?,Where is it ethicalnto enhance a human body,and where is it not ethicalnto enhance a human body?,And all of a sudden, what we're doing,is we've got thisnmultidimensional chess board,where we can changenhuman genetics by using viruses,to attack things like AIDS,,or we can change the gene codenthrough gene therapy,to do away with some hereditary diseases,,or we can change the environment,,and change the expressionnof those genes in the epigenome,and pass that on to the next generations.,And all of a sudden,nit's not just one little bit,,it's all these stacked little bits,that allow younto take little portions of it,until all the portions coming together,lead you to somethingnthat's very different. 
 And a lot of peoplenare very scared by this stuff.,And it does sound scary,nand there are risks to this stuff.,So why in the world would younever want to do this stuff?,Why would we really wantnto alter the human body,in a fundamental way? 
 The answer lies in part,with Lord Rees,,astronomer royal of Great Britain.,And one of his favorite sayingsnis the universe is 100 percent malevolent.,So what does that mean?,It means if you takenany one of your bodies at random,,drop it anywhere in the universe,,drop it in space, you die.,Drop it on the Sun, you die.,Drop it on the surfacenof Mercury, you die.,Drop it near a supernova, you die.,But fortunately, it's onlynabout 80 percent effective. 
 So as a great physicist once said,,there's these littlenupstream eddies of biology,that create ordernin this rapid torrent of entropy.,So as the universe dissipates energy,,there's these upstream eddiesnthat create biological order.,Now, the problem with eddies is,,they tend to disappear.,They shift. They move in rivers.,And because of that, when an eddy shifts,,when the Earth becomes a snowball,nwhen the Earth becomes very hot,,when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid,nwhen you have supervolcanoes,,when you have solar flares,,when you have potentiallynextinction-level events,like the next election -- 
 (Laughter) 
 then all of a sudden,nyou can have periodic extinctions.,And by the way, that's happenednfive times on Earth,,and therefore it is very likely,that the human species on Earthnis going to go extinct someday.,Not next week,,not next month,,maybe in November,nbut maybe 10,000 years after that.,As you're thinkingnof the consequence of that,,if you believe that extinctionsnare common and natural,and normal and occur periodically,,it becomes a moral imperativento diversify our species. 
 And it becomes a moral imperative,because it's going to benreally hard to live on Mars,if we don't fundamentallynmodify the human body.,Right?,You go from one cell,,mom and dad coming togethernto make one cell,,in a cascade to 10 trillion cells.,We don't know, if you changenthe gravity substantially,,if the same thing will happennto create your body.,We do know that if you exposenour bodies as they currently are,to a lot of radiation, we will die.,So as you're thinking of that,nyou have to really redesign things,just to get to Mars.,Forget about the moonsnof Neptune or Jupiter. 
 And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,,let's think about lifenin a series of scales.,So Life One civilization,is a civilization that beginsnto alter his or her looks.,And we've been doing thatnfor thousands of years.,You've got tummy tucksnand you've got this and you've got that.,You alter your looks, and I'm told,that not all of those alterationsntake place for medical reasons. 
 (Laughter) 
 Seems odd. 
 A Life Two civilizationnis a different civilization.,A Life Two civilization altersnfundamental aspects of the body.,So you put human growth hormone in,nthe person grows taller,,or you put x in and the personngets fatter or loses metabolism,or does a whole series of things,,but you're altering the functionsnin a fundamental way. 
 To become an intrasolar civilization,,we're going to have to createna Life Three civilization,,and that looks very differentnfrom what we've got here.,Maybe you splice innDeinococcus radiodurans,so that the cells can resplicenafter a lot of exposure to radiation.,Maybe you breathe by having oxygennflow through your blood,instead of through your lungs.,But you're talking aboutnreally radical redesigns,,and one of the interesting thingsnthat's happened in the last decade,is we've discoveredna whole lot of planets out there.,And some of them may be Earth-like.,The problem is, if we evernwant to get to these planets,,the fastest human objects --,Juno and Voyagernand the rest of this stuff --,take tens of thousands of years,to get from herento the nearest solar system.,So if you want to start exploringnbeaches somewhere else,,or you want to see two-sun sunsets,,then you're talkingnabout something that is very different,,because you have to changenthe timescale and the body of humans,in ways which may benabsolutely unrecognizable.,And that's a Life Four civilization. 
 Now, we can't even beginnto imagine what that might look like,,but we're beginning to get glimpses,of instruments that mightntake us even that far.,And let me give you two examples. 
 So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,,and one of the thingsnthat Floyd's been doing,is he's been playingnwith the basic chemistry of life.,So all life on this planetnis made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.,All bacteria, all plants,nall animals, all humans, all cows,,everything else.,And what Floyd did is he changed outntwo of those base pairs,,so it's ATXY.,And that means that you now havena parallel system to make life,,to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,,that doesn't matenwith most things on Earth,or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.,Maybe you make plantsnthat are immune to all bacteria.,Maybe you make plantsnthat are immune to all viruses.,But why is that so interesting?,It means that wenare not a unique solution.,It means you can createnalternate chemistries to us,that could be chemistriesnadaptable to a very different planet,that could create life and heredity. 
 The second experiment,,or the other implicationnof this experiment,,is that all of you, all lifenis based on 20 amino acids.,If you don't substitute two amino acids,,if you don't say ATXY,nif you say ATCG + XY,,then you go fromn20 building blocks to 172,,and all of a sudden you've gotn172 building blocks of amino acids,to build life-formsnin very different shapes. 
 The second experiment to think aboutnis a really weird experiment,that's been taking place in China.,So this guy has been transplantingnhundreds of mouse heads.,Right?,And why is that an interesting experiment?,Well, think of the firstnheart transplants.,One of the things they used to do,is they used to bring innthe wife or the daughter of the donor,so the donee could tell the doctors,,"Do you recognize this person?nDo you love this person?,Do you feel anything for this person?",We laugh about that today.,We laugh because we knownthe heart is a muscle,,but for hundreds of thousands of years,nor tens of thousands of years,,"I gave her my heart.nShe took my heart. She broke my heart.",We thought this was emotion,and we thought maybe emotionsnwere transplanted with the heart. Nope. 
 So how about the brain?,Two possible outcomes to this experiment.,If you can get a mouse,that is functional,,then you can see,,is the new brain a blank slate?,And boy, does that have implications.,Second option:,the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.,The new mousenremembers what it's afraid of,,remembers how to navigate the maze,,and if that is true,,then you can transplantnmemory and consciousness.,And then the reallyninteresting question is,,if you can transplant this,nis the only input-output mechanism,this down here?,Or could you transplantnthat consciousness into something,that would be very different,,that would last in space,,that would lastntens of thousands of years,,that would be a completely redesigned body,that could hold consciousnessnfor a long, long period of time? 
 And let's come back to the first question:,Why would you ever want to do that?,Well, I'll tell you why.,Because this is the ultimate selfie. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is taken from six billion miles away,,and that's Earth.,And that's all of us.,And if that little thing goes,nall of humanity goes.,And the reason you wantnto alter the human body,is because you eventuallynwant a picture that says,,that's us, and that's us,,and that's us,,because that's the way humanitynsurvives long-term extinction.,And that's the reason why it turns out,it's actually unethicalnnot to evolve the human body,even though it can be scary,neven though it can be challenging,,but it's what's goingnto allow us to explore, live,and get to placesnwe can't even dream of today,,but which our great-great-great-great-ngrandchildren might someday. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Hi. My name is Marwa,nand I'm an architect.,I was born and raised in Homs,,a city in the centralnwestern part of Syria,,and I've always lived here.,After six years of war,,Homs is now a half-destroyed city.,My family and I were lucky;nour place is still standing.,Although for two years,nwe were like prisoners at home.,Outside there were demonstrationsnand battles and bombings and snipers.,My husband and I used to runnan architecture studio,in the old town main square.,It's gone, as is mostnof the old town itself.,Half of the city's other neighborhoods,are now rubble.,Since the ceasefire in late 2015,,large parts of Homsnhave been more or less quiet.,The economy is completely broken,nand people are still fighting.,The merchants who had stallsnin the old city market,now trade out of sheds on the streets.,Under our apartment, there is a carpenter,,sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house,nworkshops, among many more.,I have started teaching part-time,,and with my husband,nwho juggles several jobs,,we've opened a small bookshop.,Other people do all sortsnof jobs to get by. 
 When I look at my destroyed city,nof course, I ask myself:,What has led to this senseless war?,Syria was largely a place of tolerance,,historically accustomed to variety,,accommodating a wide rangenof beliefs, origins, customs,,goods, food.,How did my country --,a country with communitiesnliving harmoniously together,and comfortable in discussingntheir differences --,how did it degenerate into civil war,nviolence, displacement,and unprecedented sectarian hatred?,There were many reasonsnthat had led to the war --,social, political and economic.,They all have played their role.,But I believe there is one key reasonnthat has been overlooked,and which is important to analyze,,because from it will largely depend,whether we can make surenthat this doesn't happen again.,And that reason is architecture. 
 Architecture in my countrynhas played an important role,in creating, directing and amplifyingnconflict between warring factions,,and this is probably truenfor other countries as well.,There is a sure correspondencenbetween the architecture of a place,and the character of the communitynthat has settled there.,Architecture plays a key rolenin whether a community crumbles,or comes together.,Syrian society has long livednthe coexistence,of different traditions and backgrounds.,Syrians have experiencednthe prosperity of open trade,and sustainable communities.,They have enjoyed the true meaningnof belonging to a place,,and that was reflectednin their built environment,,in the mosques and churchesnbuilt back-to-back,,in the interwoven souks and public venues,,and the proportions and sizes basednon principles of humanity and harmony. 
 This architecture of mixityncan still be read in the remains.,The old Islamic city in Syrianwas built over a multilayered past,,integrating with itnand embracing its spirit.,So did its communities.,People lived and worked with each other,in a place that gave themna sense of belonging,and made them feel at home.,They shared a remarkablynunified existence. 
 But over the last century,,gradually this delicate balancenof these places has been interfered with;,first, by the urban plannersnof the colonial period,,when the French wentnenthusiastically about,,transforming what they sawnas the un-modern Syrian cities.,They blew up city streetsnand relocated monuments.,They called them improvements,,and they were the beginningnof a long, slow unraveling.,The traditional urbanismnand architecture of our cities,assured identity and belongingnnot by separation,,but by intertwining.,But over time, the ancient becamenworthless, and the new, coveted.,The harmony of the built environmentnand social environment,got trampled overnby elements of modernity --,brutal, unfinished concrete blocks,,neglect, aesthetic devastation,,divisive urbanism that zonedncommunities by class, creed or affluence. 
 And the same was happeningnto the community.,As the shape of the builtnenvironment changed,,so the lifestyles and sensenof belonging of the communities,also started changing.,From a registernof togetherness, of belonging,,architecture becamena way of differentiation,,and communities started drifting apart,from the very fabricnthat used to unite them,,and from the soul of the place that usednto represent their common existence. 
 While many reasons had lednto the Syrian war,,we shouldn't underestimatenthe way in which,,by contributing to the loss nof identity and self-respect,,urban zoning and misguided,ninhumane architecture,have nurtured sectarianndivisions and hatred.,Over time, the united citynhas morphed into a city center,with ghettos along its circumference.,And in turn, the coherent communitiesnbecame distinct social groups,,alienated from each othernand alienated from the place.,From my point of view,,losing the sense of belonging to a place,and a sense of sharing itnwith someone else,has made it a lot easier to destroy. 
 The clear example can be seennin the informal housing system,,which used to host, before the war,nover 40 percent of the population.,Yes, prior to the war,nalmost half of the Syrian population,lived in slums,,peripheral areasnwithout proper infrastructure,,made of endless rows of bare block boxes,containing people,,people who mostly belongednto the same group,,whether based on religion,nclass, origin or all of the above. 
 This ghettoized urbanismnproved to be a tangible precursor of war.,Conflict is much easiernbetween pre-categorized areas --,where the "others" live.,The ties that usednto bind the city together --,whether they were social,nthrough coherent building,,or economic, through trade in the souk,,or religious, throughnthe coexistent presence --,were all lost in the misguidednand visionless modernization,of the built environment. 
 Allow me an aside.,When I read about heterogeneous urbanismnin other parts of the world,,involving ethnic neighborhoodsnin British cities,or around Paris or Brussels,,I recognize the beginningnof the kind of instability,we have witnessednso disastrously here in Syria. 
 We have severely destroyed cities,,such as Homs, Aleppo,nDaraa and many others,,and almost half of the populationnof the country is now displaced. 
 Hopefully, the war will end,,and the question that,nas an architect, I have to ask, is:,How do we rebuild?,What are the principlesnthat we should adopt,in order to avoid repeatingnthe same mistakes?,From my point of view, the main focusnshould be on creating places,that make their people feel they belong.,Architecture and planningnneed to recapture,some of the traditional valuesnthat did just that,,creating the conditionsnfor coexistence and peace,,values of beautynthat don't exhibit ostentation,,but rather, approachability and ease,,moral values that promotengenerosity and acceptance,,architecture that is for everyonento enjoy, not just for the elite,,just as used to be in the shadowed alleysnof the old Islamic city,,mixed designs that encouragena sense of community. 
 There is a neighborhood here in Homsnthat's called Baba Amr,that has been fully destroyed.,Almost two years ago,nI introduced this design,into a UN-Habitat competitionnfor rebuilding it.,The idea was to create an urban fabricninspired by a tree,,capable of growingnand spreading organically,,echoing the traditional bridgenhanging over the old alleys,,and incorporating apartments,nprivate courtyards, shops,,workshops, places for parkingnand playing and leisure,,trees and shaded areas.,It's far from perfect, obviously.,I drew it during the few hoursnof electricity we get.,And there are many possible waysnto express belonging and community,through architecture.,But compare it with the freestanding,ndisconnected blocks,proposed by the official projectnfor rebuilding Baba Amr. 
 Architecture is not the axisnaround which all human life rotates,,but it has the power to suggestnand even direct human activity.,In that sense, settlement,nidentity and social integration,are all the producer and productnof effective urbanism.,The coherent urbanismnof the old Islamic city,and of many old Europeanntowns, for instance,,promote integration,,while rows of soulless housingnor tower blocks,,even when they are luxurious,,tend to promote isolation and "otherness.",Even simple things,like shaded places or fruit plantsnor drinking water inside the city,can make a differencenin how people feel towards the place,,and whether they consider itna generous place that gives,,a place that's worth keeping,ncontributing to,,or whether they see itnas an alienating place,,full of seeds of anger.,In order for a place to give,nits architecture should be giving, too. 
 Our built environment matters.,The fabric of our cities is reflectednin the fabric of our souls.,And whether in the shapenof informal concrete slums,or broken social housing,or trampled old towns,or forests of skyscrapers,,the contemporary urban archetypes,that have emergednall across the Middle East,have been one cause of the alienationnand fragmentation of our communities. 
 We can learn from this.,We can learn how to rebuildnin another way,,how to create an architecturenthat doesn't contribute only,to the practical and economicnaspects of people's lives,,but also to their social, spiritualnand psychological needs.,Those needs were totally overlookednin the Syrian cities before the war.,We need to create againncities that are shared,by the communities that inhabit them.,If we do so, people will not feel the need,to seek identities opposednto the other identities all around,,because they will all feel at home. 
 Thank you for listening.I'm going to talknabout a failure of intuition,that many of us suffer from.,It's really a failurento detect a certain kind of danger.,I'm going to describe a scenario,that I think is both terrifying,and likely to occur,,and that's not a good combination,,as it turns out.,And yet rather than be scared,nmost of you will feel,that what I'm talking aboutnis kind of cool. 
 I'm going to describenhow the gains we make,in artificial intelligence,could ultimately destroy us.,And in fact, I think it's very difficultnto see how they won't destroy us,or inspire us to destroy ourselves.,And yet if you're anything like me,,you'll find that it's funnto think about these things.,And that response is part of the problem.,OK? That response should worry you.,And if I were to convince you in this talk,that we were likelynto suffer a global famine,,either because of climate changenor some other catastrophe,,and that your grandchildren,nor their grandchildren,,are very likely to live like this,,you wouldn't think,,"Interesting.,I like this TED Talk." 
 Famine isn't fun.,Death by science fiction,non the other hand, is fun,,and one of the things that worries me mostnabout the development of AI at this point,is that we seem unable to marshalnan appropriate emotional response,to the dangers that lie ahead.,I am unable to marshal this response,nand I'm giving this talk. 
 It's as though we stand before two doors.,Behind door number one,,we stop making progressnin building intelligent machines.,Our computer hardware and softwarenjust stops getting better for some reason.,Now take a momentnto consider why this might happen.,I mean, given how valuablenintelligence and automation are,,we will continue to improve our technologynif we are at all able to.,What could stop us from doing this?,A full-scale nuclear war?,A global pandemic?,An asteroid impact?,Justin Bieber becomingnpresident of the United States? 
 (Laughter) 
 The point is, something would have tondestroy civilization as we know it.,You have to imaginenhow bad it would have to be,to prevent us from makingnimprovements in our technology,permanently,,generation after generation.,Almost by definition,nthis is the worst thing,that's ever happened in human history. 
 So the only alternative,,and this is what liesnbehind door number two,,is that we continuento improve our intelligent machines,year after year after year.,At a certain point, we will buildnmachines that are smarter than we are,,and once we have machinesnthat are smarter than we are,,they will begin to improve themselves.,And then we risk whatnthe mathematician IJ Good called,an "intelligence explosion,",that the process could get away from us. 
 Now, this is often caricatured,nas I have here,,as a fear that armies of malicious robots,will attack us.,But that isn't the most likely scenario.,It's not that our machinesnwill become spontaneously malevolent.,The concern is reallynthat we will build machines,that are so muchnmore competent than we are,that the slightest divergencenbetween their goals and our own,could destroy us. 
 Just think about how we relate to ants.,We don't hate them.,We don't go out of our way to harm them.,In fact, sometimesnwe take pains not to harm them.,We step over them on the sidewalk.,But whenever their presence,seriously conflicts with one of our goals,,let's say when constructingna building like this one,,we annihilate them without a qualm.,The concern is that we willnone day build machines,that, whether they're conscious or not,,could treat us with similar disregard. 
 Now, I suspect this seemsnfar-fetched to many of you.,I bet there are those of you who doubtnthat superintelligent AI is possible,,much less inevitable.,But then you must find something wrongnwith one of the following assumptions.,And there are only three of them. 
 Intelligence is a matter of informationnprocessing in physical systems.,Actually, this is a little bit morenthan an assumption.,We have already builtnnarrow intelligence into our machines,,and many of these machines perform,at a level of superhumannintelligence already.,And we know that mere matter,can give rise to what is calledn"general intelligence,",an ability to think flexiblynacross multiple domains,,because our brains have managed it. Right?,I mean, there's just atoms in here,,and as long as we continuento build systems of atoms,that display more and morenintelligent behavior,,we will eventually,nunless we are interrupted,,we will eventuallynbuild general intelligence,into our machines. 
 It's crucial to realizenthat the rate of progress doesn't matter,,because any progressnis enough to get us into the end zone.,We don't need Moore's law to continue.nWe don't need exponential progress.,We just need to keep going. 
 The second assumptionnis that we will keep going.,We will continue to improvenour intelligent machines.,And given the value of intelligence --,I mean, intelligence is eithernthe source of everything we value,or we need it to safeguardneverything we value.,It is our most valuable resource.,So we want to do this.,We have problemsnthat we desperately need to solve.,We want to cure diseasesnlike Alzheimer's and cancer.,We want to understand economic systems.nWe want to improve our climate science.,So we will do this, if we can.,The train is already out of the station,nand there's no brake to pull. 
 Finally, we don't standnon a peak of intelligence,,or anywhere near it, likely.,And this really is the crucial insight.,This is what makesnour situation so precarious,,and this is what makes our intuitionsnabout risk so unreliable. 
 Now, just consider the smartest personnwho has ever lived.,On almost everyone's shortlist herenis John von Neumann.,I mean, the impression that von Neumannnmade on the people around him,,and this included the greatestnmathematicians and physicists of his time,,is fairly well-documented.,If only half the storiesnabout him are half true,,there's no question,he's one of the smartest peoplenwho has ever lived.,So consider the spectrum of intelligence.,Here we have John von Neumann.,And then we have you and me.,And then we have a chicken. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry, a chicken. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's no reason for me to make this talknmore depressing than it needs to be. 
 (Laughter) 
 It seems overwhelmingly likely, however,nthat the spectrum of intelligence,extends much furthernthan we currently conceive,,and if we build machinesnthat are more intelligent than we are,,they will very likelynexplore this spectrum,in ways that we can't imagine,,and exceed us in waysnthat we can't imagine. 
 And it's important to recognize thatnthis is true by virtue of speed alone.,Right? So imagine if we just builtna superintelligent AI,that was no smarternthan your average team of researchers,at Stanford or MIT.,Well, electronic circuitsnfunction about a million times faster,than biochemical ones,,so this machine should thinknabout a million times faster,than the minds that built it.,So you set it running for a week,,and it will perform 20,000 yearsnof human-level intellectual work,,week after week after week.,How could we even understand,nmuch less constrain,,a mind making this sort of progress? 
 The other thing that's worrying, frankly,,is that, imagine the best case scenario.,So imagine we hit upon a designnof superintelligent AI,that has no safety concerns.,We have the perfect designnthe first time around.,It's as though we've been handed an oracle,that behaves exactly as intended.,Well, this machine would benthe perfect labor-saving device.,It can design the machinenthat can build the machine,that can do any physical work,,powered by sunlight,,more or less for the costnof raw materials.,So we're talking aboutnthe end of human drudgery.,We're also talking about the endnof most intellectual work. 
 So what would apes like ourselvesndo in this circumstance?,Well, we'd be free to play Frisbeenand give each other massages.,Add some LSD and somenquestionable wardrobe choices,,and the whole worldncould be like Burning Man. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, that might sound pretty good,,but ask yourself what would happen,under our current economicnand political order?,It seems likely that we would witness,a level of wealth inequalitynand unemployment,that we have never seen before.,Absent a willingnessnto immediately put this new wealth,to the service of all humanity,,a few trillionaires could gracenthe covers of our business magazines,while the rest of the worldnwould be free to starve. 
 And what would the Russiansnor the Chinese do,if they heard that some companynin Silicon Valley,was about to deploy a superintelligent AI?,This machine would be capablenof waging war,,whether terrestrial or cyber,,with unprecedented power.,This is a winner-take-all scenario.,To be six months aheadnof the competition here,is to be 500,000 years ahead,,at a minimum.,So it seems that even mere rumorsnof this kind of breakthrough,could cause our species to go berserk. 
 Now, one of the most frightening things,,in my view, at this moment,,are the kinds of thingsnthat AI researchers say,when they want to be reassuring.,And the most common reasonnwe're told not to worry is time.,This is all a long way off,ndon't you know.,This is probably 50 or 100 years away.,One researcher has said,,"Worrying about AI safety,is like worryingnabout overpopulation on Mars.",This is the Silicon Valley version,of "don't worry yournpretty little head about it." 
 (Laughter) 
 No one seems to notice,that referencing the time horizon,is a total non sequitur.,If intelligence is just a matternof information processing,,and we continue to improve our machines,,we will producensome form of superintelligence.,And we have no ideanhow long it will take us,to create the conditionsnto do that safely.,Let me say that again.,We have no idea how long it will take us,to create the conditionsnto do that safely. 
 And if you haven't noticed,n50 years is not what it used to be.,This is 50 years in months.,This is how long we've had the iPhone.,This is how long "The Simpsons"nhas been on television.,Fifty years is not that much time,to meet one of the greatest challengesnour species will ever face.,Once again, we seem to be failingnto have an appropriate emotional response,to what we have every reasonnto believe is coming. 
 The computer scientist Stuart Russellnhas a nice analogy here.,He said, imagine that we receivedna message from an alien civilization,,which read:,"People of Earth,,we will arrive on your planet in 50 years.,Get ready.",And now we're just counting downnthe months until the mothership lands?,We would feel a littlenmore urgency than we do. 
 Another reason we're told not to worry,is that these machinesncan't help but share our values,because they will be literallynextensions of ourselves.,They'll be grafted onto our brains,,and we'll essentiallynbecome their limbic systems.,Now take a moment to consider,that the safestnand only prudent path forward,,recommended,,is to implant this technologyndirectly into our brains.,Now, this may in fact be the safestnand only prudent path forward,,but usually one's safety concernsnabout a technology,have to be pretty much worked outnbefore you stick it inside your head. 
 (Laughter) 
 The deeper problem is thatnbuilding superintelligent AI on its own,seems likely to be easier,than building superintelligent AI,and having the completed neuroscience,that allows us to seamlesslynintegrate our minds with it.,And given that the companiesnand governments doing this work,are likely to perceive themselvesnas being in a race against all others,,given that to win this racenis to win the world,,provided you don't destroy itnin the next moment,,then it seems likelynthat whatever is easier to do,will get done first. 
 Now, unfortunately,nI don't have a solution to this problem,,apart from recommendingnthat more of us think about it.,I think we need somethingnlike a Manhattan Project,on the topic of artificial intelligence.,Not to build it, because I thinknwe'll inevitably do that,,but to understandnhow to avoid an arms race,and to build it in a waynthat is aligned with our interests.,When you're talkingnabout superintelligent AI,that can make changes to itself,,it seems that we only have one chancento get the initial conditions right,,and even then we will need to absorb,the economic and politicalnconsequences of getting them right. 
 But the moment we admit,that information processingnis the source of intelligence,,that some appropriate computational systemnis what the basis of intelligence is,,and we admit that we will improventhese systems continuously,,and we admit that the horizonnof cognition very likely far exceeds,what we currently know,,then we have to admit,that we are in the processnof building some sort of god.,Now would be a good time,to make sure it's a god we can live with. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?,I would be shocked if you hadn't. 
 This is a technology --nit's for genome editing --,and it's so versatile and so controversial,that it's sparking all sortsnof really interesting conversations.,Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?,Should we edit a human embryo?,And my personal favorite:,How can we justifynwiping out an entire species,that we consider harmful to humans,off the face of the Earth,,using this technology? 
 This type of sciencenis moving much faster,than the regulatory mechanismsnthat govern it.,And so, for the past six years,,I've made it my personal mission,to make sure that as many peoplenas possible understand,these types of technologiesnand their implications. 
 Now, CRISPR has been the subjectnof a huge media hype,,and the words that are used most oftennare "easy" and "cheap.",So what I want to do is drill downna little bit deeper,and look into some of the mythsnand the realities around CRISPR. 
 If you're trying to CRISPR a genome,,the first thing that you have to donis damage the DNA.,The damage comes in the formnof a double-strand break,through the double helix.,And then the cellular repairnprocesses kick in,,and then we convincenthose repair processes,to make the edit that we want,,and not a natural edit.,That's how it works.,It's a two-part system.,You've got a Cas9 proteinnand something called a guide RNA.,I like to think of it as a guided missile.,So the Cas9 --nI love to anthropomorphize --,so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing,that wants to chew DNA,,and the guide RNA is the leashnthat's keeping it out of the genome,until it finds the exact spotnwhere it matches.,And the combination of those twonis called CRISPR.,It's a system that we stole,from an ancient, ancientnbacterial immune system. 
 The part that's amazing about itnis that the guide RNA,,only 20 letters of it,,are what target the system.,This is really easy to design,,and it's really cheap to buy.,So that's the partnthat is modular in the system;,everything else stays the same.,This makes it a remarkably easynand powerful system to use. 
 The guide RNA and the Cas9nprotein complex together,go bouncing along the genome,,and when they find a spotnwhere the guide RNA matches,,then it inserts between the two strandsnof the double helix,,it rips them apart,,that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,,and all of a sudden,,you've got a cell that's in total panic,because now it's got a piecenof DNA that's broken. 
 What does it do?,It calls its first responders.,There are two major repair pathways.,The first just takes the DNAnand shoves the two pieces back together.,This isn't a very efficient system,,because what happens isnsometimes a base drops out,or a base is added.,It's an OK way to maybe, like,nknock out a gene,,but it's not the way that we really wantnto do genome editing. 
 The second repair pathwaynis a lot more interesting.,In this repair pathway,,it takes a homologous piece of DNA.,And now mind you, in a diploidnorganism like people,,we've got one copy of our genomenfrom our mom and one from our dad,,so if one gets damaged,,it can use the othernchromosome to repair it.,So that's where this comes from.,The repair is made,,and now the genome is safe again. 
 The way that we can hijack this,is we can feed it a false piece of DNA,,a piece that has homology on both ends,but is different in the middle.,So now, you can putnwhatever you want in the center,and the cell gets fooled.,So you can change a letter,,you can take letters out,,but most importantly,nyou can stuff new DNA in,,kind of like a Trojan horse. 
 CRISPR is going to be amazing,,in terms of the number of differentnscientific advances,that it's going to catalyze.,The thing that's special about itnis this modular targeting system.,I mean, we've been shoving DNAninto organisms for years, right?,But because of the modularntargeting system,,we can actually put itnexactly where we want it. 
 The thing is that there'sna lot of talk about it being cheap,and it being easy.,And I run a community lab.,I'm starting to get emails from peoplenthat say stuff like, 
 "Hey, can I come to your open night,and, like, maybe use CRISPRnand engineer my genome?" 
 (Laugher) 
 Like, seriously. 
 I'm, "No, you can't." 
 (Laughter) 
 "But I've heard it's cheap.nI've heard it's easy." 
 We're going to explore that a little bit.,So, how cheap is it?,Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.,It's going to take the cost of the averagenmaterials for an experiment,from thousands of dollarsnto hundreds of dollars,,and it cuts the time a lot, too.,It can cut it from weeks to days.,That's great.,You still need a professional labnto do the work in;,you're not going to do anything meaningfulnoutside of a professional lab.,I mean, don't listen to anyone who says,you can do this sort of stuffnon your kitchen table.,It's really not easynto do this kind of work.,Not to mention,nthere's a patent battle going on,,so even if you do invent something,,the Broad Institute and UC Berkeleynare in this incredible patent battle.,It's really fascinatingnto watch it happen,,because they're accusing each othernof fraudulent claims,and then they've got people saying,,"Oh, well, I signednmy notebook here or there.",This isn't going to be settled for years.,And when it is,,you can bet you're going to pay someonena really hefty licensing fee,in order to use this stuff.,So, is it really cheap?,Well, it's cheap if you're doingnbasic research and you've got a lab. 
 How about easy?nLet's look at that claim.,The devil is always in the details.,We don't really knownthat much about cells.,They're still kind of black boxes.,For example, we don't knownwhy some guide RNAs work really well,and some guide RNAs don't.,We don't know why some cellsnwant to do one repair pathway,and some cells would rather do the other. 
 And besides that,,there's the whole problemnof getting the system into the cell,in the first place.,In a petri dish, that's not that hard,,but if you're trying to do itnon a whole organism,,it gets really tricky.,It's OK if you use somethingnlike blood or bone marrow --,those are the targetsnof a lot of research now. 
 There was a great storynof some little girl,who they saved from leukemia,by taking the blood out, editing it,nand putting it back,with a precursor of CRISPR.,And this is a line of researchnthat people are going to do.,But right now, if you want to getninto the whole body,,you're probably goingnto have to use a virus.,So you take the virus,nyou put the CRISPR into it,,you let the virus infect the cell.,But now you've got this virus in there,,and we don't know what the long-termneffects of that are.,Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,,a very small percentage,nbut they're still there.,What's going to happennover time with that? 
 These are not trivial questions,,and there are scientistsnthat are trying to solve them,,and they will eventually,nhopefully, be solved.,But it ain't plug-and-play,nnot by a long shot.,So: Is it really easy?,Well, if you spend a few yearsnworking it out in your particular system,,yes, it is. 
 Now the other thing is,,we don't really know that much about hownto make a particular thing happen,by changing particular spotsnin the genome.,We're a long way away from figuring out,how to give a pig wings, for example.,Or even an extra leg -- I'd settlenfor an extra leg.,That would be kind of cool, right?,But what is happening,is that CRISPR is being usednby thousands and thousands of scientists,to do really, really important work,,like making better modelsnof diseases in animals, for example,,or for taking pathwaysnthat produce valuable chemicals,and getting them into industrialnproduction in fermentation vats,,or even doing really basic researchnon what genes do. 
 This is the story of CRISPRnwe should be telling,,and I don't like itnthat the flashier aspects of it,are drowning all of this out.,Lots of scientists did a lot of worknto make CRISPR happen,,and what's interesting to me,is that these scientistsnare being supported by our society. 
 Think about it.,We've got an infrastructure that allowsna certain percentage of people,to spend all their time doing research.,That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,,and I would say that makes us allnthe shepherds of CRISPR.,We all have a responsibility. 
 So I would urge you to really learnnabout these types of technologies,,because, really, only in that way,are we going to be able to guidenthe development of these technologies,,the use of these technologies,and make sure that, in the end,nit's a positive outcome --,for both the planet and for us. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)I was recently travelingnin the Highlands of New Guinea,,and I was talking with a mannwho had three wives.,I asked him, "How many wivesnwould you like to have?",And there was this long pause,,and I thought to myself,,"Is he going to say five?,Is he going to say 10?,Is he going to say 25?",And he leaned towards me,and he whispered, "None." 
 (Laughter) 
 Eighty-six percent of human societiesnpermit a man to have several wives:,polygyny.,But in the vast majoritynof these cultures,,only about five or ten percent of mennactually do have several wives.,Having several partnersncan be a toothache.,In fact, co-wives cannfight with each other,,sometimes they can even poisonneach other's children.,And you've got to havena lot of cows, a lot of goats,,a lot of money, a lot of land,,in order to build a harem. 
 We are a pair-bonding species.,Ninety-seven percent of mammalsndo not pair up to rear their young;,human beings do.,I'm not suggesting that we're not --,that we're necessarilynsexually faithful to our partners.,I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures,,I understand, actually,nsome of the genetics of it,,and some of the brain circuitry of it.,It's very common around the world,,but we are built to love. 
 How is technology changing love?,I'm going to say almost not at all.,I study the brain.,I and my colleagues have putnover 100 people into a brain scanner --,people who had justnfallen happily in love,,people who had just been rejected in love,and people who are in love long-term.,And it is possiblento remain "in love" long-term.,And I've long ago maintained,that we've evolved three distinctlyndifferent brain systems,for mating and reproduction:,sex drive,,feelings of intense romantic love,and feelings of deep cosmicnattachment to a long-term partner.,And together, these three brain systems --,with many other parts of the brain --,orchestrate our sexual,nour romantic and our family lives. 
 But they lie way below the cortex,,way below the limbic systemnwhere we feel our emotions,,generate our emotions.,They lie in the most primitive partsnof the brain, linked with energy,,focus, craving, motivation,nwanting and drive.,In this case,,the drive to win life's greatest prize:,a mating partner.,They evolved over 4.4 million years agonamong our first ancestors,,and they're not going to changenif you swipe left or right on Tinder. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 There's no question that technologynis changing the way we court:,emailing, texting,,emojis to express your emotions,,sexting,,"liking" a photograph, selfies ...,We're seeing new rulesnand taboos for how to court.,But, you know --,is this actuallyndramatically changing love?,What about the late 1940s,,when the automobile became very popular,and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms? 
 (Laughter) 
 How about the introductionnof the birth control pill?,Unchained from the great threatnof pregnancy and social ruin,,women could finally expressntheir primitive and primal sexuality. 
 Even dating sites are not changing love.,I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com,,I've been it for 11 years.,I keep telling themnand they agree with me,,that these are not dating sites,,they are introducing sites.,When you sit down in a bar,,in a coffee house,,on a park bench,,your ancient brain snaps into actionnlike a sleeping cat awakened,,and you smile,and laugh,and listen,and parade the way our ancestorsndid 100,000 years ago.,We can give you various people --,all the dating sites can --,but the only real algorithmnis your own human brain.,Technology is not going to change that. 
 Technology is also not going to changenwho you choose to love.,I study the biology of personality,,and I've come to believe,that we've evolved four very broadnstyles of thinking and behaving,,linked with the dopamine, serotonin,,testosterone and estrogen systems.,So I created a questionnairendirectly from brain science,to measure the degree to whichnyou express the traits --,the constellation of traits --,linked with eachnof these four brain systems.,I then put that questionnairenon various dating sites,in 40 countries.,Fourteen million or more peoplenhave now taken the questionnaire,,and I've been able to watchnwho's naturally drawn to whom. 
 And as it turns out,,those who were very expressivenof the dopamine system,tend to be curious, creative,nspontaneous, energetic --,I would imagine there's an awful lotnof people like that in this room --,they're drawn to people like themselves.,Curious, creative peoplenneed people like themselves.,People who are very expressivenof the serotonin system,tend to be traditional, conventional,nthey follow the rules,,they respect authority,,they tend to be religious -- religiositynis in the serotonin system --,and traditional peoplengo for traditional people.,In that way, similarity attracts.,In the other two cases, opposites attract.,People very expressivenof the testosterone system,tend to be analytical,nlogical, direct, decisive,,and they go for their opposite:,they go for somebody who's high estrogen,,somebody who's got very good verbal skills,and people skills,,who's very intuitive,and who's very nurturingnand emotionally expressive.,We have natural patterns of mate choice.,Modern technology is not goingnto change who we choose to love. 
 But technology is producingnone modern trend,that I find particularly important.,It's associated with the conceptnof paradox of choice.,For millions of years,,we lived in little huntingnand gathering groups.,You didn't have the opportunity to choose,between 1,000 people on a dating site.,In fact, I've been studying this recently,,and I actually think there's somensort of sweet spot in the brain;,I don't know what it is, but apparently,nfrom reading a lot of the data,,we can embrace about fivento nine alternatives, and after that,,you get into what academicsncall "cognitive overload,",and you don't choose any. 
 So I've come to think that duento this cognitive overload,,we're ushering in a new form of courtship,that I call "slow love.",I arrived at this duringnmy work with Match.com.,Every year for the last six years,,we've done a study calledn"Singles in America.",We don't poll the Match population,,we poll the American population.,We use 5,000-plus people,,a representative sample of Americansnbased on the US census. 
 We've got data now on over 30,000 people,,and every single year,,I see some of the same patterns.,Every single year when I ask the question,,over 50 percent of peoplenhave had a one-night stand --,not necessarily last year,nbut in their lives --,50 percent have hadna friends with benefits,during the course of their lives,,and over 50 percent have livednwith a person long-term,before marrying.,Americans think that this is reckless.,I have doubted that for a long time;,the patterns are too strong.,There's got to be somenDarwinian explanation --,Not that many people are crazy. 
 And I stumbled, then, on a statisticnthat really came home to me.,It was a very interesting academic article,in which I found that 67 percentnof singles in America today,who are living long-term with somebody,,have not yet married becausenthey are terrified of divorce.,They're terrified of the social,,legal, emotional,,economic consequences of divorce.,So I came to realize that I don't thinknthis is recklessness;,I think it's caution.,Today's singles want to knownevery single thing about a partner,before they wed.,You learn a lot between the sheets,,not only about how somebody makes love,,but whether they're kind,,whether they can listen,and at my age,,whether they've got a sense of humor. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in an age where we haventoo many choices,,we have very little fearnof pregnancy and disease,and we've got no feeling of shamenfor sex before marriage,,I think people are takingntheir time to love. 
 And actually, what's happening is,,what we're seeing is a real expansionnof the precommitment stage,before you tie the knot.,Where marriage used to benthe beginning of a relationship,,now it's the finale.,But the human brain -- 
 (Laughter) 
 The human brain always triumphs,,and indeed, in the United States today,,86 percent of Americansnwill marry by age 49.,And even in cultures around the worldnwhere they're not marrying as often,,they are settling down eventuallynwith a long-term partner. 
 So it began to occur to me:,during this long extensionnof the precommitment stage,,if you can get rid of badnrelationships before you marry,,maybe we're going to seenmore happy marriages.,So I did a study of 1,100nmarried people in America --,not on Match.com, of course --,and I asked them a lot of questions.,But one of the questions was,,"Would you re-marry the personnyou're currently married to?",And 81 percent said, "Yes." 
 In fact, the greatest changenin modern romance and family life,is not technology.,It's not even slow love.,It's actually womennpiling into the job market,in cultures around the world.,For millions of years,,our ancestors livednin little hunting and gathering groups.,Women commuted to worknto gather their fruits and vegetables.,They came home with 60 to 80npercent of the evening meal.,The double-income family was the rule.,And women were regardednas just as economically, socially,and sexually powerful as men. 
 Then the environment changednsome 10,000 years ago,,we began to settle down on the farm,and both men and womennbecame obliged, really,,to marry the right person,,from the right background,,from the right religion,and from the right kinnand social and political connections.,Men's jobs became more important:,they had to move the rocks,nfell the trees, plow the land.,They brought the producento local markets, and came home,with the equivalent of money. 
 Along with this,,we see a rise of a host of beliefs:,the belief of virginity at marriage,,arranged marriages --nstrictly arranged marriages --,the belief that the mannis the head of the household,,that the wife's place is in the home,and most important,,honor thy husband,nand 'til death do us part.,These are gone.,They are going, and in many places,,they are gone. 
 We are right now in a marriage revolution.,We are shedding 10,000 yearsnof our farming tradition,and moving forward towards egalitariannrelationships between the sexes --,something I regard as highly compatiblenwith the ancient human spirit. 
 I'm not a Pollyanna;,there's a great deal to cry about.,I've studied divorce in 80 cultures,,I've studied, as I say,nadultery in many --,there's a whole pile of problems.,As William Butler Yeats,nthe poet, once said,,"Love is the crooked thing.",I would add, "Nobody gets out alive." 
 (Laughter) 
 We all have problems.,But in fact, I think the poetnRandall Jarrell really sums it up best.,He said, "The dark, uneasy worldnof family life --,where the greatest can fail,nand the humblest succeed." 
 But I will leave you with this:,love and attachment will prevail,,technology cannot change it.,And I will conclude by saying,any understanding of human relationshipsnmust take into account,one the most powerful determinantsnof human behavior:,the unquenchable,,adaptable,and primordial human drive to love. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Kelly Stoetzel: Thank younso much for that, Helen.,As you know, there's anothernspeaker here with us,that works in your same field.,She comes at itnfrom a different perspective.,Esther Perel is a psychotherapistnwho works with couples.,You study data,,Esther studies the storiesnthe couples tell her,when they come to her for help.,Let's have her join us on the stage.,Esther? 
 (Applause) 
 So Esther,,when you were watching Helen's talk,,was there any part of it,that resonated with younthrough the lens of your own work,that you'd like to comment on? 
 Esther Perel: It's interesting,nbecause on the one hand,,the need for lovenis ubiquitous and universal.,But the way we love --,the meaning we make out of it --,the rules that governnour relationships, I think,,are changing fundamentally. 
 We come from a model that, until now,,was primarily regulatednaround duty and obligation,,the needs of the collective and loyalty.,And we have shifted it,to a model of free choicenand individual rights,,and self-fulfillment and happiness.,And so, that wasnthe first thing I thought,,that the need doesn't change,,but the context and the waynwe regulate these relationships,changes a lot. 
 On the paradox of choice --,you know, on the one handnwe relish the novelty,and the playfulness, I think,,to be able to have so many options.,And at the same time,,as you talk about this cognitive overload,,I see many, many people who ...,who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt,that comes with this massa of choice,,creating a case of "FOMO",and then leading us --,FOMO, fear of missed opportunity,nor fear of missing out --,it's like, "How do I knownI have found 'the one' --,the right one?" 
 So we've created what I callnthis thing of "stable ambiguity.",Stable ambiguity is whennyou are too afraid to be alone,but also not really willingnto engage in intimacy-building.,It's a set of tactics that kind of prolongnthe uncertainty of a relationship,but also the uncertainty of the breakup.,So, here on the internetnyou have three major ones.,One is icing and simmering,,which are great stalling tactics,that offer a kind of holding pattern,that emphasizes the undefinednnature of a relationship,but at the same time gives younenough of a comforting consistency,and enough freedomnof the undefined boundaries. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah? 
 And then comes ghosting.,And ghosting is, basically,,you disappear from this massanof texts on the spot,,and you don't have to deal withnthe pain that you inflict on another,,because you're making itninvisible even to yourself. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah? 
 So I was thinking -- these words came upnfor me as I was listening to you,,like how a vocabularynalso creates a reality,,and at the same time,,that's my question to you:,Do you think when the context changes,,it still means that the naturenof love remains the same? 
 You study the brain and I studynpeople's relationships and stories,,so I think it's everything you say, plus.,But I don't always know the degreento which a changing context ...,Does it at some point begin to change --,If the meaning changes,ndoes it change the need,,or is the need clearnof the entire context? 
 HF: Wow! Well -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Well, I've got three points here, right?,First of all, to your first one:,there's no question that we've changed,nthat we now want a person to love,,and for thousands of years,nwe had to marry the right person,from the right backgroundnand right kin connection.,And in fact, in my studiesnof 5,000 people every year,,I ask them, "What are you looking for?",And every single year,nover 97 percent say -- 
 EP: The list grows -- 
 HF: Well, no.,The basic thing isnover 97 percent of people,want somebody that respects them,,somebody they can trust and confide in,,somebody who makes them laugh,,somebody who makes enough time for them,and somebody who they findnphysically attractive.,That never changes.,And there's certainly -- you know,nthere's two parts -- 
 EP: But you know how I call that?,That's not what people used to say -- 
 HF: That's exactly right. 
 EP: They said they wanted somebodynwith whom they have companionship,,economic support, children.,We went from a production economynto a service economy. 
 (Laughter) 
 We did it in the larger culture,nand we're doing it in marriage. 
 HF: Right, no question about it.,But it's interesting, the millennialsnactually want to be very good parents,,whereas the generation above themnwants to have a very fine marriage,but is not as focusednon being a good parent.,You see all of these nuances. 
 There's two basic parts of personality:,there's your culture -- everything youngrew up to do and believe and say --,and there's your temperament.,Basically, what I've been talkingnabout is your temperament.,And that temperament is certainlyngoing to change with changing times,and changing beliefs. 
 And in terms of the paradox of choice,,there's no question about itnthat this is a pickle.,There were millions of yearsnwhere you found that sweet boy,at the other side of the water hole,,and you went for it. 
 EP: Yes, but you -- 
 HF: I do want to say one more thing.,The bottom line is, in huntingnand gathering societies,,they tended to have two or three partnersnduring the course of their lives.,They weren't square!,And I'm not suggesting that we do,,but the bottom line is,nwe've always had alternatives.,Mankind is always --,in fact, the brain is well-builtnto what we call "equilibrate,",to try and decide:,Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay?,What are the opportunities here?,How do I handle this there?,And so I think we're seeingnanother play-out of that now. 
 KS: Well, thank you both so much.,I think you're going to havena million dinner partners for tonight! 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, thank you.Hi. 
 Thank you. 
 [Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive.,The live audience was askednto applaud ASL-style, in silence.] 
 So, five years ago, this was me.,I was a PhD student at Harvard,,and I loved to travel.,I had just gotten engagednto marry the love of my life.,I was 28, and like so many of usnwhen we are in good health,,I felt like I was invincible. 
 Then one day I hadna fever of 104.7 degrees.,I probably should have gone to the doctor,,but I'd never really been sick in my life,,and I knew that usually,nif you have a virus,,you stay home and you makensome chicken soup,,and in a few days,neverything will be fine.,But this time it wasn't fine.,After the fever broke,,for three weeks I was so dizzy,nI couldn't leave my house.,I would walk straight into door frames.,I had to hug the wallsnjust to make it to the bathroom.,That spring I got infectionnafter infection,,and every time I went to the doctor,,he said there was absolutelynnothing wrong.,He had his laboratory tests,,which always came back normal.,All I had were my symptoms,,which I could describe,,but no one else can see.,I know it sounds silly,,but you have to find a waynto explain things like this to yourself,,and so I thought maybe I was just aging.,Maybe this is what it's likento be on the other side of 25. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then the neurological symptoms started.,Sometimes I would find that I couldn'tndraw the right side of a circle.,Other times I wouldn't be ablento speak or move at all.,I saw every kind of specialist:,infectious disease doctors,ndermatologists, endocrinologists,,cardiologists.,I even saw a psychiatrist.,My psychiatrist said,n"It's clear you're really sick,,but not with anything psychiatric.,I hope they can find outnwhat's wrong with you." 
 The next day, my neurologistndiagnosed me with conversion disorder.,He told me that everything --,the fevers, the sore throats,nthe sinus infection,,all of the gastrointestinal,nneurological and cardiac symptoms --,were being causednby some distant emotional trauma,that I could not remember.,The symptoms were real, he said,,but they had no biological cause. 
 I was training to be a social scientist.,I had studied statistics,nprobability theory,,mathematical modeling,nexperimental design.,I felt like I couldn't just rejectnmy neurologist's diagnosis.,It didn't feel true,,but I knew from my trainingnthat the truth is often counterintuitive,,so easily obscurednby what we want to believe.,So I had to consider the possibilitynthat he was right. 
 That day, I ran a small experiment.,I walked back the two milesnfrom my neurologist's office to my house,,my legs wrapped in this strange,nalmost electric kind of pain.,I meditated on that pain,,contemplating how my mindncould have possibly generated all this.,As soon as I walked through the door,,I collapsed.,My brain and my spinal cord were burning.,My neck was so stiffnI couldn't touch my chin to my chest,,and the slightest sound --,the rustling of the sheets,,my husband walking barefootnin the next room --,could cause excruciating pain.,I would spend mostnof the next two years in bed. 
 How could my doctornhave gotten it so wrong?,I thought I had a rare disease,,something doctors had never seen.,And then I went online,and found thousands of peoplenall over the world,living with the same symptoms,,similarly isolated,,similarly disbelieved.,Some could still work,,but had to spend their eveningsnand weekends in bed,,just so they could show upnthe next Monday.,On the other end of the spectrum,,some were so sick,they had to live in complete darkness,,unable to toleratenthe sound of a human voice,or the touch of a loved one. 
 I was diagnosednwith myalgic encephalomyelitis.,You've probably heard it calledn"chronic fatigue syndrome.",For decades, that's a name,that's meant that this,has been the dominant image,of a disease that can benas serious as this.,The key symptom we all share,is that whenever we exert ourselves --nphysically, mentally --,we pay and we pay hard.,If my husband goes for a run,nhe might be sore for a couple of days.,If I try to walk half a block,nI might be bedridden for a week.,It is a perfect custom prison.,I know ballet dancers who can't dance,,accountants who can't add,,medical students who never became doctors.,It doesn't matter what you once were;,you can't do it anymore.,It's been four years,,and I've still never been as well as I was,the minute before I walked homenfrom my neurologist's office. 
 It's estimated that about 15 to 30 millionnpeople around the world,have this disease.,In the US, where I'm from,nit's about one million people.,That makes it roughly twice as commonnas multiple sclerosis.,Patients can live for decadesnwith the physical function,of someone with congestive heart failure.,Twenty-five percent of usnare homebound or bedridden,,and 75 to 85 percent of usncan't even work part-time.,Yet doctors do not treat us,and science does not study us.,How could a disease this commonnand this devastating,have been forgotten by medicine? 
 When my doctor diagnosed menwith conversion disorder,,he was invoking a lineagenof ideas about women's bodies,that are over 2,500 years old.,The Roman physician Galen thought,that hysteria was causednby sexual deprivation,in particularly passionate women.,The Greeks thought the uterusnwould literally dry up,and wander around the bodynin search of moisture,,pressing on internal organs --,yes --,causing symptoms from extreme emotions,to dizziness and paralysis.,The cure was marriage and motherhood. 
 These ideas went largely unchangednfor several millennia until the 1880s,,when neurologists tried to modernizenthe theory of hysteria.,Sigmund Freud developed a theory,that the unconscious mindncould produce physical symptoms,when dealing with memories or emotions,too painful for the consciousnmind to handle.,It converted these emotionsninto physical symptoms.,This meant that menncould now get hysteria,,but of course women were stillnthe most susceptible. 
 When I began investigatingnthe history of my own disease,,I was amazed to find how deepnthese ideas still run.,In 1934,,198 doctors, nurses and staffnat the Los Angeles County General Hospital,became seriously ill.,They had muscle weakness, stiffnessnin the neck and back, fevers --,all of the same symptomsnI had when I first got diagnosed.,Doctors thoughtnit was a new form of polio.,Since then, there have been morenthan 70 outbreaks documented,around the world,,of a strikingly similarnpost-infectious disease.,All of these outbreaks have tendednto disproportionately affect women,,and in time, when doctors failed to findnthe one cause of the disease,,they thought that these outbreaksnwere mass hysteria. 
 Why has this idea had such staying power?,I do think it has to do with sexism,,but I also think that fundamentally,ndoctors want to help.,They want to know the answer,,and this category allows doctors to treatnwhat would otherwise be untreatable,,to explain illnessesnthat have no explanation.,The problem is that thisncan cause real harm.,In the 1950s, a psychiatristnnamed Eliot Slater,studied a cohort of 85 patientsnwho had been diagnosed with hysteria.,Nine years later, 12 of them were deadnand 30 had become disabled.,Many had undiagnosed conditionsnlike multiple sclerosis,,epilepsy, brain tumors.,In 1980, hysteria was officiallynrenamed "conversion disorder.",When my neurologist gave menthat diagnosis in 2012,,he was echoing Freud's words verbatim,,and even today,,women are 2 to 10 times more likelynto receive that diagnosis. 
 The problem with the theory of hysterianor psychogenic illness,is that it can never be proven.,It is by definitionnthe absence of evidence,,and in the case of ME,,psychological explanationsnhave held back biological research.,All around the world, ME is onenof the least funded diseases.,In the US, we spend each yearnroughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient,,250 dollars per MS patient,and just 5 dollars per yearnper ME patient.,This was not just lightning.,I was not just unlucky.,The ignorance surrounding my diseasenhas been a choice,,a choice made by the institutionsnthat were supposed to protect us. 
 We don't know why MEnsometimes runs in families,,why you can get itnafter almost any infection,,from enterovirusesnto Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever,,or why it affects womennat two to three times the rate of men.,This issue is much biggernthan just my disease.,When I first got sick,,old friends were reaching out to me.,I soon found myself a partnof a cohort of women in their late 20s,whose bodies were falling apart.,What was striking was just hownmuch trouble we were having,being taken seriously. 
 I learned of one woman with scleroderma,,an autoimmune connective tissue disease,,who was told for yearsnthat it was all in her head.,Between the time of onset and diagnosis,,her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged,,she will never be able to eat again.,Another woman with ovarian cancer,,who for years was toldnthat it was just early menopause.,A friend from college,,whose brain tumor was misdiagnosednfor years as anxiety. 
 Here's why this worries me:,since the 1950s, rates of manynautoimmune diseases,have doubled to tripled.,Forty-five percent of patientsnwho are eventually diagnosed,with a recognized autoimmune disease,are initially told they're hypochondriacs.,Like the hysteria of old,nthis has everything to do with gender,and with whose stories we believe.,Seventy-five percentnof autoimmune disease patients are women,,and in some diseases,nit's as high as 90 percent.,Even though these diseasesndisproportionately affect women,,they are not women's diseases.,ME affects childrennand ME affects millions of men.,And as one patient told me,,we get it coming and going --,if you're a woman, you're toldnyou're exaggerating your symptoms,,but if you're a guy, you're toldnto be strong, to buck up.,And men may even havena more difficult time getting diagnosed. 
 My brain is not what it used to be. 
 Here's the good part:,despite everything, I still have hope.,So many diseases were oncenthought of as psychological,until science uncoveredntheir biological mechanisms.,Patients with epilepsyncould be forcibly institutionalized,until the EEG was able to measurenabnormal electrical activity in the brain.,Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosednas hysterical paralysis,until the CAT scan and the MRIndiscovered brain lesions.,And recently, we used to think,that stomach ulcersnwere just caused by stress,,until we discoverednthat H. pylori was the culprit.,ME has never benefitednfrom the kind of science,that other diseases have had,,but that's starting to change.,In Germany, scientists are startingnto find evidence of autoimmunity,,and in Japan, of brain inflammation.,In the US, scientists at Stanfordnare finding abnormalities,in energy metabolism,that are 16 standard deviationsnaway from normal.,And in Norway, researchersnare running a phase-3 clinical trial,on a cancer drug that in some patientsncauses complete remission. 
 What also gives me hope,is the resilience of patients.,Online we came together,,and we shared our stories.,We devoured what research there was.,We experimented on ourselves.,We became our own scientistsnand our own doctors,because we had to be.,And slowly I added five percent here,nfive percent there,,until eventually, on a good day,,I was able to leave my home.,I still had to make ridiculous choices:,Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes,nor will I wash my hair today?,But it gave me hopenthat I could be treated.,I had a sick body; that was all.,And with the right kind of help,nmaybe one day I could get better. 
 I came together with patientsnaround the world,,and we started to fight.,We have filled the voidnwith something wonderful,,but it is not enough.,I still don't know if I will evernbe able to run again,,or walk at any distance,,or do any of those kinetic thingsnthat I now only get to do in my dreams.,But I am so gratefulnfor how far I have come.,Progress is slow,,and it is up,and it is down,,but I am getting a little better each day. 
 I remember what it was likenwhen I was stuck in that bedroom,,when it had been monthsnsince I had seen the sun.,I thought that I would die there.,But here I am today,,with you,,and that is a miracle. 
 I don't know what would have happenednhad I not been one of the lucky ones,,had I gotten sick before the internet,,had I not found my community.,I probably would have alreadyntaken my own life,,as so many others have done.,How many lives couldnwe have saved, decades ago,,if we had asked the right questions?,How many lives could we save today,if we decide to make a real start? 
 Even once the true causenof my disease is discovered,,if we don't changenour institutions and our culture,,we will do this again to another disease.,Living with this illness has taught me,that science and medicinenare profoundly human endeavors.,Doctors, scientists and policy makers,are not immune to the same biases,that affect all of us. 
 We need to think in more nuanced waysnabout women's health.,Our immune systems are just as muchna battleground for equality,as the rest of our bodies.,We need to listen to patients' stories,,and we need to be willingnto say, "I don't know.","I don't know" is a beautiful thing.,"I don't know" is where discovery starts.,And if we can do that,,if we can approach the great vastnessnof all that we do not know,,and then, rather than fear uncertainty,,maybe we can greet itnwith a sense of wonder. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you.I once had this nightmare:,I'm standing in the middlenof a deserted field full of land mines.,In real life, I love to hike,,but every time I want to go on a hike,nit makes me nervous.,I have this thought in the back of my mind,that I might lose a limb. 
 This underlying fear started 10 years ago,,after I met Mohammed,na cluster bomb survivor,of the summer 2006nIsrael-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.,Mohammed, like so manynother survivors all around the world,,had to live through the horrifyingnrepercussions of cluster munitions,on a daily basis. 
 When the one-month conflictnstarted in Lebanon,,I was still workingnat Agence France-Presse in Paris.,I remember how I was glued to the screens,,anxiously following the news.,I wanted to reassure myself,that the falling bombsnmissed my parents' home.,When I arrived in Beirutnon assignment to cover that war,,I was relieved to be unitednwith my family,,after they had finally managednto escape southern Lebanon.,The day the war was over,,I remember seeing this image --,one of blocked roads,,of displaced people eagerly rushingnsouth, back to their homes,,regardless of what they would find. 
 An estimated four millionncluster submunitions,were spread in Lebanon duringnthe 34-day conflict.,Mohammed lost both legsnduring the last week of the conflict.,The fact that he lives a five-minutendrive from my parents' home,made it easier to follownhim through the years.,It was now almost 10 yearsnsince we first met.,I saw the young boy,who had to endurenphysical and emotional trauma.,I saw the teenager who triednto offer his friends tattoos,,in return for a set fee of five dollars.,And I know the young, jobless mannwho spends hours surfing the Internet,trying to meet a girl who mightnbecome his girlfriend.,His fate and the effectsnof losing his legs,are now his daily reality. 
 Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed,have to deal with so many detailsnthat never occur to us.,Who would have imagined,that so many daily tasks we donor take for granted,,such as going to the beach or evennpicking up something from the floor,,would become sourcesnof stress and anxiety?,Well, that's what eventuallynbecame of Mohammed,,due to his inflexible prosthetic legs. 
 Ten years ago, I had no cluenwhat a cluster bomb was,,nor its horrifying implications.,I learned that this indiscriminatenweapon was used,in so many parts of the world,and continues to kill on a regular basis,,without distinguishingnbetween a military target,or a child.,I naively asked myself,,"But seriously, who made those weapons?,And what for?" 
 Let me explain to younwhat a cluster bomb is.,It's a large canisternfilled with bomblets.,When it's dropped from the air,,it opens up in midair to releasenhundreds of bomblets.,They scatter around wide areas,and on impact,,many fail to explode.,Those unexploded ones end upnjust like landmines --,sitting on the ground,,waiting for their next target.,If someone steps on them by accident,or picks them up,,they can explode.,These weapons are extremely unpredictable,,which makes the threat even bigger.,One day, a farmer can worknhis land without a problem.,The next day, he can make firenand burn some branches,,and the submunitions close byncould be set off because of the heat.,The problem is children mistakenthose bomblets for toys,,because they can look likenbouncy balls or soda cans. 
 Being a documentary photographer,,I decided to go back to Lebanonna few months after the conflict ended,to meet cluster bomb survivors.,And I met a few --,Hussein and Rasha,,who both lost a leg to submunitions.,Their stories are similar to so manynother kids' stories across the world,and are a testimonynto the horrifying implications,of the continuous use of such weapons. 
 That's when I met Mohammed,nin January 2007.,He was 11 years old,,and I met him exactly four monthsnafter his accident.,When I first saw him,,he was going through painful physiotherapy,to recover from his fresh wounds.,Still in shock at such a young age,,Mohammed was strugglingnto get used to his new body.,He would even wake up sometimesnat night wanting to scratch his lost feet.,What drew me closer to his storynwas my instant realization,of the difficulties Mohammednwas likely to face in the future --,that what he has been sufferingnwhile adjusting to his injury,at the age of 11,,would increase manyfold. 
 Even before his disability,,Mohammed's life wasn't easy.,He was born in the Rashidieh Campnfor Palestinian refugees,,and this is where he still lives.,Lebanon holds some 400,000nPalestinian refugees,,and they suffer from discriminatory laws.,They're not allowed to worknin the public sector,or practice certain professions,and are denied the right to own property.,This is one of the reasons,why Mohammed doesn't reallynregret dropping out of school,right after his injury.,He said, "What's the pointnof a university degree,when I can't find a job to start with?" 
 Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circlenof impact on communities,,and not only the lives of their victims.,Many who get injured by this weaponndrop out of school,,can't find jobs or even lose their jobs,,therefore losing the abilitynto provide for their families.,This is not to mentionnthe continuous physical pain,and the experience of feeling isolated.,These weapons affectnthe poorest of the poor.,The high medical costnis a burden to the families.,They end up relyingnon humanitarian agencies,,which is insufficient and unsustainable,,especially when injuries requirenlifelong support to the injured.,Ten years after Mohammed's injury,,he is still unable to affordnproper prosthetic legs.,He's very cautious with his steps,,as a couple of falls over the years,brought him embarrassmentnamong his friends.,He joked that since he doesn't have legs,,some days he tries to walk on his hands. 
 One of the worst yet invisiblenimpacts of the weapon,is the psychological scars it leaves.,In one of Mohammed'snearly medical reports,,he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.,He suffered from anxiety,npoor appetite, sleep disturbance,and showed signs of anger.,The reality is Mohammed never receivednproper help to fully recover.,His current obsessionnis to leave Lebanon at any cost --,even if it meant embarkingnon a hazardous journey,along with refugees drifting towardsnEurope today through the Mediterranean.,Knowing how risky such a journey would be,,he said, "If I were to die on the way,,it doesn't matter.",To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway. 
 Cluster bombs are a world problem,,as this munition keeps destroyingnand hurting whole communities,for generations to come.,In an online interview with the directornof the Mines Advisory Group,,Jamie Franklin,,he said,,"The US forces dropped over two millionntons of munitions over Laos.,If they couldn't findntheir targets in Vietnam,,there were free-drop areas in Laosnwhere planes would drop their loads,before going back to base,,because it's dangerous to landnwith loaded planes.",According to the InternationalnCommittee of the Red Cross,,in Laos alone -- one of the poorestncountries in the world --,nine to 27 million unexplodednsubmunitions remain.,Some 11,000 people have been killednor injured since 1973.,This lethal weapon has been usednby over 20 states during armed conflicts,in over 35 countries,,such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan. 
 So far, 119 states have joinednan international treaty,banning cluster bombs,,which is officially callednthe Convention on Cluster Munitions.,But some of the biggest producersnof cluster munitions --,namely, the United States,nRussia and China --,remain outside of this lifesaving treaty,and continue to produce them,,reserve the right to producenthem in the future,,keep those harmful weaponsnin their stockpiles,and even possibly use them in the future. 
 Cluster bombs have reportedlynbeen used most recently,in the ongoing conflictsnin Yemen and Syria.,According to researchnon the worldwide investments,in cluster munitions producers,by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO,,financial institutions investednbillions of US dollars,into companies that makencluster munitions.,The majority of these institutionsnare based in countries,that have not yet signednthe Convention on Cluster Munitions. 
 Getting back to Mohammed,,one of the few jobs he was ablento find was picking lemons.,When I ask him if it's safento work in the field he said,,"I'm not sure.",Research shows that cluster munitionsnoften contaminate areas,where agriculture is the mainnsource of income.,According to HandicapnInternational's research,,98 percent of those killed or injurednby cluster munitions are civilians.,Eighty-four percentnof casualties are males.,In countries wherenthese people have no choice,but to work in those fields,,they simply do it,and risk it. 
 Mohammed is the only malento three sisters.,Culturally, he's expectednto provide for his family,,but he simply can't.,He tried to have so many different jobs,,but he couldn't keep anyndue to his physical disability,and the less-than-friendly environmentnto people with disabilities,,to say the least.,It hurts him a lot when he goesnout looking for a job,,and he's turned away,with a small amount of moneynpaid to him out of pity.,He said, "I'm not here to beg for money,,I just want to earn it." 
 Mohammed today is 21 years old.,He's illiterate,,and he communicates with voice messages.,Here is one of his messages. 
 (Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic) 
 Laura Boushnak:nHe said, "My dream is to run,,and I'm pretty sure once I start running,,I would never stop." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The narrative of a rising Africanis being challenged. 
 About 10 years ago,nI spoke about an Africa,,an Africa of hope and opportunity,,an Africa of entrepreneurs,,an Africa very different from the Africanthat you normally hear about,of death, poverty and disease.,And that what I spoke about,,became part of what is known nownas the narrative of the rising Africa. 
 I want to tell you two storiesnabout this rising Africa.,The first has to do with Rwanda,,a country that has gonenthrough many trials and tribulations.,And Rwanda has decided to becomenthe technology hub, or a technology hub,on the continent.,It's a country with mountainousnand hilly terrain,,a little bit like here,,so it's very difficultnto deliver services to people.,So what has Rwanda said?,In order to save lives,nit's going to try using drones,to deliver lifesaving drugs,nvaccines and blood,to people in hard-to-reach places,in partnership withna company called Zipline,,with UPS, and also with the Gavi,na global vaccine alliance.,In doing this, it will save lives.,This is part of the type of innovationnwe want to see in the rising Africa. 
 The second story has to do with something,that I'm sure most of younhave seen or will remember.,Very often, countries in Africansuffer drought and floods,,and it's getting more frequentnbecause of climate change effects.,When this happens, they normally waitnfor international appeals to raise money.,You see pictures of childrennwith flies on their faces,,carcasses of dead animals and so on.,Now these countries,n32 countries, came together,under the auspices of the African Union,and decided to form an organizationncalled the African Risk Capacity.,What does it do?,It's a weather-based insurance agency,,and what these countries donis to pay insurance each year,,about 3 million dollars a yearnof their own resources,,so that in the event they havena difficult drought situation or flood,,this money will be paid out to them,,which they can then usento take care of their populations,,instead of waiting for aid to come.,The African Risk Capacitynlast year paid 26 million dollars,to Mauritania, Senegal and Niger.,This enabled them to take carenof 1.3 million people affected by drought.,They were able to restore livelihoods,,buy fodder for cattle,nfeed children in school,and in short keep the populations homeninstead of migrating out of the area. 
 So these are the kinds of stories,of an Africa readynto take responsibility for itself,,and to look for solutionsnfor its own problems.,But that narrative is being challenged now,because the continent has notnbeen doing well in the last two years.,It had been growingnat five percent per annum,for the last one and a half decades,,but this year's forecastnwas three percent. Why?,In an uncertain global environment,ncommodity prices have fallen.,Many of the economiesnare still commodity driven,,and therefore theirnperformance has slipped.,And now the issue of Brexitndoesn't make it any easier.,I never knew that the Brexit could happen,and that it could be one of the thingsnthat would cause global uncertainty,such as we have. 
 So now we've got this situation,,and I think it's time to take stock,and to say what were the thingsnthat the African countries did right?,What did they do wrong?,How do we build on all of thisnand learn lessons,so that we can keep Africa rising? 
 So let me talk about six thingsnthat I think we did right.,The first is managingnour economies better.,The '80s and '90s were the lost decades,nwhen Africa was not doing well,,and some of you will remembernan "Economist" cover,that said, "The Lost Continent.",But in the 2000s, policymakers learned,that they needed to managenthe macroeconomic environment better,,to ensure stability,,keep inflation low in single digits,,keep their fiscal deficits low,nbelow three percent of GDP,,give investors, both domestic and foreign,,some stability so they'll have confidencento invest in these economies.,So that was number one. 
 Two, debt.,In 1994, the debt-to-GDP rationof African countries was 130 percent,,and they didn't have fiscal space.,They couldn't use their resourcesnto invest in their development,because they were paying debt.,There may be some of you in this roomnwho worked to support African countries,to get debt relief.,So private creditors, multilateralsnand bilaterals came together,and decided to do the Highly IndebtednPoor Countries Initiative,and give debt relief.,So this debt relief in 2005,made the debt-to-GDP rationfall down to about 30 percent,,and there was enough resourcesnto try and reinvest. 
 The third thing wasnloss-making enterprises.,Governments were involved in business,which they had no business being in.,And they were running businesses,nthey were making losses.,So some of these enterprisesnwere restructured,,commercialized, privatized or closed,,and they becamenless of a burden on government. 
 The fourth thingnwas a very interesting thing.,The telecoms revolution came,,and African countries jumped on it.,In 2000, we had 11 million phone lines.,Today, we have about 687 millionnmobile lines on the continent.,And this has enabled us,to go, move forwardnwith some mobile technology,where Africa is actually leading.,In Kenya, the developmentnof mobile money --,M-Pesa, which all of younhave heard about --,it took some time for the worldnto notice that Africa was ahead,in this particular technology.,And this mobile moneynis also providing a platform,for access to alternative energy.,You know, people who can now pay for solar,the same way they paynfor cards for their telephone.,So this was a very good development,nsomething that went right. 
 We also invested morenin education and health, not enough,,but there were some improvements.,250 million children were immunizednin the last one and a half decades. 
 The other thing wasnthat conflicts decreased.,There were many conflictsnon the continent.,Many of you are aware of that.,But they came down, and our leadersneven managed to dampen some coups.,New types of conflicts have emerged,nand I'll refer to those later. 
 So based on all this, there's alsonsome differentiation on the continent,that I want you to know about,,because even asnthe doom and gloom is here,,there are some countries --nCôte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ethiopia,,Tanzania and Senegal are performingnrelatively well at the moment. 
 But what did we do wrong?,Let me mention eight things.,You have to havenmore things wrong than right. 
 (Laughter) 
 So there are eight things we did wrong.,The first was that even though we grew,nwe didn't create enough jobs.,We didn't create jobs for our youth.,Youth unemployment on the continentnis about 15 percent,,and underemployment is a serious problem. 
 The second thing that we did is thatnthe quality of growth was not good enough.,Even those jobs we creatednwere low-productivity jobs,,so we moved peoplenfrom low-productivity agriculture,to low-productivity commercenand working in the informal sector,in the urban areas. 
 The third thingnis that inequality increased.,So we created more billionaires.,50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollars,own more wealth than the bottomn75 million people on the continent. 
 Poverty,,the proportion of people in poverty --nthat's the fourth thing -- did decrease,,but the absolute numbers did notnbecause of population growth.,And population growth is something,that we don't have enoughnof a dialogue about on the continent.,And I think we will neednto get a handle on it,,particularly how we educate girls.,That is the road to really workingnon this particular issue. 
 The fifth thing is that we didn't investnenough in infrastructure.,We had investment from the Chinese.,That helped some countries,nbut it's not enough.,The consumption of electricitynin Africa on the continent,in Sub-Saharan Africanis equivalent to Spain.,The total consumptionnis equivalent to that of Spain.,So many people are living in the dark,,and as the President of the AfricannDevelopment Bank said recently,,Africa cannot develop in the dark. 
 The other thing we have not done,is that our economiesnretain the same structure,that we've had for decades.,So even though we've been growing,,the structure of the economiesnhas not changed very much.,We are still exporting commodities,,and exporting commodities is what?nIt's exporting jobs.,Our manufacturing value-addednis only 11 percent.,We are not creating enoughndecent manufacturing jobs for our youth,,and trade among ourselves is low.,Only about 12 percent of our tradenis among ourselves.,So that's another serious problem. 
 Then governance.,Governance is a serious issue.,We have weak institutions,,and sometimes nonexistent institutions,nand I think this gives way for corruption.,Corruption is an issue that we have notnyet gotten a good enough handle on,,and we have to fight tooth and nail,,that and increased transparencynin the way we manage our economies,and the way we manage our finances. 
 We also need to be wary of new conflicts,,new types of conflicts,,such as we have with Boko Haramnin my country, Nigeria,,and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.,We need to partnernwith international partners,,developed countries,nto fight this together.,Otherwise, we create a new reality,which is not the typenwe want for a rising Africa. 
 And finally, the issue of education.,Our education systemsnin many countries are broken.,We are not creating the types of skillsnneeded for the future.,So we have to find a waynto educate better.,So those are the thingsnthat we are not doing right. 
 Now, where do we go from there?,I believe that the way forwardnis to learn to manage success.,Very often, when people succeednor countries succeed,,they forget what made them succeed.,Learning what you're successful at,,managing it and keeping itnis vital for us.,So all those things I said we did right,,we have to learn to do it right again,nkeep doing it right.,Managing the economy whilencreating stability is vital,,getting prices right,nand policy consistency.,Very often, we are not consistent.,One regime goes out, another comes in,and they throw away even the functioningnpolicies that were there before.,What does this do?,It creates uncertaintynfor people, for households,,uncertainties for business.,They don't know whether and how to invest. 
 Debt: we must managenthe success we had in reducing our debt,,but now countriesnare back to borrowing again,,and we see our debt-to-GDP rationbeginning to creep up,,and in certain countries,,debt is becoming a problem,nso we have to avoid that.,So managing success. 
 The next thingnis focusing with a laser beam,on those things we did not do well.,First and foremost is infrastructure.,Yes, most countries now recognizenthey have to invest in this,,and they are trying to donthe best they can to do that.,We must.,The most important thing is power.,You cannot develop in the dark. 
 And then governance and corruption:,we have to fight.,We have to make our countries transparent.,And above all, we have tonengage our young people.,We have genius in our young people.,I see it every day.,It's what makes me wake upnin the morning and feel ready to go.,We have to unleashnthe genius of our young people,,get out of their way,nsupport them to create and innovate,and lead the way.,And I know that they will lead usnin the right direction. 
 And our women, and our girls:,we have to recognizenthat girls and women are a gift.,They have strength,,and we have to unleash that strength,so that they canncontribute to the continent. 
 I strongly believenthat when we do all of these things,,we find that the rising Africa narrative,is not a fluke.,It's a trend.,It's a trend, and if we continue,nif we unleash our youth,,if we unleash our women,,we may step backwards sometimes,,we may even step sideways,,but the trend is clear.,Africa will continue to rise. 
 And I tell you businesspeoplenin the audience,,investment in Africa is not for today,nis not for tomorrow,,it's not a short-term thing,nit's a longer term thing.,But if you are not invested in Africa,,then you will be missing,one of the most importantnemerging opportunities in the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Kelly Stoetzel: So you mentionedncorruption in your talk,,and you're known, well-knownnas a strong anticorruption fighter.,But that's had consequences.,People have fought back,nand your mother was kidnapped.,How have you been handling this?,Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala:nIt's been very difficult.,Thank you for mentioningnthe issue of the kidnap of my mother.,It's a very difficult subject.,But what it meansnis that when you fight corruption,,when you touch the pocketsnof people who are stealing money,,they don't just keep quiet.,They fight back, and the issue for younis when they try to intimidate you,,do you give up, or do you fight on?,Do you find a waynto stay on and fight back?,And the answer that I hadnwith the teams I worked with,is we have to fight on.,We have to create those institutions.,We have to find ways to stop these people,from taking awaynthe heritage of the future.,And so that's what we did.,And even out of government,nwe continued to make that point.,In our countries, nobody,nnobody is going to fight corruption,for us but us.,And therefore,nthat comes with consequences,,and we just have to do the best we can.,But I thank you and thank TEDnfor giving us a voice,to say to those people, you will not win,,and we will not be intimidated. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you so muchnfor your great talk and important work. 
 (Applause)In July of 1911,,a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professornset out from his rainforest camp,with his team.,After climbing a steep hill,and wiping the sweat from his brow,,he described what he saw beneath him.,He saw rising fromnthe dense rainforest foliage,this incredible interlockingnmaze of structures,built of granite,,beautifully put together. 
 What's amazing about this project,is that it was the first fundednby National Geographic,,and it graced the front covernof its magazine in 1912.,This professor used state-of-the-artnphotography equipment,to record the site,,forever changing the face of exploration. 
 The site was Machu Picchu,,discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.,When he saw the site, he asked,,"This is an impossible dream.,What could it be?" 
 So today,,100 years later,,I invite you allnon an incredible journey with me,,a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor. 
 (Cheers) 
 We will do nothing lessnthan use state-of-the-art technology,to map an entire country.,This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,,but we are expanding it to the world,,making archaeological explorationnmore open, inclusive,,and at a scale simplynnot previously possible. 
 This is why I am so excited,to share with you all today,that we will beginnthe 2016 TED Prize platform,in Latin America,,more specifically Peru. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 We will be takingnHiram Bingham's impossible dream,and turning it into an amazing future,that we can all share in together. 
 So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.,It has absolutely stunning jewelry,,like what you can see here.,It has amazing Moche potterynof human figures.,It has the Nazca Lines,and amazing textiles.,So as part of the TED Prize platform,,we are going to partneringnwith some incredible organizations,,first of all with DigitalGlobe,nthe world's largest provider,of high-resolutionncommercial satellite imagery.,They're going to be helping us build out,this amazing crowdsourcingnplatform they have.,Maybe some of you used it,with the MH370 crashnand search for the airplane.,Of course, they'll also be providing usnwith the satellite imagery.,National Geographic will be helping usnwith education and of course exploration.,As well, they'll be providing usnwith rich content for the platform,,including some of the archival imagerynlike you saw at the beginning of this talk,and some of their documentary footage.,We've already begunnto build and plan the platform,,and I'm just so excited. 
 So here's the cool part.,My team, headed up by Chase Childs,,is already beginning to looknat some of the satellite imagery.,Of course, what you can see herenis 0.3-meter data.,This is site called Chan Channin northern Peru.,It dates to 850 AD.,It's a really amazing city,nbut let's zoom in.,This is the type and quality of datanthat you all will get to see.,You can see individual structures,nindividual buildings.,And we've already begunnto find previously unknown sites.,What we can say alreadynis that as part of the platform,,you will all help discovernthousands of previously unknown sites,,like this one here,,and this potentially large one here.,Unfortunately, we've also begunnto uncover large-scale looting at sites,,like what you see here.,So many sites in Peru are threatened,,but the great partnis that all of this data,is going to be sharednwith archaeologists on the front lines,of protecting these sites. 
 So I was just in Peru,nmeeting with their Minister of Culture,as well as UNESCO.,We'll be collaborating closely with them.,Just so you all know,,the site is going to benin both English and Spanish,,which is absolutely essential to make sure,that people in Peru and acrossnLatin America can participate.,Our main project coprincipal investigatornis the gentleman you see here,,Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo,,professor at Catholic University.,As a respected Peruvian archaeologistnand former vice-minister,,Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinatenand share the data with archaeologists,so they can explorenthese sites on the ground.,He also runs this amazingndrone mapping program,,some of the images of whichnyou can see behind me here and here.,And this data will be incorporatedninto the platform,,and also he'll be helping to imagensome of the new sites you help find. 
 Our on-the-ground partner,who will be helping usnwith education, outreach,,as well as site preservation components,,is the SustainablenPreservation Initiative,,led by Dr. Larry Coben.,Some of you may not be aware,that some of the world'snpoorest communities,coexist with some of the world'snmost well-known archaeological sites.,What SPI does,is it helps to empower these communities,,in particular women,,with new economic approachesnand business training.,So it helps to teach themnto create beautiful handicrafts,which are then sold on to tourists.,This empowers the womennto treasure their cultural heritage,and take ownership of it.,I had the opportunity to spend some timenwith 24 of these women,at a well-known archaeological sitencalled Pachacamac, just outside Lima.,These women were unbelievably inspiring,,and what's great is that SPInwill help us transform communities,near some of the sitesnthat you help to discover. 
 Peru is just the beginning.,We're going to be expandingnthis platform to the world,,but already I've gottennthousands of emails,from people all across the world --nprofessors, educators, students,,and other archaeologists --nwho are so excited to help participate.,In fact, they're already suggestingnamazing places for us to help discover,,including Atlantis.,I don't know if we're goingnto be looking for Atlantis,,but you never know. 
 So I'm just so excitednto launch this platform.,It's going to be launched formallynby the end of the year.,And I have to say,,if what my team has already discoverednin the past few weeks are any indication,,what the world discoversnis just going to be beyond imagination.,Make sure to hold on to your alpacas. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The technology likely to haventhe greatest impact,on the next few decades,has arrived.,And it's not social media.,It's not big data.,It's not robotics.,It's not even AI.,You'll be surprised to learn,that it's the underlying technologynof digital currencies like Bitcoin.,It's called the blockchain. Blockchain. 
 Now, it's not the most sonorousnword in the world,,but I believe that this is now,the next generation of the internet,,and that it holds vast promisenfor every business, every society,and for all of you, individually. 
 You know, for the past few decades,nwe've had the internet of information.,And when I send you an emailnor a PowerPoint file or something,,I'm actually not sending you the original,,I'm sending you a copy.,And that's great.,This is democratized information.,But when it comes to assets --,things like money,,financial assets like stocks and bonds,,loyalty points, intellectual property,,music, art, a vote,,carbon credit and other assets --,sending you a copy is a really bad idea.,If I send you 100 dollars,,it's really importantnthat I don't still have the money -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and that I can't send it to you.,This has been callednthe "double-spend" problem,by cryptographers for a long time. 
 So today, we rely entirelynon big intermediaries --,middlemen like banks, government,,big social media companies,ncredit card companies and so on --,to establish trust in our economy.,And these intermediaries performnall the business and transaction logic,of every kind of commerce,,from authentication,nidentification of people,,through to clearing, settlingnand record keeping.,And overall, they do a pretty good job.,But there are growing problems. 
 To begin, they're centralized.,That means they can be hacked,nand increasingly are --,JP Morgan, the US Federal Government,,LinkedIn, Home Depot and others,found that out the hard way.,They exclude billions of peoplenfrom the global economy,,for example, peoplenwho don't have enough money,to have a bank account.,They slow things down.,It can take a second for an emailnto go around the world,,but it can take days or weeks,for money to move throughnthe banking system across a city.,And they take a big piece of the action --,10 to 20 percent just to send moneynto another country.,They capture our data,,and that means we can't monetize it,or use it to better manage our lives.,Our privacy is being undermined.,And the biggest problem is that overall,,they've appropriated the largessenof the digital age asymmetrically:,we have wealth creation,nbut we have growing social inequality. 
 So what if there were not onlynan internet of information,,what if there were an internet of value --,some kind of vast, global,ndistributed ledger,running on millions of computers,and available to everybody.,And where every kind of asset,nfrom money to music,,could be stored, moved, transacted,nexchanged and managed,,all without powerful intermediaries?,What if there werena native medium for value? 
 Well, in 2008, the financialnindustry crashed,and, perhaps propitiously,,an anonymous person or personsnnamed Satoshi Nakamoto,created a paper where he developedna protocol for a digital cash,that used an underlyingncryptocurrency called Bitcoin.,And this cryptocurrency enabled peoplento establish trust and do transactions,without a third party.,And this seemingly simple actnset off a spark,that ignited the world,,that has everyone excitednor terrified or otherwise interested,in many places.,Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin --,Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,,and that should be of interestnto you if you're a speculator.,More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.,It's not a fiat currencyncontrolled by a nation-state.,And that's of greater interest.,But the real pony herenis the underlying technology.,It's called blockchain. 
 So for the first time nownin human history,,people everywhere can trust each other,and transact peer to peer.,And trust is established,nnot by some big institution,,but by collaboration, by cryptography,and by some clever code.,And because trust is nativento the technology,,I call this, "The Trust Protocol." 
 Now, you're probably wondering:nHow does this thing work?,Fair enough.,Assets -- digital assets like moneynto music and everything in between --,are not stored in a central place,,but they're distributednacross a global ledger,,using the highest level of cryptography.,And when a transaction is conducted,,it's posted globally,,across millions and millions of computers.,And out there, around the world,,is a group of people called "miners.",These are not young people,nthey're Bitcoin miners.,They have massive computing powernat their fingertips --,10 to 100 times biggernthan all of Google worldwide.,These miners do a lot of work.,And every 10 minutes,,kind of like the heartbeat of a network,,a block gets created,that has all the transactionsnfrom the previous 10 minutes.,Then the miners get to work,ntrying to solve some tough problems. 
 And they compete:,the first miner to find out the truthnand to validate the block,,is rewarded in digital currency,,in the case of the Bitcoinnblockchain, with Bitcoin.,And then -- this is the key part --,that block is linked to the previous block,and the previous block,to create a chain of blocks.,And every one is time-stamped,,kind of like with a digital waxed seal.,So if I wanted to go and hack a block,and, say, pay you and younwith the same money,,I'd have to hack that block,,plus all the preceding blocks,,the entire history of commercenon that blockchain,,not just on one computernbut across millions of computers,,simultaneously,,all using the highestnlevels of encryption,,in the light of the most powerfulncomputing resource in the world,that's watching me.,Tough to do.,This is infinitely more secure,than the computer systemsnthat we have today.,Blockchain. That's how it works. 
 So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.,There are many.,The Ethereum blockchain was developednby a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.,He's [22] years old,,and this blockchainnhas some extraordinary capabilities.,One of them is that you cannbuild smart contracts.,It's kind of what it sounds like.,It's a contract that self-executes,,and the contract handles the enforcement,nthe management, performance,and payment -- the contract kind of hasna bank account, too, in a sense --,of agreements between people.,And today, on the Ethereum blockchain,,there are projects underwaynto do everything,from create a new replacementnfor the stock market,to create a new model of democracy,,where politiciansnare accountable to citizens. 
 (Applause) 
 So to understand what a radical changenthis is going to bring,,let's look at one industry,nfinancial services.,Recognize this?,Rube Goldberg machine.,It's a ridiculously complicated machinenthat does something really simple,,like crack an egg or shut a door.,Well, it kind of reminds menof the financial services industry,,honestly.,I mean, you tap your cardnin the corner store,,and a bitstream goes throughna dozen companies,,each with their own computer system,,some of them being 1970s mainframes,older than manynof the people in this room,,and three days later, a settlement occurs.,Well, with a blockchainnfinancial industry,,there would be no settlement,,because the payment and the settlementnis the same activity,,it's just a change in the ledger.,So Wall Street and all around the world,,the financial industrynis in a big upheaval about this,,wondering, can we be replaced,,or how do we embracenthis technology for success? 
 Now, why should you care?,Well, let me describe some applications.,Prosperity.,The first era of the internet,,the internet of information,,brought us wealthnbut not shared prosperity,,because social inequality is growing.,And this is at the heartnof all of the anger and extremism,and protectionism and xenophobia and worse,that we're seeing growingnin the world today,,Brexit being the most recent case. 
 So could we develop some new approachesnto this problem of inequality?,Because the only approach todaynis to redistribute wealth,,tax people and spread it around more.,Could we pre-distribute wealth?,Could we change the way that wealthngets created in the first place,by democratizing wealth creation,,engaging more people in the economy,,and then ensuring that they gotnfair compensation?,Let me describe five waysnthat this can be done. 
 Number one:,Did you know that 70 percentnof the people in the world who have land,have a tenuous title to it?,So, you've got a little farm in Honduras,nsome dictator comes to power,,he says, "I know you've got a piecenof paper that says you own your farm,,but the government computernsays my friend owns your farm.",This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,,and this problem exists everywhere.,Hernando de Soto, the greatnLatin American economist,,says this is the number onenissue in the world,in terms of economic mobility,,more important than having a bank account,,because if you don't havena valid title to your land,,you can't borrow against it,,and you can't plan for the future. 
 So today, companiesnare working with governments,to put land titles on a blockchain.,And once it's there, this is immutable.,You can't hack it.,This creates the conditions for prosperity,for potentially billions of people. 
 Secondly:,a lot of writers talk about Uber,and Airbnb and TaskRabbitnand Lyft and so on,as part of the sharing economy.,This is a very powerful idea,,that peers can come togethernand create and share wealth.,My view is that ...,these companies are not really sharing.,In fact, they're successfulnprecisely because they don't share.,They aggregate services together,nand they sell them.,What if, rather than Airbnbnbeing a $25 billion corporation,,there was a distributed applicationnon a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb,,and it was essentially ownednby all of the people,who have a room to rent.,And when someone wants to rent a room,,they go onto the blockchainndatabase and all the criteria,,they sift through, it helpsnthem find the right room,,and then the blockchain helpsnwith the contracting,,it identifies the party,,it handles the payments,just through digital payments --nthey're built into the system.,And it even handles reputation,,because if she rates a roomnas a five-star room,,that room is there,,and it's rated, and it's immutable.,So, the big sharing-economyndisruptors in Silicon Valley,could be disrupted,,and this would be good for prosperity. 
 Number three:,the biggest flow of fundsnfrom the developed world,to the developing world,is not corporate investment,,and it's not even foreign aid.,It's remittances.,This is the global diaspora;,people have left their ancestral lands,,and they're sending money backnto their families at home.,This is 600 billion dollars a year,nand it's growing,,and these people are getting ripped off. 
 Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.,She lives in Toronto,,and every month she goesnto the Western Union office,with some cash,to send her remittancesnto her mom in Manila.,It costs her around 10 percent;,the money takes four to sevenndays to get there;,her mom never knowsnwhen it's going to arrive.,It takes five hoursnout of her week to do this. 
 Six months ago,,Analie Domingo usedna blockchain application called Abra.,And from her mobile device,nshe sent 300 bucks.,It went directlynto her mom's mobile device,without going through an intermediary.,And then her momnlooked at her mobile device --,it's kind of like an Uber interface,nthere's Abra "tellers" moving around.,She clicks on a tellernthat's a five-star teller,,who's seven minutes away.,The guy shows up at the door,ngives her Filipino pesos,,she puts them in her wallet.,The whole thing took minutes,,and it cost her two percent.,This is a big opportunity for prosperity. 
 Number four: the most powerful assetnof the digital age is data.,And data is really a new asset class,,maybe bigger than previous asset classes,,like land under the agrarian economy,,or an industrial plant,,or even money.,And all of you -- we -- create this data.,We create this asset,,and we leave this trailnof digital crumbs behind us,as we go throughout life.,And these crumbs are collectedninto a mirror image of you,,the virtual you.,And the virtual you may knownmore about you than you do,,because you can't remembernwhat you bought a year ago,,or said a year ago,nor your exact location a year ago.,And the virtual you is not owned by you --,that's the big problem. 
 So today, there are companies working,to create an identity in a black box,,the virtual you owned by you.,And this black box moves around with you,as you travel throughout the world,,and it's very, very stingy.,It only gives awaynthe shred of information,that's required to do something.,A lot of transactions,,the seller doesn't even neednto know who you are.,They just need to know that they got paid. 
 And then this avatarnis sweeping up all of this data,and enabling you to monetize it.,And this is a wonderful thing,,because it can also help usnprotect our privacy,,and privacy is the foundationnof a free society.,Let's get this asset that we create,back under our control,,where we can own our own identity,and manage it responsibly. 
 Finally -- 
 (Applause) 
 Finally, number five:,there are a whole numbernof creators of content,who don't receive fair compensation,,because the systemnfor intellectual property is broken.,It was broken by the first eranof the internet.,Take music.,Musicians are left with crumbsnat the end of the whole food chain.,You know, if you were a songwriter,n25 years ago, you wrote a hit song,,it got a million singles,,you could get royaltiesnof around 45,000 dollars.,Today, you're a songwriter,nyou write a hit song,,it gets a million streams,,you don't get 45k,,you get 36 dollars,,enough to buy a nice pizza. 
 So Imogen Heap,,the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,,is now putting musicnon a blockchain ecosystem.,She calls it "Mycelia.",And the music hasna smart contract surrounding it.,And the music protectsnher intellectual property rights.,You want to listen to the song?,It's free, or maybe a few micro-centsnthat flow into a digital account.,You want to put the songnin your movie, that's different,,and the IP rights are all specified.,You want to make a ringtone?nThat's different.,She describes that the songnbecomes a business.,It's out there on this platformnmarketing itself,,protecting the rights of the author,,and because the song has a payment system,in the sense of bank account,,all the money flows back to the artist,,and they control the industry,,rather than these powerful intermediaries.,Now, this is -- 
 (Applause) 
 This is not just songwriters,,it's any creator of content,,like art,,like inventions,,scientific discoveries, journalists.,There are all kinds of peoplenwho don't get fair compensation,,and with blockchains,,they're going to be ablento make it rain on the blockchain.,And that's a wonderful thing. 
 So, these are five opportunities,out of a dozen,to solve one problem, prosperity,,which is one of countless problems,that blockchains are applicable to. 
 Now, technology doesn't createnprosperity, of course -- people do.,But my case to you is that, once again,,the technology genienhas escaped from the bottle,,and it was summonednby an unknown person or persons,at this uncertain time in human history,,and it's giving usnanother kick at the can,,another opportunity to rewritenthe economic power grid,and the old order of things,,and solve some of the world's mostndifficult problems,,if we will it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It's easy to forget that last night,,one billion people went to sleepnwithout access to electricity.,One billion people.,Two and a half billion peoplendid not have access to clean cooking fuels,or clean heating fuels.,Those are the problemsnin the developing world.,And it's easy for us not to be empathetic,with those peoplenwho seem so distanced from us. 
 But even in our own world,nthe developed world,,we see the tension of stagnant economies,impacting the lives of people around us.,We see it in whole pieces of the economy,,where the people involvednhave lost hope about the future,and despair about the present.,We see that in the Brexit vote.,We see that in the Sanders/Trumpncampaigns in my own country.,But even in countries as recentlynturning the corner,towards being in the developed world,,in China,,we see the difficultynthat President Xi has,as he begins to un-employ so many peoplenin his coal and mining industries,who see no future for themselves.,As we as a societynfigure out how to manage,the problems of the developed world,and the problems of the developing world,,we have to look at how we move forward,and manage the environmental impactnof those decisions. 
 We've been working on this problemnfor 25 years, since Rio,,the Kyoto Protocols.,Our most recent move is the Paris treaty,,and the resulting climate agreements,that are being ratifiednby nations around the world.,I think we can be very hopeful,that those agreements,nwhich are bottom-up agreements,,where nations have saidnwhat they think they can do,,are genuine and forthcomingnfor the vast majority of the parties.,The unfortunate thing,is that now, as we looknat the independent analyses,of what those climate treatiesnare liable to yield,,the magnitude of the problemnbefore us becomes clear. 
 This is the United StatesnEnergy Information Agency's assessment,of what will happen if the countriesnimplement the climate commitments,that they've made in Paris,between now and 2040.,It shows basically CO2 emissionsnaround the world,over the next 30 years.,There are three things that you neednto look at and appreciate. 
 One, CO2 emissions are expectednto continue to grow,for the next 30 years.,In order to control climate,,CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero,because it's the cumulative emissionsnthat drive heating on the planet.,This should tell you that we are losingnthe race to fossil fuels. 
 The second thing you should notice,is that the bulk of the growthncomes from the developing countries,,from China, from India,nfrom the rest of the world,,which includes South Africanand Indonesia and Brazil,,as most of these countriesnmove their people,into the lower range of lifestyles,that we literally take for grantednin the developed world. 
 The final thing that you should notice,is that each year,,about 10 gigatons of carbon are gettingnadded to the planet's atmosphere,,and then diffusing into the oceannand into the land.,That's on top of the 550 gigatonsnthat are in place today.,At the end of 30 years,,we will have put 850 gigatonsnof carbon into the air,,and that probably goes a long way,towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increasenin global mean surface temperatures,,locking in ocean acidification,and locking in sea level rise. 
 Now, this is a projection made by men,by the actions of society,,and it's ours to change, not to accept.,But the magnitude of the problemnis something we need to appreciate. 
 Different nations makendifferent energy choices.,It's a functionnof their natural resources.,It's a function of their climate.,It's a function of the development pathnthat they've followed as a society.,It's a function of wherenon the surface of the planet they are.,Are they where it's darkna lot of the time,,or are they at the mid-latitudes?,Many, many, many thingsngo into the choices of countries,,and they each make a different choice. 
 The overwhelming thingnthat we need to appreciate,is the choice that China has made.,China has made the choice,,and will make the choice, to run on coal.,The United States has an alternative.,It can run on natural gas,as a result of the inventionsnof fracking and shale gas,,which we have here.,They provide an alternative.,The OECD Europe has a choice.,It has renewables that it can affordnto deploy in Germany,because it's rich enoughnto afford to do it.,The French and the Britishnshow interest in nuclear power.,Eastern Europe, still very heavilyncommitted to natural gas and to coal,,and with natural gasnthat comes from Russia,,with all of its entanglements.,China has many fewer choices,and a much harder row to hoe. 
 If you look at China, and you ask yourself,why has coal been important to it,,you have to remember what China's done.,China brought people to power,nnot power to people.,It didn't do rural electrification.,It urbanized.,It urbanized by taking low-cost labornand low-cost energy,,creating export industries,that could fund a tremendousnamount of growth. 
 If we look at China's path,,all of us know that prosperity in Chinanhas dramatically increased.,In 1980, 80 percent of China's population,lived below the extreme poverty level,,below the level of havingn$1.90 per person per day.,By the year 2000, only 20 percentnof China's population,lived below the extreme poverty level --,a remarkable feat,,admittedly, with some costsnin civil liberties,that would be tough to acceptnin the Western world.,But the impact of all that wealth,allowed people to getnmassively better nutrition.,It allowed water pipes to be placed.,It allowed sewage pipes to be placed,,dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,,at the cost of some outdoor air pollution. 
 But in 1980, and even today,,the number one killer in Chinanis indoor air pollution,,because people do not have accessnto clean cooking and heating fuels.,In fact, in 2040,,it's still estimatednthat 200 million people in China,will not have accessnto clean cooking fuels.,They have a remarkable path to follow. 
 India also needs to meet the needsnof its own people,,and it's going to do that by burning coal.,When we look at the EIA's projectionsnof coal burning in India,,India will supply nearly four timesnas much of its energy from coal,as it will from renewables.,It's not because they don't knownthe alternatives;,it's because rich countriesncan do what they choose,,poor countries do what they must. 
 So what can we do to stopncoal's emissions in time?,What can we do that changesnthis forecast that's in front of us?,Because it's a forecast that we can changenif we have the will to do it. 
 First of all, we have to thinknabout the magnitude of the problem.,Between now and 2040,,800 to 1,600 new coal plantsnare going to be built around the world.,This week, between one and threenone-gigawatt coal plants,are being turned on around the world.,That's happening regardlessnof what we want,,because the peoplenthat rule their countries,,assessing the interests of their citizens,,have decided it's in the interestnof their citizens to do that.,And that's going to happennunless they have a better alternative.,And every 100 of those plants will use up,between one percent and three percent,of the Earth's climate budget. 
 So every day that you go homenthinking that you should do something,about global warming,,at the end of that week, remember:,somebody fired up a coal plantnthat's going to run for 50 years,and take away your ability to change it. 
 What we've forgotten is somethingnthat Vinod Khosla used to talk about,,a man of Indian ethnicitynbut an American venture capitalist.,And he said, back in the early 2000s,,that if you needed to getnChina and India off of fossil fuels,,you had to create a technologynthat passed the "Chindia test,","Chindia" being the appendingnof the two words.,It had to be first of all viable,,meaning that technically, they couldnimplement it in their country,,and that it would be acceptednby the people in the country. 
 Two, it had to be a technologynthat was scalable,,that it could deliver the same benefits,on the same timetable as fossil fuels,,so that they can enjoy the kind of life,nagain, that we take for granted. 
 And third, it had to be cost-effective,without subsidy or without mandate.,It had to stand on its own two feet;,it could not be maintainednfor that many people,if in fact, those countriesnhad to go begging,or had some foreign country say,n"I won't trade with you,",in order to getnthe technology shift to occur. 
 If you look at the Chindia test,,we simply have not come upnwith alternatives that meet that test.,That's what the EIA forecast tells us.,China's building 800 gigawatts of coal,,400 gigawatts of hydro,,about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,,and on an energy-equivalent basis,nadjusting for intermittency,,about 100 gigawatts of renewables.,800 gigawatts of coal.,They're doing that, knowing the costsnbetter than any other country,,knowing the need betternthan any other country.,But that's what they're aiming for in 2040,unless we give them a better choice.,To give them a better choice,,it's going to have to meetnthe Chindia test. 
 If you look at all the alternativesnthat are out there,,there are really twonthat come near to meeting it.,First is this area of new nuclearnthat I'll talk about in just a second.,It's a new generation of nuclear plantsnthat are on the drawing boards,around the world,,and the people who arendeveloping these say,we can get themnin position to demo by 2025,and to scale by 2030,nif you will just let us.,The second alternativenthat could be there in time,is utility-scale solarnbacked up with natural gas,,which we can use today,,versus the batteriesnwhich are still under development. 
 So what's holding new nuclear back?,Outdated regulationsnand yesterday's mindsets.,We have not used our latestnscientific thinking on radiological health,to think how we communicatenwith the public,and govern the testingnof new nuclear reactors.,We have new scientific knowledgenthat we need to use,in order to improve the waynwe regulate nuclear industry. 
 The second thing is we've got a mindset,that it takes 25 yearsnand 2 to 5 billion dollars,to develop a nuclear power plant.,That comes from the historical,nmilitary mindset,of the places nuclear power came from.,These new nuclear ventures are saying,that they can deliver powernfor 5 cents a kilowatt hour;,they can deliver itnfor 100 gigawatts a year;,they can demo it by 2025;,and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,,if only we give them a chance. 
 Right now, we're basicallynwaiting for a miracle.,What we need is a choice.,If they can't make it safe,nif they can't make it cheap,,it should not be deployed.,But what I want you to donis not carry an idea forward,,but write your leaders,,write the head of the NGOs you support,,and tell them to give you the choice,,not the past. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Have you heard the news?,We're in a clean energy revolution.,And where I live in Berkeley, California,,it seems like every day I see a new roofnwith new solar panels going up,,electric car in the driveway.,Germany sometimes getsnhalf its power from solar,,and India is now committednto building 10 times more solar,than we have in California,,by the year 2022. 
 Even nuclear seems to benmaking a comeback.,Bill Gates is in Chinanworking with engineers,,there's 40 different companiesnthat are working together,to try to race to build the firstnreactor that runs on waste,,that can't melt down,and is cheaper than coal.,And so you might start to ask:,Is this whole global warming problem,going to be a lot easier to solventhan anybody imagined?,That was the question we wanted to know,,so my colleagues and I decidednto take a deep dive into the data.,We were a little skeptical of some parts,of the clean energy revolution story,,but what we found really surprised us. 
 The first thing is that cleannenergy has been increasing.,This is electricity from clean energynsources over the last 20 years.,But when you look atnthe percentage of global electricity,from clean energy sources,,it's actually been in declinenfrom 36 percent to 31 percent.,And if you care about climate change,,you've got to go in the opposite direction,to 100 percent of our electricitynfrom clean energy sources,,as quickly as possible.,Now, you might wonder,,"Come on, how much could five percentagenpoints of global electricity be?",Well, it turns out to be quite a bit.,It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants,the size of Diablo Canyon,nCalifornia's last nuclear plant,,or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz,,which is one of the biggestnsolar farms in the world,,and certainly our biggest in California.,A big part of this is simplynthat fossil fuels are increasing,faster than clean energy.,And that's understandable.,There's just a lot of poor countries,that are still using woodnand dung and charcoal,as their main source of energy,,and they need modern fuels. 
 But there's something else going on,,which is that one of those clean energynsources in particular,has actually been on the declinenin absolute terms,,not just relatively.,And that's nuclear.,You can see its generationnhas declined seven percent,over the last 10 years.,Now, solar and wind have beennmaking huge strides,,so you hear a lot of talknabout how it doesn't really matter,,because solar and windnis going to make up the difference.,But the data says something different.,When you combine all the electricitynfrom solar and wind,,you see it actually barely makes upnhalf of the decline from nuclear.,Let's take a closer looknin the United States. 
 Over the last couple of years --nreally 2013, 2014 --,we prematurely retirednfour nuclear power plants.,They were almost entirelynreplaced with fossil fuels,,and so the consequencenwas that we wiped out,almost as much clean energynelectricity that we get from solar.,And it's not unique to us.,People think of Californianas a clean energy and climate leader,,but when we looked at the data,,what we found is that, in fact,,California reduced emissions more slowlynthan the national average,,between 2000 and 2015. 
 What about Germany?,They're doing a lot of clean energy.,But when you look at the data,,German emissions have actuallynbeen going up since 2009,,and there's really not anybodynwho's going to tell you,that they're going to meetntheir climate commitments in 2020. 
 The reason isn't hard to understand.,Solar and wind provide powernabout 10 to 20 percent of the time,,which means that whennthe sun's not shining,,the wind's not blowing,,you still need power for your hospitals,,your homes, your cities, your factories.,And while batteries have madensome really cool improvements lately,,the truth is, they're just neverngoing to be as efficient,as the electrical grid.,Every time you put electricityninto a battery and take it out,,you lose about 20 to 40npercent of the power.,That's why when, in California,,we try to deal with all the solarnwe've brought online --,we now get about 10 percentnof electricity from solar --,when the sun goes down,nand people come home from work,and turn on their air conditionersnand their TV sets,,and every other appliance in the house,,we need a lot of natural gas backup.,So what we've been doing,is stuffing a lot of natural gasninto the side of a mountain.,And that worked pretty well for a while,,but then late last year,nit sprung a leak.,This is Aliso Canyon.,So much methane gas was released,,it was the equivalent of puttingnhalf a million cars on the road.,It basically blew through allnof our climate commitments for the year. 
 Well, what about India?,Sometimes you have to go placesnto really get the right data,,so we traveled to India a few months ago.,We met with all the top officials --nsolar, nuclear, the rest --,and what they told us is,,"We're actually havingnmore serious problems,than both Germany and California.,We don't have backup;nwe don't have all the natural gas.,And that's just the start of it.,Say we want to getnto 100 gigawatts by 2022.,But last year we did just five,,and the year before that, we did five." 
 So, let's just takena closer look at nuclear.,The United Nations IntergovernmentalnPanel on Climate Change,has looked at the carbon contentnof all these different fuels,,and nuclear comes out really low --nit's actually lower even than solar.,And nuclear obviouslynprovides a lot of power --,24 hours a day, seven days a week.,During a year, a single plant can providenpower 92 percent of the time.,What's interesting is thatnwhen you look at countries,that have deployed differentnkinds of clean energies,,there's only a few that have done so,at a pace consistent with dealingnwith the climate crisis. 
 So nuclear seems likena pretty good option,,but there's this big problem with it,,which all of you, I'm sure, are aware of,,which is that people really don't like it.,There was a study, a survey donenof people around the world,,not just in the United States or Europe,,about a year and a half ago.,And what they found,is that nuclear is actually onenof the least popular forms of energy.,Even oil is more popular than nuclear.,And while nuclear kind ofnedges out coal, the thing is,,people don't really fear coalnin the same way they fear nuclear,,which really operates on our unconscious. 
 So what is it that we fear?,There's really three things.,There's the safetynof the plants themselves --,the fears that they're goingnto melt down and cause damage;,there's the waste from them;,and there's the association with weapons.,And I think, understandably,,engineers look at those concernsnand look for technological fixes.,That's why Bill Gates is in Chinandeveloping advanced reactors.,That's why 40 different entrepreneursnare working on this problem.,And I, myself, have beennvery excited about it. 
 We did a report:n"How to Make Nuclear Cheap.",In particular, the thorium reactornshows a lot of promise.,So when the climatenscientist, James Hansen,,asked if I wanted to go to China with him,and look at the Chinesenadvanced nuclear program,,I jumped at the chance.,We were there with MITnand UC Berkeley engineers.,And I had in my mind,that the Chinese would be ablento do with nuclear,what they did with so many other things --,start to crank out small nuclearnreactors on assembly lines,,ship them up like iPhones or MacBooksnand send them around the world.,I would get one at home in Berkeley.,But what I found was somewhat different.,The presentations were allnvery exciting and very promising;,they have multiple reactorsnthat they're working on.,The time came for the thorium reactor,nand a bunch of us were excited.,They went through the whole presentation,nthey got to the timeline,,and they said,,"We're going to havena thorium molten salt reactor,ready for sale to the world,by 2040.",And I was like, "What?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I looked at my colleagues and I was like,,"Excuse me --,can you guys speed that up a little bit?,Because we're in a little bitnof a climate crisis right now.,And your cities are reallynpolluted, by the way.",And they responded back, they were like,,"I'm not sure what you've heardnabout our thorium program,,but we don't have a third of our budget,,and your department of energynhasn't been particularly forthcoming,with all that data you guysnhave on testing reactors.",And I said, "Well, I've got an idea.,You know how you've got 10 yearsnwhere you're demonstrating that reactor?,Let's just skip that part,,and let's just go rightnto commercializing it.,That will save money and time.",And the engineer justnlooked at me and said,,"Let me ask you a question:,Would you buy a car that had nevernbeen demonstrated before?" 
 So what about the other reactors?,There's a reactor that's coming onlinennow, they're starting to sell it.,It's a high-temperature gas reactor.,It can't melt down.,But it's really big and bulky,nthat's part of the safety,,and nobody thinksnit's going to ever get cheaper,than the reactors that we have.,The ones that use waste as fuelnare really cool ideas, but the truth is,,we don't actually know how to do that yet.,There's some risk that you'llnactually make more waste,,and most people thinknthat if you're including,that waste part of the process,,it's just going to make the wholenmachine a lot more expensive,,it's just adding another complicated step. 
 The truth is,,there's real questions about how muchnof that we're going to do.,I mean, we went to India and askednabout the nuclear program.,The government saidnbefore the Paris climate talks,that they were going to do somethingnlike 30 new nuclear plants.,But when we got therenand interviewed people,and even looked at the internal documents,,they're now sayingnthey're going to do about five.,And in most of the world,nespecially the rich world,,they're not talkingnabout building new reactors.,We're actually talkingnabout taking reactors down,before their lifetimes are over.,Germany's actually pressuringnits neighbors to do that.,I mentioned the United States --,we could lose half of our reactorsnover the next 15 years,,which would wipe out 40 percentnof the emissions reductions,we're supposed to getnunder the Clean Power Plan.,Of course, in Japan, they tooknall their nuclear plants offline,,replaced them with coal,nnatural gas, oil burning,,and they're only expected to bringnonline about a third to two-thirds. 
 So when we went through the numbers,,and just added that up --,how much nuclear do we seenChina and India bringing online,over the next 15 years,,how much do we see at risknof being taken offline --,this was the most startling finding.,What we found is thatnthe world is actually at risk,of losing four times more clean energynthan we lost over the last 10 years.,In other words: we're notnin a clean energy revolution;,we're in a clean energy crisis.,So it's understandable that engineersnwould look for a technical fix,to the fears that people have of nuclear.,But when you considernthat these are big challenges to do,,that they're going to takena long time to solve,,there's this other issue, which is:,Are those technical fixesnreally going to solve people's fears? 
 Let's take safety.,You know, despite what people think,,it's hard to figure out hownto make nuclear power much safer.,I mean, every medicalnjournal that looks at it --,this is the most recent studynfrom the British journal, "Lancet,",one of the most respectednjournals in the world --,nuclear is the safest waynto make reliable power.,Everybody's scared of the accidents.,So you go look at the accident data --,Fukushima, Chernobyl --,the World Health Organizationnfinds the same thing:,the vast majority of harmnis caused by people panicking,,and they're panickingnbecause they're afraid.,In other words,,the harm that's causednisn't actually caused by the machines,or the radiation.,It's caused by our fears. 
 And what about the waste?,Everyone worries about the waste.,Well, the interestingnthing about the waste,is how little of it there is.,This is just from one plant.,If you take all the nuclear wastenwe've ever made in the United States,,put it on a football field, stacked it up,,it would only reach 20 feet high.,And people say it's poisoningnpeople or doing something --,it's not, it's just sittingnthere, it's just being monitored.,There's not very much of it.,By contrast, the waste that we don'tncontrol from energy production --,we call it "pollution," and it killsnseven million people a year,,and it's threatening very seriousnlevels of global warming.,And the truth is that even if we getngood at using that waste as fuel,,there's always going to bensome fuel left over.,That means there's always going to benpeople that think it's a big problem,for reasons that maybe don't havenas much to do with the actual waste,as we think. 
 Well, what about the weapons?,Maybe the most surprising thingnis that we can't find any examples,of countries that have nuclear power,and then, "Oh!" decide to go get a weapon.,In fact, it works the opposite.,What we find is the only way we know,how to get rid large numbersnof nuclear weapons,is by using the plutonium in the warheads,as fuel in our nuclear power plants.,And so, if you are wanting to getnthe world rid of nuclear weapons,,then we're going to needna lot more nuclear power. 
 (Applause) 
 As I was leaving China,,the engineer that brought Bill Gates therenkind of pulled me aside,,and he said, "You know, Michael,nI appreciate your interest,in all the different nuclearnsupply technologies,,but there's this more basic issue,,which is that there's just notnenough global demand.,I mean, we can crank outnthese machines on assembly lines,,we do know how to make things cheap,,but there's just not enoughnpeople that want them." 
 And so, let's do solar and windnand efficiency and conservation.,Let's accelerate the advancednnuclear programs.,I think we should triple the amountnof money we're spending on it.,But I just think the most important thing,,if we're going to overcomenthe climate crisis,,is to keep in mind that the causenof the clean energy crisis,isn't from within our machines,,it's from within ourselves. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Half of the human workforcenis expected to be replaced,by software and robotsnin the next 20 years.,And many corporate leaders welcomenthat as a chance to increase profits.,Machines are more efficient;,humans are complicatednand difficult to manage. 
 Well, I want our organizationsnto remain human.,In fact, I want them to become beautiful.,Because as machines take our jobsnand do them more efficiently,,soon the only work left for us humansnwill be the kind of work,that must be done beautifullynrather than efficiently. 
 To maintain our humanitynin the this second Machine Age,,we may have no other choicenthan to create beauty.,Beauty is an elusive concept.,For the writer Stendhalnit was the promise of happiness.,For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi. 
 (Laughter) 
 So bear with me,as I am proposing four admittedlynvery subjective principles,that you can use to buildna beautiful organization. 
 First: do the unnecessary. 
 [Do the Unnecessary] 
 A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,,the CEO and foundernof the yogurt company Chobani,,made headlines when he decided to grantnstock to all of his 2,000 employees.,Some called it a PR stunt,,others -- a genuine act of giving back.,But there is something elsenthat was remarkable about it.,It came completely out of the blue.,There had been no marketnor stakeholder pressure,,and employees were so surprised,that they burst into tearsnwhen they heard the news.,Actions like Ulukaya's are beautifulnbecause they catch us off guard.,They create something out of nothing,because they're completely unnecessary. 
 I once worked at a company,that was the result of a merger,of a large IT outsourcing firmnand a small design firm.,We were merging 9,000 software engineers,with 1,000 creative types.,And to unify thesenimmensely different cultures,,we were going to launchna third, new brand.,And the new brand colornwas going to be orange.,And as we were goingnthrough the budget for the rollouts,,we decided last minute,to cut the purchasenof 10,000 orange balloons,,which we had meantnto distribute to all staff worldwide.,They just seemednunnecessary and cute in the end.,I didn't know back then,that our decisionnmarked the beginning of the end --,that these two organizationsnwould never become one.,And sure enough,nthe merger eventually failed.,Now, was it becausenthere weren't any orange balloons?,No, of course not.,But the kill-the-orange-balloonsnmentality permeated everything else.,You might not always realize it,nbut when you cut the unnecessary,,you cut everything.,Leading with beauty meansnrising above what is merely necessary.,So do not kill your orange balloons. 
 The second principle:,create intimacy. 
 [Create Intimacy] 
 Studies show thatnhow we feel about our workplace,very much depends on the relationshipsnwith our coworkers.,And what are relationshipsnother than a string of microinteractions?,There are hundreds of thesenevery day in our organizations,that have the potential to distinguishna good life from a beautiful one.,The marriage researcher John Gottman says,that the secret of a healthy relationship,is not the great gesturenor the lofty promise,,it's small moments of attachment.,In other words, intimacy.,In our networked organizations,,we tout the strength of weak ties,but we underestimatenthe strength of strong ones.,We forget the words of the writernRichard Bach who once said,,"Intimacy --,not connectedness --,intimacy is the opposite of loneliness." 
 So how do we designnfor organizational intimacy?,The humanitarian organization CARE,wanted to launchna campaign on gender equality,in villages in northern India.,But it realized quickly,that it had to have this conversationnfirst with its own staff.,So it invited all 36 team membersnand their partners,to one of the Khajuraho Temples,,known for their famous erotic sculptures.,And there they openly discussedntheir personal relationships --,their own experiences of gender equality,with the coworkers and the partners.,It was eye-opening for the participants.,Not only did it allow themnto relate to the communities they serve,,it also broke down invisible barriers,and created a lasting bondnamongst themselves.,Not a single team membernquit in the next four years.,So this is how you create intimacy.,No masks ...,or lots of masks. 
 (Laughter) 
 When Danone, the food company,,wanted to translate its new companynmanifesto into product initiatives,,it gathered the management team,and 100 employeesnfrom across different departments,,seniority levels and regions,for a three-day strategy retreat.,And it asked everybodynto wear costumes for the entire meeting:,wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,,huge glasses and so on.,And they left with concrete outcomes,and full of enthusiasm.,And when I asked the womannwho had designed this experience,why it worked,,she simply said, "Never underestimatenthe power of a ridiculous wig." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Because wigs erase hierarchy,,and hierarchy kills intimacy --,both ways,,for the CEO and the intern.,Wigs allow us to usenthe disguise of the false,to show something true about ourselves.,And that's not easynin our everyday work lives,,because the relationshipnwith our organizations,is often like that of a married couplenthat has grown apart,,suffered betrayals and disappointments,,and is now desperate to be beautifulnfor one another once again.,And for either of us the first stepntowards beauty involves a huge risk.,The risk to be ugly. 
 [Be Ugly] 
 So many organizations these daysnare keen on designing beautiful workplaces,that look like anything but work:,vacation resorts, coffee shops,nplaygrounds or college campuses -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Based on the promisesnof positive psychology,,we speak of play and gamification,,and one start-up even saysnthat when someone gets fired,,they have graduated. 
 (Laughter) 
 That kind of beautiful languagenonly goes "skin deep,,but ugly cuts clean to the bone,",as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.,To be authentic is to be ugly.,It doesn't mean that you can't have funnor must give in to the vulgar or cynical,,but it does mean that you speaknthe actual ugly truth.,Like this manufacturer,that wanted to transformnone of its struggling business units.,It identified, named and pinnednon large boards all the issues --,and there were hundreds of them --,that had become obstaclesnto better performance.,They put them on boards,nmoved them all into one room,,which they called "the ugly room.",The ugly became visiblenfor everyone to see --,it was celebrated.,And the ugly room served as a mixnof mirror exhibition and operating room --,a biopsy on the living fleshnto cut out all the bureaucracy. 
 The ugliest part of our body is our brain.,Literally and neurologically.,Our brain renders uglynwhat is unfamiliar ...,modern art, atonal music,,jazz, maybe --,VR goggles for that matter --,strange objects, sounds and people.,But we've all been ugly once.,We were a weird-looking baby,,a new kid on the block, a foreigner.,And we will be ugly againnwhen we don't belong. 
 The Center for Political Beauty,,an activist collective in Berlin,,recently staged an extremenartistic intervention.,With the permission of relatives,,it exhumed the corpses of refugeesnwho had drowned at Europe's borders,,transported them all the way to Berlin,,and then reburied themnat the heart of the German capital.,The idea was to allow themnto reach their desired destination,,if only after their death.,Such acts of beautificationnmay not be pretty,,but they are much needed.,Because things tend to get uglynwhen there's only one meaning, one truth,,only answers and no questions.,Beautiful organizationsnkeep asking questions.,They remain incomplete,,which is the fourthnand the last of the principles. 
 [Remain Incomplete] 
 Recently I was in Paris,,and a friend of minentook me to Nuit Debout,,which stands for "up all night,",the self-organized protest movement,that had formed in responsento the proposed labor laws in France.,Every night, hundreds gatherednat the Place de la République.,Every night they set upna small, temporary village,to deliberate their own visionnof the French Republic.,And at the core of this adhocracy,was a general assemblynwhere anybody could speak,using a specially designed sign language.,Like Occupy Wall Streetnand other protest movements,,Nuit Debout was bornnin the face of crisis.,It was messy --,full of controversies and contradictions.,But whether you agreednwith the movement's goals or not,,every gathering wasna beautiful lesson in raw humanity.,And how fitting that Paris --,the city of ideals, the city of beauty --,was it's stage.,It reminds us that like great cities,,the most beautiful organizationsnare ideas worth fighting for --,even and especiallynwhen their outcome is uncertain.,They are movements;,they are always imperfect,nnever fully organized,,so they avoid ever becoming banal.,They have somethingnbut we don't know what it is.,They remain mysterious;nwe can't take our eyes off them.,We find them beautiful. 
 So to do the unnecessary,,to create intimacy,,to be ugly,,to remain incomplete --,these are not only the qualitiesnof beautiful organizations,,these are inherentlynhuman characteristics.,And these are also the qualitiesnof what we call home.,And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,,the least we can do is to ensure,that we still feel at homenin our organizations,,and that we use our organizationsnto create that feeling for others. 
 Beauty can save the worldnwhen we embrace these principles,and design for them.,In the face of artificial intelligencenand machine learning,,we need a new radical humanism.,We must acquire and promotena new aesthetic and sentimental education.,Because if we don't,,we might end up feeling like aliens,in organizations and societiesnthat are full of smart machines,that have no appreciation whatsoever,for the unnecessary,,the intimate,,the incomplete,and definitely not for the ugly. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am British. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Never before has the phrasen"I am British" elicited so much pity. 
 (Laughter) 
 I come from an islandnwhere many of us like to believe,there's been a lot of continuitynover the last thousand years.,We tend to have historicallynimposed change on others,but done much less of it ourselves. 
 So it came as an immense shock to me,when I woke up on the morning of June 24,to discover that my countrynhad voted to leave the European Union,,my Prime Minister had resigned,,and Scotland was considering a referendum,that could bring to an endnthe very existence of the United Kingdom.,So that was an immense shock for me,,and it was an immensenshock for many people,,but it was also somethingnthat, over the following several days,,created a complete political meltdown,in my country.,There were calls for a second referendum,,almost as if, following a sports match,,we could ask the opposition for a replay.,Everybody was blaming everybody else.,People blamed the Prime Minister,for calling the referendumnin the first place.,They blamed the leader of the oppositionnfor not fighting it hard enough.,The young accused the old.,The educated blamednthe less well-educated.,That complete meltdown was made even worse,by the most tragic element of it:,levels of xenophobia and racist abusenin the streets of Britain,at a level that I have never seen before,in my lifetime.,People are now talking about whethernmy country is becoming a Little England,,or, as one of my colleagues put it,,whether we're about to becomena 1950s nostalgia theme park,floating in the Atlantic Ocean. 
 (Laughter) 
 But my question is really,,should we have the degree of shocknthat we've experienced since?,Was it somethingnthat took place overnight?,Or are there deeper structural factorsnthat have led us to where we are today?,So I want to take a step backnand ask two very basic questions.,First, what does Brexit represent,,not just for my country,,but for all of us around the world?,And second, what can we do about it?,How should we all respond? 
 So first, what does Brexit represent?,Hindsight is a wonderful thing.,Brexit teaches us many thingsnabout our society,and about societies around the world.,It highlights in waysnthat we seem embarrassingly unaware of,how divided our societies are.,The vote split along lines of age,neducation, class and geography.,Young people didn't turn outnto vote in great numbers,,but those that did wanted to remain.,Older people really wantednto leave the European Union.,Geographically, it was London and Scotlandnthat most strongly committed,to being part of the European Union,,while in other parts of the countrynthere was very strong ambivalence.,Those divisions are things we reallynneed to recognize and take seriously.,But more profoundly,nthe vote teaches us something,about the nature of politics today.,Contemporary politicsnis no longer just about right and left.,It's no longer just about tax and spend.,It's about globalization.,The fault line of contemporary politics isnbetween those that embrace globalization,and those that fear globalization. 
 (Applause) 
 If we look at whynthose who wanted to leave --,we call them "Leavers,"nas opposed to "Remainers" --,we see two factors in the opinion polls,that really mattered.,The first was immigration,nand the second sovereignty,,and these represent a desire for peoplento take back control of their own lives,and the feeling that theynare unrepresented by politicians.,But those ideas are onesnthat signify fear and alienation.,They represent a retreatnback towards nationalism and borders,in ways that many of us would reject.,What I want to suggest is the picturenis more complicated than that,,that liberal internationalists,,like myself, and I firmlyninclude myself in that picture,,need to write ourselvesnback into the picture,in order to understandnhow we've got to where we are today.,When we look at the voting patternsnacross the United Kingdom,,we can visibly see the divisions.,The blue areas show Remain,and the red areas Leave.,When I looked at this,,what personally struck menwas the very little time in my life,I've actually spentnin many of the red areas.,I suddenly realized that,nlooking at the top 50 areas in the UK,that have the strongest Leave vote,,I've spent a combined totalnof four days of my life in those areas.,In some of those places,,I didn't even know the namesnof the voting districts.,It was a real shock to me,,and it suggested that people like me,who think of ourselvesnas inclusive, open and tolerant,,perhaps don't knownour own countries and societies,nearly as well as we like to believe. 
 (Applause) 
 And the challenge that comes from thatnis we need to find a new way,to narrate globalization to those people,,to recognize that for those people whonhave not necessarily been to university,,who haven't necessarilyngrown up with the Internet,,that don't get opportunities to travel,,they may be unpersuadednby the narrative that we find persuasive,in our often liberal bubbles. 
 (Applause) 
 It means that we need to reach outnmore broadly and understand.,In the Leave vote, a minority have peddlednthe politics of fear and hatred,,creating lies and mistrust,around, for instance,nthe idea that the vote on Europe,could reduce the number of refugeesnand asylum-seekers coming to Europe,,when the vote on leavingnhad nothing to do with immigration,from outside the European Union.,But for a significant majoritynof the Leave voters,the concern was disillusionmentnwith the political establishment.,This was a protest vote for many,,a sense that nobody represented them,,that they couldn't findna political party that spoke for them,,and so they rejectednthat political establishment. 
 This replicates around Europenand much of the liberal democratic world.,We see it with the rise in popularitynof Donald Trump in the United States,,with the growing nationalismnof Viktor Orbán in Hungary,,with the increase in popularitynof Marine Le Pen in France.,The specter of Brexitnis in all of our societies. 
 So the question I think we need to asknis my second question,,which is how should wencollectively respond?,For all of us who care about creatingnliberal, open, tolerant societies,,we urgently need a new vision,,a vision of a more tolerant,ninclusive globalization,,one that brings people with usnrather than leaving them behind. 
 That vision of globalization,is one that has to start by a recognitionnof the positive benefits of globalization.,The consensus amongst economists,is that free trade,nthe movement of capital,,the movement of people across borders,benefit everyone on aggregate.,The consensus amongstninternational relations scholars,is that globalizationnbrings interdependence,,which brings cooperation and peace.,But globalizationnalso has redistributive effects.,It creates winners and losers.,To take the example of migration,,we know that immigration is a net positivenfor the economy as a whole,under almost all circumstances.,But we also have to be very aware,that there arenredistributive consequences,,that importantly, low-skilled immigration,can lead to a reduction in wagesnfor the most impoverished in our societies,and also put pressure on house prices.,That doesn't detractnfrom the fact that it's positive,,but it means more peoplenhave to share in those benefits,and recognize them. 
 In 2002, the former Secretary-Generalnof the United Nations, Kofi Annan,,gave a speech at Yale University,,and that speech was on the topicnof inclusive globalization.,That was the speechnin which he coined that term.,And he said, and I paraphrase,,"The glass house of globalizationnhas to be open to all,if it is to remain secure.,Bigotry and ignorance,are the ugly face of exclusionarynand antagonistic globalization." 
 That idea of inclusive globalizationnwas briefly revived in 2008,in a conference on progressive governance,involving many of the leadersnof European countries.,But amid austeritynand the financial crisis of 2008,,the concept disappearednalmost without a trace.,Globalization has been takennto support a neoliberal agenda.,It's perceived to benpart of an elite agenda,rather than something that benefits all.,And it needs to be reclaimednon a far more inclusive basis,than it is today. 
 So the question is,nhow can we achieve that goal?,How can we balance on the one handnaddressing fear and alienation,while on the other handnrefusing vehemently,to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?,That is the question for all of us.,And I think, as a social scientist,,that social sciencenoffers some places to start.,Our transformation has to be aboutnboth ideas and about material change,,and I want to give you four ideasnas a starting point. 
 The first relates to the ideanof civic education.,What stands out from Brexit,is the gap between public perceptionnand empirical reality.,It's been suggested that we've movednto a postfactual society,,where evidence and truth no longer matter,,and lies have equal statusnto the clarity of evidence.,So how can we -- 
 (Applause) 
 How can we rebuild respect for truthnand evidence into our liberal democracies?,It has to begin with education,,but it has to start with the recognitionnthat there are huge gaps. 
 In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI,published a surveynon attitudes to immigration,,and it showed that as numbersnof immigrants increase,,so public concernnwith immigration also increases,,although it obviouslyndidn't unpack causality,,because this could equally be to donnot so much with numbers,but the politicalnand media narrative around it.,But the same survey also revealed,huge public misinformation,and misunderstandingnabout the nature of immigration.,For example, in these attitudesnin the United Kingdom,,the public believed that levels of asylum,were a greater proportionnof immigration than they were,,but they also believednthe levels of educational migration,were far lower as a proportionnof overall migration,than they actually are.,So we have to address this misinformation,,the gap between perception and realitynon key aspects of globalization.,And that can't just be somethingnthat's left to our schools,,although that's importantnto begin at an early age.,It has to be about lifelongncivic participation,and public engagementnthat we all encourage as societies. 
 The second thingnthat I think is an opportunity,is the idea to encourage more interactionnacross diverse communities.

 One of the things that stands outnfor me very strikingly,,looking at immigration attitudesnin the United Kingdom,,is that ironically,nthe regions of my country,that are the most tolerant of immigrants,have the highest numbers of immigrants.,So for instance, London and the Southeastnhave the highest numbers of immigrants,,and they are also by farnthe most tolerant areas.,It's those areas of the countrynthat have the lowest levels of immigration,that actually are the most exclusionarynand intolerant towards migrants. 
 So we need to encourage exchange programs.,We need to ensure that older generationsnwho maybe can't travel,get access to the Internet.,We need to encourage,neven on a local and national level,,more movement, more participation,,more interactionnwith people who we don't know,and whose views we mightnnot necessarily agree with. 
 The third thing that I thinknis crucial, though,,and this is really fundamental,,is we have to ensure that everybody shares,in the benefits of globalization.,This illustration from the Financial Timesnpost-Brexit is really striking.,It shows tragically that those peoplenwho voted to leave the European Union,were those who actuallynbenefited the most materially,from trade with the European Union.,But the problem isnthat those people in those areas,didn't perceive themselvesnto be beneficiaries.,They didn't believe that theynwere actually getting access,to material benefits of increased tradenand increased mobility around the world. 
 I work on questionsnpredominantly to do with refugees,,and one of the ideasnI spent a lot of my time preaching,,mainly to developing countriesnaround the world,,is that in order to encouragenthe integration of refugees,,we can't just benefitnthe refugee populations,,we also have to address the concernsnof the host communities in local areas.,But in looking at that,,one of the policy prescriptionsnis that we have to provide,disproportionately betterneducation facilities, health facilities,,access to social services,in those regions of high immigration,to address the concernsnof those local populations.,But while we encourage thatnaround the developing world,,we don't take those lessons home,and incorporate them in our own societies. 
 Furthermore, if we're goingnto really take seriously,the need to ensure people sharenin the economic benefits,,our businesses and corporationsnneed a model of globalization,that recognizes that they, too,nhave to take people with them. 
 The fourth and final ideanI want to put forward,is an idea that we neednmore responsible politics.,There's very littlensocial science evidence,that compares attitudes on globalization.,But from the surveys that do exist,,what we can see is there's huge variationnacross different countries,and time periods in those countries,for attitudes and tolerance,of questions like migrationnand mobility on the one hand,and free trade on the other.,But one hypothesis that I think emergesnfrom a cursory look at that data,is the idea that polarized societiesnare far less tolerant of globalization.,It's the societiesnlike Sweden in the past,,like Canada today,,where there is a centrist politics,,where right and left work together,,that we encourage supportive attitudesntowards globalization.,And what we see around the world todaynis a tragic polarization,,a failure to have dialoguenbetween the extremes in politics,,and a gap in termsnof that liberal center ground,that can encourage communicationnand a shared understanding.,We might not achieve that today,,but at the very least we have to callnupon our politicians and our media,to drop a language of fearnand be far more tolerant of one another. 
 (Applause) 
 These ideas are very tentative,,and that's in part because this needsnto be an inclusive and shared project. 
 I am still British.,I am still European.,I am still a global citizen.,For those of us who believe,that our identitiesnare not mutually exclusive,,we have to all work together,to ensure that globalizationntakes everyone with us,and doesn't leave people behind.,Only then will we truly reconcilendemocracy and globalization. 
 Thank you.

 My dear fellow citizen: 
 I write to you today,,to you who have lost in this era.,At this moment in our common life,,when the world is full of breaking,and spite,and fear, 
 I address this letter,simply to you,,even though we both know,there are many of you behind this "you,",and many of me behind this "I." 
 I write to you because at present,,this quaking world we share scares me.,I gather it scares you, too.,Some of what we fear, I suspect,,we fear in common.,But much of what we fearnseems to be each other.,You fear the world I want to live in,,and I fear your visions in turn. 
 Do you know that feeling you getnwhen you know it's going to storm,before it storms?,Do you also feel that now,,fellow citizen?,That malaise and worry,that some who know,feel reminds them of the 1930s? 
 Perhaps you don't,,because our fears of each other,are not in sync.,In this round, I sensenthat your fears of me,,of the world that I have insistednis right for us both,,has gathered over a generation.,It took time for your fearsnto trigger my fears,,not least because at first,,I never thought I needed to fear you. 
 I heard you,but did not listen,,all these years when you saidnthat this amazing new world,wasn't amazing for you,,for many of you,,across the industrialized world;,that the open, liquid world I relished,,of people and goodsnand technologies flowing freely,,going where they pleased, globally,,was not, for you, an emancipation. 
 I have walked through your towns,and, while looking, failed to see.,I did notice in Stephenville, Texas,,that the town square was dominated,by one lawyer's office after another,,because of all the peoplenrotating in and out of the prison.,I did notice the barren shopsnin Wagner, South Dakota,,and the VFW gathering hall,that stood in mockery,of a community's dream to endure.,I did notice,at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart,,that far too many peoplenin their 20s and 30s,looked a decade or two from death,,with patchy, flared-up skin,and thinning, stringy hair,and browning, ground-down teeth,and a lostness in their eyes. 
 I did notice that the young peoplenI encountered in Paris,,in Florence, in Barcelona,,had degrees but no place to take them,,living on internships well into their 30s,,their lives prevented from launching,,because of an economynthat creates wealth --,just not jobs.,I did notice the news about those partsnof London becoming ghost quarters,,where the global super-richnturn fishy money into empty apartments,and price lifelong residents of a city,nyoung couples starting out,,out of their own home. 
 And I heard that the fabric of your life,was tearing.,You used to be able to count on work,,and now you couldn't.,You used to be ablento nourish your children,,and guarantee that they would climb,a little bit further in life than you had,,and now you couldn't.,You used to be made to feel dignitynin your work, and now you didn't.,It used to be normalnfor people like you to own a home,,and now it wasn't. 
 I cannot say,I didn't know these things,,but I was distracted,creating a future in whichnwe could live on Mars,,even as you struggled down here on Earth.,I was distracted,innovating immortality,,even as many of you began to livenshorter lives than your parents had. 
 I heard all of these things,nbut I didn't listen.,I looked,but didn't see.,I read, didn't understand. 
 I paid attention,only when you began to vote and shout,,and when your voting and shouting,nwhen the substance of it,,began to threaten me. 
 I listened only when you movedntoward shattering continental unions,and electing vulgar demagogues. 
 Only then did your pain become of interest,to me. 
 I know that feeling hurt,is often prologue to dealing hurt.,I wonder now,if you would be less eager to deal it,if I had stood with you,when you merely felt it. 
 I ask myself,why I didn't stand with you then. 
 One reason is that I became entranced,by the gurus of change,,became a worshiper of the religionnof the new for novelty's sake,,and of globalization and open borders,and kaleidoscopic diversity. 
 Once change became my totalizing faith,,I could be blind.,I could fail to see change's consequences.,I could overlook the importance,of roots, traditions,nrituals, stability --,and belonging. 
 And the more fundamentalist I became,in my worship of change and openness,,the more I drove yountowards the other polarity,,to cling,,to freeze,,to close,,to belong. 
 I now see as I didn't before,that not havingnthe right skin or right organ,is not the only varietal of disadvantage.,There is a subtler, quieter disadvantage,in having those privileged traits,and yet feeling history to benmoving away from you;,that while the past was hospitablento people like you,,the future will be more hospitable,to others;,that the world is growing less familiar,,less yours day by day. 
 I will not concede for a momentnthat old privileges should not dwindle.,They cannot dwindle fast enough.,It is for you to learn to livenin a new century in which,there are no bonuses for showing upnwith the right skin and right organs.,If and when your anger turns to hate,,please know that there is no spacenfor that in our shared home.,But I will admit, fellow citizen,,that I have discounted the burdennof coping with the loss of status.,I have forgotten,that what is socially necessaryncan also be personally gruelling. 
 A similar thing happened,with the economy that you and I share.,Just as I cannot and don't wish,to turn back to the clocknon equality and diversity,,and yet must understand,the sense of loss they can inspire,,so, too, I refusenand could not if I wished,turn back the clock on an ever morenclosely knit, interdependent world,,and on inventionsnthat won't stop being invented.,And yet I must understandnyour experience of these things. 
 You have for years been telling menthat your experience of these things,is not as good as my theories forecast. 
 Yet before you could finishna complaining sentence,about the difficulty of livingnwith erratic hours, volatile pay,,vanishing opportunities,,about the pain of droppingnyour children off at 24-hour day care,to make your 3am shift,,I shot back at you -- before youncould finish your sentence --,my dogma,,about how what you are actuallynexperiencing was flexibility,and freedom. 
 Language is one of the only thingsnthat we truly share,,and I sometimes usednthis joint inheritance,to obfuscate,and deflect,and justify myself;,to re-brand what was good for me,as something appearing good for us both,,when I threw around termsnlike "the sharing economy,",and "disruption",and "global resourcing." 
 I see now that what I was really doing,,at times,,was buying your pain on the cheap,,sprucing it up,and trying to sell it back to you,as freedom. 
 I have wanted to believenand wanted you to believe,that the system that has been good to me,,that has made my life ever more seamless,,is also the best system for you. 
 I have condescended to you,with the idea that you are votingnagainst your economic interests --,voting against your interests,,as if I know your interests.,That is just my dogmaticneconomism talking.,I have a weakness,for treating people's economic interestsnas their only interest,,ignoring things like belonging and pride,and the desire to send a messagento those who ignore you. 
 So here we are,,in a scary but not inexplicable moment,of demagoguery, fracture,,xenophobia, resentment and fear. 
 And I worry for us bothnif we continue down this road,,me not listening,,you feeling unheard,,you shouting to get me to listen. 
 I worry when each of us is seducednby visions of the future,that have no place for the other. 
 If this goes on,,if this goes on,,there may be blood.,There are already hints of this blood,in newspapers every day.,There may be roundups, raids,,deportations, camps, secessions.,And no, I do not think that I exaggerate.,There may be even talk of war,in places that were certainnthey were done with it. 
 There is always the hope of redemption.,But it will not be a cheap,nshallow redemption,that comes through blathernabout us all being in it together.,This will take more. 
 It will take accepting that we bothnmade choices to be here. 
 We create our "others.",As parents, as neighbors, as citizens,,we witness and sometimes ignore each other,into being. 
 You were not born vengeful.,I have some role,in whatever thirstnyou now feel for revenge,,and that thirst now tempts me,to plot ever more elaborate escapes,from our common life,,from the schools and neighborhoods,and airports and amusement parks,that we used to share. 
 We face, then,,a problem not of these large,nimpersonal forces.,We face a problemnof your and my relations.,We chose ways of relating to each other,that got us here.,We can choose ways of relating,that get us out. 
 But there are thingsnwe might have to let go of,,fellow citizen,,starting with our own cherishednversions of reality. 
 Imagine if you let go of fantasies,of a society purgednof these or those people.,Imagine if I let go of my habit,of saving the world behind your back,,of deliberating on the future,of your work,,your food,,your schools,,in places where you couldn'tnget past security. 
 We can do this only if we first accept,that we have neglected each other.,If there is hope to summon,in this ominous hour,,it is this.,We have, for too long,,chased various shimmering dreams,at the cost of attentionnto the foundational dream of each other,,the dream of tending to each other,,of unleashing each other's wonders,,of moving through history together.,We could dare to commitnto the dream of each other,as the thing that mattersnbefore every neon thing. 
 Let us dare. 
 Sincerely yours, 
 a fellow citizen. 
 (Applause)Economists have been exploringnpeople's behavior for hundreds of years:,how we make decisions,,how we act individually and in groups,,how we exchange value.,They've studied the institutionsnthat facilitate our trade,,like legal systems,,corporations,,marketplaces.,But there is a new,ntechnological institution,that will fundamentally changenhow we exchange value,,and it's called the blockchain. 
 Now, that's a pretty bold statement,,but if you take nothing elsenaway from this talk,,I actually want you to remember,that while blockchain technologynis relatively new,,it's also a continuationnof a very human story,,and the story is this.,As humans, we find ways,to lower uncertainty about one another,so that we can exchange value. 
 Now, one of the first peoplento really explore the idea,of institutions as a tool in economics,to lower our uncertaintiesnabout one another,and be able to do trade,was the Nobel economist Douglass North.,He passed away at the end of 2015,,but North pioneered what's calledn"new institutional economics.",And what he meant by institutionsnwere really just formal rules,like a constitution,,and informal constraints, like bribery.,These institutions are really the grease,that allow our economicnwheels to function,,and we can see this play outnover the course of human history. 
 If we think back to when we werenhunter-gatherer economies,,we really just tradednwithin our village structure.,We had some informal constraints in place,,but we enforcednall of our trade with violence,or social repercussions.,As our societies grew more complex,and our trade routes grew more distant,,we built up more formal institutions,,institutions like banks for currency,,governments, corporations.,These institutionsnhelped us manage our trade,as the uncertaintynand the complexity grew,,and our personal control was much lower.,Eventually with the internet,nwe put these same institutions online.,We built platform marketplacesnlike Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,,just faster institutionsnthat act as middlemen,to facilitate human economic activity. 
 As Douglass North saw it,,institutions are a toolnto lower uncertainty,so that we can connect and exchangenall kinds of value in society.,And I believe we are now entering,a further and radical evolution,of how we interact and trade,,because for the first time,nwe can lower uncertainty,not just with politicalnand economic institutions,,like our banks, our corporations,nour governments,,but we can do it with technology alone. 
 So what is the blockchain?,Blockchain technologynis a decentralized database,that stores a registrynof assets and transactions,across a peer-to-peer network.,It's basically a public registry,of who owns what and who transacts what.,The transactions are securednthrough cryptography,,and over time, that transaction historyngets locked in blocks of data,that are then cryptographicallynlinked together and secured.,This creates an immutable,nunforgeable record,of all of the transactionsnacross this network.,This record is replicatednon every computer that uses the network. 
 It's not an app.,It's not a company.,I think it's closest in descriptionnto something like Wikipedia.,We can see everything on Wikipedia.,It's a composite view that's constantlynchanging and being updated.,We can also track those changesnover time on Wikipedia,,and we can create our own wikis,,because at their core,nthey're just a data infrastructure.,On Wikipedia, it's an open platformnthat stores words and images,and the changes to that data over time.,On the blockchain,,you can think of itnas an open infrastructure,that stores many kinds of assets.,It stores the history of custodianship,,ownership and location,for assets likenthe digital currency Bitcoin,,other digital assets,like a title of ownership of IP.,It could be a certificate, a contract,,real world objects,,even personal identifiable information.,There are of course otherntechnical details to the blockchain,,but at its core, that's how it works.,It's this public registrynthat stores transactions in a network,and is replicated so that it's very securenand hard to tamper with. 
 Which brings me to my point,of how blockchains lower uncertainty,and how they therefore promisento transform our economic systems,in radical ways.,So uncertainty is kind of a big term,in economics,,but I want to go through three forms of it,that we face in almost allnof our everyday transactions,,where blockchains can play a role.,We face uncertaintiesnlike not knowing who we're dealing with,,not having visibility into a transaction,and not having recoursenif things go wrong. 
 So let's take the first example,nnot knowing who we're dealing with.,Say I want to buyna used smartphone on eBay.,The first thing I'm going to donis look up who I'm buying from.,Are they a power user?,Do they have great reviews and ratings,nor do they have no profile at all?,Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:,these are the attestationsnabout our identities,that we cobble together today,and use to lower uncertaintynabout who we're dealing with.,But the problem isnthey're very fragmented.,Think about how many profiles you have.,Blockchains allow for usnto create an open, global platform,on which to store any attestationnabout any individual,from any source.,This allows us to create a user-controlled,portable identity.,More than a profile,,it means you can selectively reveal,the different attributes about you,that help facilitate trade or interaction,,for instance that a governmentnissued you an ID,,or that you're over 21,,by revealing the cryptographic proof,that these details existnand are signed off on.,Having this kind of portable identity,around the physical worldnand the digital world,means we can do all kinds of human trade,in a totally new way. 
 So I've talked about how blockchainsncould lower uncertainty,in who we're dealing with.,The second uncertainty that we often face,is just not having transparencyninto our interactions.,Say you're going to send menthat smartphone by mail.,I want some degree of transparency.,I want to know that the product I boughtnis the same one that arrives in the mail,and that there's some recordnfor how it got to me.,This is true not justnfor electronics like smartphones,,but for many kinds of goods and data,,things like medicine, luxury goods,,any kind of data or productnthat we don't want tampered with. 
 The problem in many companies,,especially those that producensomething complicated like a smartphone,,is they're managingnall of these different vendors,across a horizontal supply chain.,All of these peoplenthat go into making a product,,they don't have the same database.,They don't use the same infrastructure,,and so it becomes really hard to seentransparently a product evolve over time. 
 Using the blockchain, we can create,a shared realitynacross nontrusting entities.,By this I mean,all of these nodes in the networkndo not need to know each other,or trust each other,,because they each have the ability,to monitor and validatenthe chain for themselves.,Think back to Wikipedia.,It's a shared database,,and even though it has multiple readers,and multiple writers at the same time,,it has one single truth.,So we can create that using blockchains.,We can create a decentralized databasenthat has the same efficiency of a monopoly,without actually creatingnthat central authority.,So all of these vendors,nall sorts of companies,,can interact using the same databasenwithout trusting one another.,It means for consumers,nwe can have a lot more transparency.,As a real-world object travels along,,we can see its digital certificatenor token move on the blockchain,,adding value as it goes.,This is a whole new worldnin terms of our visibility. 
 So I've talked about how blockchainsncan lower our uncertainties about identity,and how they changenwhat we mean about transparency,in long distances and complex trades,nlike in a supply chain.,The last uncertainty that we often face,is one of the most open-ended,nand it's reneging.,What if you don't send me the smartphone?,Can I get my money back?,Blockchains allow us to write code,,binding contracts,,between individuals,and then guaranteenthat those contracts will bear out,without a third party enforcer.,So if we look at the smartphone example,nyou could think about escrow.,You are financing that phone,,but you don't need to release the funds,until you can verifynthat all the conditions have been met.,You got the phone. 
 I think this is onenof the most exciting ways,that blockchains lower our uncertainties,,because it means to some degree,we can collapse institutionsnand their enforcement.,It means a lot of human economic activity,can get collateralized and automated,,and push a lot of humannintervention to the edges,,the places where information movesnfrom the real world to the blockchain. 
 I think what would probablynfloor Douglass North,about this use of technology,is the fact that the very thingnthat makes it work,,the very thing that keeps the blockchainnsecure and verified,,is our mutual distrust.,So rather than all of our uncertainties,slowing us down,and requiring institutions,like banks, our governments,nour corporations,,we can actually harnessnall of that collective uncertainty,and use it to collaborate and exchangenmore and faster and more open. 
 Now, I don't want younto get the impression,that the blockchainnis the solution to everything,,even though the media has saidnthat it's going to end world poverty,,it's also going to solventhe counterfeit drug problem,and potentially save the rainforest.,The truth is, this technologynis in its infancy,,and we're going to need to seena lot of experiments take place,and probably fail,before we truly understandnall of the use cases,for our economy.,But there are tons of peoplenworking on this,,from financial institutions,to technology companies,nstart-ups and universities.,And one of the reasons isnthat it's not just an economic evolution.,It's also an innovationnin computer science. 
 Blockchains give usnthe technological capability,of creating a record of human exchange,,of exchange of currency,,of all kinds of digitalnand physical assets,,even of our own personal attributes,,in a totally new way.,So in some ways,,they become a technological institution,that has a lot of the benefits,of the traditional institutionsnwe're used to using in society,,but it does this in a decentralized way.,It does this by convertingna lot of our uncertainties,into certainties. 
 So I think we need to startnpreparing ourselves,,because we are about to face a world,where distributed, autonomous institutions,have quite a significant role. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.,I think I understood that it's coming,,it offers a lot of potential,,and it's complex.,What is your estimatenfor the rate of adoption? 
 Bettina Warburg: I thinknthat's a really good question.,My lab is pretty much focused,on going the enterprisenand government route first,,because in reality,nblockchain is a complex technology.,How many of you actually understandnhow the internet works?,But you use it every day,,so I think we're sort of facingnthe same John Sculley idea,of technology should either beninvisible or beautiful,,and blockchain is kind ofnneither of those things right now,,so it's better suitednfor either really early adopters,who kind of get it and can tinker around,or for finding those best use cases,like identity or asset trackingnor smart contracts,that can be used at that levelnof an enterprise or government. 
 BG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED. 
 BW: Thanks. 
 (Applause)In the spring of 2016,,a legal battle between Applenand the Federal Bureau of Investigation,captured the world's attention. 
 Apple has built security featuresninto its mobile products,which protect data on its devicesnfrom everyone but the owner.,That means that criminals, hackersnand yes, even governments,are all locked out.,For Apple's customers,nthis is a great thing.,But governments are not so happy.,You see, Apple has madena conscious decision,to get out of the surveillance business.,Apple has tried to make surveillancenas difficult as possible,for governments and any other actors. 
 There are really twonsmartphone operating systems,in the global smartphone market:,iOS and Android.,iOS is made by Apple.nAndroid is made by Google.,Apple has spent a lot of time and money,to make sure that its productsnare as secure as possible.,Apple encrypts all datanstored on iPhones by default,,and text messages sent from onenApple customer to another Apple customer,are encrypted by default,without the user havingnto take any actions. 
 What this means is that,,if the police seize an iPhonenand it has a password,,they'll have a difficult timengetting any data off of it,,if they can do it at all.,In contrast, the security of Androidnjust really isn't as good.,Android phones, or at leastnmost of the Android phones,that have been sold to consumers,,do not encrypt data storednon the device by default,,and the built-in text messaging appnin Android does not use encryption.,So if the police seize an Android phone,,chances are, they'll be able to getnall the data they want,off of that device. 
 Two smartphones,from two of the biggestncompanies in the world;,one that protects data by default,,and one that doesn't. 
 Apple is a seller of luxury goods.,It dominates the high end of the market.,And we would expect a manufacturernof luxury goods to have products,that include more features.,But not everyone can afford an iPhone.,That's where Androidnreally, really dominates:,at the middle and low end of the market,,smartphones for the billionnand a half people,who cannot or will not spend,600 dollars on a phone. 
 But the dominance of Androidnhas led to what I call,the "digital security divide.",That is, there is now increasingly a gap,between the privacynand security of the rich,,who can afford devicesnthat secure their data by default,,and of the poor,,whose devices do very littlento protect them by default. 
 So, think of the average Apple customer:,a banker, a lawyer,na doctor, a politician.,These individuals now increasingly havensmartphones in their pockets,that encrypt their calls,ntheir text messages,,all the data on the device,,without them doing really anythingnto secure their information.,In contrast, the poornand the most vulnerable in our societies,are using devices that leave themncompletely vulnerable to surveillance. 
 In the United States, where I live,,African-Americans are more likelynto be seen as suspicious,or more likely to be profiled,,and are more likely to be targetednby the state with surveillance.,But African-Americansnare also disproportionately likely,to use Android devicesnthat do nothing at all,to protect them from that surveillance.,This is a problem. 
 We must remembernthat surveillance is a tool.,It's a tool used by those in power,against those who have no power.,And while I think it's absolutely great,that companies like Applenare making it easy for people to encrypt,,if the only peoplenwho can protect themselves,from the gaze of the government,are the rich and powerful,,that's a problem.,And it's not just a privacynor a cybersecurity problem.,It's a civil rights problem. 
 So the lack of default security in Android,is not just a problemnfor the poor and vulnerable users,who are depending on these devices.,This is actually a problemnfor our democracy.,I'll explain what I mean. 
 Modern social movementsnrely on technology --,from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Springnto Occupy Wall Street.,The organizers of these movementsnand the members of these movements,increasingly communicatenand coordinate with smartphones.,And so, naturally governmentsnthat feel threatened by these movements,will also target the organizersnand their smartphones.,Now, it's quite possible,that a future Martin Luther Kingnor a Mandela or a Gandhi,will have an iPhone and be protectednfrom government surveillance.,But chances are,,they'll probably have a cheap,n$20 Android phone in their pocket. 
 And so if we do nothingnto address the digital security divide,,if we do nothing to ensurenthat everyone in our society,gets the same benefits of encryption,and is equally able to protect themselvesnfrom surveillance by the state,,not only will the poor and vulnerablenbe exposed to surveillance,,but future civil rightsnmovements may be crushed,before they ever reachntheir full potential. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.,I have a question for you.,We saw recently in the press,that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebookncovers over his camera,and does somethingnwith his headphone mic jack.,So I wanted to ask youna personal question, which is:,Do you do that?,And, on behalf of everyonenhere, particularly myself,,Should we be doing that?,Should we be covering these things? 
 Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker --nactually, I like Band-Aids,,because you can remove themnand put them back on,whenever you want to makena call or a Skype call.,Putting a sticker over your web cam,is probably the best thingnyou can do for your privacy,in terms of bang for buck.,There really is malware,nmalicious software out there,that can take over your web cam,,even without the light turning on.,This is used by criminals.nThis is used by stalkers.,You can buy $19.99 "spynon your ex-girlfriend" software online.,It's really terrifying.,And then, of course,nit's used by governments.,And there's obviouslyna sexual violence component to this,,which is that this kind of surveillancencan be used most effectively,against women and other peoplenwho can be shamed in our society.,Even if you thinknyou have nothing to hide,,at the very least, if you havenchildren, teenagers in your lives,,make sure you put a stickernon their camera and protect them. 
 HW: Wow. Thank you so much.nCS: Thank you. 
 HW: Thanks, Chris. 
 (Applause)It's funny the things you forget.,I went to see my mother the other day,nand she told me this story,that I'd completelynforgotten about,how, when we were driving together,nshe would pull the car over,,and by the time she hadngotten out of the car,,and gone around the carnto let me out of the car,,I would have already gotten out of the car,and pretended to have died. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Because that's how you die. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I remember, that was a gamenI used to play with myself,to entertain myself whenevernI was bored or frustrated. 
 (Laughter) 
 Settle down. 
 (Laughter) 
 People say we live in an agenof information overload. Right?,I don't know about that,,but I just know that I getntoo many marketing emails.,I got a marketing emailnfrom a supermarket firm,,which will remain nameless,for predominantly legal reasons,,but which I'm going to call "SafeMart." 
 (Laughter) 
 I got an email from them,nand it went like this, it said: 
 "Just three weeks until SafeMartnat King's Cross opens!!!" 
 And I resented this,,because not only do I not remembernsigning up to that,,but I resent the factnthat they appear to think,that I should be excitednabout a shop opening. 
 So what I did was I scrolled downnto the bottom of the email,,and I pressed, "Unsubscribe.",And I thought that'd be the end of it.,But a week later,nI got another one that said, 
 "Just two weeks,until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!" 
 And I thought, obviously,nI haven't clicked hard enough.,So I tried it again. Right?,Lo and behold, a week passes,nyou guessed it, 
 "Just one week until SafeMartnat King's Cross opens!!!" 
 And here's the problem:,The internet gave us access to everything;,but it also gave everything access to us.,It's hard enough to discriminate,between the things that genuinelynmatter in this world,and the minutiae of life,,without having emailsnabout supermarket chains,and Candy Crush Saga.,And I was really annoyed with them,,and I thought, OK, I was about to writena strongly worded email,,which I can do quite well. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I thought, no --,I'm going to find the game.,So I replied to it, and I said, 
 "I literally cannot wait!!!!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "What do you need from me?" 
 They got back to me;na guy called Dan said, 
 "Hi James. I've asked a colleaguento help me with your query." 
 (Laughter) 
 Like it needs help.,And I said, "What's the plan, Dan?,I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I'm not sure what you mean." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "I'm just tremendouslynexcited about the opening!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Do you want to booknthe bouncy castle or shall I?" 
 He said, "I think you have misunderstood." 
 (Laughter) 
 "A new store is opening,nbut there is no celebration planned." 
 I said, "But what was all the 'Three weeksnuntil,' 'Two weeks until' emails?,I was getting excited." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I'm sorry you're disappointed." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Not to worry.,Let's do something anyway!,Besides, the deposit on the bouncyncastle was non-refundable." 
 (Laughter) 
 "If we don't use it, we're outna few hundred quid, Dan." 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsiblenfor anything you have ordered." 
 I said, "Let's not get into who did what.,Bottom line: you and Inare in this together." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "Question: Will you be therento make sure people take their shoes off?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll be honest, then my relationshipnwith Dan deteriorated somewhat,,because the next email I got was this: 
 "Thanks for your email -nyour Case Number is ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 That's outrageous.,I said, "Dan?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I got -- and I was just like,nthis is ... -- and I, I ....,And I said, "Danny?",And I thought, this is terrible.nAll I'm doing is collecting case numbers.,I said, "D-Dog?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "The store is now open." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "But Dan, they must have wonderednwhy there was no bouncy castle." 
 And then we were back to this. 
 And that might have beennthe end of the story,,but I rememberednthat anything -- everything --,even something as mundanenas getting out of a car,,can be fun if you find the right game. 
 So,,this is what I replied: 
 [Thanks for your email -nyour Case Number is #0000001.] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And we just, uh ... 
 (Laughter) 
 It was like we were dancing.,It was just a beautiful relationship.,We just kept going.,It was lovely.,But to be honest, guys,nit was quite labor-intensive,,and I had other stuff to do,,believe it or not.,So what I did is I have a little emailnauto-replier program.,And I set it up so every timenit receives an email from SafeMart,,it just pings one back.,So I set it up, and it says, 
 "Thanks for your email -nyour Case Number is ..." 
 Then it has a little formula that I wrotento up the case number every time.,And I put it on the server,and set it running. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll be honest, guys --,then I forgot about it. 
 (Laughter) 
 I checked back on it the other day,,and it appears there have beenna number of emails going back and forth.,We're on 21,439. 
 (Applause) 
 It gives me an immensensense of satisfaction to know,that these computer programsnare just going to be pinging one another,for eternity.,And as legacies go,nI don't think that's bad. 
 So guys, just remember:,if ever you feel weighed downnby the bureaucracy,and often mundanity of modern life,,don't fight the frustration.,Let it be the catalyst,for whimsy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The conventional wisdomnabout our world today,is that this is a timenof terrible decline.,And that's not surprising,ngiven the bad news all around us,,from ISIS to inequality,,political dysfunction, climate change,,Brexit, and on and on.,But here's the thing,nand this may sound a little weird.,I actually don't buynthis gloomy narrative,,and I don't think you should either.,Look, it's not thatnI don't see the problems.,I read the same headlines that you do.,What I dispute is the conclusionnthat so many people draw from them,,namely that we're all screwed,because the problems are unsolvable,and our governments are useless. 
 Now, why do I say this?,It's not like I'm particularlynoptimistic by nature.,But something about the media'snconstant doom-mongering,with its fixation on problemsnand not on answers,has always really bugged me. 
 So a few years ago I decided,,well, I'm a journalist,,I should see if I can do any better,by going around the worldnand actually asking folks,if and how they've tackled,their big economicnand political challenges.,And what I found astonished me.,It turns out that there are remarkablensigns of progress out there,,often in the most unexpected places,,and they've convinced menthat our great global challenges,may not be so unsolvable after all.,Not only are there theoretical fixes;,those fixes have been tried.,They've worked.,And they offer hope for the rest of us. 
 I'm going to show you what I mean,by telling you aboutnhow three of the countries I visited --,Canada, Indonesia and Mexico --,overcame three supposedlynimpossible problems.,Their stories matter because they containntools the rest of us can use,,and not just for thosenparticular problems,,but for many others, too. 
 When most people thinknabout my homeland, Canada, today,,if they think about Canada at all,,they think cold, they think boring,nthey think polite.,They think we say "sorry" too muchnin our funny accents.,And that's all true. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry. 
 (Laughter) 
 But Canada's also important,because of its triumph over a problem,currently tearingnmany other countries apart:,immigration.,Consider, Canada today is amongnthe world's most welcoming nations,,even compared to othernimmigration-friendly countries.,Its per capita immigration ratenis four times higher than France's,,and its percentagenof foreign-born residents,is double that of Sweden.,Meanwhile, Canada admitted,10 times more Syrian refugeesnin the last year,than did the United States. 
 (Applause) 
 And now Canada is taking even more.,And yet, if you ask Canadians,what makes them proudest of their country,,they rank "multiculturalism,",a dirty word in most places,,second,,ahead of hockey.,Hockey. 
 (Laughter) 
 In other words,nat a time when other countries,are now frantically buildingnnew barriers to keep foreigners out,,Canadians want even more of them in. 
 Now, here's the really interesting part.,Canada wasn't always like this.,Until the mid-1960s, Canada followednan explicitly racist immigration policy.,They called it "White Canada,",and as you can see, they were notnjust talking about the snow. 
 So how did that Canadanbecome today's Canada?,Well, despite what my momnin Ontario will tell you,,the answer had nothing to do with virtue.,Canadians are not inherentlynbetter than anyone else.,The real explanation involves the mannwho became Canada's leader in 1968,,Pierre Trudeau, who is alsonthe father of the current prime minister. 
 (Applause) 
 The thing to know about that first Trudeau,is that he was very differentnfrom Canada's previous leaders.,He was a French speaker in a countrynlong-dominated by its English elite.,He was an intellectual.,He was even kind of groovy.,I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.,He hung out with the Beatles. 
 (Laughter) 
 And like all hipsters,nhe could be infuriating at times.,But he nevertheless pulled off,one of the most progressiventransformations any country has ever seen.,His formula, I've learned,ninvolved two parts.,First, Canada threw outnits old race-based immigration rules,,and it replaced themnwith new color-blind ones,that emphasized education,nexperience and language skills instead.,And what that didnwas greatly increase the odds,that newcomers wouldncontribute to the economy.,Then part two, Trudeauncreated the world's first policy,of official multiculturalismnto promote integration,and the idea that diversitynwas the key to Canada's identity. 
 Now, in the years that followed,nOttawa kept pushing this message,,but at the same time, ordinary Canadians,soon started to see the economic,nthe material benefits of multiculturalism,all around them.,And these two influences soon combined,to create the passionatelynopen-minded Canada of today. 
 Let's now turn to another countrynand an even tougher problem,,Islamic extremism.,In 1998, the people of Indonesiantook to the streets,and overthrewntheir longtime dictator, Suharto.,It was an amazing moment,,but it was also a scary one.,With 250 million people,,Indonesia is the largestnMuslim-majority country on Earth.,It's also hot, huge and unruly,,made up of 17,000 islands,,where people speaknclose to a thousand languages.,Now, Suharto had been a dictator,,and a nasty one.,But he'd also beenna pretty effective tyrant,,and he'd always been carefulnto keep religion out of politics.,So experts feared that withoutnhim keeping a lid on things,,the country would explode,,or religious extremists would take over,and turn Indonesianinto a tropical version of Iran.,And that's just what seemednto happen at first.,In the country'snfirst free elections, in 1999,,Islamist parties scoredn36 percent of the vote,,and the islands burned,as riots and terror attacksnkilled thousands. 
 Since then, however,nIndonesia has taken a surprising turn.,While ordinary folks have grownnmore pious on a personal level --,I saw a lot more headscarvesnon a recent visit,than I would have a decade ago --,the country's politicsnhave moved in the opposite direction.,Indonesia is nowna pretty decent democracy.,And yet, its Islamist partiesnhave steadily lost support,,from a high of about 38 percent in 2004,down to 25 percent in 2014.,As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.,And while a few Indonesiansnhave recently joined ISIS,,their number is tiny,,far fewer in per capita terms,than the number of Belgians.,Try to think of one othernMuslim-majority country,that can say all those same things. 
 In 2014, I went to Indonesianto ask its current president,,a soft-spoken technocratnnamed Joko Widodo,,"Why is Indonesia thriving whennso many other Muslim states are dying?" 
 "Well, what we realized," he told me,,"is that to deal with extremism,nwe needed to deal with inequality first." 
 See, Indonesia's religious parties,nlike similar parties elsewhere,,had tended to focus on things likenreducing poverty and cutting corruption.,So that's what Jokonand his predecessors did too,,thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.,They also cracked down hard on terrorism,,but Indonesia's democratsnhave learned a key lesson,from the dark years of dictatorship,,namely that repressionnonly creates more extremism.,So they waged their warnwith extraordinary delicacy.,They used the police instead of the army.,They only detained suspectsnif they had enough evidence.,They held public trials.,They even sentnliberal imams into the jails,to persuade the jihadistsnthat terror is un-Islamic.,And all of this paid offnin spectacular fashion,,creating the kind of countrynthat was unimaginable 20 years ago. 
 So at this point,nmy optimism should, I hope,,be starting to make a bit more sense.,Neither immigration nor Islamic extremismnare impossible to deal with.,Join me now on one last trip,,this time to Mexico.,Now, of our three stories,nthis one probably surprised me the most,,since as you all know,,the country is still strugglingnwith so many problems.,And yet, a few years ago,nMexico did something,that many other countriesnfrom France to India to the United States,can still only dream of.,It shattered the political paralysisnthat had gripped it for years. 
 To understand how,nwe need to rewind to the year 2000,,when Mexico finally became a democracy.,Rather than use their new freedomsnto fight for reform,,Mexico's politicians used themnto fight one another.,Congress deadlocked,nand the country's problems --,drugs, poverty, crime, corruption --,spun out of control.,Things got so bad that in 2008,,the Pentagon warnednthat Mexico risked collapse. 
 Then in 2012, this guynnamed Enrique Peña Nieto,somehow got himself elected president.,Now, this Peña hardly inspirednmuch confidence at first.,Sure, he was handsome,,but he came from Mexico'sncorrupt old ruling party, the PRI,,and he was a notorious womanizer.,In fact, he seemednlike such a pretty boy lightweight,that women called him "bombón," sweetie,,at campaign rallies.,And yet this same bombónnsoon surprised everyone,by hammering out a truce,between the country'snthree warring political parties.,And over the next 18 months,nthey together passed,an incredibly comprehensivenset of reforms.,They busted open Mexico'snsmothering monopolies.,They liberalizednits rusting energy sector.,They restructurednits failing schools, and much more.,To appreciate the scalenof this accomplishment,,try to imagine the US Congressnpassing immigration reform,,campaign finance reformnand banking reform.,Now, try to imagine Congressndoing it all at the same time.,That's what Mexico did. 
 Not long ago, I met with Peñanand asked how he managed it all.,The President flashed menhis famous twinkly smile -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and told me that the short answernwas "compromiso," compromise.,Of course, I pushed him for details,,and the long answernthat came out was essentially,"compromise, compromisenand more compromise.",See, Peña knew that he needednto build trust early,,so he started talking to the oppositionnjust days after his election.,To ward off pressurenfrom special interests,,he kept their meetings small and secret,,and many of the participantsnlater told me that it was this intimacy,,plus a lot of shared tequila,,that helped build confidence.,So did the fact that all decisionsnhad to be unanimous,,and that Peña even agreed to passnsome of the other party's priorities,before his own.,As Santiago Creel,nan opposition senator, put it to me,,"Look, I'm not saying that I'm specialnor that anyone is special,,but that group, that was special.",The proof?,When Peña was sworn in, the pact held,,and Mexico moved forwardnfor the first time in years.,Bueno. 
 So now we've seennhow these three countries,overcame three of their great challenges.,And that's very nice for them, right?,But what good does it do the rest of us? 
 Well, in the course of studying thesenand a bunch of other success stories,,like the way Rwanda pulled itselfnback together after civil war,or Brazil has reduced inequality,,or South Korea has kept its economyngrowing faster and for longer,than any other country on Earth,,I've noticed a few common threads. 
 Now, before describing them,nI need to add a caveat.,I realize, of course,nthat all countries are unique.,So you can't simplyntake what worked in one,,port it to anothernand expect it to work there too.,Nor do specific solutions work forever.,You've got to adapt themnas circumstances change. 
 That said, by strippingnthese stories to their essence,,you absolutely can distillna few common tools for problem-solving,that will work in other countries,and in boardrooms,and in all sorts of other contexts, too. 
 Number one, embrace the extreme.,In all the stories we've just looked at,,salvation came at a momentnof existential peril.,And that was no coincidence.,Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,nhe faced two looming dangers.,First, though his vast,nunderpopulated country,badly needed more bodies,,its preferred sourcenfor white workers, Europe,,had just stopped exporting themnas it finally recovered from World War II.,The other problem wasnthat Canada's long cold war,between its Frenchnand its English communities,had just become a hot one.,Quebec was threatening to secede,,and Canadians were actuallynkilling other Canadians over politics.,Now, countries facencrises all the time. Right?,That's nothing special.,But Trudeau's geniusnwas to realize that Canada's crisis,had swept away all the hurdlesnthat usually block reform.,Canada had to open up. It had no choice.,And it had to rethink its identity.,Again, it had no choice.,And that gave Trudeauna once-in-a-generation opportunity,to break the old rules and write new ones.,And like all our other heroes,nhe was smart enough to seize it. 
 Number two, there's powernin promiscuous thinking.,Another striking similaritynamong good problem-solvers,is that they're all pragmatists.,They'll steal the best answersnfrom wherever they find them,,and they don't let details,like party or ideologynor sentimentality get in their way.,As I mentioned earlier,nIndonesia's democrats were clever enough,to steal many of the Islamists'nbest campaign promises for themselves.,They even invited some of the radicalsninto their governing coalition.,Now, that horrifiedna lot of secular Indonesians.,But by forcing the radicalsnto actually help govern,,it quickly exposed the factnthat they weren't any good at the job,,and it got them mixed upnin all of the grubby compromises,and petty humiliationsnthat are part of everyday politics.,And that hurt their image so badlynthat they've never recovered. 
 Number three,,please all of the people some of the time.,I know I just mentioned how crisesncan grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.,And that's true, but problem-solvingnoften requires more than just boldness.,It takes showing restraint, too,,just when that'snthe last thing you want to do.,Take Trudeau: when he took office,,he could easily have putnhis core constituency,,that is Canada's French community, first.,He could have pleasednsome of the people all of the time.,And Peña could have used his powernto keep attacking the opposition,,as was traditional in Mexico.,Yet he chose to embracenhis enemies instead,,while forcing his own party to compromise.,And Trudeau pushed everyonento stop thinking in tribal terms,and to see multiculturalism,nnot language and not skin color,,as what made themnquintessentially Canadian.,Nobody got everything they wanted,,but everyone got just enoughnthat the bargains held. 
 So at this point you may be thinking,,"OK, Tepperman,,if the fixes really are out therenlike you keep insisting,,then why aren't more countriesnalready using them?",It's not like they requirenspecial powers to pull off.,I mean, none of the leadersnwe've just looked at were superheroes.,They didn't accomplishnanything on their own,,and they all had plenty of flaws.,Take Indonesia'snfirst democratic president,,Abdurrahman Wahid.,This man was so powerfully uncharismatic,that he once fell asleep,in the middle of his own speech. 
 (Laughter) 
 True story. 
 So what this tells usnis that the real obstacle is not ability,,and it's not circumstances.,It's something much simpler.,Making big changesninvolves taking big risks,,and taking big risks is scary.,Overcoming that fear requires guts,,and as you all know,,gutsy politicians are painfully rare.,But that doesn't mean we voters,can't demand couragenfrom our political leaders.,I mean, that's why we put themnin office in the first place.,And given the state of the world today,nthere's really no other option. 
 The answers are out there,,but now it's up to us,to elect more women and men,brave enough to find them,,to steal them,and to make them work. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Twelve years ago, I picked upna camera for the first time,to film the olive harvestnin a Palestinian village in the West Bank.,I thought I was therento make a single documentary,and would then move onnto some other part of the world.,But something kept bringing me back. 
 Now, usually, when international audiencesnhear about that part of the world,,they often just wantnthat conflict to go away.,The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad,nand we wish it could just disappear.,We feel much the same waynabout other conflicts around the world.,But every time we turnnour attention to the news,,it seems like one more countrynhas gone up in flames.,So I've been wondering,whether we should not startnlooking at conflict in a different way --,whether instead of simplynwishing to end conflict,,we focus instead on how to wage conflict.,This has been a big question for me,,one I've pursued together with my teamnat the nonprofit Just Vision.,After witnessing several different kindsnof struggles in the Middle East,,I started noticing some patternsnon the more successful ones.,I wondered whether these variablesnheld across cases, and if they did,,what lessons we could gleannfor waging constructive conflict,,in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere. 
 There is some science about this.,In a study of 323nmajor political conflicts,from 1900 to 2006,,Maria Stephan and Erica Chenowethnfound that nonviolent campaigns,were almost 100 percent more likelynto lead to success than violent campaigns.,Nonviolent campaigns are alsonless likely to cause physical harm,to those waging the campaign,,as well as their opponents.,And, critically, they typically leadnto more peaceful and democratic societies.,In other words, nonviolent resistancenis a more effective and constructive way,of waging conflict. 
 But if that's such an easy choice,nwhy don't more groups use it?,Political scientist Victor Asalnand colleagues,have looked at several factors,that shape a political group'snchoice of tactics.,And it turns outnthat the greatest predictor,of a movement's decisionnto adopt nonviolence or violence,is not whether that groupnis more left-wing or right-wing,,not whether the group is more or lessninfluenced by religious beliefs,,not whether it's up againstna democracy or a dictatorship,,and not even the levels of repressionnthat that group is facing.,The greatest predictor of a movement'sndecision to adopt nonviolence,is its ideology regardingnthe role of women in public life. 
 (Applause) 
 When a movement includes in its discourse,language around gender equality,,it increases dramaticallynthe chances it will adopt nonviolence,,and thus, the likelihood it will succeed. 
 The research squared upnwith my own documentation,of political organizingnin Israel and Palestine.,I've noticed that movements whichnwelcome women into leadership positions,,such as the one I documentednin a village called Budrus,,were much more likelynto achieve their goals.,This village was under a real threatnof being wiped off the map,when Israel started buildingnthe separation barrier.,The proposed route would require,the destruction of this community'snolive groves, their cemeteries,and would ultimatelynenclose the village from all sides.,Through inspired local leadership,,they launched a nonviolent resistancencampaign to stop that from happening.,The odds were massivelynstacked against them.,But they had a secret weapon:,a 15-year-old girl,who courageously jumpednin front of a bulldozer,which was about to uprootnan olive tree, stopping it.,In that moment, the communitynof Budrus realized what was possible,if they welcomed and encouraged womennto participate in public life.,And so it was that the women of Budrusnwent to the front lines day after day,,using their creativity and acumennto overcome multiple obstacles they faced,in a 10-month unarmed struggle.,And as you can probablyntell at this point,,they win at the end. 
 The separation barriernwas changed completely,to the internationallynrecognized green line,,and the women of Budrusncame to be known across the West Bank,for their indomitable energy. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 I want to pause for a second,nwhich you helped me do,,because I do want to tacklentwo very serious misunderstandings,that could happen at this point.,The first one is that I don't believe,women are inherently or essentiallynmore peaceful than men.,But I do believe that in today's world,,women experience power differently.,Having had to navigatenbeing in the less powerful position,in multiple aspects of their lives,,women are often more adept,at how to surreptitiouslynpressure for change,against large, powerful actors.,The term "manipulative," often chargednagainst women in a derogatory way,,reflects a reality in which womennhave often had to find ways,other than direct confrontationnto achieve their goals.,And finding alternativesnto direct confrontation,is at the core of nonviolent resistance. 
 Now to the secondnpotential misunderstanding.,I've been talking a lot aboutnmy experiences in the Middle East,,and some of you might be thinking now,that the solution then is for usnto educate Muslim and Arab societies,to be more inclusive of their women.,If we were to do that,nthey would be more successful.,They do not need this kind of help.,Women have been partnof the most influential movements,coming out of the Middle East,,but they tend to be invisiblento the international community.,Our cameras are largely focused on the men,who often end up involvednin the more confrontational scenes,that we find so irresistiblenin our news cycle.,And we end up with a narrativenthat not only erases women,from the struggles in the region,but often misrepresentsnthe struggles themselves. 
 In the late 1980s,nan uprising started in Gaza,,and quickly spread to the West Banknand East Jerusalem.,It came to be known as the First Intifada,,and people who havenany visual memory of it,generally conjure up something like this:,Palestinian mennthrowing rocks at Israeli tanks.,The news coverage at the time,made it seem like stones,nMolotov cocktails and burning tires,were the only activitiesntaking place in the Intifada.,This period, though, was also markednby widespread nonviolent organizing,in the forms of strikes, sit-insnand the creation of parallel institutions. 
 During the First Intifada,,whole sectors of the Palestinianncivilian population mobilized,,cutting across generations,nfactions and class lines.,They did this through networksnof popular committees,,and their use of direct actionnand communal self-help projects,challenged Israel's very ability,to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.,According to the Israeli Army itself,,97 percent of activitiesnduring the First Intifada were unarmed. 
 And here's another thing that is notnpart of our narrative about that time.,For 18 months in the Intifada,,women were the onesncalling the shots behind the scenes:,Palestinian women from all walks of life,in charge of mobilizingnhundreds of thousands of people,in a concerted effort to withdrawnconsent from the occupation.,Naela Ayesh, who strived to buildna self-sufficient Palestinian economy,by encouraging women in Gazanto grow vegetables in their backyards,,an activity deemed illegalnby the Israeli authorities at that time;,Rabeha Diab, who took overndecision-making authority,for the entire uprising,when the men who had been running it,were deported;,Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leafletsncontaining the uprising's directives,in order to spread themnacross the territories,without getting caught;,and Zahira Kamal,,who ensured the longevity of the uprising,by leading an organization,that went from 25 womennto 3,000 in a single year.,Despite their extraordinary achievements,,none of these women have made itninto our narrative of the First Intifada. 
 We do this in other partsnof the globe, too.,In our history books, for instance,nand in our collective consciousness,,men are the public faces and spokespersons,for the 1960s strugglenfor racial justice in the United States.,But women were alsona critical driving force,,mobilizing, organizing,ntaking to the streets.,How many of us think of Septima Clark,when we think of the United StatesnCivil Rights era?,Remarkably few.,But she played a crucial rolenin every phase of the struggle,,particularly by emphasizingnliteracy and education.,She's been omitted, ignored,,like so many other womennwho played critical roles,in the United StatesnCivil Rights Movement. 
 This is not about getting credit.,It's more profound than that.,The stories we tell matter deeplynto how we see ourselves,,and to how we believe movements are run,and how movements are won.,The stories we tell about a movementnlike the First Intifada,or the United States Civil Rights era,matter deeplynand have a critical influence,in the choices Palestinians,,Americans,and people around the world will make,next time they encounter an injustice,and develop the courage to confront it.,If we do not lift up the women who playedncritical roles in these struggles,,we fail to offer up role modelsnto future generations.,Without role models, it becomes harder,for women to take up their rightful space,in public life.,And as we saw earlier,,one of the most critical variables,in determining whetherna movement will be successful or not,is a movement's ideologynregarding the role of women,in public life. 
 This is a question of whether we're moving,towards more democraticnand peaceful societies.,In a world where so muchnchange is happening,,and where change is bound to continuenat an increasingly faster pace,,it is not a questionnof whether we will face conflict,,but rather a question,of which stories will shape,how we choose to wage conflict. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk a little bitnabout where technology's going.,And often technology comes to us,,we're surprised by what it brings.,But there's actuallyna large aspect of technology,that's much more predictable,,and that's because technological systemsnof all sorts have leanings,,they have urgencies,,they have tendencies.,And those tendencies are derivednfrom the very nature of the physics,,chemistry of wiresnand switches and electrons,,and they will make reoccurringnpatterns again and again.,And so those patterns producenthese tendencies, these leanings. 
 You can almost think of itnas sort of like gravity.,Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.,The actual path of a raindropnas it goes down the valley,is unpredictable.,We cannot see where it's going,,but the general directionnis very inevitable:,it's downward.,And so these baked-inntendencies and urgencies,in technological systems,give us a sense of where thingsnare going at the large form.,So in a large sense,,I would say that telephonesnwere inevitable,,but the iPhone was not.,The Internet was inevitable,,but Twitter was not. 
 So we have many ongoingntendencies right now,,and I think one of the chief among them,is this tendency to make thingsnsmarter and smarter.,I call it cognifying -- cognification --,also known as artificialnintelligence, or AI.,And I think that's going to be onenof the most influential developments,and trends and directions and drivesnin our society in the next 20 years. 
 So, of course, it's already here.,We already have AI,,and often it works in the background,,in the back offices of hospitals,,where it's used to diagnose X-raysnbetter than a human doctor.,It's in legal offices,,where it's used to gonthrough legal evidence,better than a human paralawyer.,It's used to fly the planenthat you came here with.,Human pilots only flew itnseven to eight minutes,,the rest of the time the AI was driving.,And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,,it's in the background,nmaking those recommendations.,That's what we have today. 
 And we have an example, of course,nin a more front-facing aspect of it,,with the win of the AlphaGo, who beatnthe world's greatest Go champion.,But it's more than that.,If you play a video game,nyou're playing against an AI.,But recently, Google taught their AI,to actually learn how to play video games.,Again, teaching video gamesnwas already done,,but learning how to playna video game is another step.,That's artificial smartness.,What we're doing is takingnthis artificial smartness,and we're making it smarter and smarter. 
 There are three aspectsnto this general trend,that I think are underappreciated;,I think we would understandnAI a lot better,if we understood these three things.,I think these things also wouldnhelp us embrace AI,,because it's only by embracing itnthat we actually can steer it.,We can actually steer the specificsnby embracing the larger trend. 
 So let me talk aboutnthose three different aspects.,The first one is: our own intelligencenhas a very poor understanding,of what intelligence is.,We tend to think of intelligencenas a single dimension,,that it's kind of like a notenthat gets louder and louder.,It starts like with IQ measurement.,It starts with maybe a simplenlow IQ in a rat or mouse,,and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,,and then maybe there's morenin a stupid person,,and then maybe an averagenperson like myself,,and then maybe a genius.,And this single IQ intelligencenis getting greater and greater.,That's completely wrong.,That's not what intelligence is --nnot what human intelligence is, anyway.,It's much more like a symphonynof different notes,,and each of these notes is playednon a different instrument of cognition. 
 There are many typesnof intelligences in our own minds.,We have deductive reasoning,,we have emotional intelligence,,we have spatial intelligence;,we have maybe 100 different typesnthat are all grouped together,,and they vary in different strengthsnwith different people.,And of course, if we go to animals,nthey also have another basket --,another symphony of differentnkinds of intelligences,,and sometimes those same instrumentsnare the same that we have.,They can think in the same way,nbut they may have a different arrangement,,and maybe they're highernin some cases than humans,,like long-term memory in a squirrelnis actually phenomenal,,so it can remembernwhere it buried its nuts.,But in other cases they may be lower. 
 When we go to make machines,,we're going to engineernthem in the same way,,where we'll make some of those typesnof smartness much greater than ours,,and many of them won't benanywhere near ours,,because they're not needed.,So we're going to take these things,,these artificial clusters,,and we'll be adding more varietiesnof artificial cognition to our AIs.,We're going to make themnvery, very specific. 
 So your calculator is smarternthan you are in arithmetic already;,your GPS is smarternthan you are in spatial navigation;,Google, Bing, are smarternthan you are in long-term memory.,And we're going to take, again,nthese kinds of different types of thinking,and we'll put them into, like, a car.,The reason why we want to put themnin a car so the car drives,,is because it's not driving like a human.,It's not thinking like us.,That's the whole feature of it.,It's not being distracted,,it's not worrying about whethernit left the stove on,,or whether it should havenmajored in finance.,It's just driving. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just driving, OK?,And we actually might evenncome to advertise these,as "consciousness-free.",They're without consciousness,,they're not concerned about those things,,they're not distracted. 
 So in general, what we're trying to do,is make as many differentntypes of thinking as we can.,We're going to populate the space,of all the different possible types,nor species, of thinking.,And there actually may be some problems,that are so difficultnin business and science,that our own type of human thinkingnmay not be able to solve them alone.,We may need a two-step program,,which is to invent new kinds of thinking,that we can work alongside of to solventhese really large problems,,say, like dark energy or quantum gravity. 
 What we're doingnis making alien intelligences.,You might even think of thisnas, sort of, artificial aliens,in some senses.,And they're going to helpnus think different,,because thinking differentnis the engine of creation,and wealth and new economy. 
 The second aspect of thisnis that we are going to use AI,to basically make a secondnIndustrial Revolution.,The first Industrial Revolutionnwas based on the fact,that we invented somethingnI would call artificial power.,Previous to that,,during the Agricultural Revolution,,everything that was madenhad to be made with human muscle,or animal power.,That was the only waynto get anything done.,The great innovation duringnthe Industrial Revolution was,,we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,,to make this artificial powernthat we could use,to do anything we wanted to do.,So today when you drive down the highway,,you are, with a flick of the switch,ncommanding 250 horses --,250 horsepower --,which we can use to build skyscrapers,nto build cities, to build roads,,to make factories that would churn outnlines of chairs or refrigerators,way beyond our own power.,And that artificial power can alsonbe distributed on wires on a grid,to every home, factory, farmstead,,and anybody could buynthat artificial power,,just by plugging something in. 
 So this was a sourcenof innovation as well,,because a farmer could takena manual hand pump,,and they could add this artificialnpower, this electricity,,and he'd have an electric pump.,And you multiply that by thousandsnor tens of thousands of times,,and that formula was what brought usnthe Industrial Revolution.,All the things that we see,nall this progress that we now enjoy,,has come from the factnthat we've done that. 
 We're going to donthe same thing now with AI.,We're going to distribute that on a grid,,and now you can take that electric pump.,You can add some artificial intelligence,,and now you have a smart pump.,And that, multiplied by a million times,,is going to be this secondnIndustrial Revolution.,So now the car is going down the highway,,it's 250 horsepower,nbut in addition, it's 250 minds.,That's the auto-driven car.,It's like a new commodity;,it's a new utility.,The AI is going to flownacross the grid -- the cloud --,in the same way electricity did. 
 So everything that we had electrified,,we're now going to cognify.,And I would suggest, then,,that the formulanfor the next 10,000 start-ups,is very, very simple,,which is to take x and add AI.,That is the formula,nthat's what we're going to be doing.,And that is the waynin which we're going to make,this second Industrial Revolution.,And by the way -- right now, this minute,,you can log on to Google,and you can purchasenAI for six cents, 100 hits.,That's available right now. 
 So the third aspect of this,is that when we take this AInand embody it,,we get robots.,And robots are going to be bots,,they're going to be doing manynof the tasks that we have already done.,A job is just a bunch of tasks,,so they're going to redefine our jobs,because they're going to donsome of those tasks.,But they're also going to createnwhole new categories,,a whole new slew of tasks,that we didn't knownwe wanted to do before.,They're going to actuallynengender new kinds of jobs,,new kinds of tasks that we want done,,just as automation made upna whole bunch of new things,that we didn't know we needed before,,and now we can't live without them.,So they're going to produceneven more jobs than they take away,,but it's important that a lot of the tasksnthat we're going to give them,are tasks that can be definednin terms of efficiency or productivity.,If you can specify a task,,either manual or conceptual,,that can be specified in termsnof efficiency or productivity,,that goes to the bots.,Productivity is for robots.,What we're really good atnis basically wasting time. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're really good at thingsnthat are inefficient.,Science is inherently inefficient.,It runs on that fact that you havenone failure after another.,It runs on the fact that you make testsnand experiments that don't work,,otherwise you're not learning.,It runs on the fact,that there is notna lot of efficiency in it.,Innovation by definition is inefficient,,because you make prototypes,,because you try stuff that fails,nthat doesn't work.,Exploration is inherently inefficiency.,Art is not efficient.,Human relationships are not efficient.,These are all the kinds of thingsnwe're going to gravitate to,,because they're not efficient.,Efficiency is for robots.,We're also going to learnnthat we're going to work with these AIs,because they think differently than us. 
 When Deep Blue beatnthe world's best chess champion,,people thought it was the end of chess.,But actually, it turns out that today,nthe best chess champion in the world,is not an AI.,And it's not a human.,It's the team of a human and an AI.,The best medical diagnosticiannis not a doctor, it's not an AI,,it's the team.,We're going to be working with these AIs,,and I think you'll be paid in the future,by how well you work with these bots.,So that's the third thing,nis that they're different,,they're utility,and they are going to be somethingnwe work with rather than against.,We're working with thesenrather than against them. 
 So, the future:,Where does that take us?,I think that 25 years from now,nthey'll look back,and look at our understandingnof AI and say,,"You didn't have AI. In fact,nyou didn't even have the Internet yet,,compared to what we're goingnto have 25 years from now.",There are no AI experts right now.,There's a lot of money going to it,,there are billions of dollarsnbeing spent on it;,it's a huge business,,but there are no experts, comparednto what we'll know 20 years from now.,So we are just at the beginningnof the beginning,,we're in the first hour of all this.,We're in the first hour of the Internet.,We're in the first hour of what's coming.,The most popular AI productnin 20 years from now,,that everybody uses,,has not been invented yet.,That means that you're not late. 
 Thank you. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)How do we build a society,without fossil fuels? 
 This is a very complex challenge,,and I believe developing countriesncould take the lead in this transition.,And I'm aware that thisnis a contentious statement,,but the reality is that so muchnis at stake in our countries,if we let fossil fuels staynat the center of our development.,We can do it differently.,And it's time, it really is time,,to debunk the myth,that a country has to choosenbetween development on the one hand,and environmental protection,nrenewables, quality of life, on the other. 
 I come from Costa Rica,na developing country.,We are nearly five million people,,and we live right in the middlenof the Americas,,so it's very easynto remember where we live.,Nearly 100 percent of our electricity,comes from renewable sources,,five of them. 
 (Applause) 
 Hydropower, geothermal,,wind, solar, biomass. 
 Did you know that last year,,for 299 days,,we did not use any fossil fuels,in order to generate all our electricity?,It's a fantastic achievement,,and yet, it hides a paradox,,which is that nearly 70 percent,of all our energy consumption is oil. 
 Why?,Because of our transportation system,,which is totally dependentnon fossil fuels,,like it is in most countries.,So if we think of the energyntransition as a marathon,,the question is, how do we getnto the finish line,,how do we decarbonizenthe rest of the economy?,And it's fair to saynthat if we don't succeed,,it's difficult to see who will.,So that is why I wantnto talk to you about Costa Rica,,because I believe we are a great candidate,in pioneering a visionnfor development without fossil fuels. 
 If you know one thing about our country,,it's that we don't have an army.,So I'm going to take you back to 1948.,That year, the countrynwas coming out of civil war.,Thousands of Costa Ricans had died,,and families were bitterly split.,And yet, a surprising ideanwon the hearts and minds:,we would reboot the country,,and that Second Republicnwould have no army.,So we abolished it.,And the president at the time,,José Figueres,,found a powerful waynby smashing the walls of an army base.,The following year, 1949,,we made that decision permanentnin the new constitution,,and that is why I can tell you that storynnearly 70 years later.,And I'm grateful.,I'm grateful they made that decisionnbefore I was born,,because it allowed menand millions of others,to live in a very stable country. 
 And you might be thinkingnthat it was good luck,,but it wasn't.,There was a pattern of deliberate choices.,In the '40s, Costa Ricans were givennfree education and free health care.,We called that social guarantees.,By abolishing the army,,we were able to turn military spendingninto social spending,,and that was a driver of stability.,In the '50s -- 
 (Applause) 
 In the '50s, we startedninvesting in hydropower,,and that kept us away from the trap,of using fossil fuelsnfor electricity generation,,which is what the worldnis struggling with today.,In the '70s we invested in national parks,,and that kept us away,from the deeply flawed logicnof growth, growth, growth at any cost,that you see others embracing,nespecially in the developing world.,In the '90s, we pioneered paymentsnfor ecosystem services,,and that helped us reverse deforestation,and boosted ecotourism,nwhich today is a key engine of growth.,So investing in environmental protection,did not hurt our economy.,Quite the opposite. 
 And it doesn't mean we are perfect,,and it doesn't meannwe don't have contradictions.,That's not the point.,The point is that,nby making our own choices,,we were able to develop resiliencenin dealing with development problems. 
 Also, if you take a country like ours,,the GDP per capitanis around 11,000 dollars,,depending on how you measure it.,But according tonthe Social Progress Index,,we are an absolute outlier,when it comes to turning GDPninto social progress.,Abolishing the army,,investing in nature and people,,did something very powerful, too.,It shaped the narrative,,the narrative of a small countrynwith big ideas,,and it was very empoweringnto grow up with that narrative. 
 So the question is,,what is the next big ideanfor this generation?,And I believe what comes next,is for this generationnto let go of fossil fuels for good,,just as we did with the army. 
 Fossil fuels create climate change.,We know that,,and we know how vulnerable we arento the impacts of climate change.,So as a developing country,nit is in our best interest,to build development without fossil fuels,that harm people in the first place.,Because,why would we continue importing oil,for transportation,if we can use electricity instead? 
 Remember,,this is the country,where electricityncomes from water in our rivers,,heat from volcanoes,,wind turbines, solar panels,,biowaste.,Abolishing fossil fuels meansndisrupting our transportation system,so that we can power our cars,nbuses and trains with electricity,instead of dirty energy. 
 And transportation, let me tell you,,has become an existential issuenfor us Costa Ricans,,because the model we havenis not working for us.,It's hurting people,,it's hurting companies,,and it's hurting our health. 
 Because when policiesnand infrastructure fail,,this is what happens on a daily basis.,Two hours in the morning,,two hours in the evening.,I don't understand whynwe have to accept this as normal.,It's offensive,to have to waste our time like thisnevery single day.,And this highway is actually quite good,compared to what you seenin other countries,where traffic is exploding.,You know, Costa Ricans call this "presa.",Presa means "imprisoned.",And people are turning violent,in a country that is otherwisenhappy in pura vida.,It's happening.,So a lot is at stake. 
 The good news,is that when we talknabout clean transportation,and different mobility,,we're not talking aboutnsome distant utopia out there.,We're talking about electric mobilitynthat is happening today.,By 2022, electric carsnand conventional cars,are expected to cost the same,,and cities are already tryingnelectric buses.,And these really cool creatures,are saving money,,and they reduce pollution.,So if we want to get ridnof oil-based transportation, we can,,because we have options nownthat we didn't have before.,It's really exciting. 
 But of course,,some get very uncomfortablenwith this idea,,and they will come and they will tell you,that the world is stuck with oil,nand so is Costa Rica, so get real.,That's what they tell you.,And you know what the answernto that argument is?,That in 1948, we didn't saynthe world is stuck with armies,,so let's keep our army, too.,No, we made a very brave choice,,and that choice made the whole difference. 
 So it's time for this generationnto be brave again,and abolish fossil fuels for good.,And I'll give you three reasonsnwhy we have to do this. 
 First,,our model of transportationnand urbanization is broken,,so this is the best momentnto redefine our urban and mobility future.,We don't want citiesnthat are built for cars.,We want cities for people,where we can walk and we can use bikes.,And we want public transportation,,lots of it,,public transportationnthat is clean and dignifying.,Because if we continuenadding fleets of conventional cars,,our cities will become unbearable. 
 Second, we have to change,,but incremental changenis not going to be sufficient.,We need transformational change.,And there are somenincremental projects in my country,,and I am the first one to celebrate them.,But let's not kid ourselves.,We're not talking about ending upnwith really beautiful electric cars here,and a few electric buses there,while we keep investingnin the same kind of infrastructure,,more cars, more roads, more oil.,We're talking aboutnbreaking free from oil,,and you cannot get therenthrough incrementalism. 
 Third, and you know this one,,the world is hungry for inspiration.,It craves stories of success,in dealing with complex issues,,especially in developing countries.,So I believe Costa Ricancan be an inspiration to others,,as we did last year when we disclosed,that for so many daysnwe were not using any fossil fuels,in order to generate all our electricity.,The news went viral around the world.,Also, and this makes me extremely proud,,a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,,played a decisive role in the negotiationsnof the Paris climate agreement.,So we have to protect that legacynand be an example. 
 So what comes next?,The people.,How do we get people to own this?,How do we get people,to believe that it's possible,to build a society without fossil fuels?,A lot of work fromnthe ground up is needed. 
 That is why, in 2014,nwe created Costa Rica Limpia.,"Limpia" means "clean,",because we want to empowernand we want to inspire citizens.,If citizens don't get engaged,,clean transportation decisionsnwill be bogged down by endless,,and I mean endless, technical discussions,,and by avalanches of lobbyingnby various established interests.,Wanting to be a green countrynpowered by renewables,is already part of our story.,We should not let anybodyntake that away from us. 
 Last year, we brought peoplenfrom our seven provinces,to talk about climate changenin terms that matter to them,,and we also brought this year,another group of Costa Ricans,to talk about renewable energy.,And you know what?,These people disagree on almost everything,except on renewable energy,and clean transportation and clean air.,It brings people together. 
 And the key to real participation,is to help people not to feel small.,People feel powerless,,and they are tired of not being heard.,So what we do is concrete things,,and we translate technical issuesninto citizen language,to show that citizens have a role to playnand can play it together.,For the first time, we're trackingnthe promises that were made,on clean transportation,,and politicos knownthat they have to deliver it,,but the tipping point will comenwhen we form coalitions --,citizens, companies,,champions of public transportation --,that will make electric mobilitynthe new normal,,especially in a developing country. 
 By the time the next election comes,,I believe every candidatenwill have to disclose where they stand,on the abolition of fossil fuels.,Because this questionnhas to enter our mainstream politics.,And I'm telling you,nthis is not a question of climate policy,or environmental agenda.,It's about the country that we want,and the cities that we have,and the cities that we want,and who makes that choice.,Because at the end of the day,nwhat we have to show,is that development with renewable energy,is good for the people,,for Costa Ricans that are alive today,and especially for thosenwho haven't been born. 
 This is our National Museum today.,It's bright and peaceful,,and when you stand up in front of it,,it's really hard to believenthese were military barracks,at the end of the '40s.,We started a new lifenwithout an army in this place,,and here is where our abolition,of fossil fuels will be announced one day.,And we will make history again. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Let's talk about trust.,We all know trust is fundamental,,but when it comes to trusting people,,something profound is happening. 
 Please raise your hand,if you have ever beenna host or a guest on Airbnb.,Wow. That's a lot of you. 
 Who owns Bitcoin?,Still a lot of you. OK. 
 And please raise your handnif you've ever used Tinder,to help you find a mate. 
 (Laughter) 
 This one's really hard to countnbecause you're kind of going like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 These are all examples of how technology,is creating new mechanisms,that are enabling us to trustnunknown people, companies and ideas.,And yet at the same time,,trust in institutions --,banks, governments and even churches --,is collapsing.,So what's happening here,,and who do you trust? 
 Let's start in France with a platform --nwith a company, I should say --,with a rather funny-sounding name,,BlaBlaCar.,It's a platform that matchesndrivers and passengers,who want to sharenlong-distance journeys together.,The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.,So it's a good ideanto choose your fellow travelers wisely.,Social profiles and reviewsnhelp people make a choice.,You can see if someone's a smoker,nyou can see what kind of music they like,,you can see if they're going to bringntheir dog along for the ride.,But it turns outnthat the key social identifier,is how much you're goingnto talk in the car. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bla, not a lot,,bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,,and bla bla bla, you're not goingnto stop talking the entire way,from London to Paris. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's remarkable, right,nthat this idea works at all,,because it's counter to the lessonnmost of us were taught as a child:,never get in a car with a stranger.,And yet, BlaBlaCar transportsnmore than four million people,every single month.,To put that in context,nthat's more passengers,than the Eurostarnor JetBlue airlines carry.,BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustrationnof how technology is enabling,millions of people across the worldnto take a trust leap. 
 A trust leap happens when we take the risknto do something new or different,to the way that we've always done it.,Let's try to visualize this together.,OK. I want you to close your eyes.,There is a man staring at menwith his eyes wide open.,I'm on this big red circle. I can see.,So close your eyes. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 I'll do it with you.,And I want you to imaginenthere exists a gap,between you and something unknown.,That unknown can bensomeone you've just met.,It can be a place you've never been to.,It can be somethingnyou've never tried before.,You got it?,OK. You can open your eyes now.,For you to leap from a place of certainty,,to take a chance on that someonenor something unknown,,you need a force to pull you over the gap,,and that remarkable force is trust. 
 Trust is an elusive concept,,and yet we depend on itnfor our lives to function.,I trust my children,when they say they're goingnto turn the lights out at night.,I trusted the pilotnwho flew me here to keep me safe.,It's a word we use a lot,,without always thinkingnabout what it really means,and how it works in differentncontexts of our lives. 
 There are, in fact,nhundreds of definitions of trust,,and most can be reducednto some kind of risk assessment,of how likely it isnthat things will go right.,But I don't like this definition of trust,,because it makes trustnsound rational and predictable,,and it doesn't really getnto the human essence,of what it enables us to do,and how it empowers us,to connect with other people. 
 So I define trust a little differently.,I define trust as a confidentnrelationship to the unknown.,Now, when you view trustnthrough this lens,,it starts to explainnwhy it has the unique capacity,to enable us to cope with uncertainty,,to place our faith in strangers,,to keep moving forward. 
 Human beings are remarkable,at taking trust leaps.,Do you remember the first timenyou put your credit card details,into a website?,That's a trust leap.,I distinctly remember telling my dad,that I wanted to buy a navy bluensecondhand Peugeot on eBay,,and he rightfully pointed out,that the seller's namenwas "Invisible Wizard",and that this probablynwas not such a good idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 So my work, my researchnfocuses on how technology,is transformingnthe social glue of society,,trust between people,,and it's a fascinating area to study,,because there's stillnso much we do not know.,For instance, do men and womenntrust differently in digital environments?,Does the way we build trustnface-to-face translate online?,Does trust transfer?,So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,,are you more likelynto trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar? 
 But from studying hundredsnof networks and marketplaces,,there is a common patternnthat people follow,,and I call it "climbing the trust stack.",Let me use BlaBlaCarnas an example to bring it to life.,On the first level,,you have to trust the idea.,So you have to trust,the idea of ride-sharingnis safe and worth trying.,The second level is about havingnconfidence in the platform,,that BlaBlaCar will help younif something goes wrong.,And the third level is aboutnusing little bits of information,to decide whethernthe other person is trustworthy. 
 Now, the first timenwe climb the trust stack,,it feels weird, even risky,,but we get to a pointnwhere these ideas seem totally normal.,Our behaviors transform,,often relatively quickly.,In other words, trust enablesnchange and innovation. 
 So an idea that intrigued me,nand I'd like you to consider,,is whether we can better understand,major waves of disruption and changenin individuals in society,through the lens of trust.,Well, it turns outnthat trust has only evolved,in three significant chaptersnthroughout the course of human history:,local, institutional,and what we're now entering, distributed. 
 So for a long time,,until the mid-1800s,,trust was builtnaround tight-knit relationships.,So say I lived in a village,with the first five rows of this audience,,and we all knew one another,,and say I wanted to borrow money.,The man who had his eyes wide open,nhe might lend it to me,,and if I didn't pay him back,,you'd all know I was dodgy.,I would get a bad reputation,,and you would refusento do business with me in the future.,Trust was mostly localnand accountability-based. 
 In the mid-19th century,,society went throughna tremendous amount of change.,People moved to fast-growing citiesnsuch as London and San Francisco,,and a local banker herenwas replaced by large corporations,that didn't know us as individuals.,We started to place our trust,into black box systems of authority,,things like legal contractsnand regulation and insurance,,and less trust directly in other people.,Trust became institutionalnand commission-based. 
 It's widely talked about how trustnin institutions and many corporate brands,has been steadily decliningnand continues to do so.,I am constantly stunnednby major breaches of trust:,the News Corp phone hacking,,the Volkswagen emissions scandal,,the widespread abusenin the Catholic Church,,the fact that only one measly banker,went to jail after the greatnfinancial crisis,,or more recently the Panama Papers,that revealed how the richncan exploit offshore tax regimes.,And the thing that really surprises me,is why do leaders find it so hard,to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,,when our trust is broken? 
 It would be easy to concludenthat institutional trust isn't working,because we are fed up,with the sheer audacitynof dishonest elites,,but what's happening now,runs deeper than the rampant questioningnof the size and structure of institutions.,We're starting to realize,that institutional trust,wasn't designed for the digital age.,Conventions of how trust is built,,managed, lost and repaired --,in brands, leaders and entire systems --,is being turned upside down. 
 Now, this is exciting,,but it's frightening,,because it forces many of usnto have to rethink,how trust is built and destroyednwith our customers, with our employees,,even our loved ones. 
 The other day, I was talking to the CEOnof a leading international hotel brand,,and as is often the case,nwe got onto the topic of Airbnb.,And he admitted to menthat he was perplexed by their success.,He was perplexed at how a company,that depends on the willingnessnof strangers to trust one another,could work so well across 191 countries.,So I said to himnthat I had a confession to make,,and he looked at me a bit strangely,,and I said --,and I'm sure many of youndo this as well --,I don't always bother to hang my towels up,when I'm finished in the hotel,,but I would never do thisnas a guest on Airbnb.,And the reason why I would never do thisnas a guest on Airbnb,is because guests knownthat they'll be rated by hosts,,and that those ratingsnare likely to impact their ability,to transact in the future.,It's a simple illustration of hownonline trust will change our behaviors,in the real world,,make us more accountable,in ways we cannot yet even imagine. 
 I am not saying we do not need hotels,or traditional forms of authority.,But what we cannot deny,is that the way trustnflows through society is changing,,and it's creating this big shift,away from the 20th century,that was defined by institutional trust,towards the 21st century,that will be fueled by distributed trust.,Trust is no longer top-down.,It's being unbundled and inverted.,It's no longer opaque and linear.,A new recipe for trust is emerging,that once againnis distributed amongst people,and is accountability-based. 
 And this shift is only going to accelerate,with the emergence of the blockchain,,the innovative ledger technologynunderpinning Bitcoin.,Now let's be honest,,getting our heads aroundnthe way blockchain works,is mind-blowing.,And one of the reasons whynis it involves processing,some pretty complicated concepts,with terrible names.,I mean, cryptographic algorithmsnand hash functions,,and people called miners,nwho verify transactions --,all that was creatednby this mysterious person,or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.,Now, that is a massive trust leapnthat hasn't happened yet. 
 (Applause) 
 But let's try to imagine this.,So "The Economist"neloquently described the blockchain,as the great chainnof being sure about things.,The easiest way I can describe itnis imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,,and they are filled with assets.,So that could be a property title.,It could be a stock trade.,It could be a creative asset,nsuch as the rights to a song.,Every time something moves,from one place on the registernto somewhere else,,that asset transfer is time-stamped,and publicly recorded on the blockchain.,It's that simple. Right. 
 So the real implication of the blockchain,is that it removes the neednfor any kind of third party,,such as a lawyer,,or a trusted intermediary,nor maybe not a government intermediary,to facilitate the exchange.,So if we go back to the trust stack,,you still have to trust the idea,,you have to trust the platform,,but you don't have to trustnthe other person,in the traditional sense. 
 The implications are huge.,In the same way the internet blew opennthe doors to an age of information,available to everyone,,the blockchain will revolutionizentrust on a global scale. 
 Now, I've waited to the endnintentionally to mention Uber,,because I recognizenthat it is a contentious,and widely overused example,,but in the context of a new era of trust,nit's a great case study.,Now, we will see cases of abusenof distributed trust.,We've already seen this,nand it can go horribly wrong.,I am not surprised that we are seeingnprotests from taxi associations,all around the world,trying to get governments to ban Ubernbased on claims that it is unsafe.,I happened to be in Londonnthe day that these protests took place,,and I happened to notice a tweet,from Matt Hancock, who isna British minister for business. 
 And he wrote,,"Does anyone have details of thisn#Uber app everyone's talking about? 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd never heard of it until today." 
 Now, the taxi associations,,they legitimized the first layernof the trust stack.,They legitimized the ideanthat they were trying to eliminate,,and sign-ups increasednby 850 percent in 24 hours.,Now, this is a really strong illustration,of how once a trust shift has happenednaround a behavior or an entire sector,,you cannot reverse the story.,Every day, five million peoplenwill take a trust leap,and ride with Uber.,In China, on Didi,nthe ride-sharing platform,,11 million rides taken every day.,That's 127 rides per second,,showing that this isna cross-cultural phenomenon. 
 And the fascinating thing isnthat both drivers and passengers report,that seeing a name,and seeing someone's photonand their rating,makes them feel safer,,and as you may have experienced,,even behave a little more nicelynin the taxi cab.,Uber and Didi are earlynbut powerful examples,of how technologynis creating trust between people,in ways and on a scalennever possible before. 
 Today, many of us are comfortablengetting into cars driven by strangers.,We meet up with someonenwe swiped right to be matched with.,We share our homesnwith people we do not know. 
 This is just the beginning,,because the real disruption happening,isn't technological.,It's the trust shift it creates,,and for my part, I want to help peoplenunderstand this new era of trust,so that we can get it right,and we can embracenthe opportunities to redesign systems,that are more transparent,ninclusive and accountable. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There's a big questionnat the center of life,in our democracies today:,How do we fight terrornwithout destroying democracies,,without trampling human rights? 
 I've spent much of my careernworking with journalists,,with bloggers,,with activists,,with human rights researchersnall around the world,,and I've come to the conclusion,that if our democratic societiesndo not double down,on protecting and defending human rights,,freedom of the press,and a free and open internet,,radical extremist ideologiesnare much more likely to persist. 
 (Applause) 
 OK, all done. Thank you very much.,No, just joking. 
 (Laughter) 
 I actually want to drill downnon this a little bit. 
 So, one of the countries that has beennon the frontlines of this issue,is Tunisia,,which was the only countrynto come out of the Arab Spring,with a successful democratic revolution.,Five years later,,they're strugglingnwith serious terror attacks,and rampant ISIS recruitment.,And many Tunisiansnare calling on their government,to do whatever it takes to keep them safe. 
 Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari,has summed up the situationnwith this character who says,,"I don't give a damn about human rights.,I don't give a damn about the revolution.,I don't give a damnnabout democracy and liberty.,I just want to be safe." 
 "Satisfied?" asked his jailer.,"You're safe now." 
 If the Tunisian people can figure out,how to deal with their terrorism problem,without ending up in this place,,they will be a modelnnot only for their region,,but for all of us. 
 The reality is that civil society,njournalists and activists,are coming under attacknfrom extremist groups on the one hand,,and, in many countries,,also from their own governments.,We're seeing bloggersnand journalists being jailed,,charged and intimidated,by their own governments,,many of which are alliesnwith the West in the war on terror. 
 Just three examples.,A friend and former colleague of mine,,Hisham Almiraat,,has been chargednwith threatening state security,,along with six other activists in Morocco.,The Saudi blogger Raif Badawinhas been jailed and flogged,for insulting Islam and criticizingnthe Saudi regime on his blog.,More recently, the Turkish representativenfor Reporters Without Borders,,Erol Önderoglu,,has been detained and chargednwith spreading terrorist propaganda,,because he and some other activistsnhave been supporting Kurdish media. 
 Anti-terror measuresnquickly turn into state repression,without strong protectionnfor minority communities,and for peaceful debate;,this needs to be supportednby a robust, independent local media. 
 But while that's not really happening,,Washington is teaming upnwith Silicon Valley and with Hollywood,to pour millions -- hundredsnof millions of dollars --,into what's called "counter-messaging,",a fancy word for propaganda.,To counter the terrorist propagandanspreading all over the internet,,in Europe, Internet ReferralnUnits are being set up,,so that people can reportnon extremist content that they find,and get it censored.,The problem is,,that all of this propaganda,nmonitoring and censorship,completely fails to make up for the fact,that the people who arenthe most credible voices,,who can present credible ideasnand alternative solutions,to real economic, social and politicalnproblems in their community,that are causing people to turnnto extremism in the first place,,are being silencednby their own governments. 
 This is all adding up to a decreasenin freedom across the world.,Freedom House,,the human rights organization,,reports that 2015 marksnthe 10th straight year in a row,of decline in freedom worldwide.,And this is not justnbecause of the actions,of authoritarian governments.,It's also because democratic governments,are increasingly crackingndown on dissenters,,whistle-blowers,and investigative journalists.,UN Secretary GeneralnBan Ki-Moon has warned,that "preventing extremism and promotingnhuman rights go hand-in-hand.",It's not to say that governmentsnshouldn't keep us safe --,of course they should --,but we need public oversight, transparency,and accountability to the rule of law.,Meanwhile,,extremists are literally killing offncivil society in some countries.,Since 2013 in Bangladesh,,over a dozen secular bloggersnand community activists,have been literallynslaughtered by extremists,while the government has done very little.,From the city of Raqqa in Syria,,people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerfnhave been assassinated,for their reportingnout of ISIS-controlled territory. 
 The citizen media group callednRaqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently,relies on strong encryptionnto send out their reports,and shield themselvesnfrom interception and surveillance.,Yet authorities in countriesnlike the United States,,the United Kingdomnand many other democracies,are seeking to use the law,to either weaken or outright bannstrong encryption,,because the bad guys are using it, too.,We have got to fight for the rightnof citizens to use strong encryption.,Otherwise, dissentnand investigative journalism,are going to become even more difficult,in even more places.,And the bad guys -- the criminalsnand terrorists --,are still going to findnways to communicate.,Kudos to the companiesnthat are standing up,for their users' right to use encryption. 
 But when it comes to censorship,,the picture is much more troubling.,Yes, there's a real problem,of extremist contentnspreading all over the internet.,And Facebook, YouTube and Twitternare among the many companies,who report having taken down hundredsnof thousands of pieces of content,and deactivating accounts,that are connectednto the extremist's speech.,The problem is their enforcementnmechanisms are a complete black box,,and there is collateral damage. 
 Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,,an activist who makes funnof ISIS on Twitter.,He had his account deactivated,,because he shares a surnamenwith a prominent ISIS leader.,Last December,,a number of women named Isis,,which also happens to benthe name of an Egyptian goddess,,had their accounts deactivated.,And this woman,,who lives in the United Statesnand is a computer programmer,,reported on Twitternabout her deactivation on Facebook,,managed to get enough media attentionnto have her account reinstated.,But that's the thing --nshe had to get media attention.,And journalists aren't immune.,David Thomson,,an expert on terrorism and reporternfor Radio France International,,had reports deletednfrom his Facebook account,and had his accountndeactivated for several days,,because they containednpictures of ISIS flags,,even though he was just reporting on ISIS,,not promoting it. 
 And then we have stories from peoplenlike this Egyptian man,,Ahmed Abdellahy,,who reported recently in an eventnin Washington DC,that some of his argumentsnwith extremists --,he now spends his time on social medianarguing with ISIS followers,,trying to get them to turn away --,some of his argumentsnwith these extremists get deleted,,which he believes has the effectnof shielding them,from alternative points of view. 
 It's unclear whether Facebookneven knows the extent,of the collateral damage,,or the other companies as well.,But we do know that journalism,nactivism and public debate,are being silenced in the effortnto stamp out extremist speech. 
 So with these companies having so muchnpower over the public discourse,,they need to be held accountable.,They need to carry out impact assessment,to identify and fix the problemsnthat we're clearly seeing.,They need to be more transparentnabout their enforcement mechanisms,,and they need to have clearnappeal and grievance mechanisms,,so people can getntheir content reinstated. 
 Now, I've been talkingnfor the last 10 minutes,about how governments and companiesnare making it more difficult,for people like these.,This is a picture of membersnof the citizen media network,,Global Voices,,that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago,with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.,Interestingly, about 5 years ago,nright after the Arab Spring,,the data scientist Gilad Lotan,created a network mapnof the people in Global Voices,who were heavy users of Twitternduring the Arab Spring.,And he found that many of these peoplenserved as key information nodes,between activists and journalists,throughout the Tunisiannand Egyptian revolution.,We've got to make surenthat these people not only survive,,but are able to continue to thrive.,Many of them are still active,,other than the ones who have gone to jail,or have been driven into hiding or exile. 
 All around the world,,people who are sick and tirednof fear and oppression,are linking up in their communitiesnand across borders.,We've got to do everything we cannto push our governments and companies,to do a better jobnof protecting their rights.,We've also got to be more mindful,about how our own personal, political,nconsumer and business choices,affect people like these around the world.,Also, if you follow the news,,it's pretty clear that that alonenisn't going to be enough.,We've got to take personalnresponsibility by joining --,or at very least, actively supporting --,the growing ecosystemnof individuals and groups,who are fighting for social justice,,environmental sustainability,,government accountability,,human rights, freedom of the press,and a free and open internet,,all around the world. 
 I believe that, ultimately,nwe can overcome,the digitally empowered networksnof extremism, demagoguery and hate.,But ...,we've got to do this by reallynbeefing up the global networks,of citizens around the world,,powered by peoplenwho are working hard every day,,and taking personal risk,for a future world that is morenpeaceful, just, open and free. 
 Thanks very much for listening. 
 (Applause)Imagine you're walking through a forest.,I'm guessing you're thinkingnof a collection of trees,,what we foresters call a stand,,with their rugged stemsnand their beautiful crowns.,Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,,but a forest is much morenthan what you see,,and today I want to changenthe way you think about forests.,You see, undergroundnthere is this other world,,a world of infinite biological pathways,that connect treesnand allow them to communicate,and allow the forest to behavenas though it's a single organism.,It might remind younof a sort of intelligence. 
 How do I know this?,Here's my story.,I grew up in the forestsnof British Columbia.,I used to lay on the forest floornand stare up at the tree crowns.,They were giants.,My grandfather was a giant, too.,He was a horse logger,,and he used to selectively cutncedar poles from the inland rainforest.,Grandpa taught me about the quietnand cohesive ways of the woods,,and how my family was knit into it.,So I followed in grandpa's footsteps. 
 He and I had this curiosity about forests,,and my first big "aha" moment,was at the outhouse by our lake.,Our poor dog Jigsnhad slipped and fallen into the pit.,So grandpa ran up with his shovelnto rescue the poor dog.,He was down there, swimming in the muck.,But as grandpa dugnthrough that forest floor,,I became fascinated with the roots,,and under that, what I learned laternwas the white mycelium,and under that the rednand yellow mineral horizons.,Eventually, grandpa and Inrescued the poor dog,,but it was at that moment that I realized,that that palette of roots and soil,was really the foundation of the forest. 
 And I wanted to know more.,So I studied forestry.,But soon I found myself workingnalongside the powerful people,in charge of the commercial harvest.,The extent of the clear-cutting,was alarming,,and I soon found myselfnconflicted by my part in it.,Not only that, the sprayingnand hacking of the aspens and birches,to make way for the more commerciallynvaluable planted pines and firs,was astounding.,It seemed that nothing could stopnthis relentless industrial machine. 
 So I went back to school,,and I studied my other world.,You see, scientists had just discoverednin the laboratory in vitro,that one pine seedling root,could transmit carbonnto another pine seedling root.,But this was in the laboratory,,and I wondered,ncould this happen in real forests?,I thought yes.,Trees in real forests might alsonshare information below ground.,But this was really controversial,,and some people thought I was crazy,,and I had a really hard timengetting research funding.,But I persevered,,and I eventually conductednsome experiments deep in the forest,,25 years ago.,I grew 80 replicates of three species:,paper birch, Douglas fir,nand western red cedar.,I figured the birch and the firnwould be connected in a belowground web,,but not the cedar.,It was in its own other world.,And I gathered my apparatus,,and I had no money,nso I had to do it on the cheap.,So I went to Canadian Tire -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and I bought some plastic bagsnand duct tape and shade cloth,,a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.,And then I borrowed somenhigh-tech stuff from my university:,a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter,na mass spectrometer, microscopes.,And then I got somenreally dangerous stuff:,syringes full of radioactivencarbon-14 carbon dioxide gas,and some high pressure bottles,of the stable isotopencarbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.,But I was legally permitted. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, and I forgot some stuff,,important stuff: the bug spray,,the bear spray,nthe filters for my respirator.,Oh well. 
 The first day of the experiment,nwe got out to our plot,and a grizzly bear and her cubnchased us off.,And I had no bear spray.,But you know, this is hownforest research in Canada goes. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I came back the next day,,and mama grizzly and her cub were gone.,So this time, we really got started,,and I pulled on my white paper suit,,I put on my respirator,,and then,I put the plastic bags over my trees.,I got my giant syringes,,and I injected the bags,with my tracer isotopencarbon dioxide gases,,first the birch.,I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,,into the bag of birch.,And then for fir,,I injected the stable isotopencarbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.,I used two isotopes,,because I was wondering,whether there was two-way communicationngoing on between these species.,I got to the final bag,,the 80th replicate,,and all of a suddennmama grizzly showed up again.,And she started to chase me,,and I had my syringes above my head,,and I was swatting the mosquitos,nand I jumped into the truck,,and I thought,,"This is why people do lab studies." 
 (Laughter) 
 I waited an hour.,I figured it would take this long,for the trees to suck upnthe CO2 through photosynthesis,,turn it into sugars,nsend it down into their roots,,and maybe, I hypothesized,,shuttle that carbon belowgroundnto their neighbors.,After the hour was up,,I rolled down my window,,and I checked for mama grizzly.,Oh good, she's over thereneating her huckleberries.,So I got out of the trucknand I got to work.,I went to my first bag with the birch.nI pulled the bag off.,I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.,Kkhh!,Perfect.,The birch had taken upnthe radioactive gas.,Then the moment of truth.,I went over to the fir tree.,I pulled off its bag.,I ran the Geiger counter up its needles,,and I heard the most beautiful sound.,Kkhh!,It was the sound of birch talking to fir,,and birch was saying,n"Hey, can I help you?",And fir was saying, "Yeah,ncan you send me some of your carbon?,Because somebodynthrew a shade cloth over me.",I went up to cedar, and I rannthe Geiger counter over its leaves,,and as I suspected,,silence.,Cedar was in its own world.,It was not connected into the webninterlinking birch and fir. 
 I was so excited,,I ran from plot to plotnand I checked all 80 replicates.,The evidence was clear.,The C-13 and C-14 was showing me,that paper birch and Douglas firnwere in a lively two-way conversation.,It turns out at that time of the year,,in the summer,,that birch was sending more carbon to firnthan fir was sending back to birch,,especially when the fir was shaded.,And then in later experiments,nwe found the opposite,,that fir was sending more carbon to birchnthan birch was sending to fir,,and this was because the fir was stillngrowing while the birch was leafless.,So it turns out the two speciesnwere interdependent,,like yin and yang. 
 And at that moment,neverything came into focus for me.,I knew I had found something big,,something that would change the waynwe look at how trees interact in forests,,from not just competitors,but to cooperators.,And I had found solid evidence,of this massive belowgroundncommunications network,,the other world. 
 Now, I truly hoped and believed,that my discovery would changenhow we practice forestry,,from clear-cutting and herbiciding,to more holistic and sustainable methods,,methods that were less expensivenand more practical.,What was I thinking?,I'll come back to that. 
 So how do we do sciencenin complex systems like forests?,Well, as forest scientists,nwe have to do our research in the forests,,and that's really tough,nas I've shown you.,And we have to be really goodnat running from bears.,But mostly, we have to persevere,in spite of all the stuffnstacked against us.,And we have to follow our intuitionnand our experiences,and ask really good questions.,And then we've got to gather our datanand then go verify.,For me, I've conducted and publishednhundreds of experiments in the forest.,Some of my oldest experimental plantationsnare now over 30 years old.,You can check them out.,That's how forest science works. 
 So now I want to talk about the science.,How were paper birchnand Douglas fir communicating?,Well, it turns out they were conversingnnot only in the language of carbon,but also nitrogen and phosphorus,and water and defense signalsnand allele chemicals and hormones --,information.,And you know, I have to tell you,nbefore me, scientists had thought,that this belowgroundnmutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza,was involved.,Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root.",You see their reproductive organsnwhen you walk through the forest.,They're the mushrooms.,The mushrooms, though,nare just the tip of the iceberg,,because coming out of those stemsnare fungal threads that form a mycelium,,and that myceliumninfects and colonizes the roots,of all the trees and plants.,And where the fungal cellsninteract with the root cells,,there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,,and that fungus gets those nutrientsnby growing through the soil,and coating every soil particle.,The web is so dense that there can benhundreds of kilometers of mycelium,under a single footstep.,And not only that, that mycelium connectsndifferent individuals in the forest,,individuals not only of the same speciesnbut between species, like birch and fir,,and it works kind of like the Internet. 
 You see, like all networks,,mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.,We made this map by examiningnthe short sequences of DNA,of every tree and every fungal individualnin a patch of Douglas fir forest.,In this picture, the circles representnthe Douglas fir, or the nodes,,and the lines represent the interlinkingnfungal highways, or the links. 
 The biggest, darkest nodesnare the busiest nodes.,We call those hub trees,,or more fondly, mother trees,,because it turns outnthat those hub trees nurture their young,,the ones growing in the understory.,And if you can see those yellow dots,,those are the young seedlingsnthat have established within the network,of the old mother trees.,In a single forest, a mother tree can benconnected to hundreds of other trees.,And using our isotope tracers,,we have found that mother trees,will send their excess carbonnthrough the mycorrhizal network,to the understory seedlings,,and we've associated thisnwith increased seedling survival,by four times. 
 Now, we know we allnfavor our own children,,and I wondered, could Douglas firnrecognize its own kin,,like mama grizzly and her cub?,So we set about an experiment,,and we grew mother treesnwith kin and stranger's seedlings.,And it turns outnthey do recognize their kin.,Mother trees colonize their kinnwith bigger mycorrhizal networks.,They send them more carbon below ground.,They even reducentheir own root competition,to make elbow room for their kids.,When mother trees are injured or dying,,they also send messages of wisdomnon to the next generation of seedlings.,So we've used isotope tracing,to trace carbon movingnfrom an injured mother tree,down her trunkninto the mycorrhizal network,and into her neighboring seedlings,,not only carbon but also defense signals.,And these two compounds,have increased the resistancenof those seedlings to future stresses.,So trees talk. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Through back and forth conversations,,they increase the resiliencenof the whole community.,It probably reminds younof our own social communities,,and our families,,well, at least some families. 
 (Laughter) 
 So let's come back to the initial point.,Forests aren't simplyncollections of trees,,they're complex systemsnwith hubs and networks,that overlap and connect treesnand allow them to communicate,,and they provide avenuesnfor feedbacks and adaptation,,and this makes the forest resilient.,That's because there are many hub treesnand many overlapping networks.,But they're also vulnerable,,vulnerable not onlynto natural disturbances,like bark beetles that preferentiallynattack big old trees,but high-grade loggingnand clear-cut logging.,You see, you can take outnone or two hub trees,,but there comes a tipping point,,because hub trees are notnunlike rivets in an airplane.,You can take out one or twonand the plane still flies,,but you take out one too many,,or maybe that one holding on the wings,,and the whole system collapses. 
 So now how are you thinkingnabout forests? Differently? 
 (Audience) Yes. 
 Cool.,I'm glad. 
 So, remember I said earliernthat I hoped that my research,,my discoveries would changenthe way we practice forestry.,Well, I want to take a check on thatn30 years later here in western Canada. 
 This is about 100 kilometersnto the west of us,,just on the border of Banff National Park.,That's a lot of clear-cuts.,It's not so pristine.,In 2014, the World Resources Institutenreported that Canada in the past decade,has had the highest forest disturbancenrate of any country worldwide,,and I bet you thought it was Brazil.,In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.,Now, by my estimation, that's aboutnfour times the rate that is sustainable. 
 Now, massive disturbance at this scalenis known to affect hydrological cycles,,degrade wildlife habitat,,and emit greenhouse gasesnback into the atmosphere,,which creates more disturbancenand more tree diebacks. 
 Not only that, we're continuingnto plant one or two species,and weed out the aspens and birches.,These simplified forests lack complexity,,and they're really vulnerablento infections and bugs.,And as climate changes,,this is creating a perfect storm,for extreme events, like the massivenmountain pine beetle outbreak,that just swept across North America,,or that megafire in the lastncouple months in Alberta. 
 So I want to come backnto my final question:,instead of weakening our forests,,how can we reinforce themnand help them deal with climate change?,Well, you know, the great thingnabout forests as complex systems,is they have enormousncapacity to self-heal.,In our recent experiments,,we found with patch-cuttingnand retention of hub trees,and regeneration to a diversitynof species and genes and genotypes,that these mycorrhizal networks,nthey recover really rapidly.,So with this in mind, I want to leave younwith four simple solutions.,And we can't kid ourselvesnthat these are too complicated to act on. 
 First, we all neednto get out in the forest.,We need to reestablishnlocal involvement in our own forests.,You see, most of our forests now,are managed usingna one-size-fits-all approach,,but good forest stewardshipnrequires knowledge of local conditions. 
 Second, we need to savenour old-growth forests.,These are the repositories of genesnand mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.,So this means less cutting.,I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting. 
 And third, when we do cut,,we need to save the legacies,,the mother trees and networks,,and the wood, the genes,,so they can pass their wisdomnonto the next generation of trees,so they can withstandnthe future stresses coming down the road.,We need to be conservationists. 
 And finally, fourthly and finally,,we need to regenerate our forestsnwith a diversity of species,and genotypes and structures,by planting and allowingnnatural regeneration.,We have to give Mother Naturenthe tools she needs,to use her intelligence to self-heal.,And we need to remembernthat forests aren't just a bunch of trees,competing with each other,,they're supercooperators. 
 So back to Jigs.,Jigs's fall into the outhousenshowed me this other world,,and it changed my view of forests.,I hope today to have changednhow you think about forests. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I started my first jobnas a computer programmer,in my very first year of college --,basically, as a teenager. 
 Soon after I started working,,writing software in a company,,a manager who worked at the companyncame down to where I was,,and he whispered to me,,"Can he tell if I'm lying?",There was nobody else in the room. 
 "Can who tell if you're lying?nAnd why are we whispering?" 
 The manager pointednat the computer in the room.,"Can he tell if I'm lying?",Well, that manager was havingnan affair with the receptionist. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was still a teenager.,So I whisper-shouted back to him,,"Yes, the computer can tellnif you're lying." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I laughed, but actually,nthe laugh's on me.,Nowadays, there are computational systems,that can suss outnemotional states and even lying,from processing human faces.,Advertisers and even governmentsnare very interested. 
 I had become a computer programmer,because I was one of those kidsncrazy about math and science.,But somewhere along the linenI'd learned about nuclear weapons,,and I'd gotten really concernednwith the ethics of science.,I was troubled.,However, because of family circumstances,,I also needed to start workingnas soon as possible.,So I thought to myself, hey,nlet me pick a technical field,where I can get a job easily,and where I don't have to dealnwith any troublesome questions of ethics.,So I picked computers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, ha, ha, ha!nAll the laughs are on me.,Nowadays, computer scientistsnare building platforms,that control what a billionnpeople see every day.,They're developing carsnthat could decide who to run over.,They're even building machines, weapons,,that might kill human beings in war.,It's ethics all the way down. 
 Machine intelligence is here.,We're now using computationnto make all sort of decisions,,but also new kinds of decisions.,We're asking questions to computationnthat have no single right answers,,that are subjective,and open-ended and value-laden. 
 We're asking questions like,,"Who should the company hire?","Which update from which friendnshould you be shown?","Which convict is morenlikely to reoffend?","Which news item or movienshould be recommended to people?" 
 Look, yes, we've been usingncomputers for a while,,but this is different.,This is a historical twist,,because we cannot anchor computationnfor such subjective decisions,the way we can anchor computationnfor flying airplanes, building bridges,,going to the moon.,Are airplanes safer?nDid the bridge sway and fall?,There, we have agreed-upon,nfairly clear benchmarks,,and we have laws of nature to guide us.,We have no such anchors and benchmarks,for decisions in messy human affairs. 
 To make things more complicated,nour software is getting more powerful,,but it's also getting lessntransparent and more complex.,Recently, in the past decade,,complex algorithmsnhave made great strides.,They can recognize human faces.,They can decipher handwriting.,They can detect credit card fraud,and block spam,and they can translate between languages.,They can detect tumors in medical imaging.,They can beat humans in chess and Go. 
 Much of this progress comesnfrom a method called "machine learning.",Machine learning is differentnthan traditional programming,,where you give the computerndetailed, exact, painstaking instructions.,It's more like you take the systemnand you feed it lots of data,,including unstructured data,,like the kind we generatenin our digital lives.,And the system learnsnby churning through this data.,And also, crucially,,these systems don't operatenunder a single-answer logic.,They don't produce a simple answer;nit's more probabilistic:,"This one is probably more likenwhat you're looking for." 
 Now, the upside is:nthis method is really powerful.,The head of Google's AI systems called it,,"the unreasonable effectiveness of data.",The downside is,,we don't really understandnwhat the system learned.,In fact, that's its power.,This is less like givingninstructions to a computer;,it's more like trainingna puppy-machine-creature,we don't really understand or control.,So this is our problem.,It's a problem when this artificialnintelligence system gets things wrong.,It's also a problemnwhen it gets things right,,because we don't even know which is whichnwhen it's a subjective problem.,We don't know what this thing is thinking. 
 So, consider a hiring algorithm --,a system used to hire people,nusing machine-learning systems.,Such a system would have been trainednon previous employees' data,and instructed to find and hire,people like the existingnhigh performers in the company.,Sounds good.,I once attended a conference,that brought togethernhuman resources managers and executives,,high-level people,,using such systems in hiring.,They were super excited.,They thought that this would make hiringnmore objective, less biased,,and give womennand minorities a better shot,against biased human managers. 
 And look -- human hiring is biased.,I know.,I mean, in one of my early jobsnas a programmer,,my immediate manager would sometimesncome down to where I was,really early in the morningnor really late in the afternoon,,and she'd say, "Zeynep,nlet's go to lunch!",I'd be puzzled by the weird timing.,It's 4pm. Lunch?,I was broke, so free lunch. I always went.,I later realized what was happening.,My immediate managersnhad not confessed to their higher-ups,that the programmer they hirednfor a serious job was a teen girl,who wore jeans and sneakers to work.,I was doing a good job,nI just looked wrong,and was the wrong age and gender. 
 So hiring in a gender- and race-blind way,certainly sounds good to me.,But with these systems,nit is more complicated, and here's why:,Currently, computational systemsncan infer all sorts of things about you,from your digital crumbs,,even if you have notndisclosed those things.,They can infer your sexual orientation,,your personality traits,,your political leanings.,They have predictive powernwith high levels of accuracy.,Remember -- for thingsnyou haven't even disclosed.,This is inference. 
 I have a friend who developednsuch computational systems,to predict the likelihoodnof clinical or postpartum depression,from social media data.,The results are impressive.,Her system can predictnthe likelihood of depression,months before the onset of any symptoms --,months before.,No symptoms, there's prediction.,She hopes it will be usednfor early intervention. Great!,But now put this in the context of hiring. 
 So at this human resourcesnmanagers conference,,I approached a high-level managernin a very large company,,and I said to her, "Look,nwhat if, unbeknownst to you,,your system is weeding out peoplenwith high future likelihood of depression?,They're not depressed now,njust maybe in the future, more likely.,What if it's weeding out womennmore likely to be pregnant,in the next year or twonbut aren't pregnant now?,What if it's hiring aggressive peoplenbecause that's your workplace culture?",You can't tell this by lookingnat gender breakdowns.,Those may be balanced.,And since this is machine learning,nnot traditional coding,,there is no variable therenlabeled "higher risk of depression,","higher risk of pregnancy,","aggressive guy scale.",Not only do you not knownwhat your system is selecting on,,you don't even knownwhere to begin to look.,It's a black box.,It has predictive power,nbut you don't understand it. 
 "What safeguards," I asked, "do you have,to make sure that your black boxnisn't doing something shady?",She looked at me as if I hadnjust stepped on 10 puppy tails. 
 (Laughter) 
 She stared at me and she said,,"I don't want to hearnanother word about this.",And she turned around and walked away.,Mind you -- she wasn't rude.,It was clearly: what I don't knownisn't my problem, go away, death stare. 
 (Laughter) 
 Look, such a systemnmay even be less biased,than human managers in some ways.,And it could make monetary sense.,But it could also lead,to a steady but stealthynshutting out of the job market,of people with higher risk of depression.,Is this the kind of societynwe want to build,,without even knowing we've done this,,because we turned decision-makingnto machines we don't totally understand? 
 Another problem is this:,these systems are often trainednon data generated by our actions,,human imprints.,Well, they could just benreflecting our biases,,and these systemsncould be picking up on our biases,and amplifying them,and showing them back to us,,while we're telling ourselves,,"We're just doing objective,nneutral computation." 
 Researchers found that on Google,,women are less likely than mennto be shown job ads for high-paying jobs.,And searching for African-American names,is more likely to bring up adsnsuggesting criminal history,,even when there is none.,Such hidden biasesnand black-box algorithms,that researchers uncover sometimesnbut sometimes we don't know,,can have life-altering consequences. 
 In Wisconsin, a defendantnwas sentenced to six years in prison,for evading the police.,You may not know this,,but algorithms are increasingly usednin parole and sentencing decisions.,He wanted to know:nHow is this score calculated?,It's a commercial black box.,The company refused to have its algorithmnbe challenged in open court.,But ProPublica, an investigativennonprofit, audited that very algorithm,with what public data they could find,,and found that its outcomes were biased,and its predictive powernwas dismal, barely better than chance,,and it was wrongly labelingnblack defendants as future criminals,at twice the rate of white defendants. 
 So, consider this case:,This woman was latenpicking up her godsister,from a school in Broward County, Florida,,running down the streetnwith a friend of hers.,They spotted an unlocked kid's bikenand a scooter on a porch,and foolishly jumped on it.,As they were speeding off,na woman came out and said,,"Hey! That's my kid's bike!",They dropped it, they walked away,nbut they were arrested. 
 She was wrong, she was foolish,nbut she was also just 18.,She had a couple of juvenile misdemeanors.,Meanwhile, that man had been arrestednfor shoplifting in Home Depot --,85 dollars' worth of stuff,na similar petty crime.,But he had two priornarmed robbery convictions.,But the algorithm scored hernas high risk, and not him.,Two years later, ProPublica foundnthat she had not reoffended.,It was just hard to get a jobnfor her with her record.,He, on the other hand, did reoffend,and is now serving an eight-yearnprison term for a later crime.,Clearly, we need to audit our black boxes,and not have them haventhis kind of unchecked power. 
 (Applause) 
 Audits are great and important,nbut they don't solve all our problems.,Take Facebook's powerfulnnews feed algorithm --,you know, the one that ranks everythingnand decides what to show you,from all the friends and pages you follow.,Should you be shown another baby picture? 
 (Laughter) 
 A sullen note from an acquaintance?,An important but difficult news item?,There's no right answer.,Facebook optimizesnfor engagement on the site:,likes, shares, comments. 
 In August of 2014,,protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri,,after the killing of an African-Americannteenager by a white police officer,,under murky circumstances.,The news of the protests was all over,my algorithmicallynunfiltered Twitter feed,,but nowhere on my Facebook.,Was it my Facebook friends?,I disabled Facebook's algorithm,,which is hard because Facebooknkeeps wanting to make you,come under the algorithm's control,,and saw that my friendsnwere talking about it.,It's just that the algorithmnwasn't showing it to me.,I researched this and foundnthis was a widespread problem. 
 The story of Fergusonnwasn't algorithm-friendly.,It's not "likable.",Who's going to click on "like?",It's not even easy to comment on.,Without likes and comments,,the algorithm was likely showing itnto even fewer people,,so we didn't get to see this.,Instead, that week,,Facebook's algorithm highlighted this,,which is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.,Worthy cause; dump ice water,ndonate to charity, fine.,But it was super algorithm-friendly.,The machine made this decision for us.,A very importantnbut difficult conversation,might have been smothered,,had Facebook been the only channel. 
 Now, finally, these systemsncan also be wrong,in ways that don't resemble human systems.,Do you guys remember Watson,nIBM's machine-intelligence system,that wiped the floornwith human contestants on Jeopardy?,It was a great player.,But then, for Final Jeopardy,nWatson was asked this question:,"Its largest airport is namednfor a World War II hero,,its second-largestnfor a World War II battle." 
 (Hums Final Jeopardy music) 
 Chicago.,The two humans got it right.,Watson, on the other hand,nanswered "Toronto" --,for a US city category!,The impressive system also made an error,that a human would never make,na second-grader wouldn't make. 
 Our machine intelligence can fail,in ways that don't fitnerror patterns of humans,,in ways we won't expectnand be prepared for.,It'd be lousy not to get a jobnone is qualified for,,but it would triple sucknif it was because of stack overflow,in some subroutine. 
 (Laughter) 
 In May of 2010,,a flash crash on Wall Streetnfueled by a feedback loop,in Wall Street's "sell" algorithm,wiped a trillion dollarsnof value in 36 minutes.,I don't even want to thinknwhat "error" means,in the context of lethalnautonomous weapons. 
 So yes, humans have always made biases.,Decision makers and gatekeepers,,in courts, in news, in war ...,they make mistakes;nbut that's exactly my point.,We cannot escapenthese difficult questions.,We cannot outsourcenour responsibilities to machines. 
 (Applause) 
 Artificial intelligence does not give usna "Get out of ethics free" card. 
 Data scientist Fred Benensonncalls this math-washing.,We need the opposite.,We need to cultivate algorithm suspicion,nscrutiny and investigation.,We need to make sure we havenalgorithmic accountability,,auditing and meaningful transparency.,We need to acceptnthat bringing math and computation,to messy, value-laden human affairs,does not bring objectivity;,rather, the complexity of human affairsninvades the algorithms.,Yes, we can and we should use computation,to help us make better decisions.,But we have to own upnto our moral responsibility to judgment,,and use algorithms within that framework,,not as a means to abdicatenand outsource our responsibilities,to one another as human to human. 
 Machine intelligence is here.,That means we must hold on ever tighter,to human values and human ethics. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It was April, last year.,I was on an evening out with friends,to celebrate one of their birthdays.,We hadn't been all togethernfor a couple of weeks;,it was a perfect evening,nas we were all reunited. 
 At the end of the evening,,I caught the last underground trainnback to the other side of London.,The journey was smooth.,I got back to my local station,and I began the 10-minute walk home.,As I turned the corner onto my street,,my house in sight up ahead,,I heard footsteps behind me,that seemed to havenapproached out of nowhere,and were picking up pace.,Before I had time to processnwhat was happening,,a hand was clapped around my mouthnso that I could not breathe,,and the young man behind mendragged me to the ground,,beat my head repeatedlynagainst the pavement,until my face began to bleed,,kicking me in the back and neck,while he began to assault me,,ripping off my clothesnand telling me to "shut up,",as I struggled to cry for help.,With each smack of my headnto the concrete ground,,a question echoed through my mindnthat still haunts me today:,"Is this going to be how it all ends?" 
 Little could I have realized,nI'd been followed the whole way,from the moment I left the station.,And hours later,,I was standing topless and bareleggednin front of the police,,having the cuts and bruisesnon my naked body photographed,for forensic evidence. 
 Now, there are few words to describenthe all-consuming feelings,of vulnerability, shame, upsetnand injustice that I was ridden with,in that moment and for the weeks to come.,But wanting to find a waynto condense these feelings,into something orderednthat I could work through,,I decided to do whatnfelt most natural to me:,I wrote about it. 
 It started out as a cathartic exercise.,I wrote a letter to my assaulter,,humanizing him as "you,",to identify him as partnof the very community,that he had so violentlynabused that night. 
 Stressing the tidal-waveneffect of his actions,,I wrote:,"Did you ever thinknof the people in your life?,I don't know who the peoplenin your life are.,I don't know anything about you.,But I do know this:,you did not just attack me that night.,I'm a daughter, I'm a friend,,I'm a sister, I'm a pupil,,I'm a cousin, I'm a niece,,I'm a neighbor;,I'm the employeenwho served everyone coffee,in the café under the railway.,And all the people who formnthese relations to me,make up my community.,And you assaultednevery single one of them.,You violated the truth that Inwill never cease to fight for,,and which all of these people represent:,that there are infinitely morengood people in the world than bad." 
 But, determined not to letnthis one incident make me lose faith,in the solidarity in my communitynor humanity as a whole,,I recalled the 7/7 terrorist bombingsnin July 2005 on London transport,,and how the mayor of London at the time,nand indeed my own parents,,had insisted that we all get backnon the tubes the next day,,so we wouldn't be defined or changed,by those that had made us feel unsafe. 
 I told my attacker,,"You've carried out your attack,,but now I'm getting back on my tube.,My community will not feel we are unsafenwalking home after dark.,We will get on the last tubes home,,and we will walk up our streets alone,,because we will not ingrainnor submit to the idea,that we are putting ourselvesnin danger in doing so.,We will continuento come together, like an army,,when any membernof our community is threatened.,And this is a fight you will not win." 
 At the time of writing this letter -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 At the time of writing this letter,,I was studying for my exams in Oxford,,and I was workingnon the local student paper there.,Despite being lucky enough to havenfriends and family supporting me,,it was an isolating time.,I didn't know anyonenwho'd been through this before;,at least I didn't think I did.,I'd read news reports, statistics,nand knew how common sexual assault was,,yet I couldn't actually namena single person,that I'd heard speak outnabout an experience of this kind before. 
 So in a somewhat spontaneous decision,,I decided that I would publishnmy letter in the student paper,,hoping to reach out to others in Oxford,that might have had a similar experiencenand be feeling the same way.,At the end of the letter,,I asked others to write innwith their experiences,under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty,",to emphasize that survivors of assaultncould express themselves,without feeling shame or guiltnabout what happened to them --,to show that we could allnstand up to sexual assault. 
 What I never anticipatednis that almost overnight,,this published letter would go viral.,Soon, we were receivingnhundreds of stories,from men and women across the world,,which we began to publishnon a website I set up.,And the hashtag became a campaign. 
 There was an Australian mother in her 40snwho described how on an evening out,,she was followed to the bathroom,by a man who wentnto repeatedly grab her crotch.,There was a man in the Netherlands,who described how he was date-rapednon a visit to London,and wasn't taken seriouslynby anyone he reported his case to.,I had personal Facebook messagesnfrom people in India and South America,,saying, how can we bringnthe message of the campaign there?,One of the first contributions we hadnwas from a woman called Nikki,,who described growing up,nbeing molested my her own father.,And I had friends open up to me,about experiences rangingnfrom those that happened last week,to those that happened years ago,nthat I'd had no idea about. 
 And the more we startednto receive these messages,,the more we also startednto receive messages of hope --,people feeling empowerednby this community of voices,standing up to sexual assaultnand victim-blaming.,One woman called Olivia,,after describing how she was attacked,by someone she had trustednand cared about for a long time,,said, "I've read manynof the stories posted here,,and I feel hopeful that if so manynwomen can move forward,,then I can, too.,I've been inspired by many,,and I hope I can be as strongnas them someday.,I'm sure I will." 
 People around the world beganntweeting under this hashtag,,and the letter was republishednand covered by the national press,,as well as being translated into severalnother languages worldwide. 
 But something struck menabout the media attention,that this letter was attracting.,For something to be front-page news,,given the word "news" itself,,we can assume it must be something newnor something surprising.,And yet sexual assaultnis not something new.,Sexual assault, along with othernkinds of injustices,,is reported in the media all the time.,But through the campaign,,these injustices were framednas not just news stories,,they were firsthand experiencesnthat had affected real people,,who were creating,nwith the solidarity of others,,what they needednand had previously lacked:,a platform to speak out,,the reassurance they weren't alonenor to blame for what happened to them,and open discussions that would helpnto reduce stigma around the issue.,The voices of those directly affectednwere at the forefront of the story --,not the voices of journalistsnor commentators on social media.,And that's why the story was news. 
 We live in an incrediblyninterconnected world,with the proliferation of social media,,which is of course a fantastic resourcenfor igniting social change.,But it's also made usnincreasingly reactive,,from the smallest annoyancesnof, "Oh, my train's been delayed,",to the greatest injustices of war,ngenocides, terrorist attacks.,Our default response has becomento leap to react to any kind of grievance,by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging --,anything to show othersnthat we, too, have reacted. 
 The problem with reactingnin this manner en masse,is it can sometimes meannthat we don't actually react at all,,not in the sense of actuallyndoing anything, anyway.,It might make ourselves feel better,,like we've contributednto a group mourning or outrage,,but it doesn't actually change anything.,And what's more,,it can sometimes drown out the voices,of those directlynaffected by the injustice,,whose needs must be heard. 
 Worrying, too, is the tendencynfor some reactions to injustice,to build even more walls,,being quick to point fingersnwith the hope of providing easy solutions,to complex problems.,One British tabloid,non the publication of my letter,,branded a headline stating,,"Oxford Student LaunchesnOnline Campaign to Shame Attacker.",But the campaign nevernmeant to shame anyone.,It meant to let people speaknand to make others listen.,Divisive Twitter trolls were quicknto create even more injustice,,commenting onnmy attacker's ethnicity or class,to push their own prejudiced agendas.,And some even accused menof feigning the whole thing,to push, and I quote,,my "feminist agenda of man-hating." 
 (Laughter) 
 I know, right?,As if I'm going to be like,n"Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it,,I'm busy trying to hatenthe entire male population,by the time I'm 30." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I'm almost sure,that these people wouldn't saynthe things they say in person.,But it's as if because they mightnbe behind a screen,,in the comfort in their own home,when on social media,,people forget that whatnthey're doing is a public act --,that other people will be reading itnand be affected by it. 
 Returning to my analogynof getting back on our trains,,another main concern I havenabout this noise that escalates,from our online responses to injustice,is that it can very easily slipninto portraying us as the affected party,,which can lead to a sense of defeatism,,a kind of mental barrier to seeingnany opportunity for positivity or change,after a negative situation. 
 A couple of monthsnbefore the campaign started,or any of this happened to me,,I went to a TEDx event in Oxford,,and I saw Zelda la Grange speak,,the former private secretarynto Nelson Mandela.,One of the storiesnshe told really struck me.,She spoke of whennMandela was taken to court,by the South African Rugby Union,after he commissionednan inquiry into sports affairs.,In the courtroom,,he went up to the South AfricannRugby Union's lawyers,,shook them by the hand,and conversed with them,neach in their own language.,And Zelda wanted to protest,,saying they had no right to his respect,after this injustice they had caused him. 
 He turned to her and said,,"You must never allow the enemynto determine the grounds for battle." 
 At the time of hearing these words,,I didn't really know whynthey were so important,,but I felt they were, and I wrote themndown in a notebook I had on me.,But I've thought about this linena lot ever since. 
 Revenge, or the expression of hatred,towards those who have done us injustice,may feel like a human instinctnin the face of wrong,,but we need to break out of these cycles,if we are to hope to transformnnegative events of injustice,into positive social change.,To do otherwise,continues to let the enemyndetermine the grounds for battle,,creates a binary,,where we who have sufferednbecome the affected,,pitted against them, the perpetrators.,And just like we got back on our tubes,,we can't let our platformsnfor interconnectivity and community,be the places that we settle for defeat. 
 But I don't want to discouragena social media response,,because I owe the developmentnof the #NotGuilty campaign,almost entirely to social media.,But I do want to encouragena more considered approach,to the way we use itnto respond to injustice. 
 The start, I think,nis to ask ourselves two things.,Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?,In my case, there werenseveral answers to this.,Someone had hurt me and those who I loved,,under the assumption theynwouldn't have to be held to account,or recognize the damage they had caused.,Not only that, but thousandsnof men and women suffer every day,from sexual abuse, often in silence,,yet it's still a problem we don't giventhe same airtime to as other issues.,It's still an issue many peoplenblame victims for. 
 Next, ask yourself: How,nin recognizing these reasons,,could I go about reversing them?,With us, this was holding my attackernto account -- and many others.,It was calling them outnon the effect they had caused.,It was giving airtimento the issue of sexual assault,,opening up discussions amongst friends,namongst families, in the media,that had been closed for too long,,and stressing that victimsnshouldn't feel to blame,for what happened to them.,We might still have a long way to gonin solving this problem entirely.,But in this way,,we can begin to use social medianas an active tool for social justice,,as a tool to educate,nto stimulate dialogues,,to make those in positionsnof authority aware of an issue,by listening to thosendirectly affected by it. 
 Because sometimes these questionsndon't have easy answers.,In fact, they rarely do.,But this doesn't mean we stillncan't give them a considered response.,In situations wherenyou can't go about thinking,how you'd reversenthis feeling of injustice,,you can still think,nmaybe not what you can do,,but what you can not do.,You can not build further wallsnby fighting injustice with more prejudice,,more hatred.,You can not speak over thosendirectly affected by an injustice.,And you can not react to injustice,nonly to forget about it the next day,,just because the restnof Twitter has moved on. 
 Sometimes not reactingninstantly is, ironically,,the best immediate coursenof action we can take.,Because we might be angry, upsetnand energized by injustice,,but let's consider our responses.,Let us hold people to account,nwithout descending into a culture,that thrives off shamingnand injustice ourselves.,Let us remember that distinction,,so often forgotten by internet users,,between criticism and insult.,Let us not forgetnto think before we speak,,just because we mightnhave a screen in front of us.,And when we create noise on social media,,let it not drown out the needsnof those affected,,but instead let it amplify their voices,,so the internet becomes a placenwhere you're not the exception,if you speak out about somethingnthat has actually happened to you. 
 All these considerednapproaches to injustice,evoke the very keystonesnon which the internet was built:,to network, to have signal, to connect --,all these terms that implynbringing people together,,not pushing people apart. 
 Because if you look up the wordn"justice" in the dictionary,,before punishment,,before administration of lawnor judicial authority,,you get:,"The maintenance of what is right.",And I think there are few thingsnmore "right" in this world,than bringing people together,,than unions.,And if we allow social medianto deliver that,,then it can deliver a very powerfulnform of justice, indeed. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)One hot October morning,,I got off the all-night train,in Mandalay,,the old royal capital of Burma,,now Myanmar.,And out on the street, I ran intona group of rough men,standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.,And one of them came up,and offered to show me around.,The price he quoted was outrageous.,It was less than I would paynfor a bar of chocolate at home. 
 So I clambered into his trishaw,,and he began pedaling us slowlynbetween palaces and pagodas.,And as he did, he told me hownhe had come to the city from his village.,He'd earned a degree in mathematics.,His dream was to be a teacher.,But of course, life is hardnunder a military dictatorship,,and so for now, this was the only waynhe could make a living.,Many nights, he told me,nhe actually slept in his trishaw,so he could catch the first visitorsnoff the all-night train. 
 And very soon, we foundnthat in certain ways,,we had so much in common --,we were both in our 20s,,we were both fascinatednby foreign cultures --,that he invited me home. 
 So we turned off the wide,ncrowded streets,,and we began bumpingndown rough, wild alleyways.,There were broken shacks all around.,I really lost the sense of where I was,,and I realized that anythingncould happen to me now.,I could get mugged or drugged,or something worse.,Nobody would know. 
 Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut,,which consisted of just one tiny room.,And then he leaned down,,and reached under his bed.,And something in me froze.,I waited to see what he would pull out.,And finally he extracted a box.,Inside it was every single letternhe had ever received,from visitors from abroad,,and on some of them he had pasted,little black-and-white worn snapshots,of his new foreign friends. 
 So when we said goodbye that night,,I realized he had also shown me,the secret point of travel,,which is to take a plunge,,to go inwardly as well as outwardly,to places you would never go otherwise,,to venture into uncertainty,,ambiguity,,even fear. 
 At home, it's dangerously easy,to assume we're on top of things.,Out in the world, you are remindednevery moment that you're not,,and you can't get to the bottomnof things, either. 
 Everywhere, "People wish to be settled,",Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us,,"but only insofarnas we are unsettled,is there any hope for us." 
 At this conference,nwe've been lucky enough,to hear some exhilaratingnnew ideas and discoveries,and, really, about all the ways,in which knowledge is beingnpushed excitingly forwards.,But at some point, knowledge gives out.,And that is the moment,when your life is truly decided:,you fall in love;,you lose a friend;,the lights go out.,And it's then, when you're lostnor uneasy or carried out of yourself,,that you find out who you are. 
 I don't believe that ignorance is bliss.,Science has unquestionably made our lives,brighter and longer and healthier.,And I am forever grateful to the teachersnwho showed me the laws of physics,and pointed out thatnthree times three makes nine.,I can count that out on my fingers,any time of night or day.,But when a mathematician tells me,that minus three timesnminus three makes nine,,that's a kind of logicnthat almost feels like trust. 
 The opposite of knowledge, in other words,nisn't always ignorance.,It can be wonder.,Or mystery.,Possibility.,And in my life, I've foundnit's the things I don't know,that have lifted me upnand pushed me forwards,much more than the things I do know.,It's also the things I don't know,that have often brought me closernto everybody around me. 
 For eight straight Novembers, recently,,I traveled every year across Japannwith the Dalai Lama.,And the one thing he said every day,that most seemed to give peoplenreassurance and confidence,was, "I don't know." 
 "What's going to happen to Tibet?","When are we everngoing to get world peace?","What's the best way to raise children?" 
 "Frankly," says this very wise man,,"I don't know." 
 The Nobel Prize-winningneconomist Daniel Kahneman,has spent more than 60 years nownresearching human behavior,,and his conclusion is,that we are always much more confidentnof what we think we know,than we should be.,We have, as he memorably puts it,,an "unlimited abilitynto ignore our ignorance.",We know -- quote, unquote -- our teamnis going to win this weekend,,and we only remember that knowledge,on the rare occasions when we're right.,Most of the time, we're in the dark.,And that's where real intimacy lies. 
 Do you know what your lovernis going to do tomorrow?,Do you want to know? 
 The parents of us all,nas some people call them,,Adam and Eve,,could never die, so long as theynwere eating from the tree of life.,But the minute they began nibbling,from the tree of the knowledgenof good and evil,,they fell from their innocence.,They grew embarrassed and fretful,,self-conscious.,And they learned,na little too late, perhaps,,that there are certainly some thingsnthat we need to know,,but there are many, many morenthat are better left unexplored. 
 Now, when I was a kid,,I knew it all, of course.,I had been spending 20 yearsnin classrooms collecting facts,,and I was actuallynin the information business,,writing articles for Time Magazine.,And I took my first real trip to Japannfor two-and-a-half weeks,,and I came back with a 40-page essay,explaining every last detailnabout Japan's temples,,its fashions, its baseball games,,its soul. 
 But underneath all that,,something that I couldn't understand,so moved me for reasonsnI couldn't explain to you yet,,that I decided to go and live in Japan.,And now that I've been there for 28 years,,I really couldn't tell younvery much at all,about my adopted home.,Which is wonderful,,because it means every daynI'm making some new discovery,,and in the process,,looking around the cornernand seeing the hundred thousand things,I'll never know. 
 Knowledge is a priceless gift.,But the illusion of knowledgencan be more dangerous than ignorance. 
 Thinking that you know your lover,or your enemy,can be more treacherous,than acknowledging you'll never know them.,Every morning in Japan, as the sunnis flooding into our little apartment,,I take great pains not to consultnthe weather forecast,,because if I do,,my mind will be overclouded, distracted,,even when the day is bright. 
 I've been a full-timenwriter now for 34 years.,And the one thing that I have learned,is that transformation comesnwhen I'm not in charge,,when I don't know what's coming next,,when I can't assume I am biggernthan everything around me.,And the same is true in love,or in moments of crisis.,Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again,and we're bumping off the broad,nwell-lit streets;,and we're reminded, really,nof the first law of travel,and, therefore, of life:,you're only as strongnas your readiness to surrender. 
 In the end, perhaps,,being human,is much more important,than being fully in the know. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So it all came to life,in a dark bar in Madrid.,I encountered my colleaguenfrom McGill, Michael Meaney.,And we were drinking a few beers,,and like scientists do,,he told me about his work.,And he told me that he is interestednin how mother rats lick their pups,after they were born.,And I was sitting there and saying,,"This is where my taxndollars are wasted -- 
 (Laughter) 
 on this kind of soft science." 
 And he started telling me,that the rats, like humans,,lick their pups in very different ways.,Some mothers do a lot of that,,some mothers do very little,,and most are in between.,But what's interesting about it,is when he follows these pupsnwhen they become adults --,like, years in human life,nlong after their mother died.,They are completely different animals.,The animals that were lickednand groomed heavily,,the high-licking and grooming,,are not stressed.,They have different sexual behavior.,They have a different way of living,than those that were not treatednas intensively by their mothers. 
 So then I was thinking to myself:,Is this magic?,How does this work?,As geneticists would like you to think,,perhaps the mother hadnthe "bad mother" gene,that caused her pups to be stressful,,and then it was passednfrom generation to generation;,it's all determined by genetics.,Or is it possible that somethingnelse is going on here? 
 In rats, we can asknthis question and answer it.,So what we did isna cross-fostering experiment.,You essentially separate the litter,nthe babies of this rat, at birth,,to two kinds of fostering mothers --,not the real mothers,nbut mothers that will take care of them:,high-licking mothersnand low-licking mothers.,And you can do the oppositenwith the low-licking pups.,And the remarkable answer was,,it wasn't importantnwhat gene you got from your mother.,It was not the biological mothernthat defined this property of these rats.,It is the mother thatntook care of the pups.,So how can this work? 
 I am an a epigeneticist.,I am interested in how genes are marked,by a chemical mark,during embryogenesis, during the timenwe're in the womb of our mothers,,and decide which gene will be expressed,in what tissue.,Different genes are expressed in the brainnthan in the liver and the eye.,And we thought: Is it possible,that the mother is somehownreprogramming the gene of her offspring,through her behavior?,And we spent 10 years,,and we found that there is a cascadenof biochemical events,by which the licking and groomingnof the mother, the care of the mother,,is translated to biochemical signals,that go into the nucleus and into the DNA,and program it differently.,So now the animal can preparenitself for life:,Is life going to be harsh?,Is there going to be a lot of food?,Are there going to be a lot of catsnand snakes around,,or will I livenin an upper-class neighborhood,where all I have to donis behave well and proper,,and that will gain me social acceptance?,And now one can think aboutnhow important that process can be,for our lives. 
 We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.,The DNA is old.,It evolved during evolution.,But it doesn't tell usnif you are going to be born in Stockholm,,where the days are long in the summernand short in the winter,,or in Ecuador,,where there's an equal number of hoursnfor day and night all year round.,And that has such an enormous [effect]non our physiology.,So what we suggest is,nperhaps what happens early in life,,those signals that comenthrough the mother,,tell the child what kind of social worldnyou're going to be living in.,It will be harsh, and you'd betternbe anxious and be stressful,,or it's going to be an easy world,nand you have to be different.,Is it going to be a worldnwith a lot of light or little light?,Is it going to be a worldnwith a lot of food or little food?,If there's no food around,,you'd better develop your brain to bingenwhenever you see a meal,,or store every piece of foodnthat you have as fat. 
 So this is good.,Evolution has selected this,to allow our fixed, old DNAnto function in a dynamic way,in new environments.,But sometimes things can go wrong;,for example, if you're bornnto a poor family,and the signals are, "You better binge,,you better eat every piece of foodnyou're going to encounter.",But now we humansnand our brain have evolved,,have changed evolution even faster.,Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.,And therefore, the preparationnthat we had by our mothers,is turning out to be maladaptive.,The same preparation that was supposednto protect us from hunger and famine,is going to cause obesity,,cardiovascular problemsnand metabolic disease.,So this concept that genesncould be marked by our experience,,and especially the early life experience,,can provide us a unifying explanation,of both health and disease. 
 But is true only for rats?,The problem is, we cannotntest this in humans,,because ethically, we cannot administernchild adversity in a random way.,So if a poor child developsna certain property,,we don't know whethernthis is caused by poverty,or whether poor people have bad genes.,So geneticists will try to tell younthat poor people are poor,because their genes make them poor.,Epigeneticists will tell you,poor people are in a bad environmentnor an impoverished environment,that creates that phenotype,nthat property. 
 So we moved to lookninto our cousins, the monkeys.,My colleague, Stephen Suomi,nhas been rearing monkeys,in two different ways:,randomly separated the monkeynfrom the mother,and reared her with a nurse,and surrogate motherhood conditions.,So these monkeys didn't havena mother; they had a nurse.,And other monkeys were rearednwith their normal, natural mothers.,And when they were old,nthey were completely different animals.,The monkeys that had a motherndid not care about alcohol,,they were not sexually aggressive.,The monkeys that didn't have a mothernwere aggressive, were stressed,and were alcoholics.,So we looked at their DNAnearly after birth, to see:,Is it possible that the mother is marking?,Is there a signature of the mothernin the DNA of the offspring? 
 These are Day-14 monkeys,,and what you see here is the modern waynby which we study epigenetics.,We can now map those chemical marks,nwhich we call methylation marks,,on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.,We can map the entire genome.,We can now compare the monkeynthat had a mother or not.,And here's a visual presentation of this.,What you see is the genesnthat got more methylated are red.,The genes that gotnless methylated are green.,You can see many genes are changing,,because not having a mothernis not just one thing --,it affects the whole way;,it sends signals about the whole waynyour world is going to look,when you become an adult.,And you can see the two groups of monkeys,extremely well-separated from each other.,How early does this develop?,These monkeys alreadyndidn't see their mothers,,so they had a social experience.,Do we sense our social status,neven at the moment of birth? 
 So in this experiment,nwe took placentas of monkeys,that had different social status.,What's interesting about social ranknis that across all living beings,,they will structurenthemselves by hierarchy.,Monkey number one is the boss;,monkey number four is the peon.,You put four monkeys in a cage,,there will always be a bossnand always be a peon.,And what's interestingnis that the monkey number one,is much healthier than monkey number four.,And if you put them in a cage,,monkey number one will not eat as much.,Monkey number four will eat [a lot].,And what you see herenin this methylation mapping,,a dramatic separation at birth,of the animals that hadna high social status,versus the animalsnthat did not have a high status. 
 So we are born already knowingnthe social information,,and that social informationnis not bad or good,,it just prepares us for life,,because we have to programnour biology differently,if we are in the highnor the low social status. 
 But how can you study this in humans?,We can't do experiments,nwe can't administer adversity to humans.,But God does experiments with humans,,and it's called natural disasters. 
 One of the hardest natural disastersnin Canadian history,happened in my province of Quebec.,It's the ice storm of 1998.,We lost our entire electrical gridnbecause of an ice storm,when the temperaturesnwere, in the dead of winter in Quebec,,minus 20 to minus 30.,And there were pregnantnmothers during that time.,And my colleague Suzanne Kingnfollowed the children of these mothers,for 15 years. 
 And what happened was,nthat as the stress increased --,and here we had objectivenmeasures of stress:,How long were you without power?nWhere did you spend your time?,Was it in your mother-in-law's apartmentnor in some posh country home?,So all of these added upnto a social stress scale,,and you can ask the question:,How did the children look?,And it appears that as stress increases,,the children develop more autism,,they develop more metabolic diseases,and they develop more autoimmune diseases.,We would map the methylation state,,and again, you see the green genesnbecoming red as stress increases,,the red genes becoming greennas stress increases,,an entire rearrangementnof the genome in response to stress. 
 So if we can program genes,,if we are not just the slavesnof the history of our genes,,that they could be programmed,ncan we deprogram them?,Because epigenetic causesncan cause diseases like cancer,,metabolic disease,and mental health diseases. 
 Let's talk about cocaine addiction.,Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation,that can lead to deathnand to loss of human life.,We asked the question:,Can we reprogram the addicted brain,to make that animal not addicted anymore?,We used a cocaine addiction model,that recapitulates what happens in humans.,In humans, you're in high school,,some friends suggest you use some cocaine,,you take cocaine, nothing happens.,Months pass by, something reminds younof what happened the first time,,a pusher pushes cocaine,,and you become addictednand your life has changed. 
 In rats, we do the same thing.,My colleague, Gal Yadid,,he trains the animalsnto get used to cocaine,,then for one month, no cocaine.,Then he reminds them of the partynwhen they saw the cocaine the first time,by cue, the colors of the cagenwhen they saw cocaine.,And they go crazy.,They will press the lever to get cocaine,until they die.,We first determined that the differencenbetween these animals,is that during that timenwhen nothing happens,,there's no cocaine around,,their epigenome is rearranged.,Their genes are re-markednin a different way,,and when the cue comes,ntheir genome is ready,to develop this addictive phenotype. 
 So we treated these animals with drugsnthat either increase DNA methylation,,which was the epigeneticnmarker to look at,,or decrease epigenetic markings.,And we found thatnif we increased methylation,,these animals go even crazier.,They become more craving for cocaine.,But if we reduce the DNA methylation,,the animals are not addicted anymore.,We have reprogrammed them.,And a fundamental differencenbetween an epigenetic drug,and any other drug,is that with epigenetic drugs,,we essentially removenthe signs of experience,,and once they're gone,,they will not come backnunless you have the same experience.,The animal now is reprogrammed.,So when we visited the animalsn30 days, 60 days later,,which is in human termsnmany years of life,,they were still not addicted --nby a single epigenetic treatment. 
 So what did we learn about DNA?,DNA is not just a sequence of letters;,it's not just a script.,DNA is a dynamic movie.,Our experiences are being writtenninto this movie, which is interactive.,You're, like, watching a movienof your life, with the DNA,,with your remote control.,You can remove an actor and add an actor.,And so you have, in spitenof the deterministic nature of genetics,,you have control of the waynyour genes look,,and this has a tremendousnoptimistic message,for the ability to now encounternsome of the deadly diseases,like cancer, mental health,,with a new approach,,looking at them as maladaptation.,And if we can epigenetically intervene,,[we can] reverse the movienby removing an actor,and setting up a new narrative. 
 So what I told you today is,,our DNA is really combinednof two components,,two layers of information.,One layer of information is old,,evolved from millionsnof years of evolution.,It is fixed and very hard to change.,The other layer of informationnis the epigenetic layer,,which is open and dynamic,and sets up a narrativenthat is interactive,,that allows us to control,nto a large extent, our destiny,,to help the destiny of our children,and to hopefully conquer disease,and serious health challenges,that have plagued humankindnfor a long time. 
 So even though we are determined,by our genes,,we have a degree of freedom,that can set up our lifento a life of responsibility. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I design engineering projects,for middle schoolnand high school students,,often using materialsnthat are pretty unexpected.,My inspiration comesnfrom problems in my daily life.,For example,,one time I needed a costumento go to a comic convention,,but I didn't want to spend too much money,,so I made my own ...,with a light-up crown and skirt. 
 (Laughter) 
 Another time,,I was devastatednbecause my favorite mobile game,,Flappy Bird,,was being taken off the app store. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I was faced with the dilemma,to either never update my phonenor never play Flappy Bird again. 
 (Laughter) 
 Unhappy with both options,,I did the only thingnthat made sense to me.,I made a physical version of Flappy Bird,that could never bentaken off the app store. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Music) 
 (Beeping) 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 So a few of my friendsnwere also pretty addicted to the game,,and I invited them to play as well. 
 (Video) Friend: Ah! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Video) Friend: What the heck? 
 (Laughter) 
 And they told me that it wasnjust as infuriating as the original game. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I uploaded a demonof this project online,,and to my surprise it went viral.,It had over two million viewsnin just a few days. 
 (Laughter) 
 And what's more interestingnare people's comments.,A lot of peoplenwanted to make it their own,,or asked me how it was made.,So this kind of confirmed my ideanthat through a creative project,,we can teach people about engineering. 
 With the money made from the viral video,,we were able to let studentsnin our classroom,all make their own game in a box.,Although it was pretty challenging,,they learned a lot of new conceptsnin engineering and programming.,And they were all eager to learnnso they could finish the game as well. 
 (Laughter) 
 So before Flappy Bird Box,,I had the idea of using creativenengineering projects to teach students.,When I was teaching at a middle school,,we asked our students to build a robotnfrom a standard technology kit.,And I noticed thatna lot of them seemed bored.,Then a few of themnstarted taking pieces of paper,and decorating their robots.,And then more of them got into it,,and they becamenmore interested in the project.,So I started lookingnfor more creative ways,to introduce technology to students.,What I found was that most technology kitsnavailable in school,look a little intimidating.,They're all made of plastic partsnthat you can't customize.,On top of that,nthey're all very expensive,,costing hundreds of dollars per kit.,So that's certainly not very affordablenfor most classroom budgets. 
 Since I didn't find anything,,I decided to make something on my own.,I started with paper and fabric.,After all, we all playednwith those since we were kids,,and they are also pretty cheap,and can be foundnanywhere around the house.,And I prototyped a project,where studentsncan create a light-up creature,using fabric and googly eyes.,They were all helpingneach other in classrooms,,and were laughingnand discussing the project.,And most importantly,,they were able to insertntheir own creativity into the project. 
 So because of the success of this project,,I continued to createnmore engineering projects,to challenge my students.,And I also started to takenthese workshops outside of school,and into the community.,And something really interesting happened.,I noticed a lot of peoplenfrom very diverse backgrounds,started coming to our workshops.,And specifically,,there were a lot more womennand minorities than I expected,,and that you wouldn't usually seenat a traditional engineering workshop. 
 Now take a look at this employee reportnat a major technology company in 2016.,Women make up only 19 percentnof the technology workforce.,And underrepresented minoritiesnmake up only four percent.,This statistic might look familiar,if you walked intona high school robotics club,,or a college engineering class. 
 Now, there's a wide variety of problems,that contribute to the lack of diversitynin the technology force.,Perhaps one solution could be,to introduce technology to studentsnthrough creative projects.,I'm not saying that thisncould solve everything,,but it could introduce technology,to people who originallynwouldn't be interested in it,because of how it has beennportrayed and taught in school. 
 So how do we start to changenthe perception of technology?,Most students thinknthat it's boring or unwelcoming,,so I have always designed projectsnfollowing three principles.,First is having a low floor,,and that means this projectnis easy to get started.,So take a look at this tutorial.,The first projectnwe asked students to learn,is to make a circuit on paper.,As you can see, it doesn'tntake very long to learn,,and it's pretty easy even for beginners.,And having a low floor also meansnthat we're removing the financial barrier,that prevents peoplenfrom completing a project.,So with paper, copper tape,nlightbulb and a battery,,people can complete this projectnfor under a dollar. 
 So second principlenis having a high ceiling.,This means that there'sna lot of room to grow,,and students arenconstantly being challenged.,At first it might just bena light-up creature,,but then you can add sensorsnand microcontrollers,,and start to program the creaturento interact with its environment. 
 (Laughter) 
 And finally,,the third principle is customization.,This means that we can makenthis project relevant to anyone.,That's the beautynof using everyday materials;,it's very easy to customizenusing paper and fabric.,So even if you don't like Flappy Bird,,you can still make your own game. 
 (Video) Student: So our gamenis about Justin Bieber,,because he's been speeding,,and the object is to prevent himnfrom getting caught by the LAPD -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Video) Student:nYeah, but he's changing so --,we're a part of his posse. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)For the past few years,,I've been spending my summersnin the marine biological laboratory,in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.,And there, what I've been doingnis essentially renting a boat.,What I would like to do is ask you,to come on a boat ride with me tonight. 
 So, we ride off from Eel Pondninto Vineyard Sound,,right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,,equipped with a dronento identify potential spots,from which to peer into the Atlantic.,Earlier, I was going to sayninto the depths of the Atlantic,,but we don't have to go too deepnto reach the unknown.,Here, barely two miles away,from what is arguably the greatestnmarine biology lab in the world,,we lower a simplenplankton net into the water,and bring up to the surface,things that humanity rarelynpays any attention to,,and oftentimes has never seen before. 
 Here's one of the organismsnthat we caught in our net.,This is a jellyfish.,But look closely,,and living inside of this animalnis another organism,that is very likelynentirely new to science.,A complete new species.,Or how about this other transparent beauty,with a beating heart,,asexually growing on top of its head,,progeny that will move onnto reproduce sexually.,Let me say that again:,this animal is growing asexuallynon top of its head,,progeny that is going to reproducensexually in the next generation.,A weird jellyfish?,Not quite.,This is an ascidian.,This is a group of animals,that now we know we sharenextensive genomic ancestry with,,and it is perhaps the closestninvertebrate species to our own.,Meet your cousin,,Thalia democratica. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spotnat your last family reunion,for Thalia,,but let me tell you,,these animals are profoundly related to us,in ways that we're justnbeginning to understand.,So, next time you hear anybodynderisively telling you,that this type of researchnis a simple fishing expedition,,I hope that you'll remembernthe trip that we just took. 
 Today, many of the biologicalnsciences only see value,in studying deeper what we already know --,in mapping already-discovered continents.,But some of us are much moreninterested in the unknown.,We want to discoverncompletely new continents,,and gaze at magnificentnvistas of ignorance.,We crave the experiencenof being completely baffled,by something we've never seen before.,And yes, I agree,there's a lot of little ego satisfactionnin being able to say,,"Hey, I was the first onento discover that.",But this is notna self-aggrandizing enterprise,,because in this typenof discovery research,,if you don't feel like a completenidiot most of the time,,you're just not sciencing hard enough. 
 (Laughter) 
 So every summer I bring onto the decknof this little boat of ours,more and more thingsnthat we know very little about.,I would like tonightnto tell you a story about life,that rarely gets toldnin an environment like this.,From the vantage point of our 21st-centurynbiological laboratories,,we have begun to illuminatenmany mysteries of life with knowledge.,We sense that after centuriesnof scientific research,,we're beginning to makensignificant inroads,into understanding some of the mostnfundamental principles of life. 
 Our collective optimism is reflectednby the growth of biotechnology,across the globe,,striving to utilize scientific knowledgento cure human diseases.,Things like cancer, aging,ndegenerative diseases;,these are but somenof the undesirables we wish to tame.,I often wonder:,Why is it that we are havingnso much trouble,trying to solve the problem of cancer?,Is it that we're trying to solventhe problem of cancer,,and not trying to understand life? 
 Life on this planetnshares a common origin,,and I can summarize 3.5 billion yearsnof the history of life on this planet,in a single slide.,What you see here are representativesnof all known species in our planet.,In this immensity of lifenand biodiversity,,we occupy a rather unremarkable position. 
 (Laughter) 
 Homo sapiens.,The last of our kind.,And though I don't really wantnto disparage at all,the accomplishments of our species,,as much as we wish it to be sonand often pretend that it is,,we are not the measure of all things.,We are, however, the measurersnof many things.,We relentlessly quantify,nanalyze and compare,,and some of this is absolutely invaluablenand indeed necessary. 
 But this emphasis today on forcingnbiological research to specialize,and to produce practical outcomes,is actually restricting our abilitynto interrogate life,to unacceptably narrow confinesnand unsatisfying depths.,We are measuring an astonishinglynnarrow sliver of life,,and hoping that those numbersnwill save all of our lives.,How narrow do you ask?,Well, let me give you a number.,The National Oceanic and AtmosphericnAdministration recently estimated,that about 95 percent of our oceansnremain unexplored.,Now let that sink in for a second.,95 percent of our oceansnremain unexplored.,I think it's very safe to say,that we don't even knownhow much about life we do not know. 
 So, it's not surprisingnthat every week in my field,we begin to see the additionnof more and more new species,to this amazing tree of life.,This one for example --,discovered earlier this summer,,new to science,,and now occupying its lonely branchnin our family tree.,What is even more tragic,is that we know about a bunchnof other species of animals out there,,but their biology remainsnsorely under-studied. 
 I'm sure some of younhave heard about the fact,that a starfish can actuallynregenerate its arm after it's lost.,But some of you might not know,that the arm itself can actuallynregenerate a complete starfish.,And there are animals out therenthat do truly astounding things.,I'm almost willing to bet,that many of you have never heardnof the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.,This little guy right here,does things that essentiallynjust blow my mind.,You can grab one of these animalsnand cut it into 18 different fragments,,and each and every one of those fragmentsnwill go on to regenerate,a complete animal,in under two weeks.,18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries.,For the past decade and a half or so,,I've been trying to figure outnhow these little dudes do what they do,,and how they pull this magic trick off.,But like all good magicians,,they're not really releasingntheir secrets readily to me. 
 (Laughter) 
 So here we are,,after 20 years of essentiallynstudying these animals,,genome mapping, chin scratching,,and thousands of amputationsnand thousands of regenerations,,we still don't fully understandnhow these animals do what they do.,Each planarian an ocean unto itself,,full of unknowns. 
 One of the common characteristics,of all of these animalsnI've been talking to you about,is that they did not appearnto have received the memo,that they need to behavenaccording to the rules,that we have derived from a handfulnof randomly selected animals,that currently populate the vast majority,of biomedical laboratoriesnacross the world.,Meet our Nobel Prize winners.,Seven species, essentially,,that have produced for us the bruntnof our understanding,of biological behavior today.,This little guy right here --,three Nobel Prizes in 12 years.,And yet, after all the attentionnthey have garnered,,and all the knowledge they have generated,,as well as the lion's sharenof the funding,,here we are standing [before] the samenlitany of intractable problems,and many new challenges.,And that's because, unfortunately,,these seven animals essentially correspond,to 0.0009 percent of all of the speciesnthat inhabit the planet. 
 So I'm beginning to suspect,that our specialization is beginningnto impede our progress at best,,and at worst, is leading us astray.,That's because lifenon this planet and its history,is the history of rule breakers.,Life started on the face of this planetnas single-cell organisms,,swimming for millionsnof years in the ocean,,until one of those creatures decided,,"I'm going to do things differently today;,today I would like to inventnsomething called multicellularity,,and I'm going to do this.",And I'm sure it wasn't a popularndecision at the time -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but somehow, it managed to do it.,And then, multicellularnorganisms began to populate,all these ancestral oceans,,and they thrived.,And we have them here today.,Land masses began to emergenfrom the surface of the oceans,,and another creature thought,,"Hey, that looks like a really nicenpiece of real estate.,I'd like to move there.","Are you crazy?,You're going to desiccate out there.nNothing can live out of water.",But life found a way,,and there are organismsnnow that live on land.,Once on land, they may havenlooked up into the sky,and said, "It would be nicento go to the clouds,,I'm going to fly.","You can't break the law of gravity,nthere's no way you can fly.",And yet, nature has invented --,multiple and independent times --,ways to fly. 
 I love to study these animalsnthat break the rules,,because every time they break a rule,nthey invent something new,that made it possible for usnto be able to be here today.,These animals did not get the memo.,They break the rules.,So if we're going to study animalsnthat break the rules,,shouldn't how we study themnalso break the rules? 
 I think we need to renewnour spirit of exploration.,Rather than bring natureninto our laboratories,and interrogate it there,,we need to bring our science,into the majestic laboratorynthat is nature,,and there, with our modernntechnological armamentarium,,interrogate every new formnof life we find,,and any new biological attributenthat we may find.,We actually need to bringnall of our intelligence,to becoming stupid again --,clueless [before] the immensitynof the unknown.,Because after all,,science is not really about knowledge.,Science is about ignorance.,That's what we do. 
 Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote,,"If you want to build a ship,,don't drum up people to collect wood,and don't assign them tasks and work,,but rather teach them to longnfor the endless immensity of the sea ...",As a scientist and a teacher,,I like to paraphrase this to read,that we scientists neednto teach our students,to long for the endlessnimmensity of the sea,that is our ignorance.,We Homo sapiens are the onlynspecies we know of,that is driven to scientific inquiry.,We, like all other species on this planet,,are inextricably wovenninto the history of life on this planet.,And I think I'm a little wrongnwhen I say that life is a mystery,,because I think that lifenis actually an open secret,that has been beckoning our speciesnfor millennia to understand it. 
 So I ask you:,Aren't we the best chancenthat life has to know itself?,And if so,,what the heck are we waiting for? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There is something about physics,that has been really bothering mensince I was a little kid.,And it's related to a question,that scientists have been askingnfor almost 100 years,,with no answer.,How do the smallest things in nature,,the particles of the quantum world,,match up with the largestnthings in nature --,planets and stars and galaxiesnheld together by gravity? 
 As a kid, I would puzzlenover questions just like this.,I would fiddle aroundnwith microscopes and electromagnets,,and I would readnabout the forces of the small,and about quantum mechanics,and I would marvel at how wellnthat description matched up,to our observation.,Then I would look at the stars,,and I would read about how wellnwe understand gravity,,and I would think surely,nthere must be some elegant way,that these two systems match up.,But there's not.,And the books would say,,yeah, we understand a lotnabout these two realms separately,,but when we try to linknthem mathematically,,everything breaks. 
 And for 100 years,,none of our ideas as to how to solventhis basically physics disaster,,has ever been supported by evidence.,And to little old me --,little, curious, skeptical James --,this was a supremely unsatisfying answer. 
 So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.,Flash-forward nownto December of 2015,,when I found myself smack in the middle,of the physics worldnbeing flipped on its head.,It all started when we at CERNnsaw something intriguing in our data:,a hint of a new particle,,an inkling of a possibly extraordinarynanswer to this question. 
 So I'm still a skepticalnlittle kid, I think,,but I'm also now a particle hunter.,I am a physicist at CERN'snLarge Hadron Collider,,the largest sciencenexperiment ever mounted.,It's a 27-kilometer tunnelnon the border of France and Switzerland,buried 100 meters underground.,And in this tunnel,,we use superconducting magnetsncolder than outer space,to accelerate protonsnto almost the speed of light,and slam them into each othernmillions of times per second,,collecting the debris of these collisions,to search for new, undiscoverednfundamental particles.,Its design and constructionntook decades of work,by thousands of physicistsnfrom around the globe,,and in the summer of 2015,,we had been working tirelesslynto switch on the LHC,at the highest energy that humansnhave ever used in a collider experiment. 
 Now, higher energy is important,because for particles,nthere is an equivalence,between energy and particle mass,,and mass is just a numbernput there by nature.,To discover new particles,,we need to reach these bigger numbers.,And to do that, we have to buildna bigger, higher energy collider,,and the biggest, highestnenergy collider in the world,is the Large Hadron Collider.,And then, we collide protonsnquadrillions of times,,and we collect this data very slowly,nover months and months.,And then new particles might show upnin our data as bumps --,slight deviations from what you expect,,little clusters of data pointsnthat make a smooth line not so smooth.,For example, this bump,,after months of data-taking in 2012,,led to the discoverynof the Higgs particle --,the Higgs boson --,and to a Nobel Prizenfor the confirmation of its existence. 
 This jump up in energy in 2015,represented the best chancenthat we as a species had ever had,of discovering new particles --,new answers to thesenlong-standing questions,,because it was almostntwice as much energy as we used,when we discovered the Higgs boson.,Many of my colleagues had been workingntheir entire careers for this moment,,and frankly, to little curious me,,this was the momentnI'd been waiting for my entire life.,So 2015 was go time. 
 So June 2015,,the LHC is switched back on.,My colleagues and I held our breathnand bit our fingernails,,and then finally we sawnthe first proton collisions,at this highest energy ever.,Applause, champagne, celebration.,This was a milestone for science,,and we had no idea what we would findnin this brand-new data.,And then a few weeks later,nwe found a bump.,It wasn't a very big bump,,but it was big enough to makenyou raise your eyebrow.,But on a scale of one to 10nfor eyebrow raises,,if 10 indicates that you'vendiscovered a new particle,,this eyebrow raise is about a four. 
 (Laughter) 
 I spent hours, days, weeksnin secret meetings,,arguing with my colleaguesnover this little bump,,poking and prodding it with our mostnruthless experimental sticks,to see if it would withstand scrutiny.,But even after monthsnof working feverishly --,sleeping in our officesnand not going home,,candy bars for dinner,,coffee by the bucketful --,physicists are machinesnfor turning coffee into diagrams -- 
 (Laughter) 
 This little bump would not go away.,So after a few months,,we presented our little bump to the worldnwith a very clear message:,this little bump is interestingnbut it's not definitive,,so let's keep an eye on itnas we take more data.,So we were trying to benextremely cool about it. 
 And the world ran with it anyway.,The news loved it.,People said it remindednthem of the little bump,that was shown on the wayntoward the Higgs boson discovery.,Better than that,nmy theorist colleagues --,I love my theorist colleagues --,my theorist colleagues wroten500 papers about this little bump. 
 (Laughter) 
 The world of particle physicsnhad been flipped on its head.,But what was it about this particular bump,that caused thousands of physicistsnto collectively lose their cool?,This little bump was unique.,This little bump indicated,that we were seeing an unexpectedlynlarge number of collisions,whose debris consistednof only two photons,,two particles of light.,And that's rare. 
 Particle collisions are notnlike automobile collisions.,They have different rules.,When two particles collidenat almost the speed of light,,the quantum world takes over.,And in the quantum world,,these two particlesncan briefly create a new particle,that lives for a tiny fraction of a second,before splitting into other particlesnthat hit our detector.,Imagine a car collisionnwhere the two cars vanish upon impact,,a bicycle appears in their place -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And then that bicycle explodesninto two skateboards,,which hit our detector. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hopefully, not literally.,They're very expensive. 
 Events where only two photonsnhit out detector are very rare.,And because of the specialnquantum properties of photons,,there's a very small numbernof possible new particles --,these mythical bicycles --,that can give birth to only two photons.,But one of these options is huge,,and it has to do withnthat long-standing question,that bothered me as a tiny little kid,,about gravity. 
 Gravity may seem super strong to you,,but it's actually crazily weakncompared to the other forces of nature.,I can briefly beat gravity when I jump,,but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.,The strength of gravity comparednto the other forces of nature?,It's 10 to the minus 39.,That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it. 
 Worse than that,,all of the other known forces of naturenare perfectly described,by this thing we call the Standard Model,,which is our current best descriptionnof nature at its smallest scales,,and quite frankly,,one of the most successfulnachievements of humankind --,except for gravity, which is absentnfrom the Standard Model.,It's crazy.,It's almost as though mostnof gravity has gone missing.,We feel a little bit of it,,but where's the rest of it?,No one knows. 
 But one theoretical explanationnproposes a wild solution.,You and I --,even you in the back --,we live in three dimensions of space.,I hope that's annon-controversial statement. 
 (Laughter) 
 All of the known particles also livenin three dimensions of space.,In fact, a particle is just another name,for an excitationnin a three-dimensional field;,a localized wobbling in space.,More importantly, all the mathnthat we use to describe all this stuff,assumes that there are onlynthree dimensions of space.,But math is math, and we can playnaround with our math however we want.,And people have been playing aroundnwith extra dimensions of space,for a very long time,,but it's always been an abstractnmathematical concept.,I mean, just look around you --nyou at the back, look around --,there's clearly onlynthree dimensions of space. 
 But what if that's not true?,What if the missing gravity is leakingninto an extra-spatial dimension,that's invisible to you and I?,What if gravity is just as strongnas the other forces,if you were to view it in thisnextra-spatial dimension,,and what you and I experiencenis a tiny slice of gravity,make it seem very weak?,If this were true,,we would have to expandnour Standard Model of particles,to include an extra particle,na hyperdimensional particle of gravity,,a special graviton that livesnin extra-spatial dimensions. 
 I see the looks on your faces.,You should be asking me the question,,"How in the world are we going to testnthis crazy, science fiction idea,,stuck as we are in three dimensions?",The way we always do,,by slamming together two protons -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Hard enough thatnthe collision reverberates,into any extra-spatial dimensionsnthat might be there,,momentarily creatingnthis hyperdimensional graviton,that then snaps backninto the three dimensions of the LHC,and spits off two photons,,two particles of light.,And this hypothetical,nextra-dimensional graviton,is one of the only possible,nhypothetical new particles,that has the special quantum properties,that could give birth to our little,ntwo-photon bump. 
 So, the possibility of explainingnthe mysteries of gravity,and of discovering extrandimensions of space --,perhaps now you get a sense,as to why thousands of physics geeksncollectively lost their cool,over our little, two-photon bump.,A discovery of this typenwould rewrite the textbooks.,But remember,,the message from us experimentalists,that actually were doingnthis work at the time,,was very clear:,we need more data.,With more data,,the little bump will either turn intona nice, crisp Nobel Prize -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Or the extra data will fill innthe space around the bump,and turn it into a nice, smooth line. 
 So we took more data,,and with five times the data,nseveral months later,,our little bump,turned into a smooth line.,The news reported on a "hugendisappointment," on "faded hopes,",and on particle physicists "being sad.",Given the tone of the coverage,,you'd think that we had decidednto shut down the LHC and go home. 
 (Laughter) 
 But that's not what we did.,But why not?,I mean, if I didn't discoverna particle -- and I didn't --,if I didn't discover a particle,nwhy am I here talking to you?,Why didn't I just hang my head in shame,and go home? 
 Particle physicists are explorers.,And very much of what we donis cartography.,Let me put it this way: forgetnabout the LHC for a second.,Imagine you are a space explorernarriving at a distant planet,,searching for aliens.,What is your first task?,To immediately orbit the planet,nland, take a quick look around,for any big, obvious signs of life,,and report back to home base.,That's the stage we're at now.,We took a first look at the LHC,for any new, big,nobvious-to-spot particles,,and we can report that there are none.,We saw a weird-looking alien bumpnon a distant mountain,,but once we got closer,nwe saw it was a rock. 
 But then what do we do?nDo we just give up and fly away?,Absolutely not;,we would be terrible scientists if we did.,No, we spend the next couplenof decades exploring,,mapping out the territory,,sifting through the sandnwith a fine instrument,,peeking under every stone,,drilling under the surface.,New particles can eithernshow up immediately,as big, obvious-to-spot bumps,,or they can only reveal themselvesnafter years of data taking. 
 Humanity has just begun its explorationnat the LHC at this big high energy,,and we have much searching to do.,But what if, even after 10 or 20 years,nwe still find no new particles?,We build a bigger machine. 
 (Laughter) 
 We search at higher energies.,We search at higher energies.,Planning is already underwaynfor a 100-kilometer tunnel,that will collide particlesnat 10 times the energy of the LHC.,We don't decide wherennature places new particles.,We only decide to keep exploring.,But what if, even afterna 100-kilometer tunnel,or a 500-kilometer tunnel,or a 10,000-kilometerncollider floating in space,between the Earth and the Moon,,we still find no new particles?,Then perhaps we're doingnparticle physics wrong. 
 (Laughter) 
 Perhaps we need to rethink things.,Maybe we need more resources,ntechnology, expertise,than what we currently have.,We already use artificial intelligencenand machine learning techniques,in parts of the LHC,,but imagine designingna particle physics experiment,using such sophisticated algorithms,that it could teach itself to discoverna hyperdimensional graviton. 
 But what if?,What if the ultimate question:,What if even artificial intelligencencan't help us answer our questions?,What if these open questions,nfor centuries,,are destined to be unanswerednfor the foreseeable future?,What if the stuff that's bothered mensince I was a little kid,is destined to be unanswerednin my lifetime?,Then that ...,will be even more fascinating. 
 We will be forced to thinknin completely new ways.,We'll have to go back to our assumptions,,and determine if there wasna flaw somewhere.,And we'll need to encourage more peoplento join us in studying science,since we need fresh eyesnon these century-old problems.,I don't have the answers,nand I'm still searching for them.,But someone -- maybenshe's in school right now,,maybe she's not even born yet --,could eventually guide us to see physicsnin a completely new way,,and to point out that perhapsnwe're just asking the wrong questions.,Which would not be the end of physics,,but a novel beginning. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Why bother?,The game is rigged.,My vote won't count.,The choices are terrible.,Voting is for suckers. 
 Perhaps you've thoughtnsome of these things.,Perhaps you've even said them.,And if so, you wouldn't be alone,nand you wouldn't be entirely wrong.,The game of public policy todaynis rigged in many ways.,How else would more than halfnof federal tax breaks,flow up to the wealthiestnfive percent of Americans?,And our choices indeed are often terrible.,For many peoplenacross the political spectrum,,Exhibit A is the 2016npresidential election.,But in any year, you can looknup and down the ballot,and find plenty to be uninspired about. 
 But in spite of all this,nI still believe voting matters.,And crazy as it may sound,,I believe we can revive the joy of voting.,Today, I want to talknabout how we can do that, and why. 
 There used to be a timenin American history when voting was fun,,when it was much more than justna grim duty to show up at the polls.,That time is calledn"most of American history." 
 (Laughter) 
 From the Revolutionnto the Civil Rights Era,,the United States had a vibrant,,robustly participatorynand raucous culture of voting.,It was street theater, open-air debates,nfasting and feasting and toasting,,parades and bonfires.,During the 19th century,nimmigrants and urban political machines,helped fuel this culture of voting.,That culture grew with eachnsuccessive wave of new voters.,During Reconstruction,nwhen new African-American voters,,new African-American citizens,,began to exercise their power,,they celebrated in jubilee parades,that connected emancipationnwith their newfound right to vote.,A few decades later, the suffragettes,brought a spiritnof theatricality to their fight,,marching together in white dressesnas they claimed the franchise.,And the Civil Rights Movement,,which sought to redeemnthe promise of equal citizenship,that had been betrayed by Jim Crow,,put voting right at the center.,From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,,that generation of activistsnknew that voting matters,,and they knew that spectaclenand the performance of power,is key to actually claiming power. 
 But it's been over a half centurynsince Selma and the Voting Rights Act,,and in the decades since,,this face-to-face culture of voting,has just about disappeared.,It's been killed by television,and then the internet.,The couch has replaced the commons.,Screens have madencitizens into spectators.,And while it's nice to sharenpolitical memes on social media,,that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.,It's what the sociologist Sherry Turklencalls "being alone together." 
 What we need today,is an electoral culturenthat is about being together together,,in person,,in loud and passionate ways,,so that instead of beingn"eat your vegetables" or "do you duty,",voting can feel more like "join the club",or, better yet, "join the party." 
 Imagine if we had,nacross the country right now,,in local places but nationwide,,a concerted effortnto revive a face-to-face set of ways,to engage and electioneer:,outdoor shows in which candidatesnand their causes are mocked,and praised in broad satirical style;,soapbox speeches by citizens;,public debates held inside pubs;,streets filled with political artnand handmade posters and murals;,battle of the band concerts in whichncompeting performers rep their candidates.,Now, all of this may soundna little bit 18th century to you,,but in fact, it doesn't have to benany more 18th century,than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton,",which is to say vibrantly contemporary. 
 And the fact is that all around the world,,today, millions of peoplenare voting like this.,In India, elections are colorful,ncommunal affairs.,In Brazil, election daynis a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.,In Taiwan and Hong Kong,nthere is a spectacle,,eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle,to the street theater of elections. 
 You might ask, well,nhere in America, who has time for this?,And I would tell you,that the average Americannwatches five hours of television a day.,You might ask, who has the motivation?,And I'll tell you,,any citizen who wants to be seen and heard,not as a prop, not as a talking point,,but as a participant, as a creator. 
 Well, how do we make this happen?,Simply by making it happen. 
 That's why a group of colleagues and I,launched a new projectncalled "The Joy of Voting.",In four cities across the United States --,Philadelphia, Miami,,Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --,we've gathered togethernartists and activists,,educators, political folks,nneighbors, everyday citizens,to come together and create projects,that can foster this culturenof voting in a local way. 
 In Miami, that meansnall-night parties with hot DJs,where the only way to get innis to show that you're registered to vote.,In Akron, it means political plays,being performednin the bed of a flatbed truck,that moves from neighborhoodnto neighborhood.,In Philadelphia,,it's a voting-themed scavenger huntnall throughout colonial old town.,And in Wichita, it's makingnmixtapes and live graffiti art,in the North End to get out the vote.,There are 20 of these projects,,and they are remarkablenin their beauty and their diversity,,and they are changing people.,Let me tell you about a couple of them. 
 In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,,a young artist named Atomico,,to create some vivid and vibrant imagesnfor a new series of "I voted" stickers.,But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.,He wasn't even registered.,So as he got to work on creatingnthis artwork for these stickers,,he also began to get overnhis sense of intimidation about politics.,He got himself registered,,and then he got educatednabout the upcoming primary election,,and on election day he was out therennot just passing out stickers,,but chatting up votersnand encouraging people to vote,,and talking aboutnthe election with passersby. 
 In Akron, a theater companyncalled the Wandering Aesthetics,has been putting onnthese pickup truck plays.,And to do so, they put outnan open call to the public,asking for speeches,nmonologues, dialogues, poems,,snippets of anythingnthat could be read aloud,and woven into a performance.,They got dozens of submissions.,One of them was a poem,written by nine students in an ESL class,,all of them Hispanic migrant workers,from nearby Hartville, Ohio.,I want to read to you from this poem.,It's called "The Joy of Voting." 
 "I would like to vote for the first time,because things are changing for Hispanics.,I used to be afraid of ghosts.,Now I am afraid of people.,There's more violence and racism.,Voting can change this.,The border wall is nothing.,It's just a wall.,The wall of shame is something.,It's very important to vote,so we can break down this wall of shame.,I have passion in my heart.,Voting gives me a voice and power.,I can stand up and do something." 
 "The Joy of Voting" projectnisn't just about joy.,It's about this passion.,It's about feeling and belief,,and it isn't just our organization's work.,All across this country right now,,immigrants, young people, veterans,npeople of all different backgrounds,are coming together to createnthis kind of passionate, joyful activity,around elections,,in red and blue states,nin urban and rural communities,,people of every political background.,What they have in common is simply this:,their work is rooted in place. 
 Because remember,nall citizenship is local.,When politics becomesnjust a presidential election,,we yell and we scream at our screens,nand then we collapse, exhausted.,But when politics is about us,and our neighborsnand other people in our community,coming together to create experiencesnof collective voice and imagination,,then we begin to remembernthat this stuff matters.,We begin to remembernthat this is the stuff of self-government. 
 Which brings me back to where I began.,Why bother?,There's one way to answer this question.,Voting matters because it isna self-fulfilling act of belief.,It feeds the spirit of mutual interestnthat makes any society thrive.,When we vote, even if it is in anger,,we are part of a collective,ncreative leap of faith.,Voting helps us generatenthe very power that we wish we had. 
 It's no accidentnthat democracy and theater,emerged around the same timenin ancient Athens.,Both of them yank the individualnout of the enclosure of her private self.,Both of them create greatnpublic experiences of shared ritual.,Both of them bring the imagination to life,in ways that remind usnthat all of our bonds in the end,are imagined, and can be reimagined. 
 This moment right now,,when we think aboutnthe meaning of imagination,,is so fundamentally important,,and our ability to take that spirit,and to take that sense,that there is something greater out there,,is not just a matternof technical expertise.,It's not just a matter of making the timenor having the know-how.,It is a matter of spirit. 
 But let me give you an answernto this question, "Why bother?",that is maybe a little less spiritualnand a bit more pointed.,Why bother voting?,Because there isnno such thing as not voting.,Not voting is voting,,for everything that younmay detest and oppose.,Not voting can be dressed up,as an act of principled,npassive resistance,,but in fact not voting,is actively handing power over,to those whose interestsnare counter to your own,,and those who would be very gladnto take advantage of your absence.,Not voting is for suckers. 
 Imagine where this country would be,if all the folks who in 2010ncreated the Tea Party,had decided that,nyou know, politics is too messy,,voting is too complicated.,There is no possibilitynof our votes adding up to anything.,They didn't preemptivelynsilence themselves.,They showed up,,and in the course of showing up,nthey changed American politics.,Imagine if all of the followersnof Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders,had decided not to upendnthe political status quo,and blow apart the framenof the previously possible,in American politics.,They did that by voting. 
 We live in a time right now,,divided, often very dark,,where across the left and the right,nthere's a lot of talk of revolution,and the need for revolutionnto disrupt everyday democracy.,Well, here's the thing:,everyday democracy alreadyngives us a playbook for revolution.,In the 2012 presidential election,,young voters, Latino voters,,Asian-American voters, low-income voters,,all showed up at less than 50 percent.,In the 2014 midterm elections,nturnout was 36 percent,,which was a 70-year low.,And in your average local election,,turnout hoversnsomewhere around 20 percent. 
 I invite you to imagine 100 percent.,Picture 100 percent.,Mobilize 100 percent,,and overnight, we get revolution.,Overnight, the policy prioritiesnof this country change dramatically,,and every level of governmentnbecomes radically more responsive,to all the people.,What would it takento mobilize 100 percent?,Well, we do have to push backnagainst efforts afoot,all across the country right now,to make voting harder.,But at the same time,,we have to actively createna positive culture of voting,that people want to belong to,,be part of, and experience together.,We have to make purpose.,We have to make joy. 
 So yes, let's have that revolution,,a revolution of spirit, of ideas,,of policy and participation,,a revolution against cynicism,,a revolution against the self-fulfillingnsense of powerlessness.,Let's vote this revolution into existence,,and while we're at it,,let's have some fun. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I remember the very first timenI went to a nice restaurant,,a really nice restaurant.,It was for a law firm recruitment dinner,,and I remember beforehandnthe waitress walked around,and asked whether we wanted some wine,,so I said, "Sure,nI'll take some white wine." 
 And she immediately said,,"Would you like sauvignon blancnor chardonnay?" 
 And I remember thinking,,"Come on, lady,nstop with the fancy French words,and just give me some white wine.",But I used my powers of deduction,and recognized that chardonnaynand sauvignon blanc,were two separate types of white wine,,and so I told hernthat I would take the chardonnay,,because frankly that wasnthe easiest one to pronounce for me. 
 So I had a lot of experiences like that,during my first couple of yearsnas a law student at Yale,,because, despite all outward appearances,nI'm a cultural outsider.,I didn't come from the elites.,I didn't come from the Northeastnor from San Francisco.,I came from a southern Ohio steel town,,and it's a town that's reallynstruggling in a lot of ways,,ways that are indicativenof the broader struggles,of America's working class.,Heroin has moved in,,killing a lot of people, people I know.,Family violence, domestic violence,nand divorce have torn apart families.,And there's a very uniquensense of pessimism that's moved in.,Think about rising mortality ratesnin these communities,and recognize thatnfor a lot of these folks,,the problems that they're seeing,are actually causing rising death ratesnin their own communities,,so there's a very real sense of struggle. 
 I had a very front-row seatnto that struggle.,My family has been part of that strugglenfor a very long time.,I come from a familynthat doesn't have a whole lot of money.,The addiction that plagued my community,also plagued my family,nand even, sadly, my own mom.,There were a lot of problemsnthat I saw in my own family,,problems caused sometimesnby a lack of money,,problems caused sometimes by a lacknof access to resources and social capital,that really affected my life. 
 If you had looked at my lifenwhen I was 14 years old,and said, "Well, what's goingnto happen to this kid?",you would have concludednthat I would have struggled,with what academics call upward mobility.,So upward mobility is an abstract term,,but it strikes at somethingnthat's very core,at the heart of the American Dream.,It's the sense,,and it measures whether kids like me,who grow up in poor communitiesnare going to live a better life,,whether they're going to have a chancento live a materially better existence,,or whether they're going to staynin the circumstances where they came from.,And one of the thingsnwe've learned, unfortunately,,is that upward mobility isn't as highnas we'd like it to be in this country,,and interestingly,nit's very geographically distributed.,So take Utah, for instance.,In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK,,very likely to live their sharenand their part in the American Dream.,But if you think of where I'm from,,in the South, in Appalachia,nin southern Ohio,,it's very unlikelynthat kids like that will rise.,The American Dreamnin those parts of the country,is in a very real sense just a dream. 
 So why is that happening?,So one reason is obviouslyneconomic or structural.,So you think of these areas.,They're beset by thesenterrible economic trends,,built around industriesnlike coal and steel,that make it hardernfor folks to get ahead.,That's certainly one problem.,There's also the problem of brain drain,nwhere the really talented people,,because they can't findnhigh-skilled work at home,,end up moving elsewhere,,so they don't build a businessnor non-profit where they're from,,they end up going elsewherenand taking their talents with them.,There are failing schoolsnin a lot of these communities,,failing to give kidsnthe educational leg up,that really makes it possible for kidsnto have opportunities later in life.,These things are all important.,I don't mean to discountnthese structural barriers.,But when I look back at my lifenand my community,,something else was going on,nsomething else mattered.,It's difficult to quantify,nbut it was no less real. 
 So for starters, there wasna very real sense of hopelessness,in the community that I grew up in.,There was a sense that kids hadnthat their choices didn't matter.,No matter what happened,nno matter how hard they worked,,no matter how hardnthey tried to get ahead,,nothing good would happen.,So that's a tough feelingnto grow up around.,That's a tough mindset to penetrate,,and it leads sometimesnto very conspiratorial places.,So let's just take onenpolitical issue that's pretty hot,,affirmative action.,So depending on your politics,nyou might think that affirmative action,is either a wise or an unwise waynto promote diversity in the workplace,or the classroom.,But if you grow up in an area like this,,you see affirmative actionnas a tool to hold people like you back.,That's especially true if you'rena member of the white working class.,You see it as somethingnthat isn't just about good or bad policy.,You see it as somethingnthat's actively conspiring,,where people with politicalnand financial power,are working against you.,And there are a lot of ways that you seenthat conspiracy against you --,perceived, real, but it's there,,and it warps expectations. 
 So if you think about what do you donwhen you grow up in that world,,you can respond in a couple of ways.,One, you can say,n"I'm not going to work hard,,because no matter how hard I work,nit's not going to matter.",Another thing you might do is say,,"Well, I'm not going to gonafter the traditional markers of success,,like a university educationnor a prestigious job,,because the people who carenabout those things are unlike me.,They're never going to let me in.",When I got admitted to Yale,na family member asked me,if I had pretended to be a liberalnto get by the admissions committee.,Seriously.,And it's obviously not the casenthat there was a liberal box to check,on the application,,but it speaks to a very realninsecurity in these places,that you have to pretendnto be somebody you're not,to get past these various social barriers.,It's a very significant problem. 
 Even if you don't give innto that hopelessness,,even if you think, let's say,,that your choices matternand you want to make the good choices,,you want to do betternfor yourself and for your family,,it's sometimes hardnto even know what those choices are,when you grow upnin a community like I did.,I didn't know, for example,,that you had to gonto law school to be a lawyer.,I didn't know that elite universities,nas research consistently tells us,,are cheaper for low-income kids,because these universitiesnhave bigger endowments,,can offer more generous financial aid.,I remember I learned this,when I got the financial aid letternfrom Yale for myself,,tens of thousands of dollarsnin need-based aid,,which is a term I had never heard before.,But I turned to my auntnwhen I got that letter and said,,"You know, I think this just meansnthat for the first time in my life,,being poor has paid really well." 
 So I didn't have accessnto that information,because the social networks around mendidn't have access to that information.,I learned from my communitynhow to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.,I learned how to makena damn good biscuit recipe.,The trick, by the way,nis frozen butter, not warm butter.,But I didn't learn how to get ahead.,I didn't learn how to makenthe good decisions,about education and opportunity,that you need to make,to actually have a chancenin this 21st century knowledge economy.,Economists call the valuenthat we gain from our informal networks,,from our friends and colleaguesnand family "social capital.",The social capital that I hadnwasn't built for 21st century America,,and it showed. 
 There's something elsenthat's really important that's going on,that our communityndoesn't like to talk about,,but it's very real.,Working-class kids are much more likely,to face what's callednadverse childhood experiences,,which is just a fancy wordnfor childhood trauma:,getting hit or yelled at,nput down by a parent repeatedly,,watching someone hit or beat your parent,,watching someone do drugsnor abuse alcohol.,These are all instancesnof childhood trauma,,and they're prettyncommonplace in my family.,Importantly, they're not justncommonplace in my family right now.,They're also multigenerational.,So my grandparents,,the very first time that they had kids,,they expected that theynwere going to raise them in a way,that was uniquely good.,They were middle class,,they were able to earnna good wage in a steel mill.,But what ended up happening,is that they exposed their kidsnto a lot of the childhood trauma,that had gone back many generations.,My mom was 12 when she sawnmy grandma set my grandfather on fire.,His crime was that he came home drunk,after she told him,,"If you come home drunk,nI'm gonna kill you.",And she tried to do it.,Think about the waynthat that affects a child's mind. 
 And we think of these thingsnas especially rare,,but a study by the WisconsinnChildren's Trust Fund found,that 40 percent of low-income kids facenmultiple instances of childhood trauma,,compared to only 29 percentnfor upper-income kids.,And think about what that really means.,If you're a low-income kid,,almost half of you face multipleninstances of childhood trauma.,This is not an isolated problem.,This is a very significant issue. 
 We know what happensnto the kids who experience that life.,They're more likely to do drugs,nmore likely to go to jail,,more likely to drop out of high school,,and most importantly,,they're more likelynto do to their children,what their parents did to them.,This trauma, this chaos in the home,,is our culture'snvery worst gift to our children,,and it's a gift that keeps on giving. 
 So you combine all that,,the hopelessness, the despair,,the cynicism about the future,,the childhood trauma,,the low social capital,,and you begin to understand why me,,at the age of 14,,was ready to becomenjust another statistic,,another kid who failed to beat the odds. 
 But something unexpected happened.,I did beat the odds.,Things turned up for me.,I graduated from high school,nfrom college, I went to law school,,and I have a pretty good job now.,So what happened? 
 Well, one thing that happenednis that my grandparents,,the same grandparentsnof setting someone on fire fame,,they really shaped upnby the time I came around.,They provided me a stable home,,a stable family.,They made sure,that when my parents weren't ablento do the things that kids need,,they stepped in and filled that role.,My grandma especiallyndid two things that really matter.,One, she provided that peaceful homenthat allowed me to focus on homework,and the things that kidsnshould be focused on.,But she was alsonthis incredibly perceptive woman,,despite not even havingna middle school education.,She recognized the messagenthat my community had for me,,that my choices didn't matter,,that the deck was stacked against me.,She once told me,,"JD, never be like those losers who thinknthe deck is stacked against them.,You can do anything you want to." 
 And yet she recognizednthat life wasn't fair.,It's hard to strike that balance,,to tell a kid that life isn't fair,,but also recognize and enforce in themnthe reality that their choices matter.,But mamaw was ablento strike that balance. 
 The other thing that really helpednwas the United States Marine Corps.,So we think of the Marine Corpsnas a military outfit, and of course it is,,but for me, the US Marine Corpsnwas a four-year crash course,in character education.,It taught me how to make a bed,nhow to do laundry,,how to wake up early,nhow to manage my finances.,These are thingsnmy community didn't teach me.,I remember when I wentnto go buy a car for the very first time,,I was offered a dealer'snlow, low interest rate of 21.9 percent,,and I was readynto sign on the dotted line.,But I didn't take that deal,,because I went and took it to my officer,who told me, "Stop being an idiot,,go to the local credit union,nand get a better deal.",And so that's what I did.,But without the Marine Corps,,I would have never had accessnto that knowledge.,I would have hadna financial calamity, frankly. 
 The last thing I want to saynis that I had a lot of good fortune,in the mentors and people,who have playednan important role in my life.,From the Marines,nfrom Ohio State, from Yale,,from other places,,people have really stepped in,and ensured that they fillednthat social capital gap,that it was pretty obvious,napparently, that I had.,That comes from good fortune,,but a lot of childrennaren't going to have that good fortune,,and I think that raisesnreally important questions for all of us,about how we're going to change that.,We need to ask questions aboutnhow we're going to give low-income kids,who come from a broken homenaccess to a loving home.,We need to ask questions,about how we're goingnto teach low-income parents,how to better interactnwith their children,,with their partners.,We need to ask questionsnabout how we give social capital,,mentorship to low-income kidsnwho don't have it.,We need to think aboutnhow we teach working class children,about not just hard skills,,like reading, mathematics,,but also soft skills,,like conflict resolutionnand financial management. 
 Now, I don't have all of the answers.,I don't know all of the solutionsnto this problem,,but I do know this:,in southern Ohio right now,,there's a kid who isnanxiously awaiting their dad,,wondering whether,nwhen he comes through the door,,he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.,There's a kid,whose mom sticks a needle in her arm,and passes out,,and he doesn't knownwhy she doesn't cook him dinner,,and he goes to bed hungry that night.,There's a kid who hasnno hope for the future,but desperatelynwants to live a better life.,They just want somebodynto show it to them.,I don't have all the answers,,but I know that unless our societynstarts asking better questions,about why I was so lucky,and about how to get that lucknto more of our communities,and our country's children,,we're going to continuento have a very significant problem. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The great philosopher Aristotle said,if something doesn't exist,nthere's no word for it,,and if there's no word for something,,that something doesn't exist.,So when we talk about elections,,we in established democracies,nwe know what we're talking about.,We've got the words.nWe have the vocabulary.,We know what a polling station is.,We know what a ballot paper is.,But what about countriesnwhere democracy doesn't exist,,countries where there arenno words to describe the concepts,that underpin a democratic society? 
 I work in the fieldnof electoral assistance,,so that's to say we assist,emerging democracies to organize,what is often their first elections.,When people ask me what I do,,quite often I get this answer.,"Oh, so you're one of these peoplenwho goes around the world,imposing Western democracynon countries that can't handle it.",Well, the United Nationsndoes not impose anything on anybody.,It really doesn't,,and also, what we do,is firmly anchored in the 1948nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights,,Article 21, that says,that everybody should have the rightnto choose who governs them. 
 So that's the basis of the work.,I specialize in public outreach.,What does that mean? Another jargon.,It actually meansndesigning information campaigns,so that candidates and voters,who have never had the opportunitynto participate or to vote,understand where, when, how to register;,where, when, how to vote;,why, why it is important to take part.,So I'll probably devise a specificncampaign to reach out to women,to make sure that they can take part,,that they can be part of the process.,Young people as well.,All sorts of people.,Handicapped people.,We try to reach everybody. 
 And it's not always easy,nbecause very often in this work,,I've noticed now over the yearsnthat I've been doing it,that words are lacking,,and so what do you do? 
 Afghanistan.,It's a country withnhigh levels of illiteracy,,and the thing about that was,nit was in 2005,,and we organized two electionsnon the same day.,The reason was because the logisticsnare so incredibly difficult,,it seemed to be more efficient to do that.,It was,,but on the other hand,nexplaining two elections instead of one,was even more complicated.,So we used a lot of images,,and when it came to the actual ballot,,we had problems, becausenso many people wanted to take part,,we had 300 candidates for 52 seats,in the Wolesi Jirga,nwhich is the parliamentary elections.,And for the Provincial Council,nwe had even more candidates.,We had 330 for 54 seats.,So talking about ballot design,,this is what the ballot looked like.,It's the size of a newspaper.,This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot --,(Laughter),Yeah, and --,this was the Provincial Council ballot.,Even more.,So you see, we did usena lot of symbols and things like that. 
 And we had other problemsnin Southern Sudan.,Southern Sudan was a very different story.,We had so many peoplenwho had never, of course, voted,,but we had extremely, extremelynhigh levels of illiteracy,,very, very poor infrastructure.,For example -- I mean, it's a countrynthe size of Texas, more or less.,We had seven kilometers of paved roads,,seven kilometers in the whole country,,and that includes the tarmacnwhere we landed the planes,in Juba Airport.,So transporting electoral materials, etc.,,is exceedingly difficult.,People had no ideanabout what a box looked like.,It was very complicated,,so using verbal communicationnwas obviously the way to go,,but there were 132 languages.,So that was extremely challenging. 
 Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011.,It was the Arab Spring.,A huge amount of hope was generatednby that enormous movement,that was going on in the region.,There was Libya,nthere was Egypt, there was Yemen.,It was an enormous, enormousnhistorical moment.,And I was sittingnwith the election commission,,and we were talkingnabout various aspects of the election,,and I was hearing them using wordsnthat I hadn't actually heard before,,and I'd worked with Iraqis,nI'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians,,and suddenly they were using these words,,and I just thought, "This is strange.",And what really gave rise to itnwas this word "observer.",We were discussing election observers,,and the election commissionernwas talking about "mulahiz" in Arabic.,This means "to notice"nin a passive sort of sense,,as in, "I noticednhe was wearing a light blue shirt.",Did I go and check whethernthe shirt was light blue or not?,That is the role of an election observer.,It's very active, it's governednby all kinds of treaties,,and it has gotnthat control function in it.,And then I got windnof the fact that in Egypt,,they were using this term "mutabi’,"nwhich means "to follow.",So we were now havingnfollowers of an election.,So that's not quite right either,,because there is a termnthat's already accepted and in use,,which was the word "muraqib"nwhich means "a controller.",It's got that notion of control.,So I thought, three wordsnfor one concept. This is not good.,And with our colleagues,nwe thought perhaps it's our role,to actually help make surenthat the words are understood,and actually create a work of reference,that could be used across the Arab region. 
 And that's what we did.,So together with these colleagues,,we launched the "Arabic Lexiconnof Electoral Terminology,",and we workednin eight different countries.,It meant actually defining 481 terms,which formed the basisnof everything you need to know,if you're going to organizena democratic election.,And we defined these terms,,and we worked with the Arab colleagues,and came to an agreementnabout what would be the appropriate word,to use in Arabic.,Because the Arabic language is very rich,nand that's part of the problem.,But there are 22 countriesnthat speak Arabic,,and they use modern standard Arabic,,which is the Arabicnthat is used across the whole region,in newspapers and broadcasts,,but of course, then from one countrynto the next in day to day language and use,it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc.,So that was anothernadded layer of complication.,So in one sense you had the problem,that language wasn'tnfully ripe, if you like,,neologisms were coming up,nnew expressions. 
 And so we defined all these terms,,and then we hadneight correspondents in the region.,We submitted the draft to them,,they responded back to us.,"Yes, we understand the definition.,We agree with it,,but this is what we say in our country.",Because we were not goingnto harmonize or force harmonization.,We were trying to facilitatenunderstanding among people.,So in yellow, you seenthe different expressions in use,in the various countries. 
 So this, I'm happy to say,nit took three years to produce this,because we also finalized the draftnand took it actually into the field,,sat with the election commissionsnin all these different countries,,debated and defined and refined the draft,,and finally published itnin November 2014 in Cairo.,And it's gone a long way.nWe published 10,000 copies.,To date, there's about 3,000 downloadsnoff the internet in PDF form.,I heard just recently from a colleaguenthat they've taken it up in Somalia.,They're going to producena version of this in Somalia,,because there's nothing in Somalia at all.,So that's very good to know.,And this newly formed Arab Organizationnfor Electoral Management Bodies,,which is trying to professionalize,how elections are run in the region,,they're using it as well.,And the Arab League have nownbuilt up a pan-Arab observation unit,,and they're using it.,So that's all really good. 
 However, this work of referencenis quite high-pitched.,It's complex, and a lot of the termsnare quite technical,,so the average person probably doesn'tnneed to know at least a third of it.,But the people of the Middle East,have been deprived of any formnof what we know as civic education.,It's part of our curriculum at school.,It doesn't really existnin that part of the world,,and I feel it's reallynthe right of everybody,to know how these things work.,And it's a good thing to think aboutnproducing a work of reference,for the average person,,and bearing in mind that now,we have a basis to work with,,but also we have technology,,so we can reach out using telephone apps,,video, animation.,There's all sorts of toolsnthat can be used now,to communicate these ideas to people,for the first time in their own language. 
 We hear a lot of miserynabout the Middle East.,We hear the chaos of war.nWe hear terrorism.,We hear about sectarianismnand all this horrible negative news,that comes to us all the time.,What we're not hearing is what arenthe people, the everyday people, thinking?,What are they aspiring to?,Let's give them the means,nlet's give them the words.,The silent majority is silent,because they don't have the words.,The silent majority needs to know.,It is time to provide peoplenwith the knowledge tools,that they can inform themselves with. 
 The silent majorityndoes not need to be silent.,Let's help them have a voice. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Good evening.,My journey to this stage,began when I came to America,at the age of 17.,You see, I'm onenof the 84 million Americans,who are immigrants,or children of immigrants.,Each of us has a dream when we come here,,a dream that usually has to be rewritten,and always has to be repurposed.,I was one of the lucky ones.,My revised dreamnled me to the work I do today:,training immigrantsnto run for public office,and leading a movementnfor inclusive democracy. 
 But I don't want you to thinknit was a cakewalk,,that America opened its arms widenand welcomed me.,It's still not doing that.,And I've learnedna few lessons along the way,that I wanted to share with you,,because I think that together,we can make American democracy,better and stronger. 
 I was born in India,,the world's largest democracy,,and when I was four,,my family moved to Belize,,the world's smallest democracy perhaps.,And at the age of 17,,I moved to the United States,,the world's greatest democracy.,I came because I wantednto study English literature.,You see, as a child,nI buried my nose in books,,and I thought, why not make a livingndoing that as an adult?,But after I graduated from college,and got a graduate degree,,I found myself movingnfrom one less ideal job to another.,Maybe it was the optimismnthat I had about America,that made me take a while to understand,that things were not going to change.,The door that I thought was open,was actually just slightly ajar --,this door of America,that would open widenif you had the right name,,the right skin color,,the right networks,,but could just slam in your face,if you had the wrong religion,,the wrong immigration status,,the wrong skin color.,And I just couldn't accept that. 
 So I started a careernas a social entrepreneur,,starting an organizationnfor young people like myself --,I was young at the timenthat I started it --,who traced their heritagento the Indian subcontinent.,In that work, I became and advocatenfor South Asians and other immigrants.,I lobbied members of Congressnon policy issues.,I volunteered on election daynto do exit polling.,But I couldn't vote,nand I couldn't run for office.,So in 2000, when it was announced,that the citizenship application feenwas going to more than double,from 95 dollars to 225 dollars,,I decided it was time to applynbefore I could no longer afford it.,I filled out a long application,,answering questions aboutnmy current and my past affiliations.,And once the application was submitted,,there were fingerprints to be taken,,a test to study for,,endless hours of waiting in line.,You might call it extreme vetting.,And then in December of 2000,,I joined hundreds of other immigrants,in a hall in Brooklyn,where we pledged our loyalty,to a country that we hadnlong considered home.,My journey from international studentnto American citizen took 16 years,,a short timeline when you compare itnto other immigrant stories. 
 And soon after I had takennthat formal step,to becoming an American,,the attacks of September 11, 2001,,changed the immigration landscapenfor decades to come.,My city, New York City,,was reeling and healing,,and in the midst of it,,we were in an election cycle. 
 Two things happened,as we coped with loss and recoverynin New York City.,Voters elected Michael Bloombergnmayor of New York City.,We also adopted by ballot referendum,the Office of Immigrant Affairsnfor the City of New York.,Five months after that election,,the newly elected mayor,appointed me the first Commissionernof Immigrant Affairs,for this newly established office. 
 I want you to come back to that time.,I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.,I had basically flounderednin various jobs in America,before I startedna community-based organization,in a church basement in Queens.,The attacks of September 11nsent shock waves through my community.,People who were members of my family,nyoung people I had worked with,,were experiencing harassment,at schools, at workplacesnand in airports.,And now I was goingnto represent their concerns,in government.,No job felt more perfect for me. 
 And here are two things I learnednwhen I became Commissioner.,First, well-meaning New Yorkers,who were in city governmentnholding government positions,had no idea how scared immigrants were,of law enforcement.,Most of us don't really knownthe difference, do we,,between a sheriffnand local police and the FBI.,And most of us,nwhen we see someone in uniform,going through our neighborhoods,feel curiosity, if not concern.,So if you're an undocumented parent,,every day when you sayngoodbye to your child,,send them off to school and go to work,,you don't know what the chances are,that you're going to see themnat the end of the day.,Because a raid at your workplace,,a chance encounter with local police,could change the coursenof your life forever. 
 The second thing I learnednis that when people like me,,who understood that fear,,who had learned a new language,nwho had navigated new systems,,when people like usnwere sitting at the table,,we advocated for our communities' needsnin a way that no one else could or would.,I understood what that feelingnof fear was like.,People in my family were experiencing it.,Young people I had worked withnwere being harassed,,not just by classmates,,but also by their teachers.,My husband, then boyfriend,,thought twice before he putna backpack on or grew a beard,because he traveled so much. 
 What I learned in 2001nwas that my vote mattered,but that my voicenand vantage point also mattered.,And it's these three things --,immigrants' votes,nvoices and vantage points --,that I think can helpnmake our democracy stronger.,We actually have the power,to change the outcome of elections,,to introduce new issuesninto the policy debate,and to change the facenof the pale, male, stale leadership,that we have in our country today. 
 So how do we do that?,Well, let's talk first about votes.,It will come as no surprise to you,that the majority of votersnin America are white.,But it might surprise you to know,that one in three votersnare black, Latino or Asian.,But here's the thing:,it doesn't just matter who can vote,nit matters who does vote.,So in 2012, half of the Latinonand Asian-American voters,did not vote. 
 And these votes matternnot just in presidential elections.,They matter in local and state elections.,In 2015, Lan Diep,,the eldest son of politicalnrefugees from Vietnam,,ran for a seatnin the San Jose City Council.,He lost that election by 13 votes.,This year, he dusted offnthose campaign shoes,and went back to run for that seat,,and this time he won, by 12 votes.,Every one of our votes matters. 
 And when people like Lannare sitting at the policy table,,they can make a difference.,We need those voices.,We need those voices,in part because American leadership,does not look like America's residents.,There are over 500,000nlocal and state offices in America.,Fewer than 2 percent of those officesnare held by Asian-Americans or Latinos,,the two largest immigrant groupsnin our country.,In the city of Yakima, Washington,,where 49 percentnof the population is Latino,,there has never been a Latinonon the city council until this year.,Three newly elected Latinasnjoined the Yakima City Council in 2016.,One of them is Carmen Méndez.,She is a first-generation college student.,She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,,and partly in Yakima, Washington.,She's a single mother,na community advocate.,Her voice on the Yakima City Council,is advocating on behalfnof the Latino community,and of all Yakima residents.,And she's a role model for her daughter,and other Latinas. 
 But the third most untapped resourcenin American democracy,is the vantage pointnthat immigrants bring.,We have fought to be here.,We have come for economicnand educational opportunity.,We have come for politicalnand religious freedom.,We have come in the pursuit of love.,That dedication,,that commitment to America,we also bring to public service.,People like Athena Salman,,who just last week won the primary,for a seat in the Arizona State House.,Athena's father grew up in the West Bank,and moved to Chicago,,where he met her mother.,Her mother is part Italian,,part Mexican and part German.,Together they moved to Arizonanand built a life.,Athena, when she gets to the statehouse,,is going to fight for thingsnlike education funding,that will help givenfamilies like hers a leg up,so they can achieventhe financial stability,that we all are looking for. 
 Immigrants' votes,nvoices and vantage points,are what we all need to worknto include in American democracy.,It's not just my work. It's also yours.,And it's not going to be easy.,We never know,what putting a new factorninto an equation will do.,And it's a little scary.,You're scared that I'm goingnto take away your place at the table,,and I'm scared that I'm neverngoing to get a place at the table.,And we're all scared,that we're going to lose this countrynthat we know and love.,I'm scared you're goingnto take it away from me,,and you're scarednI'm going to take it away from you. 
 Look, it's been a rough election year,,a reminder that peoplenwith my immigration history,could be removed at the whim of a leader.,But I have fought to be in this country,and I continue to do so every day.,So my optimism never wavers,,because I know that there arenmillions of immigrants just like me,,in front of me,nbehind me and all around me.,It's our country, too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Speaking up is hard to do.,I understood the true meaningnof this phrase exactly one month ago,,when my wife and I became new parents.,It was an amazing moment.,It was exhilarating and elating,,but it was also scary and terrifying.,And it got particularly terrifyingnwhen we got home from the hospital,,and we were unsure,whether our little baby boy was gettingnenough nutrients from breastfeeding.,And we wanted to call our pediatrician,,but we also didn't wantnto make a bad first impression,or come across as a crazy,nneurotic parent.,So we worried.,And we waited.,When we got to the doctor's officenthe next day,,she immediately gave him formulanbecause he was pretty dehydrated.,Our son is fine now,,and our doctor has reassured usnwe can always contact her.,But in that moment,,I should've spoken up, but I didn't. 
 But sometimes we speak upnwhen we shouldn't,,and I learned that over 10 years agonwhen I let my twin brother down.,My twin brothernis a documentary filmmaker,,and for one of his first films,,he got an offernfrom a distribution company.,He was excited,,and he was inclined to accept the offer.,But as a negotiations researcher,,I insisted he make a counteroffer,,and I helped him craft the perfect one.,And it was perfect --,it was perfectly insulting.,The company was so offended,,they literally withdrew the offer,and my brother was left with nothing. 
 And I've asked people all over the worldnabout this dilemma of speaking up:,when they can assert themselves,,when they can push their interests,,when they can express an opinion,,when they can make an ambitious ask. 
 And the range of storiesnare varied and diverse,,but they also make upna universal tapestry.,Can I correct my bossnwhen they make a mistake?,Can I confront my coworkernwho keeps stepping on my toes?,Can I challenge my friend'sninsensitive joke?,Can I tell the person I love the mostnmy deepest insecurities? 
 And through these experiences,nI've come to recognize,that each of us have something calledna range of acceptable behavior.,Now, sometimes we're too strong;nwe push ourselves too much.,That's what happened with my brother.,Even making an offer was outsidenhis range of acceptable behavior.,But sometimes we're too weak.,That's what happened with my wife and I.,And this range of acceptable behaviors --,when we stay within our range,nwe're rewarded.,When we step outside that range,nwe get punished in a variety of ways.,We get dismissed or demeanednor even ostracized.,Or we lose that raisenor that promotion or that deal. 
 Now, the first thing we need to know is:,What is my range?,But the key thing is,nour range isn't fixed;,it's actually pretty dynamic.,It expands and it narrowsnbased on the context.,And there's one thing that determinesnthat range more than anything else,,and that's your power.,Your power determines your range.,What is power?,Power comes in lots of forms.,In negotiations, it comesnin the form of alternatives.,So my brother had no alternatives;,he lacked power.,The company had lots of alternatives;,they had power.,Sometimes it's being newnto a country, like an immigrant,,or new to an organization,or new to an experience,,like my wife and I as new parents.,Sometimes it's at work,,where someone's the bossnand someone's the subordinate.,Sometimes it's in relationships,,where one person's more investednthan the other person. 
 And the key thing is that whennwe have lots of power,,our range is very wide.,We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.,But when we lack power, our range narrows.,We have very little leeway.,The problem is that whennour range narrows,,that produces something callednthe low-power double bind.,The low-power double bind happens,when, if we don't speak up,nwe go unnoticed,,but if we do speak up, we get punished. 
 Now, many of you have heardnthe phrase the "double bind",and connected it with one thing,nand that's gender.,The gender double bind is womennwho don't speak up go unnoticed,,and women who do speak up get punished.,And the key thing is that women haventhe same need as men to speak up,,but they have barriers to doing so.,But what my research has shownnover the last two decades,is that what looksnlike a gender difference,is not really a gender double bind,,it's a really a low-power double bind.,And what looks like a gender difference,are really often just powerndifferences in disguise.,Oftentimes we see a differencenbetween a man and a woman,or men and women,,and think, "Biological cause.nThere's something fundamentally different,about the sexes.",But in study after study,,I've found that a better explanationnfor many sex differences,is really power.,And so it's the low-power double bind.,And the low-power double bindnmeans that we have a narrow range,,and we lack power.,We have a narrow range,,and our double bind is very large. 
 So we need to find waysnto expand our range.,And over the last couple decades,,my colleagues and I have foundntwo things really matter.,The first: you seem powerfulnin your own eyes.,The second: you seem powerfulnin the eyes of others.,When I feel powerful,,I feel confident, not fearful;,I expand my own range.,When other people see me as powerful,,they grant me a wider range.,So we need tools to expandnour range of acceptable behavior.,And I'm going to give youna set of tools today.,Speaking up is risky,,but these tools will lowernyour risk of speaking up. 
 The first tool I'm going to give youngot discovered in negotiations,in an important finding.,On average, women makenless ambitious offers,and get worse outcomes than mennat the bargaining table.,But Hannah Riley Bowlesnand Emily Amanatullah have discovered,there's one situationnwhere women get the same outcomes as men,and are just as ambitious.,That's when they advocate for others.,When they advocate for others,,they discover their own rangenand expand it in their own mind.,They become more assertive.,This is sometimes calledn"the mama bear effect.",Like a mama bear defending her cubs,,when we advocate for others,nwe can discover our own voice. 
 But sometimes, we havento advocate for ourselves.,How do we do that?,One of the most important toolsnwe have to advocate for ourselves,is something called perspective-taking.,And perspective-taking is really simple:,it's simply looking at the worldnthrough the eyes of another person.,It's one of the most important toolsnwe have to expand our range.,When I take your perspective,,and I think about what you really want,,you're more likely to give menwhat I really want. 
 But here's the problem:,perspective-taking is hard to do.,So let's do a little experiment.,I want you all to holdnyour hand just like this:,your finger -- put it up.,And I want you to drawna capital letter E on your forehead,as quickly as possible.,OK, it turns out that we canndraw this E in one of two ways,,and this was originally designednas a test of perspective-taking.,I'm going to show you two pictures,of someone with an E on their forehead --,my former student, Erika Hall.,And you can see over here,,that's the correct E.,I drew the E so it looks likenan E to another person.,That's the perspective-taking E,because it looks like an Enfrom someone else's vantage point.,But this E over herenis the self-focused E.,We often get self-focused.,And we particularly getnself-focused in a crisis. 
 I want to tell younabout a particular crisis.,A man walks into a banknin Watsonville, California.,And he says, "Give me $2,000,,or I'm blowing the whole banknup with a bomb.",Now, the bank managerndidn't give him the money.,She took a step back.,She took his perspective,,and she noticed somethingnreally important.,He asked for a specific amount of money. 
 So she said,,"Why did you ask for $2,000?" 
 And he said, "My friendnis going to be evicted,unless I get him $2,000 immediately." 
 And she said, "Oh! You don't wantnto rob the bank --,you want to take out a loan." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Why don't you come back to my office,,and we can have younfill out the paperwork." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, her quick perspective-takingndefused a volatile situation.,So when we take someone's perspective,,it allows us to be ambitiousnand assertive, but still be likable. 
 Here's another way to be assertivenbut still be likable,,and that is to signal flexibility.,Now, imagine you're a car salesperson,nand you want to sell someone a car.,You're going to more likely make the salenif you give them two options.,Let's say option A:,$24,000 for this carnand a five-year warranty.,Or option B:,$23,000 and a three-year warranty.,My research shows that when you givenpeople a choice among options,,it lowers their defenses,,and they're more likelynto accept your offer. 
 And this doesn't justnwork with salespeople;,it works with parents.,When my niece was four,,she resisted getting dressednand rejected everything.,But then my sister-in-lawnhad a brilliant idea.,What if I gave my daughter a choice?,This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.,This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.,And it worked brilliantly.,She got dressed quicklynand without resistance. 
 When I've asked the questionnaround the world,when people feel comfortable speaking up,,the number one answer is:,"When I have social supportnin my audience; when I have allies.",So we want to get allies on our side.,How do we do that?,Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.,When we advocate for others,,we expand our range in our own eyesnand the eyes of others,,but we also earn strong allies. 
 Another way we can earn strong allies,nespecially in high places,,is by asking other people for advice.,When we ask others for advice,nthey like us because we flatter them,,and we're expressing humility.,And this really works to solvenanother double bind.,And that's the self-promotion double bind.,The self-promotion double bind,is that if we don't advertisenour accomplishments,,no one notices.,And if we do, we're not likable. 
 But if we ask for advicenabout one of our accomplishments,,we are able to be competentnin their eyes but also be likeable.,And this is so powerful,it even works when you see it coming.,There have been multiple times in lifenwhen I have been forewarned,that a low-power person has been givennthe advice to come ask me for advice.,I want you to noticenthree things about this:,First, I knew they were goingnto come ask me for advice.,Two, I've actually done researchnon the strategic benefits,of asking for advice.,And three, it still worked!,I took their perspective,,I became more invested in their cause,,I became more committed to themnbecause they asked for advice. 
 Now, another time we feelnmore confident speaking up,is when we have expertise.,Expertise gives us credibility.,When we have high power,nwe already have credibility.,We only need good evidence.,When we lack power,nwe don't have the credibility.,We need excellent evidence. 
 And one of the waysnwe can come across as an expert,is by tapping into our passion.,I want everyone in the next few daysnto go up to friend of theirs,and just say to them,,"I want you to describena passion of yours to me.",I've had people do this all over the world,and I asked them,,"What did you noticenabout the other person,when they described their passion?",And the answers are always the same.,"Their eyes lit up and got big.","They smiled a big beaming smile.","They used their hands all over --,I had to duck because theirnhands were coming at me.","They talk quicklynwith a little higher pitch." 
 (Laughter) 
 "They leaned innas if telling me a secret." 
 And then I said to them,,"What happened to younas you listened to their passion?" 
 They said, "My eyes lit up.,I smiled.,I leaned in." 
 When we tap into our passion,,we give ourselves the courage,nin our own eyes, to speak up,,but we also get the permissionnfrom others to speak up.,Tapping into our passion even worksnwhen we come across as too weak.,Both men and women get punishednat work when they shed tears.,But Lizzie Wolf has shown that whennwe frame our strong emotions as passion,,the condemnation of our cryingndisappears for both men and women. 
 I want to end with a few wordsnfrom my late father,that he spoke at my twinnbrother's wedding.,Here's a picture of us.,My dad was a psychologist like me,,but his real love and his realnpassion was cinema,,like my brother.,And so he wrote a speechnfor my brother's wedding,about the roles we playnin the human comedy. 
 And he said, "The lighter your touch,,the better you become at improvingnand enriching your performance.,Those who embrace their rolesnand work to improve their performance,grow, change and expand the self.,Play it well,,and your days will be mostly joyful." 
 What my dad was saying,is that we've all been assignednranges and roles in this world.,But he was also sayingnthe essence of this talk:,those roles and ranges are constantlynexpanding and evolving. 
 So when a scene calls for it,,be a ferocious mama bear,and a humble advice seeker.,Have excellent evidence and strong allies.,Be a passionate perspective taker.,And if you use those tools --,and each and every one of youncan use these tools --,you will expand your rangenof acceptable behavior,,and your days will be mostly joyful. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When you come to TEDx,nyou always think about technology,,the world changing,nbecoming more innovative.,You think about the driverless.,Everyone's talkingnabout driverless cars these days,,and I love the conceptnof a driverless car,,but when I go in one, you know,,I want it really slow,,I want access to the steering wheelnand the brake, just in case.,I don't know about you,nbut I am not ready for a driverless bus.,I am not ready for a driverless airplane. 
 How about a driverless world?,And I ask you that,because we are increasingly in one. 
 It's not supposed to be that way.,We're number one,,the United States is large and in charge.,Americanization and globalizationnfor the last several generations,have basically been the same thing.,Right? Whether it'snthe World Trade Organization,or it's the IMF, the World Bank,,the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,,these were American institutions,,our values, our friends, our allies,nour money, our standards.,That was the way the world worked. 
 So it's sort of interesting,nif you want to look at how the US looks,,here it is.,This is our view of how the world is run.,President Obama has got the red carpet,,he goes down Air Force One,,and it feels pretty good,nit feels pretty comfortable.,Well, I don't know how many of younsaw the China trip last week,and the G20.,Oh my God. Right?,This is how we landed,for the most important meetingnof the world's leaders in China.,The National Security Advisornwas actually spewing expletives,on the tarmac --,no red carpet,,kind of left out the bottom of the plane,along with all the medianand everybody else. 
 Later on in the G20,,well, there's Obama. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hi, George.,Hi, Norman.,They look like they'renabout to get into a cage match, right?,And they did. It was 90 minutes long,nand they talked about Syria.,That's what Putin wanted to talk about.,He's increasingly calling the shots.,He's the one willing to do stuff there.,There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,,but it's not as if the Americansnare telling him what to do. 
 How about when the whole 20nare getting together?,Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,,then the Americansnare pulling their weight.,Uh-oh. 
 (Laughter) 
 Xi Jinping seems fine.,Angela Merkel has -- she always does --,that look, she always does that.,But Putin is tellingnTurkish president Erdogan what to do,,and Obama is like,nwhat's going on over there? 
 You see. And the problem isnit's not a G20,,the problem is,it's a G-Zero world that we live in,,a world order where there isnno single country or alliance,that can meet the challengesnof global leadership.,The G20 doesn't work,,the G7, all of our friends,nthat's history.,So globalization is continuing.,Goods and services and peoplenand capital are moving across borders,faster and faster than ever before,,but Americanization is not. 
 So if I've convinced you of that,,I want to do two thingsnwith the rest of this talk.,I want to talknabout the implications of that,for the whole world.,I'll go around it.,And then I want to talk about,what we think right here,in the United States and in New York. 
 So why? What are the implications.nWhy are we here?,Well, we're here,because the United States,,we spent two trillion dollarsnon wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,that were failed.,We don't want to do that anymore.,We have large numbersnof middle and working classes,that feel like they've not benefitednfrom promises of globalization,,so they don't want to see it particularly.,And we have an energy revolution,where we don't need OPECnor the Middle East the way we used to.,We produce all that right herenin the United States.,So the Americans don't wantnto be the global sheriff for security,or the architect of global trade.,The Americans don't want to even benthe cheerleader of global values. 
 Well, then you look to Europe,,and the most importantnalliance in the world,has been the transatlantic relationship.,But it is now weaker than it has beennat any point since World War II,,all of the crises,nthe Brexit conversations,,the hedging going onnbetween the French and the Russians,,or the Germans and the Turks,nor the Brits and the Chinese. 
 China does want to do more leadership.,They do, but only in the economic sphere,,and they want their own values,nstandards, currency,,in competition with that of the US.,The Russians want to do more leadership.,You see that in Ukraine,,in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,,but not with the Americans.,They want their own preferences and order.,That's why we are where we are. 
 So what happens going forward?,Let's start easy,,with the Middle East. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, I left a little out,,but you get the general idea.,Look, there are three reasons,why the Middle Eastnhas had stability such as it is. Right?,One is because there wasna willingness to provide,some level of military securitynby the US and allies.,Number two, it was easy to takena lot of cheap money out of the ground,because oil was expensive.,And number three,was no matter how bad the leaders were,nthe populations were relatively quiescent.,They didn't have the ability,nand many didn't have the will,to really rise up against. 
 Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,,all three of those thingsnare increasingly not true,,and so failed states,,terrorism, refugees and the rest.,Does the entire Middle East fall apart?,No, the Kurds will do better,nand Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.,But generally speaking,nit's not a good look. 
 OK, how about this guy?,He's playing a poor hand very well.,There's no questionnhe's hitting above his weight.,But long term -- I didn't mean that.,But long term, long term,,if you think that the Russians,were antagonized by the US and Europenexpanding NATO right up to their borders,when we said they weren't going to,,and the EU encroaching them,,just wait until the Chinesenput hundreds of billions of dollars,in every country around Russianthey thought they had influence in.,The Chinese are going to dominate it.nThe Russians are picking up the crumbs.,In a G-Zero world, this is going to bena very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin. 
 It's not all bad. Right?,Asia actually looks a lot better.,There are real leaders across Asia,,they have a lot of political stability.,They're there for a while.,Mr. Modi in India,,Mr. Abe, who is probablynabout to get a third term written in,in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,,of course Xi Jinpingnwho is consolidating enormous power,,the most powerful leader in China,since Mao.,Those are the threenmost important economies in Asia.,Now look, there are problems in Asia.,We see the sparringnover the South China Sea.,We see that Kim Jong Un,njust in the last couple of days,,tested yet another nuclear weapon.,But the leaders in Asiando not feel the need,to wave the flag,,to go xenophobic,,to actually allow escalation,of the geopoliticalnand cross-border tensions.,They want to focus on long-termneconomic stability and growth.,And that's what they're actually doing. 
 Let's turn to Europe.,Europe does look a little scarednin this environment.,So much of what is happeningnin the Middle East,is washing up quite literallynonto European shores.,You see Brexit and you seenthe concerns of populism,across all of the European states. 
 Let me tell you that over the long term,,in a G-Zero world,,European expansionnwill be seen to have gone too far.,Europe went right up to Russia,nwent right down to the Middle East,,and if the world were truly becomingnmore flat and more Americanized,,that would be less of a problem,,but in a G-Zero world,nthose countries nearest Russia,and nearest the Middle East,actually have differentneconomic capabilities,,different social stability,and different political preferencesnand systems than core Europe.,So Europe was able to truly expand,under the G7,,but under the G-Zero,nEurope will get smaller.,Core Europe around Germanynand France and others,will still work, be functional,nstable, wealthy, integrated.,But the periphery,,countries like Greecenand Turkey and others,,will not look that good at all. 
 Latin America, a lot of populism,,made the economies not go so well.,They had been more opposednto the United States for decades.,Increasingly, they're coming back.,We see that in Argentina.,We see it with the openness in Cuba.,We will see it in Venezuelanwhen Maduro falls.,We will see it in Brazilnafter the impeachment,and when we finally seena new legitimate president elected there.,The only place you seenthat is moving in another direction,is the unpopularitynof Mexican president Peña Nieto.,There you could actually seena slip away from the United States,over the coming years.,The US election matters a lotnon that one, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 Africa, right?,A lot of people have saidnit's going to be Africa's decade, finally.,In a G-Zero world,nit is absolutely an amazing time,for a few African countries,,those governed wellnwith a lot of urbanization,,a lot of smart people,nwomen really getting into the workforce,,entrepreneurship taking off.,But for most of the countries in Africa,,it's going to be a lot more dicey:,extreme climate conditions,,radicalism both from Islamnand also Christianity,,very poor governance,,borders you can't defend,nlots of forced migration.,Those countries can fall off the map.,So you're really going to seenan extreme segregation going on,between the winnersnand the losers across Africa. 
 Finally, back to the United States.,What do I think about us?,Because there are a lot of upset people,,not here at TEDx, I know,,but in the United States, my God,,after 15 months of campaigning,nwe should be upset.,I understand that.,But a lot of people are upsetnbecause they say, "Washington's broken,,we don't trust the establishment,nwe hate the media.",Heck, even globalists like menare taking it on the chin. 
 Look, I do think we have to recognize,,my fellow campers,,that when you are beingnchased by the bear,,in the global context,nyou need not outrun the bear,,you need to only outrunnyour fellow campers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I just told you,about our fellow campers.,Right? And from that perspective,,we look OK.,A lot of people in that context say,,"Let's go dollar.nLet's go New York real estate.,Let's send our kidsnto American universities.",You know, our neighbors are awesome:,Canada, Mexiconand two big bodies of water.,You know how much Turkeynwould love to have neighbors like that?,Those are awesome neighbors. 
 Terrorism is a problemnin the United States.,God knows we know it here in New York.,But it's a much bigger problemnin Europe than the US.,It's a much bigger problemnin the Middle East,than it is in Europe.,These are factors of large magnitude.,We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees,nand we're complaining bitterly about it.,You know why?nBecause they can't swim here.,Right? I mean, the Turks would lovento have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.,The Jordanians,nthe Germans, the Brits. Right?,That's not the situation.,That's the reality of the United States. 
 Now, that sounds pretty good.,Here's the challenge.,In a G-Zero world, the way you lead,is by example.,If we know we don't want to benthe global cop anymore,,if we know we're not going to benthe architect of global trade,,we're not going to benthe cheerleader of global values,,we're not going to do itnthe way we used to,,the 21st century is changing,,we need to lead by example --nbe so compelling,that all these other peoplenare going to still say,,it's not just they're faster campers.,Even when the bear is not chasing us,nthis is a good place to be.,We want to emulate them. 
 The election process this yearnis not proving a good option,for leading by example.,Hillary Clinton saysnit's going to be like the '90s.,We can still benthat cheerleader on values.,We can still benthe architect of global trade.,We can still be the global sheriff.,And Donald Trump wantsnto bring us back to the '30s.,He's saying, "Our way or the highway.nYou don't like it, lump it." Right?,Neither are recognizingna fundamental truth of the G-Zero,,which is that even thoughnthe US is not in decline,,it is getting objectively harder,for the Americans to impose their will,,even have great influence,,on the global order. 
 Are we prepared to truly lead by example?,What would we have to do to fix this,after November,,after the next president comes in?,Well, either we have to havenanother crisis that forces us to respond.,A depression would do that.,Another global financialncrisis could do this.,God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.,Or, absent crisis,,we need to see that the hollowing out,nthe inequality, the challenges,that are growing and growingnin the United States,,are themselves urgent enough,to force our leaders to change,,and that we have those voices.,Through our cell phones, individually,,we have those voicesnto compel them to change. 
 There is, of course, a third choice,,perhaps the most likely one,,which is that we donneither of those things,,and in four years time you invite me back,,and I will give this speech yet again. 
 Thank you very, very much. 
 (Applause)This is a tuberculosis ward,,and at the time this picture was takennin the late 1800s,,one in seven of all people,died from tuberculosis.,We had no ideanwhat was causing this disease.,The hypothesis was actually,it was your constitutionnthat made you susceptible.,And it was a highly romanticized disease.,It was also called consumption,,and it was the disorder of poets,and artists and intellectuals.,And some people actually thoughtnit gave you heightened sensitivity,and conferred creative genius. 
 By the 1950s,,we instead knewnthat tuberculosis was caused,by a highly contagiousnbacterial infection,,which is slightly less romantic,,but that had the upside,of us being able to maybendevelop drugs to treat it.,So doctors had discoveredna new drug, iproniazid,,that they were optimisticnmight cure tuberculosis,,and they gave it to patients,,and patients were elated.,They were more social, more energetic.,One medical report actually saysnthey were "dancing in the halls.",And unfortunately,,this was not necessarilynbecause they were getting better.,A lot of them were still dying.,Another medical report describes themnas being "inappropriately happy.",And that is how the firstnantidepressant was discovered. 
 So accidental discoverynis not uncommon in science,,but it requires morenthan just a happy accident.,You have to be able to recognize itnfor discovery to occur. 
 As a neuroscientist,nI'm going to talk to you a little bit,about my firsthand experience,with whatever you want to callnthe opposite of dumb luck --,let's call it smart luck.,But first, a bit more background. 
 Thankfully, since the 1950s,,we've developed some other drugsnand we can actually now cure tuberculosis.,And at least in the United States,nthough not necessarily in other countries,,we have closed our sanitoriums,and probably most of younare not too worried about TB.,But a lot of what was truenin the early 1900s,about infectious disease,,we can say nownabout psychiatric disorders. 
 We are in the middlenof an epidemic of mood disorders,like depression and post-traumaticnstress disorder, or PTSD.,One in four of all adultsnin the United States,suffers from mental illness,,which means that if you haven'tnexperienced it personally,or someone in your family hasn't,,it's still very likelynthat someone you know has,,though they may not talk about it.,Depression has actually now surpassed,HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war,as the leading causenof disability worldwide.,And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,,we don't know what causes it.,Once it's developed, it's chronic,,lasts a lifetime,,and there are no known cures. 
 The second antidepressant we discovered,,also by accident, in the 1950s,,from an antihistaminenthat was making people manic,,imipramine.,And in both the case of the tuberculosisnward and the antihistamine,,someone had to be able to recognize,that a drug that was designednto do one thing --,treat tuberculosisnor suppress allergies --,could be used to donsomething very different --,treat depression.,And this sort of repurposingnis actually quite challenging.,When doctors first sawnthis mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,,they didn't really recognizenwhat they saw.,They were so used to thinking about it,from the frameworknof being a tuberculosis drug,that they actually just listed it,as a side effect, an adverse side effect. 
 As you can see here,,a lot of these patients in 1954nare experiencing severe euphoria.,And they were worriednthat this might somehow interfere,with their recovering from tuberculosis.,So they recommended that iproniazidnonly be used in cases of extreme TB,and in patients that werenhighly emotionally stable,,which is of course the exact oppositenof how we use it as an antidepressant.,They were so used to looking at itnfrom the perspective of this one disease,,they could not see the larger implicationsnfor another disease. 
 And to be fair,nit's not entirely their fault.,Functional fixednessnis a bias that affects all of us.,It's a tendency to onlynbe able to think of an object,in terms of its traditionalnuse or function.,And mental set is another thing. Right?,That's sort of this preconceived framework,with which we approach problems.,And that actually makes repurposingnpretty hard for all of us,,which is, I guess, why they gavena TV show to the guy who was,,like, really great at repurposing. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the effects in both the casenof iproniazid and imipramine,,they were so strong --,there was mania,nor people dancing in the halls.,It's actually not that surprisingnthey were caught.,But it does make you wondernwhat else we've missed.,So iproniazid and imipramine,,they're more than justna case study in repurposing.,They have two other things in commonnthat are really important.,One, they have terrible side effects.,That includes liver toxicity,,weight gain of over 50 pounds,,suicidality.,And two, they bothnincrease levels of serotonin,,which is a chemical signal in the brain,,or a neurotransmitter.,And those two things together,nright, one or the two,,may not have been that important,,but the two together meantnthat we had to develop safer drugs,,and that serotonin seemednlike a pretty good place to start. 
 So we developed drugsnto more specifically focus on serotonin,,the selective serotoninnreuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,,the most famous of which is Prozac.,And that was 30 years ago,,and since then we have mostlynjust worked on optimizing those drugs.,And the SSRIs, they are betternthan the drugs that came before them,,but they still have a lot of side effects,,including weight gain, insomnia,,suicidality --,and they take a really long time to work,,something like four to six weeksnin a lot of patients.,And that's in the patientsnwhere they do work.,There are a lot of patientsnwhere these drugs don't work. 
 And that means now, in 2016,,we still have no curesnfor any mood disorders,,just drugs that suppress symptoms,,which is kind of the difference betweenntaking a painkiller for an infection,versus an antibiotic.,A painkiller will make you feel better,,but is not going to do anythingnto treat that underlying disease.,And it was this flexibilitynin our thinking,that let us recognizenthat iproniazid and imipramine,could be repurposed in this way,,which led us to the serotonin hypothesis,,which we then, ironically, fixated on.,This is brain signaling, serotonin,,from an SSRI commercial.,In case you're not clear,nthis is a dramatization.,And in science, we trynand remove our bias, right,,by running double-blinded experiments,or being statistically agnosticnas to what our results will be.,But bias creeps in more insidiouslynin what we choose to study,and how we choose to study it. 
 So we've focused on serotonin nownfor the past 30 years,,often to the exclusion of other things.,We still have no cures,,and what if serotoninnisn't all there is to depression?,What if it's not even the key part of it?,That means no matter how much time,or money or effort we put into it,,it will never lead to a cure. 
 In the past few years,ndoctors have discovered,probably what is the first truly newnantidepressant since the SSRIs,,Calypsol,,and this drug works very quickly,nwithin a few hours or a day,,and it doesn't work on serotonin.,It works on glutamate,nwhich is another neurotransmitter.,And it's also repurposed.,It was traditionally usednas anesthesia in surgery.,But unlike those other drugs,,which were recognized pretty quickly,,it took us 20 years,to realize that Calypsolnwas an antidepressant,,despite the fact that it's actuallyna better antidepressant,,probably, than those other drugs.,It's actually probably because of the factnthat it's a better antidepressant,that it was harder for us to recognize.,There was no mania to signal its effects. 
 So in 2013, up at Columbia University,,I was working with my colleague,,Dr. Christine Ann Denny,,and we were studying Calypsolnas an antidepressant in mice.,And Calypsol has, like,na really short half-life,,which means it's out of your bodynwithin a few hours.,And we were just piloting.,So we would give an injection to mice,,and then we'd wait a week,,and then we'd runnanother experiment to save money. 
 And one of the experiments I was running,,we would stress the mice,,and we used that as a model of depression.,And at first it kind of just lookednlike it didn't really work at all.,So we could have stopped there.,But I have run this modelnof depression for years,,and the data just looked kind of weird.,It didn't really look right to me.,So I went back,,and we reanalyzed it,based on whether or not they had gottennthat one injection of Calypsol,a week beforehand.,And it looked kind of like this.,So if you look at the far left,,if you put a mouse in a new space,,this is the box, it's very exciting,,a mouse will walk around and explore,,and you can see that pink linenis actually the measure of them walking.,And we also give itnanother mouse in a pencil cup,that it can decide to interact with.,This is also a dramatization,nin case that's not clear.,And a normal mouse will explore.,It will be social.,Check out what's going on.,If you stress a mousenin this depression model,,which is the middle box,,they aren't social, they don't explore.,They mostly just kind of hidenin that back corner, behind a cup.,Yet the mice that had gottennthat one injection of Calypsol,,here on your right,,they were exploring, they were social.,They looked like theynhad never been stressed at all,,which is impossible. 
 So we could have just stopped there,,but Christine had also usednCalypsol before as anesthesia,,and a few years ago she had seen,that it seemed to havensome weird effects on cells,and some other behavior,that also seemed to lastnlong after the drug,,maybe a few weeks.,So we were like, OK,,maybe this is not completely impossible,,but we were really skeptical. 
 So we did what you do in sciencenwhen you're not sure,,and we ran it again.,And I remember being in the animal room,,moving mice from box to boxnto test them,,and Christine was actually sittingnon the floor with the computer in her lap,so the mice couldn't see her,,and she was analyzingnthe data in real time.,And I remember us yelling,,which you're not supposed to donin an animal room where you're testing,,because it had worked.,It seemed like these micenwere protected against stress,,or they were inappropriately happy,nhowever you want to call it.,And we were really excited. 
 And then we were really skeptical,nbecause it was too good to be true.,So we ran it again.,And then we ran it again in a PTSD model,,and we ran it againnin a physiological model,,where all we did was give stress hormones.,And we had our undergrads run it.,And then we had our collaboratorsnhalfway across the world in France run it.,And every time someone ran it,nthey confirmed the same thing.,It seemed likenthis one injection of Calypsol,was somehow protectingnagainst stress for weeks. 
 And we only published this a year ago,,but since then other labsnhave independently confirmed this effect.,So we don't know what causes depression,,but we do know that stressnis the initial trigger,in 80 percent of cases,,and depression and PTSDnare different diseases,,but this is somethingnthey share in common.,Right? It is traumatic stress,like active combat or natural disasters,or community violence or sexual assault,that causes post-traumaticnstress disorder,,and not everyone that is exposed to stressndevelops a mood disorder.,And this ability to experiencenstress and be resilient,and bounce back and not developndepression or PTSD,is known as stress resilience,,and it varies between people.,And we have always thought of itnas just sort of this passive property.,It's the absence of susceptibility factors,and risk factors for these disorders.,But what if it were active?,Maybe we could enhance it,,sort of akin to putting on armor. 
 We had accidentally discoverednthe first resilience-enhancing drug.,And like I said, we only gavena tiny amount of the drug,,and it lasted for weeks,,and that's not like anythingnyou see with antidepressants. 
 But it is actually kind of similarnto what you see in immune vaccines.,So in immune vaccines,nyou'll get your shots,,and then weeks, months, years later,,when you're actually exposed to bacteria,,it's not the vaccine in your bodynthat protects you.,It's your own immune system,that's developed resistance and resiliencento this bacteria that fights it off,,and you actually never get the infection,,which is very differentnfrom, say, our treatments. Right?,In that case, you get the infection,nyou're exposed to the bacteria,,you're sick, and then you take,nsay, an antibiotic which cures it,,and those drugs are actually workingnto kill the bacteria.,Or similar to as I said before,nwith this palliative,,you'll take somethingnthat will suppress the symptoms,,but it won't treatnthe underlying infection,,and you'll only feel betternduring the time in which you're taking it,,which is why you have to keep taking it.,And in depression and PTSD --,here we have your stress exposure --,we only have palliative care.,Antidepressants only suppress symptoms,,and that is why you basicallynhave to keep taking them,for the life of the disease,,which is oftennthe length of your own life. 
 So we're calling our resilience-enhancingndrugs "paravaccines,",which means vaccine-like,,because it seemsnlike they might have the potential,to protect against stress,and prevent mice from developing,depression and post-traumaticnstress disorder.,Also, not all antidepressantsnare also paravaccines.,We tried Prozac as well,,and that had no effect. 
 So if this were to translate into humans,,we might be able to protect people,who are predictably at risk,against stress-induced disordersnlike depression and PTSD.,So that's first respondersnand firefighters,,refugees, prisoners and prison guards,,soldiers, you name it. 
 And to give you a sensenof the scale of these diseases,,in 2010, the global burden of disease,was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,,and since they are chronic,,that cost is compoundingnand is therefore expected to rise,up to six trillion dollarsnin just the next 15 years. 
 As I mentioned before,,repurposing can be challengingnbecause of our prior biases.,Calypsol has another name,,ketamine,,which also goes by another name,,Special K,,which is a club drug and drug of abuse.,It's still used across the worldnas an anesthetic.,It's used in children.nWe use it on the battlefield.,It's actually the drug of choicenin a lot of developing nations,,because it doesn't affect breathing.,It is on the World Health Organizationnlist of most essential medicines. 
 If we had discovered ketaminenas a paravaccine first,,it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,,but as is, we have to competenwith our functional fixedness,and mental set that kind of interfere.,Fortunately, it's notnthe only compound we have discovered,that has these prophylactic,nparavaccine qualities,,but all of the other drugsnwe've discovered,,or compounds if you will,nthey're totally new,,they have to go throughnthe entire FDA approval process --,if they make it beforenthey can ever be used in humans.,And that will be years.,So if we wanted something sooner,,ketamine is already FDA-approved.,It's generic, it's available.,We could develop it for a fractionnof the price and a fraction of the time. 
 But actually, beyondnfunctional fixedness and mental set,,there's a real other challengento repurposing drugs,,which is policy.,There are no incentives in place,once a drug is generic and off patentnand no longer exclusive,to encourage pharma companiesnto develop them,,because they don't make money.,And that's not true for just ketamine.nThat is true for all drugs.,Regardless, the idea itselfnis completely novel in psychiatry,,to use drugs to prevent mental illness,as opposed to just treat it. 
 It is possible that 20, 50,n100 years from now,,we will look back nownat depression and PTSD,the way we look backnat tuberculosis sanitoriums,as a thing of the past.,This could be the beginning of the endnof the mental health epidemic. 
 But as a great scientist once said,,"Only a fool is sure of anything.,A wise man keeps on guessing." 
 Thank you, guys. 
 (Applause)In 1987, Tina Lordnfound herself in quite the pickle.,See, this gold digger made surenshe married sweet Cord Roberts,just before he inherited millions.,But when Cord found outnTina loved his money,as much as she loved him,,he dumped her.,Cord's mother Maria was thrilled,until they hooked up again.,So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina,and then made sure Cord didn't find outnTina was pregnant with his baby.,So Tina, still marriednbut thinking Cord didn't love her,flew to Argentina with Max.,Cord finally figured out what was going on,and rushed after them,nbut he was too late.,Tina had already been kidnapped,,strapped to a raftnand sent over a waterfall.,She and her baby were presumed dead.,Cord was sad for a bit,,but then he bounced right back,with a supersmartnarchaeologist named Kate,,and they had a gorgeous wedding,until Tina, seemingly back from the dead,nran into the church holding a baby.,"Stop!" she screamed.,"Am I too late?,Cord, I've come so far.,This is your son." 
 And that, ladies and gentlemen,,is how the soap opera "One Life to Live"nintroduced a love story,that lasted 25 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera,,you know the stories and the charactersncan be exaggerated, larger than life,,and if you're a fan,nyou find that exaggeration fun,,and if you're not,,maybe you find themnmelodramatic or unsophisticated.,Maybe you think watching soap operas,is a waste of time,,that their bigness meansntheir lessons are small or nonexistent.,But I believe the opposite to be true.,Soap operas reflect life, just bigger.,So there are real life lessonsnwe can learn from soap operas,,and those lessonsnare as big and adventurous,as any soap opera storyline. 
 Now, I've been a fan since I ran homenfrom the bus stop in second grade,desperate to catch the endnof Luke and Laura's wedding,,the biggest momentnin "General Hospital" history. 
 (Applause) 
 So you can imaginenhow much I loved my eight years,as the assistant casting directornon "As the World Turns.",My job was watching soap operas,,reading soap opera scripts,and auditioning actorsnto be on soap operas.,So I know my stuff. 
 (Laughter) 
 And yes, soap operas,are larger than life,,drama on a grand scale,,but our lives can be fillednwith as much intensity,,and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.,We cycle through tragedy and joy,just like these characters.,We cross thresholds, fight demonsnand find salvation unexpectedly,,and we do it again and again and again,,but just like soaps,nwe can flip the script,,which means we can learnnfrom these characters,that move like bumblebees,,looping and swerving through life.,And we can use those lessons,to craft our own life stories.,Soap operas teach us to push away doubt,and believe in our capacity,for bravery, vulnerability,,adaptability and resilience.,And most importantly, they show us,it's never too late to change your story. 
 So with that, let's startnwith soap opera lesson one:,surrender is not an option. 
 (Laughter) 
 "All My Children"'s Erica Kanenwas daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,,a hyperbolically self-important princess,who deep down was scrappy and daring.,Now, in her 41 years on TV,nperhaps Erica's most famous scene,is her alone in the woods,suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.,She screamed at the bear,,"You may not do this!,Do you understand me?,You may not come near me!,I am Erica Kane,and you are a filthy beast!" 
 (Laughter) 
 And of course the bear left,,so what that teaches us,is obstacles are to be expected,and we can choose to surrendernor we can stand and fight. 
 Pandora's Tim Westergrennknows this better than most.,You might even call himnthe Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.,Tim and his cofoundersnlaunched the company,with two million dollars in funding.,They were out of cash the next year.,Now, lots of companies fold at that point,nbut Tim chose to fight.,He maxed out 11 credit cardsnand racked up six figures in personal debt,and it still wasn't enough.,So every two weeks for two years on paydaynhe stood in front of his employees,and he asked themnto sacrifice their salaries,,and it worked.,More than 50 people deferredntwo million dollars,,and now, more than a decade later,,Pandora is worth billions.,When you believe that there is a way,around or throughnwhatever is in front of you,,that surrender is not an option,,you can overcome enormous obstacles. 
 Which brings us to soap opera lesson two:,sacrifice your egonand drop the superiority complex. 
 Now, this is scary.,It's an acknowledgmentnof need or fallibility.,Maybe it's even an admission,that we're not as specialnas we might like to think.,Stephanie Forresternof "The Bold and the Beautiful",thought she was pretty darn special.,She thought she was so special,,she didn't need to mixnwith the riffraff from the valley,,and she made surenvalley girl Brooke knew it.,But after nearly 25 yearsnof epic fighting,,Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in.,They made amends,,archenemies became soul mates,and Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,,and here's our takeaway.,Drop your ego.,Life is not about you.,It's about us,,and our ability to experience joy,and love and to improve our reality,comes only when we makenourselves vulnerable,and we accept responsibilitynfor our actions,and our inactions,,kind of like Howard Schultz,nthe CEO of Starbucks. 
 Now, after a great run as CEO,,Howard stepped down in 2000,,and Starbucks quickly overextended itself,and stock prices fell.,Howard rejoined the team in 2008,,and one of the first things he did,was apologize to all 180,000 employees.,He apologized.,And then he asked for help,nhonesty, and ideas in return.,And now, Starbucks has more than doubled,its net revenue since Howard came back.,So sacrifice your desirento be right or safe all the time.,It's not helping anyone, least of all you.,Sacrifice your ego. 
 Soap opera lesson three:,evolution is real.,You're not meant to be static characters.,On television, static equals boringnand boring equals fired.,Characters are supposednto grow and change.,Now, on TV, those dynamic changes,can make for some rough transitions,,particularly when a characternis played by one person yesterday,and played by someone new today.,Recasting happens all the time on soaps.,Over the last 20 years,,four different actorsnhave played the same key role,of Carly Benson on "General Hospital.",Each new face triggered a changenin the character's life and personality.,Now, there was alwaysnan essential nugget of Carly in there,,but the character and the storynadapted to whomever was playing her. 
 And here's what that means for us.,While we may not swap facesnin our own lives,,we can evolve too.,We can choose to draw a circlenaround our feet and stay in that spot,,or we can open ourselves to opportunities,like Carly, who wentnfrom nursing student to hotel owner,,or like Julia Child. 
 Julia was a World War II spy,,and when the war ended,nshe got married, moved to France,,and decided to givenculinary school a shot.,Julia, her books and her TV showsnrevolutionized the way America cooks. 
 We all have the powernto initiate change in our lives,,to evolve and adapt.,We make the choice,,but sometimes life chooses for us,nand we don't get a heads up.,Surprise slams us in the face.,You're flat on the ground,nthe air is gone,,and you need resuscitation. 
 So thank goodnessnfor soap opera lesson four:,resurrection is possible. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 In 1983, "Days of Our Lives"'nStefano DiMera died of a stroke,,but not really, because in 1984,he died when his carnplunged into the harbor,,and yet he was back in 1985nwith a brain tumor. 
 (Laughter) 
 But before the tumor could kill him,,Marlena shot him, and he tumblednoff a catwalk to his death.,And so it went for 30 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 Even when we saw the body,,we knew better.,He's called the Phoenix for a reason.,And here's what that means for us.,As long as the show is still on the air,,or you're still breathing,,nothing is permanent.,Resurrection is possible. 
 Now, of course, just like life,,soap operas do ultimatelynmeet the big finale.,CBS canceled my show,n"As The World Turns," in December 2009,,and we shot our final episode,in June 2010.,It was six months of dying,and I rode that trainnright into the mountain.,And even though we werenin the middle of a huge recession,and millions of peoplenwere struggling to find work,,I somehow thought everything would be OK.,So I packed up the kidsnand the Brooklyn apartment,,and we moved in with my in-laws,in Alabama. 
 (Laughter) 
 Three months later, nothing was OK.,That was when I watchednthe final episode air,,and I realized the shownwas not the only fatality.,I was one too.,I was unemployednand living on the second floor,of my in-laws' home,,and that's enoughnto make anyone feel dead inside. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I knew my story wasn't over,,that it couldn't be over.,I just had to tap into everythingnI had ever learned about soap operas.,I had to be brave like Ericanand refuse to surrender,,so every day, I made a decision to fight.,I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie,and sacrifice my ego.,I had to ask for helpna lot of times across many states.,I had to be adaptable like Carly,and evolve my skills,nmy mindset, and my circumstances,,and then I had to benresilient, like Stefano,,and resurrect myself and my career,like a phoenix from the ashes. 
 Eventually I got an interview.,After 15 years in news and entertainment,,nine months of unemployment,and this one interview,,I had an offer for an entry level job.,I was 37 years old,and I was back from the dead. 
 We will all experiencenwhat looks like an ending,,and we can choose to make it a beginning.,Kind of like Tina, who miraculouslynsurvived that waterfall,,and because I hate to leavena cliffhanger hanging,,Tina and Cord did get divorced,,but they got remarried three timesnbefore the show went off the air in 2012. 
 So remember,,as long as there is breath in your body,,it's never too late to change your story. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)June 2010.,I landed for the first timenin Rome, Italy.,I wasn't there to sightsee.,I was there to solve world hunger. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's right.,I was a 25-year-old PhD student,armed with a prototype toolndeveloped back at my university,,and I was going to helpnthe World Food Programme fix hunger.,So I strode into the headquarters building,and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags,,and I smiled as I thought to myself,,"The engineer is here." 
 (Laughter) 
 Give me your data.,I'm going to optimize everything. 
 (Laughter) 
 Tell me the food that you've purchased,,tell me where it's goingnand when it needs to be there,,and I'm going to tell younthe shortest, fastest, cheapest,,best set of routes to take for the food.,We're going to save money,,we're going to avoidndelays and disruptions,,and bottom line,nwe're going to save lives.,You're welcome. 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought it was going to take 12 months,,OK, maybe even 13.,This is not quite how it panned out.,Just a couple of months into the project,nmy French boss, he told me,,"You know, Mallory,,it's a good idea,,but the data you neednfor your algorithms is not there.,It's the right idea but at the wrong time,,and the right idea at the wrong time,is the wrong idea." 
 (Laughter) 
 Project over.,I was crushed. 
 When I look back now,on that first summer in Rome,and I see how much has changednover the past six years,,it is an absolute transformation.,It's a coming of age for bringing dataninto the humanitarian world.,It's exciting. It's inspiring.,But we're not there yet.,And brace yourself, executives,,because I'm going to be putting companies,on the hot seat to step upnand play the role that I know they can. 
 My experiences back in Rome prove,using data you can save lives.,OK, not that first attempt,,but eventually we got there.,Let me paint the picture for you.,Imagine that you have to plannbreakfast, lunch and dinner,for 500,000 people,,and you only havena certain budget to do it,,say 6.5 million dollars per month.,Well, what should you do?nWhat's the best way to handle it?,Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil?,How much?,It sounds simple. It's not.,You have 30 possible foods,nand you have to pick five of them.,That's already over 140,000ndifferent combinations.,Then for each food that you pick,,you need to decide how much you'll buy,,where you're going to get it from,,where you're going to store it,,how long it's going to take to get there.,You need to look at all of the differentntransportation routes as well.,And that's alreadynover 900 million options.,If you considered each optionnfor a single second,,that would take younover 28 years to get through.,900 million options. 
 So we created a toolnthat allowed decisionmakers,to weed through all 900 million options,in just a matter of days.,It turned out to be incredibly successful.,In an operation in Iraq,,we saved 17 percent of the costs,,and this meant that you had the abilitynto feed an additional 80,000 people.,It's all thanks to the use of datanand modeling complex systems. 
 But we didn't do it alone.,The unit that I worked with in Rome,nthey were unique.,They believed in collaboration.,They brought in the academic world.,They brought in companies.,And if we really want to make big changesnin big problems like world hunger,,we need everybody to the table.,We need the data peoplenfrom humanitarian organizations,leading the way,,and orchestratingnjust the right types of engagements,with academics, with governments.,And there's one group that's not beingnleveraged in the way that it should be.,Did you guess it? Companies. 
 Companies have a major role to playnin fixing the big problems in our world.,I've been in the private sectornfor two years now.,I've seen what companies can do,nand I've seen what companies aren't doing,,and I think there's three main waysnthat we can fill that gap:,by donating data,nby donating decision scientists,and by donating technologynto gather new sources of data.,This is data philanthropy,,and it's the future of corporatensocial responsibility.,Bonus, it also makes good business sense. 
 Companies today,nthey collect mountains of data,,so the first thing they can donis start donating that data.,Some companies are already doing it.,Take, for example,na major telecom company.,They opened up their datanin Senegal and the Ivory Coast,and researchers discovered,that if you look at the patternsnin the pings to the cell phone towers,,you can see where people are traveling.,And that can tell you things like,where malaria might spread,nand you can make predictions with it.,Or take for examplenan innovative satellite company.,They opened up their data and donated it,,and with that data you could track,how droughts are impactingnfood production.,With that you can actually triggernaid funding before a crisis can happen. 
 This is a great start.,There's important insightsnjust locked away in company data.,And yes, you need to be very careful.,You need to respect privacy concerns,nfor example by anonymizing the data. 
 But even if the floodgates opened up,,and even if all companiesndonated their data,to academics, to NGOs,nto humanitarian organizations,,it wouldn't be enoughnto harness that full impact of data,for humanitarian goals.,Why?,To unlock insights in data,nyou need decision scientists.,Decision scientists are people like me.,They take the data, they clean it up,,transform it and put itninto a useful algorithm,that's the best choicento address the business need at hand.,In the world of humanitarian aid,nthere are very few decision scientists.,Most of them work for companies.,So that's the second thingnthat companies need to do.,In addition to donating their data,,they need to donatentheir decision scientists. 
 Now, companies will say, "Ah! Don't takenour decision scientists from us.,We need every spare second of their time.",But there's a way.,If a company was going to donatena block of a decision scientist's time,,it would actually make more sensento spread out that block of time,over a long period,nsay for example five years.,This might only amountnto a couple of hours per month,,which a company would hardly miss,,but what it enables is really important:nlong-term partnerships.,Long-term partnershipsnallow you to build relationships,,to get to know the data,nto really understand it,and to start to understandnthe needs and challenges,that the humanitariannorganization is facing.,In Rome, at the World Food Programme,nthis took us five years to do,,five years.,That first three years, OK,nthat was just what we couldn't solve for.,Then there was two years after thatnof refining and implementing the tool,,like in the operations in Iraqnand other countries.,I don't think that'snan unrealistic timeline,when it comes to using datanto make operational changes.,It's an investment. It requires patience.,But the types of resultsnthat can be produced are undeniable.,In our case, it was the abilitynto feed tens of thousands more people. 
 So we have donating data,nwe have donating decision scientists,,and there's actually a third waynthat companies can help:,donating technologynto capture new sources of data.,You see, there's a lot of thingsnwe just don't have data on.,Right now, Syrian refugeesnare flooding into Greece,,and the UN refugee agency,nthey have their hands full.,The current system for tracking peoplenis paper and pencil,,and what that means is,that when a mother and her five childrennwalk into the camp,,headquarters is essentiallynblind to this moment.,That's all going to changenin the next few weeks,,thanks to private sector collaboration.,There's going to be a new system basednon donated package tracking technology,from the logistics companynthat I work for.,With this new system,nthere will be a data trail,,so you know exactly the moment,when that mother and her childrennwalk into the camp.,And even more, you knownif she's going to have supplies,this month and the next.,Information visibility drives efficiency.,For companies, using technologynto gather important data,,it's like bread and butter.,They've been doing it for years,,and it's led to majornoperational efficiency improvements.,Just try to imaginenyour favorite beverage company,trying to plan their inventory,and not knowing how many bottlesnwere on the shelves.,It's absurd.,Data drives better decisions. 
 Now, if you're representing a company,,and you're pragmaticnand not just idealistic,,you might be saying to yourself,n"OK, this is all great, Mallory,,but why should I want to be involved?",Well for one thing, beyond the good PR,,humanitarian aidnis a 24-billion-dollar sector,,and there's over five billion people,nmaybe your next customers,,that live in the developing world.,Further, companies that are engagingnin data philanthropy,,they're finding new insightsnlocked away in their data.,Take, for example, a credit card company,that's opened up a center,that functions as a hub for academics,nfor NGOs and governments,,all working together.,They're looking at informationnin credit card swipes,and using that to find insightsnabout how households in India,live, work, earn and spend.,For the humanitarian world,nthis provides information,about how you mightnbring people out of poverty.,But for companies, it's providingninsights about your customers,and potential customers in India.,It's a win all around.,Now, for me, what I findnexciting about data philanthropy --,donating data, donating decisionnscientists and donating technology --,it's what it meansnfor young professionals like me,who are choosing to work at companies.,Studies show thatnthe next generation of the workforce,care about having their worknmake a bigger impact.,We want to make a difference,,and so through data philanthropy,,companies can actually help engagenand retain their decision scientists.,And that's a big deal for a professionnthat's in high demand. 
 Data philanthropynmakes good business sense,,and it also can helpnrevolutionize the humanitarian world.,If we coordinatednthe planning and logistics,across all of the major facetsnof a humanitarian operation,,we could feed, clothe and shelternhundreds of thousands more people,,and companies need to step upnand play the role that I know they can,in bringing about this revolution. 
 You've probably heard of the sayingn"food for thought.",Well, this is literally thought for food.,It finally is the right ideanat the right time. 
 (Laughter) 
 Très magnifique. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Some people are obsessednby French wines.,Others love playing golf,or devouring literature.,One of my greatest pleasuresnin life is, I have to admit,,a bit special.,I cannot tell you how much I enjoynwatching cities from the sky,,from an airplane window. 
 Some cities are calmly industrious,,like Dusseldorf,or Louisville.,Others project an energynthat they can hardly contain,,like New York,or Hong Kong.,And then you have Paris,or Istanbul,,and their patina full of history. 
 I see cities as living beings.,And when I discover them from far above,,I like to find those main streetsnand highways that structure their space.,Especially at night,,when commuters make these arteriesnlook dramatically red and golden:,the city's vascular systemnperforming its vital function,right before your eyes.,But when I'm sitting in my car,after an hour and a halfnof commute every day,,that reality looks very different. 
 (Laughter) 
 Nothing --,not public radio,,no podcast -- 
 (Laughter),Not even mindfulness meditation,makes this time worth living. 
 (Laughter) 
 Isn't it absurd,that we created carsnthat can reach 130 miles per hour,and we now drive them at the same speednas 19th-century horse carriages? 
 (Laughter) 
 In the US alone,,we spent 29.6 billion hoursncommuting in 2014.,With that amount of time,,ancient Egyptians could have builtn26 Pyramids of Giza. 
 (Laughter) 
 We do that in one year.,A monumental waste of time,nenergy and human potential. 
 For decades,,our remedy for congestion was simple:,build new roads or enlarge existing ones.,And it worked.,It worked admirably for Paris,,when the city tore downnhundreds of historical buildings,to create 85 miles,of transportation-friendly boulevards.,And it still works todaynin fast-growing emerging cities.,But in more established urban centers,,significant network expansionsnare almost impossible:,habitat is just too dense,,real estate, too expensive,and public finances, too fragile.,Our city's vascular systemnis getting clogged, it's getting sick,,and we should pay attention. 
 Our current waynof thinking is not working.,For our transportation to flow,,we need a new source of inspiration. 
 So after 16 yearsnworking in transportation,,my "aha moment" happenednwhen speaking with a biotech customer.,She was telling me how her treatment,was leveraging specific propertiesnof our vascular system.,"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system --,all the veins and arteries in our body,making miracles of logistics every day.",This is the moment I realized,that biology has beennin the transportation business,for billions of years.,It has been testing countless solutions,to move nutrients, gases and proteins.,It really is the world's mostnsophisticated transportation laboratory. 
 So, what if the solution to our trafficnchallenges was inside us?,I wanted to know:,Why is it that blood flowsnin our veins most of our lives,,when our big cities get cloggednon a daily basis?,And the reality is that you're lookingnat two very different networks.,I don't know if you realize,,but each of us has 60,000 milesnof blood vessels in our bodies --,60,000 miles.,That's two-and-a-half timesnthe Earth's circumference,,inside you.,What it means is that blood vesselsnare everywhere inside us,,not just under the surface of our skin. 
 But if you look at our cities,,yes, we have somenunderground subway systems,and some tunnels and bridges,,and also some helicopters in the sky.,But the vast majority of our trafficnis focused on the ground,,on the surface.,So in other words,,while our vascular system usesnthe three dimensions inside us,,our urban transportationnis mostly two-dimensional.,And so what we neednis to embrace that verticality.,If our surface grid is saturated,,well, let's elevate our traffic. 
 This Chinese concept of a busnthat can straddle traffic jams --,that was an eye-opener on new waysnto think about space and movement,inside our cities.,And we can go higher,,and suspend our transportationnlike we did with our electrical grid.,Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabinare talking about testing,these futuristic networksnof suspended magnetic pods.,And we can keep climbing, and fly.,The fact that a company like Airbus,is now seriously workingnon flying urban taxis,is telling us something.,Flying cars are finally movingnfrom science-fiction déjà vu,to attractive business-case territory.,And that's an exciting moment. 
 So building this 3-Dntransportation network,is one of the ways we can mitigatenand solve traffic jams.,But it's not the only one.,We have to question,other fundamental choicesnthat we made, like the vehicles we use.,Just imagine a very familiar scene:,You've been driving for 42 minutes.,The two kids behind younare getting restless.,And you're late.,Do you see that slow car in front of you?,Always comes when you're late, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 That driver is looking for parking.,There is no parking spotnavailable in the area,,but how would he know?,It is estimated that up to 30 percentnof urban traffic is generated,by drivers looking for parking.,Do you see the 100 cars around you?,Eighty-five of themnonly have one passenger.,Those 85 drivers could all fitnin one Londonian red bus.,So the question is:,Why are we wasting so much spacenif it is what we need the most?,Why are we doing this to ourselves? 
 Biology would never do this.,Space inside our arteriesnis fully utilized.,At every heartbeat,,a higher blood pressure literally compactsnmillions of red blood cells,into massive trains of oxygen,that quickly flow throughout our body.,And the tiny space inside our rednblood cells is not wasted, either.,In healthy conditions,,more than 95 percentnof their oxygen capacity is utilized.,Can you imagine if the vehiclesnwe used in our cities,were 95 percent full,,all the additional spacenyou would have to walk, to bike,and to enjoy our cities? 
 The reason blood is sonincredibly efficient,is that our red blood cellsnare not dedicated,to specific organs or tissues;,otherwise, we would probably haventraffic jams in our veins.,No, they're shared.,They're shared by allnthe cells of our body.,And because our network is so extensive,,each one of our 37 trillion cellsngets its own deliveries of oxygen,precisely when it needs them. 
 Blood is both a collectivenand individual form of transportation.,But for our cities,,we've been stuck.,We've been stuck in an endless debate,between creating a car-centric societynor extensive mass-transit systems.,I think we should transcend this.,I think we can create vehiclesnthat combine the convenience of cars,and the efficiencies of trains and buses.,Just imagine.,You're comfortably sittingnin a fast and smooth urban train,,along with 1,200 passengers.,The problem with urban trains,is that sometimes you have to stopnfive, ten, fifteen times,before your final destination. 
 What if in this trainnyou didn't have to stop?,In this train,,wagons can detach dynamicallynwhile you're moving,and become express, driverless buses,that move on a secondary road network.,And so without a single stop,,nor a lengthy transfer,,you are now sitting in a busnthat is headed toward your suburb.,And when you get close,,the section you're sitting in detaches,and self-drives younright to your doorstep.,It is collective and individualnat the same time.,This could be one of the shared,nmodular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow. 
 Now ...,as if walking in a citynbuzzing with drones,,flying taxis, modular busesnand suspended magnetic pods,was not exotic enough,,I think there is another force in action,that will make urban traffic mesmerizing.,If you think about it,,the current generation of driverless carsnis just trying to earn its way,into a traffic gridnmade by and for humans.,They're trying to learn traffic rules,nwhich is relatively simple,,and coping with human unpredictability,,which is more challenging. 
 But what would happennwhen whole cities become driverless?,Would we need traffic lights?,Would we need lanes?,How about speed limits?,Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.,They never stop at red lights.,In the first driverless cities,,you would have no red lights and no lanes.,And when all the carsnare driverless and connected,,everything is predictablenand reaction time, minimum.,They can drive much faster,and can take any rational initiativenthat can speed them up,or the cars around them.,So instead of rigid traffic rules,,flow will be regulated,by a mesh of dynamic and constantlynself-improving algorithms.,The result: a strange traffic,that mixes the fast and smoothnrigor of German autobahns,and the creative vitalitynof the intersections of Mumbai. 
 (Laughter) 
 Traffic will be functionally exuberant.,It will be liquid like our blood.,And by a strange paradox,,the more robotizednour traffic grid will be,,the more organic and alivenits movement will feel. 
 So yes,,biology has all the attributesnof a transportation genius today.,But this process has takennbillions of years,,and went through all sortsnof iterations and mutations.,We can't wait billions of yearsnto evolve our transportation system.,We now have the dreams,,the concepts,and the technology,to create 3-D transportation networks,,invent new vehicles,and change the flow in our cities. 
 Let's do it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So you probably have the sense,nas most people do,,that polarizationnis getting worse in our country,,that the dividenbetween the left and the right,is as bad as it's beennin really any of our lifetimes.,But you might also reasonably wondernif research backs up your intuition.,And in a nutshell,nthe answer is sadly yes.,In study after study, we find,that liberals and conservativesnhave grown further apart.,They increasingly wall themselves offnin these ideological silos,,consuming different news,ntalking only to like-minded others,and more and more choosingnto live in different parts of the country. 
 And I think thatnmost alarming of all of it,is seeing this risingnanimosity on both sides.,Liberals and conservatives,,Democrats and Republicans,,more and more they justndon't like one another.,You see it in many different ways.,They don't want to befriend one another.nThey don't want to date one another.,If they do, if they find out,nthey find each other less attractive,,and they more and more don't wantntheir children to marry someone,who supports the other party,,a particularly shocking statistic. 
 You know, in my lab,nthe students that I work with,,we're talking aboutnsome sort of social pattern --,I'm a movie buff, and so I'm often like,,what kind of movie are we in herenwith this pattern?,So what kind of movie are we innwith political polarization?,Well, it could be a disaster movie.,It certainly seems like a disaster.,Could be a war movie.,Also fits.,But what I keep thinking is thatnwe're in a zombie apocalypse movie. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? You know the kind.,There's people wandering around in packs,,not thinking for themselves,,seized by this mob mentality,trying to spread their diseasenand destroy society.,And you probably think, as I do,,that you're the good guynin the zombie apocalypse movie,,and all this hate and polarization,nit's being propagated by the other people,,because we're Brad Pitt, right?,Free-thinking, righteous,,just trying to hold onnto what we hold dear,,you know, not foot soldiersnin the army of the undead.,Not that.,Never that. 
 But here's the thing:,what movie do you supposenthey think they're in?,Right?,Well, they absolutely thinknthat they're the good guys,in the zombie apocalypse movie. Right?,And you'd better believenthat they think that they're Brad Pitt,and that we, we are the zombies.,And who's to say that they're wrong?,I think that the truth isnthat we're all a part of this.,And the good side of thatnis that we can be a part of the solution. 
 So what are we going to do?,What can we do to chip awaynat polarization in everyday life?,What could we do to connect withnand communicate with,our political counterparts?,Well, these were exactly the questionsnthat I and my colleague, Matt Feinberg,,became fascinated with a few years ago,,and we startedndoing research on this topic.,And one of the first thingsnthat we discovered,that I think is really helpfulnfor understanding polarization,is to understand,that the political divide in our countrynis undergirded by a deeper moral divide. 
 So one of the most robust findingsnin the history of political psychology,is this pattern identifiednby Jon Haidt and Jesse Graham,,psychologists,,that liberals and conservativesntend to endorse different values,to different degrees.,So for example, we find that liberalsntend to endorse values like equality,and fairness and carenand protection from harm,more than conservatives do.,And conservatives tend to endorsenvalues like loyalty, patriotism,,respect for authority and moral purity,more than liberals do.,And Matt and I were thinkingnthat maybe this moral divide,might be helpfulnfor understanding how it is,that liberals and conservativesntalk to one another,and why they so oftennseem to talk past one another,when they do. 
 So we conducted a study,where we recruited liberals to a study,where they were supposednto write a persuasive essay,that would be compelling to a conservativenin support of same-sex marriage.,And what we found was that liberalsntended to make arguments,in terms of the liberal moral valuesnof equality and fairness.,So they said things like,,"Everyone should have the rightnto love whoever they choose,",and, "They" -- they being gay Americans --,"deserve the same equal rightsnas other Americans.",Overall, we foundnthat 69 percent of liberals,invoked one of the more liberalnmoral values in constructing their essay,,and only nine percent invokednone of the more conservative moral values,,even though they were supposednto be trying to persuade conservatives.,And when we studied conservativesnand had them make persuasive arguments,in support of making Englishnthe official language of the US,,a classically conservativenpolitical position,,we found that they weren'tnmuch better at this.,59 percent of them made arguments,in terms of one of the morenconservative moral values,,and just eight percentninvoked a liberal moral value,,even though they were supposednto be targeting liberals for persuasion. 
 Now, you can see right awaynwhy we're in trouble here. Right?,People's moral values,nthey're their most deeply held beliefs.,People are willingnto fight and die for their values.,Why are they going to give that upnjust to agree with you,on something that they don't particularlynwant to agree with you on anyway?,If that persuasive appeal thatnyou're making to your Republican uncle,means that he doesn'tnjust have to change his view,,he's got to changenhis underlying values, too,,that's not going to go very far. 
 So what would work better?,Well, we believe it's a techniquenthat we call moral reframing,,and we've studied itnin a series of experiments.,In one of these experiments,,we recruited liberalsnand conservatives to a study,where they read one of three essays,before having their environmentalnattitudes surveyed.,And the first of these essays,was a relatively conventionalnpro-environmental essay,that invoked the liberal valuesnof care and protection from harm.,It said things like,n"In many important ways,we are causing real harmnto the places we live in,",and, "It is essentialnthat we take steps now,to prevent further destructionnfrom being done to our Earth.",Another group of participants,were assigned to readna really different essay,that was designed to tap intonthe conservative value of moral purity.,It was a pro-environmental essay as well,,and it said things like,,"Keeping our forests, drinking water,nand skies pure is of vital importance.","We should regard the pollution,of the places we live innto be disgusting.",And, "Reducing pollutionncan help us preserve,what is pure and beautifulnabout the places we live.",And then we had a third group,that were assignednto read just a nonpolitical essay.,It was just a comparison groupnso we could get a baseline. 
 And what we found when we surveyed people,about their environmentalnattitudes afterwards,,we found that liberals,nit didn't matter what essay they read.,They tended to have highlynpro-environmental attitudes regardless.,Liberals are on boardnfor environmental protection.,Conservatives, however,,were significantly more supportivenof progressive environmental policies,and environmental protection,if they had read the moral purity essay,than if they readnone of the other two essays.,We even found that conservativesnwho read the moral purity essay,were significantly more likely to saynthat they believed in global warming,and were concerned about global warming,,even though this essayndidn't even mention global warming.,That's just a related environmental issue.,But that's how robustnthis moral reframing effect was. 
 And we've studied this on a whole slewnof different political issues.,So if you want to move conservatives,on issues like same-sex marriagenor national health insurance,,it helps to tie these liberalnpolitical issues to conservative values,like patriotism and moral purity.,And we studied it the other way, too.,If you want to move liberalsnto the right on conservative policy issues,like military spending and making Englishnthe official language of the US,,you're going to be more persuasive,if you tie those conservativenpolicy issues to liberal moral values,like equality and fairness. 
 All these studiesnhave the same clear message:,if you want to persuadensomeone on some policy,,it's helpful to connect that policynto their underlying moral values.,And when you say it like that,it seems really obvious. Right?,Like, why did we come here tonight?,Why -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It's incredibly intuitive.,And even though it is,nit's something we really struggle to do.,You know, it turns out that when we gonto persuade somebody on a political issue,,we talk like we're speaking into a mirror.,We don't persuade so muchnas we rehearse our own reasons,for why we believensome sort of political position.,We kept saying when we were designingnthese reframed moral arguments,,"Empathy and respect,nempathy and respect.",If you can tap into that,,you can connect,and you might be able to persuadensomebody in this country. 
 So thinking again,about what movie we're in,,maybe I got carried away before.,Maybe it's not a zombie apocalypse movie.,Maybe instead it's a buddy cop movie. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just roll with it, just go with it please. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know the kind:nthere's a white cop and a black cop,,or maybe a messy cop and an organized cop.,Whatever it is, they don't get along,because of this difference.,But in the end, when they havento come together and they cooperate,,the solidarity that they feel,,it's greater because of that gulfnthat they had to cross. Right?,And remember that in these movies,,it's usually worst in the second act,when our leads are further apartnthan ever before.,And so maybe that'snwhere we are in this country,,late in the second actnof a buddy cop movie -- 
 (Laughter) 
 torn apart but aboutnto come back together.,It sounds good,,but if we want it to happen,,I think the responsibilitynis going to start with us. 
 So this is my call to you:,let's put this country back together.,Let's do it despite the politicians,and the media and Facebook and Twitter,and Congressional redistricting,and all of it,nall the things that divide us.,Let's do it because it's right.,And let's do itnbecause this hate and contempt,that flows through all of us every day,makes us ugly and it corrupts us,,and it threatensnthe very fabric of our society.,We owe it to one another and our country,to reach out and try to connect.,We can't afford to hate them any longer,,and we can't affordnto let them hate us either.,Empathy and respect.,Empathy and respect.,If you think about it, it's the very leastnthat we owe our fellow citizens. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Here's a startling fact:,in the 45 years since the introductionnof the automated teller machine,,those vending machines that dispense cash,,the number of human bank tellersnemployed in the United States,has roughly doubled,,from about a quarter of a millionnto a half a million.,A quarter of a million in 1970nto about a half a million today,,with 100,000 added since the year 2000. 
 These facts, revealed in a recent book,by Boston Universityneconomist James Bessen,,raise an intriguing question:,what are all those tellers doing,,and why hasn't automationneliminated their employment by now?,If you think about it,,many of the great inventionsnof the last 200 years,were designed to replace human labor.,Tractors were developed,to substitute mechanical powernfor human physical toil.,Assembly lines were engineered,to replace inconsistent human handiwork,with machine perfection.,Computers were programmed to swap out,error-prone, inconsistentnhuman calculation,with digital perfection.,These inventions have worked.,We no longer dig ditches by hand,,pound tools out of wrought iron,or do bookkeeping using actual books.,And yet, the fraction of US adultsnemployed in the labor market,is higher now in 2016,than it was 125 years ago, in 1890,,and it's risen in just about every decade,in the intervening 125 years. 
 This poses a paradox.,Our machines increasinglyndo our work for us.,Why doesn't this make our labor redundantnand our skills obsolete?,Why are there still so many jobs? 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm going to try to answernthat question tonight,,and along the way, I'm going to tell younwhat this means for the future of work,and the challenges that automationndoes and does not pose,for our society. 
 Why are there so many jobs?,There are actually two fundamentalneconomic principles at stake.,One has to do with human genius,and creativity.,The other has to donwith human insatiability,,or greed, if you like.,I'm going to call the first of thesenthe O-ring principle,,and it determinesnthe type of work that we do.,The second principlenis the never-get-enough principle,,and it determines how many jobsnthere actually are. 
 Let's start with the O-ring.,ATMs, automated teller machines,,had two countervailing effectsnon bank teller employment.,As you would expect,nthey replaced a lot of teller tasks.,The number of tellers per branchnfell by about a third.,But banks quickly discovered that itnalso was cheaper to open new branches,,and the number of bank branchesnincreased by about 40 percent,in the same time period.,The net result was more branchesnand more tellers.,But those tellers were doingnsomewhat different work.,As their routine,ncash-handling tasks receded,,they became less like checkout clerks,and more like salespeople,,forging relationships with customers,,solving problems,and introducing them to new productsnlike credit cards, loans and investments:,more tellers doingna more cognitively demanding job.,There's a general principle here.,Most of the work that we do,requires a multiplicity of skills,,and brains and brawn,,technical expertise and intuitive mastery,,perspiration and inspirationnin the words of Thomas Edison.,In general, automatingnsome subset of those tasks,doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.,In fact, it makes them more important.,It increases their economic value. 
 Let me give you a stark example.,In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger,exploded and crashed back down to Earth,less than two minutes after takeoff.,The cause of that crash, it turned out,,was an inexpensive rubber O-ringnin the booster rocket,that had frozen on the launchpadnthe night before,and failed catastrophicallynmoments after takeoff.,In this multibillion dollar enterprise,that simple rubber O-ring,made the differencenbetween mission success,and the calamitous deathnof seven astronauts.,An ingenious metaphornfor this tragic setting,is the O-ring production function,,named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer,after the Challenger disaster.,The O-ring production functionnconceives of the work,as a series of interlocking steps,,links in a chain.,Every one of those links must holdnfor the mission to succeed.,If any of them fails,,the mission, or the productnor the service,,comes crashing down.,This precarious situationnhas a surprisingly positive implication,,which is that improvements,in the reliabilitynof any one link in the chain,increases the valuenof improving any of the other links.,Concretely, if most of the linksnare brittle and prone to breakage,,the fact that your linknis not that reliable,is not that important.,Probably something else will break anyway.,But as all the other linksnbecome robust and reliable,,the importance of your linknbecomes more essential.,In the limit, everything depends upon it.,The reason the O-ring was criticalnto space shuttle Challenger,is because everything elsenworked perfectly.,If the Challenger werenkind of the space era equivalent,of Microsoft Windows 2000 -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the reliability of the O-ringnwouldn't have mattered,because the machine would have crashed. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's the broader point.,In much of the work that we do,nwe are the O-rings.,Yes, ATMs could doncertain cash-handling tasks,faster and better than tellers,,but that didn't make tellers superfluous.,It increased the importancenof their problem-solving skills,and their relationships with customers.,The same principle appliesnif we're building a building,,if we're diagnosingnand caring for a patient,,or if we are teaching a class,to a roomful of high schoolers.,As our tools improve,,technology magnifies our leverage,and increases the importancenof our expertise,and our judgment and our creativity. 
 And that brings mento the second principle:,never get enough.,You may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it,,that says the jobs that people donwill be important.,They can't be done by machines,nbut they still need to be done.,But that doesn't tell menhow many jobs there will need to be.,If you think about it,nisn't it kind of self-evident,that once we get sufficientlynproductive at something,,we've basicallynworked our way out of a job?,In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment,was on farms.,Today, it's less than two percent.,Why are there so few farmers today?,It's not because we're eating less. 
 (Laughter) 
 A century of productivityngrowth in farming,means that now,na couple of million farmers,can feed a nation of 320 million.,That's amazing progress,,but it also means there arenonly so many O-ring jobs left in farming.,So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.,Farming is only one example.,There are many others like it.,But what's true about a single productnor service or industry,has never been truenabout the economy as a whole.,Many of the industriesnin which we now work --,health and medicine,,finance and insurance,,electronics and computing --,were tiny or barely existentna century ago.,Many of the productsnthat we spend a lot of our money on --,air conditioners, sport utility vehicles,,computers and mobile devices --,were unattainably expensive,,or just hadn't been inventedna century ago.,As automation frees our time,nincreases the scope of what is possible,,we invent new products,nnew ideas, new services,that command our attention,,occupy our time,and spur consumption.,You may think somenof these things are frivolous --,extreme yoga, adventure tourism,,Pokémon GO --,and I might agree with you.,But people desire these things,nand they're willing to work hard for them.,The average worker in 2015,wanting to attainnthe average living standard in 1915,could do so by workingnjust 17 weeks a year,,one third of the time.,But most people don't choose to do that.,They are willing to work hard,to harvest the technological bountynthat is available to them.,Material abundance has neverneliminated perceived scarcity.,In the words of economistnThorstein Veblen,,invention is the mother of necessity. 
 Now ...,So if you accept these two principles,,the O-ring principlenand the never-get-enough principle,,then you agree with me.,There will be jobs.,Does that mean there'snnothing to worry about?,Automation, employment, robots and jobs --,it'll all take care of itself?,No.,That is not my argument.,Automation creates wealth,by allowing us to donmore work in less time.,There is no economic law,that says that wenwill use that wealth well,,and that is worth worrying about.,Consider two countries,,Norway and Saudi Arabia.,Both oil-rich nations,,it's like they have moneynspurting out of a hole in the ground. 
 (Laughter) 
 But they haven't used that wealthnequally well to foster human prosperity,,human prospering.,Norway is a thriving democracy.,By and large, its citizensnwork and play well together.,It's typically numberednbetween first and fourth,in rankings of national happiness.,Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy,in which many citizensnlack a path for personal advancement.,It's typically ranked 35thnamong nations in happiness,,which is low for such a wealthy nation.,Just by way of comparison,,the US is typically rankednaround 12th or 13th.,The difference between these two countries,is not their wealth,and it's not their technology.,It's their institutions.,Norway has invested to build a society,with opportunity and economic mobility.,Saudi Arabia has raised living standards,while frustratingnmany other human strivings.,Two countries, both wealthy,,not equally well off. 
 And this brings mento the challenge that we face today,,the challenge thatnautomation poses for us.,The challenge is notnthat we're running out of work.,The US has added 14 million jobs,since the depths of the Great Recession.,The challenge is that many of those jobs,are not good jobs,,and many citizensncannot qualify for the good jobs,that are being created.,Employment growth in the United Statesnand in much of the developed world,looks something like a barbell,with increasing poundagenon either end of the bar.,On the one hand,,you have high-education, high-wage jobs,like doctors and nurses,nprogrammers and engineers,,marketing and sales managers.,Employment is robust in these jobs,nemployment growth.,Similarly, employment growthnis robust in many low-skill,,low-education jobs like food service,,cleaning, security,,home health aids.,Simultaneously, employment is shrinking,in many middle-education,nmiddle-wage, middle-class jobs,,like blue-collar productionnand operative positions,and white-collarnclerical and sales positions.,The reasons behind this contracting middle,are not mysterious.,Many of those middle-skill jobs,use well-understood rules and procedures,that can increasinglynbe codified in software,and executed by computers.,The challenge thatnthis phenomenon creates,,what economists callnemployment polarization,,is that it knocks out rungsnin the economic ladder,,shrinks the size of the middle class,and threatens to make usna more stratified society.,On the one hand, a set of highly paid,nhighly educated professionals,doing interesting work,,on the other, a large numbernof citizens in low-paid jobs,whose primary responsibility is to seento the comfort and health of the affluent.,That is not my vision of progress,,and I doubt that it is yours. 
 But here is some encouraging news.,We have faced equally momentousneconomic transformations in the past,,and we have comenthrough them successfully.,In the late 1800s and early 1900s,,when automation was eliminatingnvast numbers of agricultural jobs --,remember that tractor? --,the farm states faced a threatnof mass unemployment,,a generation of youthnno longer needed on the farm,but not prepared for industry.,Rising to this challenge,,they took the radical step,of requiring thatntheir entire youth population,remain in schoolnand continue their education,to the ripe old age of 16.,This was called the high school movement,,and it was a radicallynexpensive thing to do.,Not only did they havento invest in the schools,,but those kids couldn't worknat their jobs.,It also turned out to benone of the best investments,the US made in the 20th century.,It gave us the most skilled,nthe most flexible,and the most productivenworkforce in the world.,To see how well this worked,nimagine taking the labor force of 1899,and bringing them into the present.,Despite their strong backsnand good characters,,many of them would lacknthe basic literacy and numeracy skills,to do all but the most mundane jobs.,Many of them would be unemployable. 
 What this example highlightsnis the primacy of our institutions,,most especially our schools,,in allowing us to reap the harvest,of our technological prosperity. 
 It's foolish to saynthere's nothing to worry about.,Clearly we can get this wrong.,If the US had not investednin its schools and in its skills,a century ago withnthe high school movement,,we would be a less prosperous,,a less mobile and probablyna lot less happy society.,But it's equally foolishnto say that our fates are sealed.,That's not decided by the machines.,It's not even decided by the market.,It's decided by usnand by our institutions. 
 Now, I started this talk with a paradox.,Our machines increasinglyndo our work for us.,Why doesn't that makenour labor superfluous,,our skills redundant?,Isn't it obvious that the roadnto our economic and social hell,is paved with our own great inventions? 
 History has repeatedly offerednan answer to that paradox.,The first part of the answernis that technology magnifies our leverage,,increases the importance, the added value,of our expertise,nour judgment and our creativity.,That's the O-ring.,The second part of the answernis our endless inventiveness,and bottomless desires,means that we never get enough,nnever get enough.,There's always new work to do.,Adjusting to the rapid pacenof technological change,creates real challenges,,seen most clearlynin our polarized labor market,and the threat that it posesnto economic mobility.,Rising to this challenge is not automatic.,It's not costless.,It's not easy.,But it is feasible.,And here is some encouraging news.,Because of our amazing productivity,,we're rich.,Of course we can affordnto invest in ourselves and in our children,as America did a hundred years agonwith the high school movement.,Arguably, we can't afford not to. 
 Now, you may be thinking,,Professor Autor has told usna heartwarming tale,about the distant past,,the recent past,,maybe the present,nbut probably not the future.,Because everybody knowsnthat this time is different.,Right? Is this time different?,Of course this time is different.,Every time is different.,On numerous occasionsnin the last 200 years,,scholars and activistsnhave raised the alarm,that we are running out of worknand making ourselves obsolete:,for example, the Ludditesnin the early 1800s;,US Secretary of Labor James Davis,in the mid-1920s;,Nobel Prize-winning economistnWassily Leontief in 1982;,and of course, many scholars,,pundits, technologists,and media figures today. 
 These predictions strike me as arrogant.,These self-proclaimed oraclesnare in effect saying,,"If I can't think of what peoplenwill do for work in the future,,then you, me and our kids,aren't going to think of it either.",I don't have the guts,to take that bet against human ingenuity.,Look, I can't tell younwhat people are going to do for work,a hundred years from now.,But the future doesn't hingenon my imagination.,If I were a farmer in Iowanin the year 1900,,and an economist from the 21st centurynteleported down to my field,and said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor,,in the next hundred years,,agricultural employment is going to fallnfrom 40 percent of all jobs,to two percent,purely due to rising productivity.,What do you think the othern38 percent of workers are going to do?",I would not have said, "Oh, we got this.,We'll do app development,nradiological medicine,,yoga instruction, Bitmoji." 
 (Laughter) 
 I wouldn't have had a clue.,But I hope I would have hadnthe wisdom to say,,"Wow, a 95 percent reductionnin farm employment,with no shortage of food.,That's an amazing amount of progress.,I hope that humanitynfinds something remarkable to do,with all of that prosperity." 
 And by and large, I would say that it has. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Today I'm going to talknabout technology and society.,The Department of Transportnestimated that last year,35,000 people diednfrom traffic crashes in the US alone.,Worldwide, 1.2 million peoplendie every year in traffic accidents.,If there was a way we could eliminaten90 percent of those accidents,,would you support it?,Of course you would.,This is what driverless car technologynpromises to achieve,by eliminating the mainnsource of accidents --,human error. 
 Now picture yourselfnin a driverless car in the year 2030,,sitting back and watchingnthis vintage TEDxCambridge video. 
 (Laughter) 
 All of a sudden,,the car experiences mechanical failurenand is unable to stop.,If the car continues,,it will crash into a bunchnof pedestrians crossing the street,,but the car may swerve,,hitting one bystander,,killing them to save the pedestrians.,What should the car do,nand who should decide?,What if instead the carncould swerve into a wall,,crashing and killing you, the passenger,,in order to save those pedestrians?,This scenario is inspirednby the trolley problem,,which was inventednby philosophers a few decades ago,to think about ethics. 
 Now, the way we thinknabout this problem matters.,We may for examplennot think about it at all.,We may say this scenario is unrealistic,,incredibly unlikely, or just silly.,But I think this criticismnmisses the point,because it takesnthe scenario too literally.,Of course no accidentnis going to look like this;,no accident has two or three options,where everybody dies somehow.,Instead, the car is goingnto calculate something,like the probability of hittingna certain group of people,,if you swerve one directionnversus another direction,,you might slightly increase the risknto passengers or other drivers,versus pedestrians.,It's going to bena more complex calculation,,but it's still goingnto involve trade-offs,,and trade-offs often require ethics. 
 We might say then,n"Well, let's not worry about this.,Let's wait until technologynis fully ready and 100 percent safe.",Suppose that we can indeedneliminate 90 percent of those accidents,,or even 99 percent in the next 10 years.,What if eliminatingnthe last one percent of accidents,requires 50 more years of research?,Should we not adopt the technology?,That's 60 million peoplendead in car accidents,if we maintain the current rate.,So the point is,,waiting for full safety is also a choice,,and it also involves trade-offs. 
 People online on social medianhave been coming up with all sorts of ways,to not think about this problem.,One person suggestednthe car should just swerve somehow,in between the passengers -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and the bystander.,Of course if that's what the car can do,nthat's what the car should do.,We're interested in scenariosnin which this is not possible.,And my personal favoritenwas a suggestion by a blogger,to have an eject button in the carnthat you press -- 
 (Laughter) 
 just before the car self-destructs. 
 (Laughter) 
 So if we acknowledge that carsnwill have to make trade-offs on the road,,how do we think about those trade-offs,,and how do we decide?,Well, maybe we should run a surveynto find out what society wants,,because ultimately,,regulations and the lawnare a reflection of societal values. 
 So this is what we did.,With my collaborators,,Jean-François Bonnefon and Azim Shariff,,we ran a survey,in which we presented peoplenwith these types of scenarios.,We gave them two optionsninspired by two philosophers:,Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant.,Bentham says the carnshould follow utilitarian ethics:,it should take the actionnthat will minimize total harm --,even if that action will kill a bystander,and even if that actionnwill kill the passenger.,Immanuel Kant says the carnshould follow duty-bound principles,,like "Thou shalt not kill.",So you should not take an actionnthat explicitly harms a human being,,and you should let the car take its course,even if that's going to harm more people. 
 What do you think?,Bentham or Kant?,Here's what we found.,Most people sided with Bentham.,So it seems that peoplenwant cars to be utilitarian,,minimize total harm,,and that's what we should all do.,Problem solved.,But there is a little catch.,When we asked peoplenwhether they would purchase such cars,,they said, "Absolutely not." 
 (Laughter) 
 They would like to buy carsnthat protect them at all costs,,but they want everybody elsento buy cars that minimize harm. 
 (Laughter) 
 We've seen this problem before.,It's called a social dilemma.,And to understand the social dilemma,,we have to go a little bitnback in history.,In the 1800s,,English economist William Forster Lloydnpublished a pamphlet,which describes the following scenario.,You have a group of farmers --,English farmers --,who are sharing a common landnfor their sheep to graze.,Now, if each farmernbrings a certain number of sheep --,let's say three sheep --,the land will be rejuvenated,,the farmers are happy,,the sheep are happy,,everything is good.,Now, if one farmer brings one extra sheep,,that farmer will do slightly better,nand no one else will be harmed.,But if every farmer madenthat individually rational decision,,the land will be overrun,nand it will be depleted,to the detriment of all the farmers,,and of course,nto the detriment of the sheep. 
 We see this problem in many places:,in the difficulty of managing overfishing,,or in reducing carbon emissionsnto mitigate climate change.,When it comes to the regulationnof driverless cars,,the common land nownis basically public safety --,that's the common good --,and the farmers are the passengers,or the car owners who are choosingnto ride in those cars.,And by making the individuallynrational choice,of prioritizing their own safety,,they may collectively bendiminishing the common good,,which is minimizing total harm.,It's called the tragedy of the commons,,traditionally,,but I think in the casenof driverless cars,,the problem may bena little bit more insidious,because there is not necessarilynan individual human being,making those decisions.,So car manufacturersnmay simply program cars,that will maximize safetynfor their clients,,and those cars may learnnautomatically on their own,that doing so requires slightlynincreasing risk for pedestrians.,So to use the sheep metaphor,,it's like we now have electric sheepnthat have a mind of their own. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they may go and grazeneven if the farmer doesn't know it. 
 So this is what we may callnthe tragedy of the algorithmic commons,,and if offers new types of challenges.,Typically, traditionally,,we solve these typesnof social dilemmas using regulation,,so either governmentsnor communities get together,,and they decide collectivelynwhat kind of outcome they want,and what sort of constraintsnon individual behavior,they need to implement.,And then using monitoring and enforcement,,they can make surenthat the public good is preserved.,So why don't we just,,as regulators,,require that all cars minimize harm?,After all, this isnwhat people say they want.,And more importantly,,I can be sure that as an individual,,if I buy a car that maynsacrifice me in a very rare case,,I'm not the only sucker doing that,while everybody elsenenjoys unconditional protection. 
 In our survey, we did ask peoplenwhether they would support regulation,and here's what we found.,First of all, peoplensaid no to regulation;,and second, they said,,"Well if you regulate cars to do thisnand to minimize total harm,,I will not buy those cars.",So ironically,,by regulating cars to minimize harm,,we may actually end up with more harm,because people may notnopt into the safer technology,even if it's much safernthan human drivers. 
 I don't have the finalnanswer to this riddle,,but I think as a starting point,,we need society to come together,to decide what trade-offsnwe are comfortable with,and to come up with waysnin which we can enforce those trade-offs. 
 As a starting point,nmy brilliant students,,Edmond Awad and Sohan Dsouza,,built the Moral Machine website,,which generates random scenarios at you --,basically a bunchnof random dilemmas in a sequence,where you have to choose whatnthe car should do in a given scenario.,And we vary the ages and evennthe species of the different victims.,So far we've collectednover five million decisions,by over one million people worldwide,from the website.,And this is helping usnform an early picture,of what trade-offsnpeople are comfortable with,and what matters to them --,even across cultures.,But more importantly,,doing this exercisenis helping people recognize,the difficulty of making those choices,and that the regulatorsnare tasked with impossible choices.,And maybe this will help us as a societynunderstand the kinds of trade-offs,that will be implementednultimately in regulation. 
 And indeed, I was very happy to hear,that the first set of regulations,that came fromnthe Department of Transport --,announced last week --,included a 15-point checklistnfor all carmakers to provide,,and number 14 was ethical consideration --,how are you going to deal with that.,We also have peoplenreflect on their own decisions,by giving them summariesnof what they chose.,I'll give you one example --,I'm just going to warn younthat this is not your typical example,,your typical user.,This is the most sacrificed and the mostnsaved character for this person. 
 (Laughter) 
 Some of you may agree with him,,or her, we don't know.,But this person also seems to slightlynprefer passengers over pedestrians,in their choices,and is very happy to punish jaywalking. 
 (Laughter) 
 So let's wrap up.,We started with the question --nlet's call it the ethical dilemma --,of what the car should donin a specific scenario:,swerve or stay?,But then we realizednthat the problem was a different one.,It was the problem of how to getnsociety to agree on and enforce,the trade-offs they're comfortable with.,It's a social dilemma. 
 In the 1940s, Isaac Asimovnwrote his famous laws of robotics --,the three laws of robotics.,A robot may not harm a human being,,a robot may not disobey a human being,,and a robot may not allownitself to come to harm --,in this order of importance.,But after 40 years or so,and after so many storiesnpushing these laws to the limit,,Asimov introduced the zeroth law,which takes precedence above all,,and it's that a robotnmay not harm humanity as a whole.,I don't know what this meansnin the context of driverless cars,or any specific situation,,and I don't know how we can implement it,,but I think that by recognizing,that the regulation of driverless carsnis not only a technological problem,but also a societal cooperation problem,,I hope that we can at least beginnto ask the right questions. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In ancient Greece,,when anyone from slaves to soldiers,npoets and politicians,,needed to make a big decisionnon life's most important questions,,like, "Should I get married?",or "Should we embark on this voyage?",or "Should our armynadvance into this territory?",they all consulted the oracle. 
 So this is how it worked:,you would bring her a questionnand you would get on your knees,,and then she would go into this trance.,It would take a couple of days,,and then eventuallynshe would come out of it,,giving you her predictions as your answer. 
 From the oracle bones of ancient China,to ancient Greece to Mayan calendars,,people have craved for prophecy,in order to find outnwhat's going to happen next.,And that's because we all wantnto make the right decision.,We don't want to miss something.,The future is scary,,so it's much nicernknowing that we can make a decision,with some assurance of the outcome. 
 Well, we have a new oracle,,and it's name is big data,,or we call it "Watson"nor "deep learning" or "neural net.",And these are the kinds of questionsnwe ask of our oracle now,,like, "What's the most efficient waynto ship these phones,from China to Sweden?",Or, "What are the odds,of my child being bornnwith a genetic disorder?",Or, "What are the sales volumenwe can predict for this product?" 
 I have a dog. Her name is Elle,nand she hates the rain.,And I have tried everythingnto untrain her.,But because I have failed at this,,I also have to consultnan oracle, called Dark Sky,,every time before we go on a walk,,for very accurate weather predictionsnin the next 10 minutes.,She's so sweet.,So because of all of this,nour oracle is a $122 billion industry. 
 Now, despite the size of this industry,,the returns are surprisingly low.,Investing in big data is easy,,but using it is hard.,Over 73 percent of big data projectsnaren't even profitable,,and I have executivesncoming up to me saying,,"We're experiencing the same thing.,We invested in some big data system,,and our employees aren't makingnbetter decisions.,And they're certainly not coming upnwith more breakthrough ideas." 
 So this is all really interesting to me,,because I'm a technology ethnographer.,I study and I advise companies,on the patternsnof how people use technology,,and one of my interest areas is data.,So why is having more datannot helping us make better decisions,,especially for companiesnwho have all these resources,to invest in these big data systems?,Why isn't it getting any easier for them? 
 So, I've witnessed the struggle firsthand.,In 2009, I startedna research position with Nokia.,And at the time,,Nokia was one of the largestncell phone companies in the world,,dominating emerging marketsnlike China, Mexico and India --,all places where I had donena lot of research,on how low-income people use technology.,And I spent a lot of extra time in China,getting to know the informal economy.,So I did things like workingnas a street vendor,selling dumplings to construction workers.,Or I did fieldwork,,spending nights and daysnin internet cafés,,hanging out with Chinese youth,nso I could understand,how they were usingngames and mobile phones,and using it between movingnfrom the rural areas to the cities. 
 Through all of this qualitative evidencenthat I was gathering,,I was starting to see so clearly,that a big change was about to happennamong low-income Chinese people.,Even though they were surroundednby advertisements for luxury products,like fancy toilets --nwho wouldn't want one? --,and apartments and cars,,through my conversations with them,,I found out that the adsnthe actually enticed them the most,were the ones for iPhones,,promising them this entryninto this high-tech life.,And even when I was living with themnin urban slums like this one,,I saw people investingnover half of their monthly income,into buying a phone,,and increasingly, they were "shanzhai,",which are affordable knock-offsnof iPhones and other brands.,They're very usable.,Does the job. 
 And after years of livingnwith migrants and working with them,and just really doing everythingnthat they were doing,,I started piecingnall these data points together --,from the things that seem random,nlike me selling dumplings,,to the things that were more obvious,,like tracking how much they were spendingnon their cell phone bills.,And I was able to createnthis much more holistic picture,of what was happening.,And that's when I started to realize,that even the poorest in Chinanwould want a smartphone,,and that they would do almost anythingnto get their hands on one. 
 You have to keep in mind,,iPhones had just come out, it was 2009,,so this was, like, eight years ago,,and Androids had just startednlooking like iPhones.,And a lot of very smartnand realistic people said,,"Those smartphones -- that's just a fad.,Who wants to carry aroundnthese heavy things,where batteries drain quicklynand they break every time you drop them?",But I had a lot of data,,and I was very confidentnabout my insights,,so I was very excitednto share them with Nokia. 
 But Nokia was not convinced,,because it wasn't big data.,They said, "We havenmillions of data points,,and we don't see any indicatorsnof anyone wanting to buy a smartphone,,and your data set of 100,nas diverse as it is, is too weak,for us to even take seriously.",And I said, "Nokia, you're right.,Of course you wouldn't see this,,because you're sending out surveysnassuming that people don't know,what a smartphone is,,so of course you're not goingnto get any data back,about people wanting to buyna smartphone in two years.,Your surveys, your methodsnhave been designed,to optimize an existing business model,,and I'm lookingnat these emergent human dynamics,that haven't happened yet.,We're looking outside of market dynamics,so that we can get ahead of it.",Well, you know what happened to Nokia?,Their business fell off a cliff.,This -- this is the costnof missing something.,It was unfathomable. 
 But Nokia's not alone.,I see organizationsnthrowing out data all the time,because it didn't come from a quant model,or it doesn't fit in one.,But it's not big data's fault.,It's the way we use big data;nit's our responsibility.,Big data's reputation for success,comes from quantifyingnvery specific environments,,like electricity power gridsnor delivery logistics or genetic code,,when we're quantifying in systemsnthat are more or less contained. 
 But not all systemsnare as neatly contained.,When you're quantifyingnand systems are more dynamic,,especially systemsnthat involve human beings,,forces are complex and unpredictable,,and these are thingsnthat we don't know how to model so well.,Once you predict somethingnabout human behavior,,new factors emerge,,because conditionsnare constantly changing.,That's why it's a never-ending cycle.,You think you know something,,and then something unknownnenters the picture.,And that's why just relyingnon big data alone,increases the chancenthat we'll miss something,,while giving us this illusionnthat we already know everything. 
 And what makes it really hardnto see this paradox,and even wrap our brains around it,is that we have this thingnthat I call the quantification bias,,which is the unconscious beliefnof valuing the measurable,over the immeasurable.,And we often experience this at our work.,Maybe we work alongsidencolleagues who are like this,,or even our whole entirencompany may be like this,,where people becomenso fixated on that number,,that they can't see anythingnoutside of it,,even when you present them evidencenright in front of their face.,And this is a very appealing message,,because there's nothingnwrong with quantifying;,it's actually very satisfying.,I get a great sense of comfortnfrom looking at an Excel spreadsheet,,even very simple ones. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's just kind of like,,"Yes! The formula worked. It's all OK.nEverything is under control." 
 But the problem is,that quantifying is addictive.,And when we forget that,and when we don't have somethingnto kind of keep that in check,,it's very easy to just throw out data,because it can't be expressednas a numerical value.,It's very easy just to slipninto silver-bullet thinking,,as if some simple solution existed.,Because this is a great moment of dangernfor any organization,,because oftentimes,nthe future we need to predict --,it isn't in that haystack,,but it's that tornadonthat's bearing down on us,outside of the barn.,There is no greater risk,than being blind to the unknown.,It can cause you to makenthe wrong decisions.,It can cause you to miss something big. 
 But we don't have to go down this path.,It turns out that the oraclenof ancient Greece,holds the secret keynthat shows us the path forward.,Now, recent geological research has shown,that the Temple of Apollo,nwhere the most famous oracle sat,,was actually builtnover two earthquake faults.,And these faults would releasenthese petrochemical fumes,from underneath the Earth's crust,,and the oracle literally satnright above these faults,,inhaling enormous amountsnof ethylene gas, these fissures. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's true. 
 (Laughter),It's all true, and that's what made hernbabble and hallucinate,and go into this trance-like state.,She was high as a kite! 
 (Laughter) 
 So how did anyone --,How did anyone getnany useful advice out of her,in this state?,Well, you see those peoplensurrounding the oracle?,You see those people holding her up,,because she's, like, a little woozy?,And you see that guynon your left-hand side,holding the orange notebook?,Well, those were the temple guides,,and they worked hand in handnwith the oracle.,When inquisitors would comenand get on their knees,,that's when the temple guidesnwould get to work,,because after they asked her questions,,they would observe their emotional state,,and then they would ask themnfollow-up questions,,like, "Why do you want to knownthis prophecy? Who are you?,What are you going to donwith this information?",And then the temple guides would takenthis more ethnographic,,this more qualitative information,,and interpret the oracle's babblings.,So the oracle didn't stand alone,,and neither should our big data systems. 
 Now to be clear,,I'm not saying that big data systemsnare huffing ethylene gas,,or that they're even givingninvalid predictions.,The total opposite.,But what I am saying,is that in the same waynthat the oracle needed her temple guides,,our big data systems need them, too.,They need people like ethnographersnand user researchers,who can gather what I call thick data.,This is precious data from humans,,like stories, emotions and interactionsnthat cannot be quantified.,It's the kind of datanthat I collected for Nokia,that comes in in the formnof a very small sample size,,but delivers incredible depth of meaning. 
 And what makes it so thick and meaty,is the experience of understandingnthe human narrative.,And that's what helps to seenwhat's missing in our models.,Thick data grounds our business questionsnin human questions,,and that's why integratingnbig and thick data,forms a more complete picture.,Big data is able to offerninsights at scale,and leverage the bestnof machine intelligence,,whereas thick data can help usnrescue the context loss,that comes from making big data usable,,and leverage the bestnof human intelligence.,And when you actually integrate the two,nthat's when things get really fun,,because then you're no longernjust working with data,you've already collected.,You get to also work with datanthat hasn't been collected.,You get to ask questions about why:,Why is this happening? 
 Now, when Netflix did this,,they unlocked a whole new waynto transform their business.,Netflix is known for their really greatnrecommendation algorithm,,and they had this $1 million prizenfor anyone who could improve it.,And there were winners.,But Netflix discoverednthe improvements were only incremental.,So to really find out what was going on,,they hired an ethnographer,nGrant McCracken,,to gather thick data insights.,And what he discovered was somethingnthat they hadn't seen initially,in the quantitative data.,He discovered that people lovednto binge-watch.,In fact, people didn't evennfeel guilty about it.,They enjoyed it. 
 (Laughter) 
 So Netflix was like,n"Oh. This is a new insight.",So they went to their data science team,,and they were able to scalenthis big data insight,in with their quantitative data.,And once they verified itnand validated it,,Netflix decided to do somethingnvery simple but impactful.,They said, instead of offeringnthe same show from different genres,or more of the different showsnfrom similar users,,we'll just offer more of the same show.,We'll make it easiernfor you to binge-watch.,And they didn't stop there.,They did all these things,to redesign their entirenviewer experience,,to really encourage binge-watching.,It's why people and friends disappearnfor whole weekends at a time,,catching up on showsnlike "Master of None.",By integrating big data and thick data,nthey not only improved their business,,but they transformed how we consume media.,And now their stocks are projectednto double in the next few years. 
 But this isn't just aboutnwatching more videos,or selling more smartphones.,For some, integrating thick dataninsights into the algorithm,could mean life or death,,especially for the marginalized.,All around the country,npolice departments are using big data,for predictive policing,,to set bond amountsnand sentencing recommendations,in ways that reinforce existing biases.,NSA's Skynet machine learning algorithm,has possibly aided in the deathsnof thousands of civilians in Pakistan,from misreading cellular device metadata.,As all of our lives become more automated,,from automobiles to health insurancenor to employment,,it is likely that all of us,will be impactednby the quantification bias. 
 Now, the good newsnis that we've come a long way,from huffing ethylene gasnto make predictions.,We have better tools,nso let's just use them better.,Let's integrate the big datanwith the thick data.,Let's bring our temple guidesnwith the oracles,,and whether this work happensnin companies or nonprofits,or government or even in the software,,all of it matters,,because that meansnwe're collectively committed,to making better data,,better algorithms, better outputs,and better decisions.,This is how we'll avoidnmissing that something. 
 (Applause)This picture,is from my metro card,when I spent a year abroad in Parisnin college in the mid-'90s.,My friend says I looknlike a French anarchist -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But this is still what I see,when I look in the mirror in the morning.,Within a month of living in Paris,nI'd lost 15 pounds,and I was in the best shape of my life,because I was eating fresh food,and I was walking wherever I went. 
 Having grown up in suburban Atlanta,,a region built largelynby highways and automobiles,and with a reputationnas a poster child for sprawl,,Paris fundamentally changednthe way I understood,the construction of the world around me,,and I got obsessed with the rolenof infrastructure --,that it's not just the way to move peoplenfrom point A to point B,,it's not just the way to convey waternor sewage or energy,,but it's the foundation for our economy.,It's the foundation for our social lifenand for our culture,,and it really mattersnto the way that we live. 
 When I came home,nI was instantly frustrated,,stuck in traffic as I crossednthe top end of our perimeter highway.,Not only was I not moving a muscle,,I had no social interaction,with the hundreds of thousands of peoplenthat were hurtling past me,,like me, with their eyes faced forwardnand their music blaring.,I wondered if this wasnan inevitable outcome,,or could we do something about it.,Was it possible to transformnthis condition in Atlanta,into the kind of placenthat I wanted to live in? 
 I went back to grad schoolnin architecture and city planning,,developed this interest in infrastructure,,and in 1999 came up with an idea,for my thesis project:,the adaptation of an obsolete loopnof old railroad circling downtown,as a new infrastructurenfor urban revitalization.,It was just an idea.,I never thoughtnwe would actually build it.,But I went to worknat an architecture firm,,and eventually talkednto my coworkers about it,,and they loved the idea.,And as we started talkingnto more people about it,,more people wanted to hear about it. 
 In the summer of 2001,,we connected with Cathy Woolard,,who was soon electedncity council president.,And we built a citywide visionnaround this idea:,the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop,of transit and trails and transformation.,I was doing two and three meetings a weeknfor two and a half years,,and so was Cathy and her staffnand a handful of volunteers.,Together, we built this amazing movementnof people and ideas.,It included community advocatesnwho were used to fighting against things,,but found the Atlanta BeltLinenas something that they could fight for;,developers who saw the opportunity,to take advantage of a lotnof new growth in the city;,and dozens of nonprofit partnersnwho saw their mission,at least partly accomplishednby the shared vision. 
 Now, usually these groups of peoplenaren't at the same table,wanting the same outcome.,But there we were,nand it was kind of weird,,but it was really, really powerful.,The people of Atlantanfell in love with a vision,that was better than what they sawnthrough their car windshields,,and the people of Atlanta made it happen,,and I guarantee you we would notnbe building it otherwise. 
 From the beginning,nour coalition was diverse.,People of all stripesnwere part of our story.,People on the lower endnof the economic spectrum loved it, too.,They were just afraidnthey weren't going to be able to be there,when it got built,nthat they'd be priced out.,And we've all heardnthat kind of story before, right?,But we promised thatnthe Atlanta BeltLine would be different,,and people took ownership of the idea,,and they made it betternthan anything we ever imagined,in the beginning,,including significantnsubsidies for housing,,new parks, art, an arboretum --na list that continues to grow.,And we put in place,the organizations and agenciesnthat were required to make it happen.,And importantly, it is. 
 Now we're in the early stagesnof implementation, and it's working.,The first mainline sectionnof trail was opened in 2012,,and it's already generatednover three billion dollars,of private-sector investment.,But it's not only changingnthe physical form of the city,,it's changing the waynwe think about the city,,and what our expectations arenfor living there.,About a month ago,,I had to take my kids with mento the grocery store,and they were complaining about it,,because they didn't wantnto get in the car.,They were saying, "Dad, if we have to go,,can we at least ride our bikes?",And I said, "Of course we can.,That's what people in Atlanta do.,We ride our bikes to the grocery store." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, yeah. 
 Now, they don't knownhow ridiculous that is,,but I do.,And I also understandnthat their expectations for Atlanta,are really powerful. 
 This kind of transformationnis exactly like sprawl,in the last century,,the movement where our investmentnin highways and automobiles,fundamentally changed American life.,That wasn't some grand conspiracy.,There were conspiraciesnwithin it, of course.,But it was a cultural momentum.,It was millions of peoplenmaking millions of decisions,over an extended period of time,,that fundamentally changednnot only the way that we build cities,,but it changed our expectations,for our lives.,These changes were the foundationsnfor urban sprawl.,We didn't call it sprawl at that time.,We called it the future.,And it was.,And we got all the highwaysnand strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted. 
 It was a radical transformation,,but it was built by a cultural momentum.,So it's important to not separate,the physical constructionnof the places we live,from other things thatnare happening at that time.,At that time,,in the second half of the last century,,science was curing disease,and lifting us to the moon,,and the sexual revolutionnwas breaking down barriers,,and the Civil Rights Movementnbegan its march,toward the fulfillmentnof our nation's promise.,Television, entertainment, food, travel,nbusiness -- everything was changing,,and both the publicnand private sectors were colluding,to give us the lives we wanted.,The Federal Highway Administration,,for example, didn't existnbefore there were highways.,Think about it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, today it's importantnto understand and acknowledge,that those benefits accruednto some groups of people,and not to others.,It was not an equitable cultural momentum.,But when we look todaynin wonder and disgust, maybe,,at the metropolis sprawl before us,,we wonder if we're stuck.,Are we stuck with the legacynof that inequity?,Are we stuck with this dystopianntraffic hellscape?,Are we stuck with rampantnurban displacement,,with environmental degradation?,Are we stuck with social isolation,or political polarization?,Are these the inevitablenand permanent outcomes?,Or are they the resultnof our collective cultural decisions,that we've made for ourselves?,And if they are,,can't we change them? 
 What I have learnednfrom our experience in Atlanta,is not an anomaly.,Similar storiesnare playing out everywhere,,where people are reclaimingnnot only old railroads,,but also degraded urban waterwaysnand obsolete roadways,,reinventing all of the infrastructure,in their lives.,Whether here in New York,or in Houston,or Miami,,Detroit, Philadelphia,,Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore,,Toronto and Paris,,cities big and small all over the worldnare reclaiming and reinventing,this infrastructure for themselves,,including the mothernof all catalyst infrastructure projects,,the Los Angeles River,,the revitalization effortnfor which similarly started,as a grassroots movement,,has developed into a cultural momentum,,and is now in the early stagesnof being transformed,into some kind of life-affirmingninfrastructure again,,this one with trails and parksnand fishing and boating,and community revitalization,,and of course, water qualitynand flood control.,It's already improvingnthe lives of people.,It's already changing the waynthe rest of us think about Los Angeles. 
 This is more than just infrastructure.,We're building new lives for ourselves.,It's a movement that includesnlocal food, urban agriculture,,craft beer, the maker movement,,tech and design -- all of these things,nearly indicators of a really radical shift,in the way we build cities.,We're taking places like this,and transforming them into this.,And soon this. 
 And this is all exciting and good.,We're changing the world for the better.,Good for us!,And it is awesome -- I mean that.,But our history of sprawl,,and from what we can already seenwith these catalyst projects today,,we know and must remember,that big changes like thisndon't usually benefit everyone.,The market forces unleashednby this cultural momentum,often include the seemingly unstoppable,and inevitable cycle of rising taxes,nprices and rents. 
 This is urgent.,If we care, we have to stand up,and speak out.,This should be a call to action,,because the answer can't bento not improve communities.,The answer can't be to not build parksnand transit and grocery stores.,The answer can't bento hold communities down,just to keep them affordable.,But we do have to follow throughnand address the financial realities,that we're facing.,This is hard, and it won'tnhappen on its own.,We can do it, and I'm committednto this goal in Atlanta,,to sticking up again for peoplenwho made it possible in the first place.,We can't call it a success without them.,I certainly can't,,because the people I madencommitments to all those years,weren't abstract populations.,They're my friends and neighbors.,They're people that I love. 
 So even though it startednas my graduate thesis,and I'm working hard for 16 yearsnwith thousands of people,to help make this thing come to life,,I know and believe that whonthe BeltLine is being built for,is just as importantnas whether it's built at all.,Not just in Atlanta,,but locally and globally,,we have to understand,this accountability to the peoplenwhose lives we are changing,,because this is us.,We are the lives we're talking about.,These places aren't inevitable.,The places we live aren't inevitable,,and if we want something different,nwe just need to speak up.,We have to ensure that changencomes on our terms.,And to do that,,we have to participate activelynin the process of shaping change. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Are you tired of your boss? 
 (Laughter) 
 Are you tired of going to work,and making money for other people?,And who are those people anyways?,Those people that makenmoney from your work.,Well, they're capitalists.,They have capital,,and they use your labornto make more capital.,So if you're tired of going to work,and making money for other people,,then you're probably like me --,just tired of capitalism.,Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist. 
 (Laughter) 
 I own a small business --,Rco Tires in Compton.,A few years ago, when I read Van Jones,,and he wrote, "Let's makengreen collar jobs in the hood,",I took him really seriously.,So I cofounded, own and operatena tire recycling company,,and I'm really proud of what we've done.,So far, we've recycledna hundred million pounds of rubber.,That's 21 million gallons of oilndiverted from landfills,into new products. 
 (Cheers) 
 We also employ about 15 guys --,mostly people of color,,most of whom are felons,,and we pay above the minimum wage,,and we are now proud membersnof the United Steelworkers Union. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, Rco is not a cooperative now.,It's a privately held companynwith community-minded ownership,,but I would like it to become one.,I would like for them to fire the boss --,that's me. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm going to tell you why,,but first, let me tell younhow we got started.,So a lot of people ask,,"How did Rco come to be?",And I have to be really honest.,I leveraged my white privilege.,So, here's how white privilegenworked for me and Rco.,My white grandmothernwas born on her family's plantation,in Arkansas in 1918.,She traveled with her white father west,,following the oil boom.,And he held various union oil jobs --,jobs which would have never been givennto my black great-grandfather,,had he lived here at the time.,Granny became a hairdresser,and then got a loan with her husband,who built their homenin West Los Angeles --,a loan which would never have beenngiven to a black family at the time.,And after my grandfather passed away,,my granny was able to keep that house,because she had his pensionnand his health care,from a state job which he held,,which again, would have never beenngiven to a black man,before the anti-discriminationnact of the 1960s. 
 So, you fast-forward 30 years,,and I graduate,,and I want to start my own business,with a pile of debt and a credit card,,and no experience in the tire industry.,But I had what most people didn't have.,I had a clean, safe, free place to live.,I moved in with my grandmother,,and I was able to rentnour first warehouse,,buy our first truck,,pay our first employees,,because I didn't have to worrynabout paying myself,,because I didn't need to feed myself,,because I am the direct beneficiarynof generations of white privilege. 
 Now, telling the storynof white privilege is important,because very often people say,,"Oh, we want more companies like yours.,We want more Rco's,,we want more black-owned businesses,,female-led, triple bottom line,,Ban the Box,,green manufacturing companies," right?,But the question we have to ask is,nwhere is the wealth?,Where is the money?,Where's the capital in our communities,to build the typesnof businesses that we want? 
 And in telling a storynof the white side of my family,,I needed a dozen ways,where blacks were excludednfrom the economy,,whereas the white side of my familynwas able to gain access and traction,,and build wealth ...,Primarily because racismnand capitalism are best homies, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but what that meansnis that when we ask ourselves,,"Why are our communities broke?" --,Like, we're not just brokenbecause we're broke;,we're broke for a reason.,Historical context really does matter. 
 But our historyntells another story as well.,There's this incredible bookncalled "Collective Courage,",which is the story of hownthousands of African Americans,have been able to buildnbusinesses and schools,,hospitals, farming cooperatives,,banks, financial institutions --,entire communitiesnand sovereign economies,,without a lot of capital.,And they did it by working together,and leveraging their community assets,and trusting each other,and putting solidarity first --,not just profits by any means necessary.,And they didn't have to wait aroundnfor celebrities and athletes,to bring their money back to the hood.,However, if you arena celebrity or an athlete,,and you're listening to this,,please feel free to bring your money. 
 (Laughter) 
 But they did itnthrough cooperative economics,,because they knew,that capitalism was neverngoing to finance black liberation.,So, there are so many greatnexamples in this book,,and I suggest that everybody just read it,because it answersnthe question I asked earlier,,which was where are we goingnto get the wealth,to build the typesnof business that we want.,And the answer is going to havento be cooperative economics. 
 There's a lot of differentnversions of cooperativism.,What I'm talking about todaynis worker ownership.,You may not have heardnof worker ownership,,but it's been an incredible tool,for black economic liberationnfor a century,,and it's also workingnall over the world right now.,You may have heard of Black Wall Street,or maybe the Zapatistas,,but I'll give you an examplenthat's a little bit closer to home.,Right now, today, in South Bronx,,is the country's largestnworker-owned company.,It's called CooperativenHome Care Associates,,and it was founded by blacknand Latinx home care workers,who are now ablento pay themselves living wages,,they have full-time hours,,they have benefits and a pension,,through their membershipnas a unit of SEIU.,And these women owners now receivena dividend back on their ownership,every year that the companynhas been profitable,,which has been most years.,So they're able to really enjoynthe fruits of their labor,because they fired the boss.,They don't have any big investors.,They don't have fat-cat CEOs,or absentee owners takingnthe profit out of the company.,They each pay innabout 1,000 dollars over time,in order to gain ownership,,and now they own their job. 
 Now, there's hundreds of more examplesnof companies like this,springing up all across the country.,And I'm so inspired by what they're doing,,because it really representsnan alternative,to the type of economy we have now,,which exploits all of us.,It also represents an alternative,to waiting around for big investorsnto bring chain stores,,or big-box stores to our communities,,because honestly,nthose types of developments,,they steal resources from our communities.,They put our mom-and-pop shopsnout of business,,they make our entrepreneursninto wage workers,,and they take money out of our pocket,and send it to their shareholders. 
 So, I was so inspired by all these storiesnof resistance and resilience,that I got together with a few peoplenhere in Los Angeles,,and we created LUCI.,LUCI stands for the Los AngelesnUnion Cooperative Initiative,,and our objective is to createnmore worker-owned businesses,here in Los Angeles.,So far, in the last year,nwe've created two:,Pacific Electric, an electrical company,,and Vermont Gage Carwash,,which is right here in South-Central,,some of you guysnmight be familiar with it.,This long-time carwash is now ownednand operated by its 20 workers,,all of whom are union members as well. 
 (Applause) 
 So you might be wonderingnwhy the focus on union-worker ownership,,but there's a lot of good reasons,why the labor movement is a natural allynto the worker-ownership movement.,To build these companiesnthat we want in our community,,we need a few things.,We're going to need money,npeople and training.,Unions have all of those things.,America's working class has beennpaying union dues for decades,,and with it, our unions have been building,dignified, decent,nand democratic workplaces for us.,However, union jobsnare on the steep decline,,and it's time for us to startncalling on our unions,to really bring all of their financialnand political capital,to bear in the creation of new,nunion, living-wage jobs,in our communities.,Also, union hallsnare full of union members,who understandnthe importance of solidarity,and the power of collective action.,These are the types of folks that wantnmore union businesses to exist,,so let's build them with them. 
 Learning from our unions,,learning from our past,,learning from our peers,,are all going to be verynimportant to our success,,which is why I'd like to leave younwith one last example,and a vision for the future ...,and that vision is Mondragon, Spain.,Mondragon, Spain is a communitynbuilt entirely around worker cooperatives.,There's 260-plus businesses here,,manufacturing everything from bicyclesnto washing machines to transformers.,And this group of businessesnnow employs 80,000 people,and earns more than 12 billion eurosnin revenue every year.,And all of the companies therenare owned by the people that work in them.,They've also built universitiesnand hospitals and financial institutions.,I mean, imagine if we could buildnsomething like this in South-Central.,The late mayor of Jacksonnhad a similar idea.,He wanted to turn his entire cityninto a Mondragon-like cooperative economy,,calling his ambitious plann"Jackson Rising." 
 And when I look at Mondragon,,I see really what working-class peoplencan do for ourselves,when we work together,and make decisionsnfor ourselves and each other,and our communities.,And what's really incrediblenabout Mondragon,is that while we are dreaming about them,,they are dreaming about us.,This community in Spain has decidednto launch an international initiative,to create more communitiesnlike it all over the world,,by linking up with unions,,by supporting organizations like LUCI,,and by educating folksnabout the worker-ownership model. 
 Now, here's what you can donto be a part of it.,If you're a union member,ngo to your union meetings,,and make sure that your unionnhas a worker-ownership initiative,,and become a part of it.,If you're an entrepreneur,,if you have a small business,,or you're interested in starting one,,then link up with LUCInor another organization like us,to help you get startednon the cooperative model.,If you're a politician,,or you work for one,,or you just like talking to them,,please get the city, state, federalnand county legislation passed,that we need in order to fundnand support worker-owned businesses. 
 And for everybody else,,learn about our history,nlearn about our models,,and seek us out so can support us,,you can buy from us, invest in us,nlend to us and join us,,because it's reallyngoing to take all of us,in order to build the more justnand sustainable and resilient economy,that we want for ourselvesnand our children. 
 And with that,,I would like to leave younwith a quote from Arundhati Roy,,and she writes ...,"Our strategy should not be onlynto confront Empire,,but to lay siege to it.,To deprive it of oxygen.,To mock it.,To shame it.,With our art,,our literature,,our music,,our brilliance,,our joy,,our sheer relentlessness --,and our ability to tell our own stories.,Not the stories that we're beingnbrainwashed to believe.,The corporate revolution will collapse,if we refuse to buynwhat they're selling --,their ideas,,their version of history,,their wars,,their weapons,,their sense of inevitability.,Because know this:,They be few and we be many.,They need us more than we need them.,Another world is not only possible,,she's on her way.,And on a quiet day,,I can hear her breathing." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We're going to sharena lot of secrets today, you and I,,and in doing so, I hope that we can lift,some of the shamenmany of us feel about sex. 
 How many here have ever beenncatcalled by a stranger?,Lots of women.,For me, the time I remember best,is when that strangernwas a student of mine.,He came up to me after class that night,and his words confirmednwhat I already knew: 
 "I am so sorry, professor.,If I had known it was you,nI would never have said those things." 
 (Laughter) 
 I wasn't a person to himnuntil I was his professor.,This concept, called objectification,,is the foundation of sexism,,and we see it reinforcednthrough every aspect of our lives.,We see it in the government,that refuses to punish men,for raping women.,We see it in advertisements.,How many of you have seen an advertisement,that uses a woman's breastnto sell an entirely unrelated product?,Or movie after movie after movie,that portrays womennas only love interests?,These examples might seemninconsequential and harmless,,but they're insidious,,slowly building into a culturenthat refuses to see women as people.,We see this in the schoolnthat sends home a 10-year-old girl,because her clothes werena distraction to boys trying to learn,,or the government that refusesnto punish men for raping women,over and over,,or the woman who is killed,because she asked a man to stopngrinding on her on the dance floor. 
 Media plays a large role in perpetuatingnthe objectification of women.,Let's considernthe classic romantic comedy.,We're typically introducednto two kinds of women in these movies,,two kinds of desirable women, anyway.,The first is the sexy bombshell.,This is the unbelievably gorgeous womannwith the perfect body.,Our leading mannhas no trouble identifying her,and even less trouble having sex with her.,The second is our leading lady,,the beautiful but demure womannour leading man falls in love with,despite not noticing her at first,or not liking her if he did.,The first is the slut.,She is to be consumed and forgotten.,She is much too available.,The second is desirable but modest,,and therefore worthynof our leading man's future babies.,Marriage material.,We're actually toldnthat women have two roles,,but these two roles have a difficult timenexisting within the same woman. 
 On the rare occasionnthat I share with a new acquaintance,that I study sex,,if they don't endnthe conversation right then,,they're usually pretty intrigued. 
 "Oh. Tell me more." 
 So I do. 
 "I'm really interestednin studying the sexual behaviors,of pregnant and postpartum couples.",At this point I getna different kind of response. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Oh. Huh.,Do pregnant people even have sex?,Have you thoughtnabout studying sexual desire,or orgasms?,That would be interesting, and sexy." 
 Tell me. What are the first wordsnthat come to mind,when you picture a pregnant woman?,I asked this questionnin a survey of over 500 adults,,and most responded with "belly" or "round",and "cute.",This didn't surprise me too much.,What else do we label as cute?,Babies. Puppies. Kittens.,The elderly. Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 When we label an adult as cute, though,,we take away a lot of their intelligence,,their complexity.,We reduce them to childlike qualities.,I also asked heterosexual men,to imagine a woman that they'renpartnered with is pregnant,,and then asked womennto imagine that they are pregnant,,and then tell menthe first words that come to mind,when they imagine having sex.,Most of the responses were negative.,"Gross.","Awkward.","Not sexy." "Odd.","Uncomfortable.","How?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Not worth the trouble."n"Not worth the risk." 
 That last one really stuck with me.,We might think that because we divorcenpregnant women and moms from sexuality,,we are removing the constraintsnof sexual objectification.,They experience less sexism. Right?,Not exactly.,What happens insteadnis a different kind of objectification.,In my efforts to explain this to others,,one conversationnled to the Venus of Willendorf,,a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumednwas a goddess of love and beauty,,hence the name Venus.,This theory was later revised, though,,when scholars notednthe sculptor's obvious focus,on the figurine's reproductive features:,large breasts,nconsidered ideal for nursing;,a round, possibly pregnant belly;,the remnants of red dye,nalluding to menstruation or birth.,They also assumed that she wasnmeant to be held or placed lying down,because her tiny feetndon't allow her to be freestanding.,She also had no face.,For this reason, it was assumednthat she was a representation of fertility,and not a portrait of a person.,She was an object.,In the history of her interpretation,,she went from objectnof ideal beauty and love,to object of reproduction. 
 I think this transition speaks more,about the scholarsnwho have interpreted her purpose,than the actual purposenof the figurine herself.,When a woman becomes pregnant,,she leaves the realmnof men's sexual desire,and slides into her reproductivenand child-rearing role.,In doing so, she also becomes,the property of the community,,considered very importantnbut only because she's pregnant. Right?,I've taken to calling thisnthe Willendorf effect,,and once again we see it reinforcednin many aspects of her life. 
 Has anyone herenever been visibly pregnant? 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. Lots of you, right?,So how many of you ever had a strangerntouch your belly during pregnancy,,maybe without even askingnyour permission first?,Or told what you can and cannot eat,by somebody who is not your doctor,nyour medical care provider?,Or asked private questionsnabout your birth plan?,And then told whynthose choices are all wrong?,Yeah, me too.,Or had a server refusento bring you a glass of wine?,This one might give you pause,nI know, but stay with me.,This is a huge secret.,It is actually safe to drinknin moderation during pregnancy.,Many of us don't know this,because doctors don't trustnpregnant women with this secret -- 
 (Laughter) 
 especially if she's less educatednor a woman of color. 
 What this tells us is,,this Willendorf effect,nit's also classist and racist.,It's present whennthe government reminds women,with every new anti-choice bill,that the contents of her uterusnare not her own,,or when an ob-gyn says,,"While it's safento have sex during pregnancy,,sometimes you never know.,Better safe than sorry, right?",She's denied basic privacynand bodily autonomy,under the guise of "be a good mother.",We don't trust hernto make her own decisions.,She's cute, remember?,When we tell women,that sexual pleasure -- excuse me. 
 When we tell women that sexnisn't worth the risk during pregnancy,,what we're telling her is thatnher sexual pleasure doesn't matter.,So what we are telling hernis that she in fact doesn't matter,,even though the needs of her fetusnare not at odds with her own needs. 
 So medical providers,,such as the American Collegenof Obstetricians and Gynecologists,have the opportunity to educatenabout the safety of sex during pregnancy.,So what do the experts say?,ACOG actually hasnno public official statement,about the safety of sex during pregnancy.,Guidance from the Mayo Clinicnis generally positive,but presented with a caveat:,"Although most women can safelynhave sex throughout pregnancy,,sometimes it's best to be cautious." 
 Some women don't wantnto have sex during pregnancy,,and that's OK.,Some women do wantnto have sex during pregnancy,,and that's OK, too.,What needs to stopnis society telling women,what they can and cannot donwith their bodies. 
 (Applause) 
 Pregnant women are not faceless,nidentity-less vessels of reproduction,who can't stand on their own two feet.,But the truth is, the real secret is,,we tell all women thatntheir sexual pleasure doesn't matter.,We refuse to even acknowledgenthat women who have sex with women,or women who don'tnwant children even exist. 
 "Oh, it's just a phase ... 
 she just needs the right mannto come along." 
 Every time a woman has sex,simply because it feels good,,it is revolutionary.,She is revolutionary.,She is pushing backnagainst society's insistence,that she exist simply for men's pleasure,or for reproduction.,A woman who prioritizesnher sexual needs is scary,,because a woman who prioritizesnher sexual needs prioritizes herself. 
 (Applause) 
 That is a woman demandingnthat she be treated as an equal.,That is a woman who insists,that you make room for hernat the table of power,,and that is the most terrifying of all,because we can't make room for her,without some of us giving upnthe extra space we hold. 
 (Applause) 
 I have one last secret for you.,I am the mother of two boys,and we could use your help.,Even though my boys hear me say regularly,that it's important for mennto recognize women as equals,and they see their father modeling this,,we need what happens in the worldnto reinforce what happens in our home.,This is not a men's problemnor a women's problem.,This is everyone's problem,,and we all play a rolenin dismantling systems of inequality.,For starters, we have gotnto stop telling women,what they can and cannot donwith their bodies. 
 (Applause) 
 This includes not treating pregnant womennlike community property.,If you don't know her,ndon't even ask to touch her belly.,You wouldn't anybody else.,Don't tell hernwhat she can and cannot eat.,Don't ask her private detailsnabout her medical decisions.,This also includes understanding,that even if you arenpersonally against abortion,,you can still fightnfor a woman's right to choose.,When it comes to women's equality,nthe two need not oppose one another.,If you're somebody who has sex with women,,prioritize her pleasure.,If you don't know how, ask.,If you have children -- 
 (Laughter) 
 have conversations about sexnas early as possible,,because kids don't look up s-e-xnin the dictionary anymore.,They look it up on the internet.,And when you're havingnthose conversations about sex,,don't center them on reproduction only.,People have sex for many reasons,,some because they want a baby,,but most of us have sexnbecause it feels good.,Admit it. 
 And regardless of whethernyou have children or not,,support comprehensive sex educationnthat doesn't shame our teenagers. 
 (Applause) 
 Nothing positive comes from shaming teens,for their sexual desires, behaviors,,other than positive STDnand pregnancy tests. 
 Every single day,nwe are all given the opportunity,to disrupt patterns of inequality.,I think we can all agreenthat it's worth the trouble to do so. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Space, the final frontier. 
 I first heard these wordsnwhen I was just six years old,,and I was completely inspired.,I wanted to explore strange new worlds.,I wanted to seek out new life.,I wanted to see everythingnthat the universe had to offer.,And those dreams, those words,nthey took me on a journey,,a journey of discovery,,through school, through university,,to do a PhD and finallynto become a professional astronomer.,Now, I learned two amazing things,,one slightly unfortunate,,when I was doing my PhD.,I learned that the reality was,I wouldn't be pilotingna starship anytime soon.,But I also learned that the universenis strange, wonderful and vast,,actually too vastnto be explored by spaceship.,And so I turned my attentionnto astronomy, to using telescopes. 
 Now, I show you before younan image of the night sky.,You might see it anywhere in the world.,And all of these stars are partnof our local galaxy, the Milky Way.,Now, if you were to gonto a darker part of the sky,,a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert,,you might see the centernof our Milky Way galaxy,spread out before you,nhundreds of billions of stars.,And it's a very beautiful image.,It's colorful.,And again, this is justna local corner of our universe.,You can see there'sna sort of strange dark dust across it.,Now, that is local dust,that's obscuring the light of the stars.,But we can do a pretty good job.,Just with our own eyes, we can explorenour little corner of the universe.,It's possible to do better.,You can use wonderful telescopesnlike the Hubble Space Telescope.,Now, astronomersnhave put together this image.,It's called the Hubble Deep Field,,and they've spent hundreds of hoursnobserving just a tiny patch of the sky,no larger than your thumbnailnheld at arm's length.,And in this image,you can see thousands of galaxies,,and we know that there must benhundreds of millions, billions of galaxies,in the entire universe,,some like our own and some very different.,So you think, OK, well,nI can continue this journey.,This is easy. I can justnuse a very powerful telescope,and just look at the sky, no problem.,It's actually really missing outnif we just do that.,Now, that's becauseneverything I've talked about so far,is just using the visible spectrum,njust the thing that your eyes can see,,and that's a tiny slice,,a tiny, tiny slicenof what the universe has to offer us.,Now, there's also two very importantnproblems with using visible light.,Not only are we missing outnon all the other processes,that are emitting other kinds of light,,but there's two issues. 
 Now, the first is that dustnthat I mentioned earlier.,The dust stops the visible lightnfrom getting to us.,So as we look deeperninto the universe, we see less light.,The dust stops it getting to us.,But there's a really strange problemnwith using visible light,in order to try and explore the universe. 
 Now take a break for a minute.,Say you're standing on a corner,na busy street corner.,There's cars going by.,An ambulance approaches.,It has a high-pitched siren. 
 (Imitates a siren passing by) 
 The siren appeared to change in pitch,as it moved towards and away from you.,The ambulance driver did not changenthe siren just to mess with you.,That was a product of your perception.,The sound waves,nas the ambulance approached,,were compressed,,and they changed higher in pitch.,As the ambulance receded,nthe sound waves were stretched,,and they sounded lower in pitch.,The same thing happens with light.,Objects moving towards us,,their light waves are compressednand they appear bluer.,Objects moving away from us,,their light waves are stretched,nand they appear redder.,So we call these effectsnblueshift and redshift. 
 Now, our universe is expanding,,so everything is moving awaynfrom everything else,,and that meansneverything appears to be red.,And oddly enough, as you looknmore deeply into the universe,,more distant objectsnare moving away further and faster,,so they appear more red.,So if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field,and we were to continuento peer deeply into the universe,just using the Hubble,,as we get to a certain distance away,,everything becomes red,,and that presents something of a problem.,Eventually, we get so far away,everything is shifted into the infrared,and we can't see anything at all. 
 So there must be a way around this.,Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey.,I wanted to explore the whole universe,,not just whatever I can see,nyou know, before the redshift kicks in.,There is a technique.,It's called radio astronomy.,Astronomers have beennusing this for decades.,It's a fantastic technique.,I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope,naffectionately known as "The Dish.",You may have seen the movie.,And radio is really brilliant.,It allows us to peer much more deeply.,It doesn't get stopped by dust,,so you can see everything in the universe,,and redshift is less of a problem,because we can build receiversnthat receive across a large band. 
 So what does Parkes see when we turn itnto the center of the Milky Way?,We should see something fantastic, right?,Well, we do see something interesting.,All that dust has gone.,As I mentioned, radio goesnstraight through dust, so not a problem.,But the view is very different.,We can see that the centernof the Milky Way is aglow,,and this isn't starlight.,This is a light callednsynchrotron radiation,,and it's formed from electronsnspiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.,So the plane is aglow with this light.,And we can also seenstrange tufts coming off of it,,and objects which don't appear to line up,with anything that we can seenwith our own eyes.,But it's hard to reallyninterpret this image,,because as you can see,nit's very low resolution.,Radio waves have a wavelength that's long,,and that makes their resolution poorer.,This image is also black and white,,so we don't really knownwhat is the color of everything in here. 
 Well, fast-forward to today.,We can build telescopes,which can get over these problems.,Now, I'm showing you here an imagenof the Murchison Radio Observatory,,a fantastic placento build radio telescopes.,It's flat, it's dry,,and most importantly, it's radio quiet:,no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing,,just very, very radio quiet,,so a perfect placento build a radio telescope.,Now, the telescope that I've beennworking on for a few years,is called the Murchison Widefield Array,,and I'm going to show youna little time lapse of it being built.,This is a group of undergraduatenand postgraduate students,located in Perth.,We call them the Student Army,,and they volunteered their timento build a radio telescope.,There's no course credit for this.,And they're putting togethernthese radio dipoles.,They just receive at low frequencies,na bit like your FM radio or your TV.,And here we are deploying themnacross the desert.,The final telescopencovers 10 square kilometers,of the Western Australian desert.,And the interesting thing is,nthere's no moving parts.,We just deploy these little antennas,essentially on chicken mesh.,It's fairly cheap.,Cables take the signals,from the antennas,and bring themnto central processing units.,And it's the size of this telescope,,the fact that we've built itnover the entire desert,that gives us a betternresolution than Parkes. 
 Now, eventually all those cablesnbring them to a unit,which sends it offnto a supercomputer here in Perth,,and that's where I come in. 
 (Sighs) 
 Radio data.,I have spent the last five years,working with very difficult,nvery interesting data,that no one had really looked at before.,I've spent a long time calibrating it,,running millions of CPU hoursnon supercomputers,and really trying to understand that data.,And with this telescope,,with this data,,we've performed a surveynof the entire southern sky,,the GaLactic and ExtragalacticnAll-sky MWA Survey,,or GLEAM, as I call it.,And I'm very excited.,This survey is just about to be published,nbut it hasn't been shown yet,,so you are literally the first people,to see this southern surveynof the entire sky.,So I'm delighted to share with younsome images from this survey. 
 Now, imagine you went to the Murchison,,you camped out underneath the stars,and you looked towards the south.,You saw the south's celestial pole,,the galaxy rising.,If I fade in the radio light,,this is what we observe with our survey.,You can see that the galactic planenis no longer dark with dust.,It's alight with synchrotron radiation,,and thousands of dots are in the sky.,Our large Magellanic Cloud,nour nearest galactic neighbor,,is orange insteadnof its more familiar blue-white. 
 So there's a lot going on in this.nLet's take a closer look.,If we look backntowards the galactic center,,where we originally saw the Parkes imagenthat I showed you earlier,,low resolution, black and white,,and we fade to the GLEAM view,,you can see the resolutionnhas gone up by a factor of a hundred.,We now have a color view of the sky,,a technicolor view.,Now, it's not a false color view.,These are real radio colors.,What I've done is I've colorednthe lowest frequencies red,and the highest frequencies blue,,and the middle ones green.,And that gives us this rainbow view.,And this isn't just false color.,The colors in this imagentell us about the physical processes,going on in the universe.,So for instance, if you looknalong the plane of the galaxy,,it's alight with synchrotron,,which is mostly reddish orange,,but if we look very closely,nwe see little blue dots.,Now, if we zoom in,,these blue dots are ionized plasma,around very bright stars,,and what happensnis that they block the red light,,so they appear blue.,And these can tell usnabout these star-forming regions,in our galaxy.,And we just see them immediately.,We look at the galaxy,nand the color tells us that they're there. 
 You can see little soap bubbles,,little circular imagesnaround the galactic plane,,and these are supernova remnants.,When a star explodes,,its outer shell is cast off,and it travels outward into spacengathering up material,,and it produces a little shell.,It's been a long-standingnmystery to astronomers,where all the supernova remnants are.,We know that there must be a lotnof high-energy electrons in the plane,to produce the synchrotronnradiation that we see,,and we think they're producednby supernova remnants,,but there don't seem to be enough.,Fortunately, GLEAM is really, reallyngood at detecting supernova remnants,,so we're hoping to havena new paper out on that soon. 
 Now, that's fine.,We've explored our little local universe,,but I wanted to go deeper,nI wanted to go further.,I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.,Well, as it happens, we can see a veryninteresting object in the top right,,and this is a local radio galaxy,,Centaurus A.,If we zoom in on this,,we can see that there arentwo huge plumes going out into space.,And if you look right in the centernbetween those two plumes,,you'll see a galaxy just like our own.,It's a spiral. It has a dust lane.,It's a normal galaxy.,But these jetsnare only visible in the radio.,If we looked in the visible,nwe wouldn't even know they were there,,and they're thousands of times largernthan the host galaxy. 
 What's going on?nWhat's producing these jets?,At the center of every galaxynthat we know about,is a supermassive black hole.,Now, black holes are invisible.nThat's why they're called that.,All you can see is the deflectionnof the light around them,,and occasionally, when a starnor a cloud of gas comes into their orbit,,it is ripped apart by tidal forces,,forming what we call an accretion disk.,The accretion disknglows brightly in the x-rays,,and huge magnetic fieldsncan launch the material into space,at nearly the speed of light.,So these jets are visible in the radio,and this is what we pick up in our survey. 
 Well, very well, so we've seennone radio galaxy. That's nice.,But if you just looknat the top of that image,,you'll see another radio galaxy.,It's a little bit smaller,nand that's just because it's further away.,OK. Two radio galaxies.,We can see this. This is fine.,Well, what about all the other dots?,Presumably those are just stars.,They're not.,They're all radio galaxies.,Every single one of the dots in this image,is a distant galaxy,,millions to billions of light-years away,with a supermassivenblack hole at its center,pushing material into spacenat nearly the speed of light.,It is mind-blowing.,And this survey is even largernthan what I've shown here.,If we zoom out tonthe full extent of the survey,,you can see I found 300,000nof these radio galaxies.,So it's truly an epic journey.,We've discovered all of these galaxies,right back to the very firstnsupermassive black holes.,I'm very proud of this,nand it will be published next week. 
 Now, that's not all.,I've explored the furthest reachesnof the galaxy with this survey,,but there's somethingneven more in this image.,Now, I'll take you right backnto the dawn of time.,When the universe formed,nit was a big bang,,which left the universenas a sea of hydrogen,,neutral hydrogen.,And when the very first starsnand galaxies switched on,,they ionized that hydrogen.,So the universe wentnfrom neutral to ionized.,That imprinted a signal all around us.,Everywhere, it pervades us,,like the Force.,Now, because that happened so long ago,,the signal was redshifted,,so now that signalnis at very low frequencies.,It's at the same frequency as my survey,,but it's so faint.,It's a billionth the sizenof any of the objects in my survey.,So our telescope may not be quitensensitive enough to pick up this signal.,However, there's a new radio telescope.,So I can't have a starship,,but I can hopefully have,one of the biggestnradio telescopes in the world.,We're building the Square Kilometre Array,na new radio telescope,,and it's going to be a thousandntimes bigger than the MWA,,a thousand times more sensitive,nand have an even better resolution.,So we should findntens of millions of galaxies.,And perhaps, deep in that signal,,I will get to look upon the very firstnstars and galaxies switching on,,the beginning of time itself. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I've been "futuring,"nwhich is a term I made up -- 
 (Laughter) 
 about three seconds ago.,I've been futuring for about 20 years,,and when I first started,nI would sit down with people,,and say, "Hey,nlet's talk 10, 20 years out.",And they'd say, "Great.",And I've been seeing that time horizon,get shorter and shorter,and shorter,,so much so that I metnwith a CEO two months ago,and I said -- we startednour initial conversation.,He goes, "I love what you do.nI want to talk about the next six months." 
 (Laughter) 
 We have a lot of problemsnthat we are facing.,These are civilizational-scale problems.,The issue though is,,we can't solve them,using the mental modelsnthat we use right now,to try and solve these problems.,Yes, a lot of greatntechnical work is being done,,but there is a problem thatnwe need to solve for a priori, before,,if we want to reallynmove the needle on those big problems.,"Short-termism.",Right? There's no marches.nThere's no bracelets.,There's no petitions that you can signnto be against short-termism.,I tried to put one up, and no one signed.,It was weird. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it prevents us from doing so much.,Short-termism, for many reasons,,has pervaded everynnook and cranny of our reality.,I just want you to take a second,and just think about an issuenthat you're thinking, working on.,It could be personal, it could be at work,or it could benmove-the-needle world stuff,,and think aboutnhow far out you tend to think,about the solution set for that. 
 Because short-termism prevents the CEO,from buying reallynexpensive safety equipment.,It'll hurt the bottom line.,So we get the Deepwater Horizon.,Short-termism prevents teachers,from spending qualitynone-on-one time with their students.,So right now in America,,a high school studentndrops out every 26 seconds.,Short-termism prevents Congress --,sorry if there's anyonenin here from Congress -- 
 (Laughter) 
 or not really that sorry -- 
 (Laughter) 
 from putting moneyninto a real infrastructure bill.,So what we getnis the I-35W bridge collapse,over the Mississippi a few years ago,,13 killed.,It wasn't always like this.nWe did the Panama Canal.,We pretty muchnhave eradicated global polio.,We did the transcontinental railroad,nthe Marshall Plan.,And it's not just big, physicalninfrastructure problems and issues.,Women's suffrage, the right to vote.,But in our short-termist time,,where everything seems to happen right now,and we can only think outnpast the next tweet or timeline post,,we get hyper-reactionary. 
 So what do we do?,We take people who are fleeingntheir war-torn country,,and we go after them.,We take low-level drug offenders,nand we put them away for life.,And then we build McMansionsnwithout even thinking,about how people are goingnto get between them and their job.,It's a quick buck. 
 Now, the reality is,nfor a lot of these problems,,there are some technical fixes,,a lot of them.,I call these technical fixesnsandbag strategies.,So you know there's a storm coming,,the levee is broken,nno one's put any money into it,,you surround your home with sandbags.,And guess what? It works.,Storm goes away,nthe water level goes down,,you get rid of the sandbags,,and you do this stormnafter storm after storm.,And here's the insidious thing.,A sandbag strategy,can get you reelected.,A sandbag strategy,can help you make your quarterly numbers. 
 Now, if we want to move forward,into a different futurenthan the one we have right now,,because I don't think we've hit --,2016 is not peak civilization. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's some more we can do.,But my argument is that unless we shiftnour mental models and our mental maps,on how we think about the short,,it's not going to happen. 
 So what I've developednis something called "longpath,",and it's a practice.,And longpath isn'tna kind of one-and-done exercise.,I'm sure everyone herenat some point has done an off-site,with a lot of Post-It notesnand whiteboards,,and you do --,no offense to the consultantsnin here who do that --,and you do a long-term plan,,and then two weeks later,neveryone forgets about it.,Right? Or a week later.nIf you're lucky, three months.,It's a practice becausenit's not necessarily a thing that you do.,It's a process where you havento revisit different ways of thinking,for every major decisionnthat you're working on.,So I want to go throughnthose three ways of thinking. 
 So the first: transgenerational thinking.,I love the philosophers:,Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.,I was raised on them.,But they all did one thing,that didn't actually seem like a big deal,until I really startednkind of looking into this.,And they all took,,as a unit of measurenfor their entire reality,of what it meant to be virtuous and good,,the single lifespan,,from birth to death.,But here's a problem with these issues:,they stack up on top of us,,because the only way we knownhow to do something good in the world,is if we do it betweennour birth and our death.,That's what we're programmed to do.,If you go to the self-help sectionnin any bookstore,,it's all about you.,Which is great,,unless you're dealingnwith some of these major issues.,And so with transgenerational thinking,,which is really kind ofntransgenerational ethics,,you're able to expandnhow you think about these problems,,what is your rolenin helping to solve them. 
 Now, this isn't something that just has tonbe done at the Security Council chamber.,It's something that you can donin a very kind of personal way.,So every once in a while, if I'm lucky,nmy wife and I like to go out to dinner,,and we have three childrennunder the age of seven.,So you can imaginenit's a very peaceful, quiet meal. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we sit down and literallynall I want to do is just eat and chill,,and my kids have a completelynand totally different idea,of what we're going to be doing.,And so my first idea,is my sandbag strategy, right?,It's to go into my pocketnand take out the iPhone,and give them "Frozen",or some other bestselling game thing.,And then I stop,and I have to kind of put onnthis transgenerational thinking cap.,I don't do this in the restaurant,nbecause it would be bizarre,,but I have to --,I did it once, and that's hownI learned it was bizarre. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you have to kind of think,n"OK, I can do this.",But what is this teaching them?,So what does it meannif I actually bring some paper,or engage with them in conversation?,It's hard. It's not easy,nand I'm making this very personal.,It's actually more traumatic,than some of the big issuesnthat I work on in the world --,entertaining my kids at dinner.,But what it does is it connects themnhere in the present with me,,but it also --,and this is the cruxnof transgenerational thinking ethics --,it sets them up to how they'rengoing to interact with their kids,and their kids and their kids. 
 Second, futures thinking.,When we think about the future,,10, 15 years out,,give me a vision of what the future is.,You don't have to give it to me,nbut think in your head.,And what you're probably going to see,is the dominant cultural lens,that dominates our thinkingnabout the future right now:,technology.,So when we think about the problems,,we always put it throughna technological lens,,a tech-centric, a techno-utopia,nand there's nothing wrong with that,,but it's something that we have tonreally think deeply about,if we're going to movenon these major issues,,because it wasn't always like this. Right?,The ancients had their way of thinking,about what the future was.,The Church definitely had their ideanof what the future could be,,and you could actually pay your wayninto that future. Right?,And luckily for humanity,,we got the scientific revolution.,From there, we got the technology,,but what has happened --,And by the way, this is not a critique.,I love technology.,Everything in my house talks back to me,,from my childrennto my speakers to everything. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we've abdicated the futurenfrom the high priests in Rome,to the high priests of Silicon Valley.,So when we think, well,nhow are we going to deal with climate,or with poverty or homelessness,,our first reaction is to think about itnthrough a technology lens.,And look, I'm not advocatingnthat we go to this guy.,I love Joel, don't get me wrong,,but I'm not saying we go to Joel.,What I'm saying is we have to rethink,our base assumption aboutnonly looking at the future in one way,,only looking at itnthrough the dominant lens.,Because our problemsnare so big and so vast,that we need to open ourselves up. 
 So that's why I do everything in my powernnot to talk about the future.,I talk about futures.,It opens the conversation again.,So when you're sitting and thinking,about how do we move forwardnon this major issue --,it could be at home,,it could be at work,,it could be again on the global stage --,don't cut yourself off from thinkingnabout something beyond technology as a fix,because we're more concernednabout technological evolution right now,than we are about moral evolution.,And unless we fix for that,,we're not going to be ablento get out of short-termism,and get to where we want to be. 
 The final, telos thinking.nThis comes from the Greek root.,Ultimate aim and ultimate purpose.,And it's really asking one question:,to what end?,When was the last timenyou asked yourself: To what end?,And when you asked yourself that,nhow far out did you go?,Because long isn't long enough anymore.,Three, five years doesn't cut it.,It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years. 
 In Homer's epic, "The Odyssey,",Odysseus had the answer to his "what end.",It was Ithaca.,It was this bold visionnof what he wanted --,to return to Penelope.,And I can tell you,nbecause of the work that I'm doing,,but also you know it intuitively --nwe have lost our Ithaca.,We have lost our "to what end,"nso we stay on this hamster wheel.,And yes, we're tryingnto solve these problems,,but what comes after we solve the problem?,And unless you define what comes after,npeople aren't going to move.,The businesses --nthis isn't just about business --,but the businesses that do consistently,nwho break out of short-termism,not surprisinglynare family-run businesses.,They're transgenerational. They're telos.nThey think about the futures.,And this is an ad for Patek Philippe.nThey're 175 years old,,and what's amazingnis that they literally embody,this kind of longpathian sensenin their brand,,because, by the way,nyou never actually own a Patek Philippe,,and I definitely won't -- 
 (Laughter) 
 unless somebody wants to justnthrow 25,000 dollars on the stage.,You merely look after itnfor the next generation. 
 So it's important that we remember,,the future, we treat it like a noun.,It's not. It's a verb.,It requires action.,It requires us to push into it.,It's not this thing that washes over us.,It's something that wenactually have total control over.,But in a short-term society,nwe end up feeling like we don't.,We feel like we're trapped.,We can push through that. 
 Now I'm getting more comfortable,in the fact that at some point,in the inevitable future,,I will die.,But because of these new waysnof thinking and doing,,both in the outside worldnand also with my family at home,,and what I'm leaving my kids,nI get more comfortable in that fact.,And it's something that a lot of usnare really uncomfortable with,,but I'm telling you,,think it through.,Apply this type of thinkingnand you can push yourself past,what's inevitablynvery, very uncomfortable. 
 And it all begins reallynwith yourself asking this question:,What is your longpath?,But I ask you, when you ask yourself that,now or tonight or behind a steering wheel,or in the boardroom or the situation room:,push past the longpath,,quick, oh, what's my longpathnthe next three years or five years?,Try and push past your own life if you can,because it makes you do thingsna little bit bigger,than you thought were possible. 
 Yes, we have huge,nhuge problems out there.,With this process, with this thinking,,I think we can make a difference.,I think you can make a difference,,and I believe in you guys. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the last couple of years,,I have produced what I calln"The Dead Mall Series,",32 short films and countingnabout dead malls.,Now, for those of you who arennot familiar with what a dead mall is,,it's basically a shopping mall,that has fallen into hard times.,So it either has few shopsnand fewer shoppers,,or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.,No sale at Penny's. 
 (Laughter) 
 I started producing this series,in early 2015,after going throughnkind of a dark period in my life,where I just didn't wantnto create films anymore.,I put my camera away,and I just stopped.,So in 2015, I decided to makena short film about the Owings Mills Mall.,Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986.,I should know becausenI was there on opening day.,I was there with my family,,along with every othernfamily in Baltimore,,and you had to drive around,for 45 minutes,just to find a parking spot.,So if you can imagine,,that's not happening at the malls today. 
 My first mall job that I had as a teenager,was at a sporting goods storencalled Herman's World of Sports.,Maybe you remember. 
 (Singing) Herman's World of Sports. 
 You guys remember that? 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.,I worked in a leather goods store,,and I also worked in a video store,,and not being one who wasnvery fond of the retail arts -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I got fired from every single job. 
 (Laughter) 
 In between these low-paying retail jobs,,I did what any normal teenager did,in the 1990s.,I shoplifted.,I'm just kidding.,I hung out with my friends at the mall. 
 (Laughter) 
 Everyone's like, "Oh my God,nwhat kind of talk is this?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Hanging out at the mall could be fun,nbut it could be really lame, too,,like sharing a cigarettenwith a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat,who has put onnblack lipstick for the night,while you're on your breaknfrom your crappy minimum wage job. 
 As I stand here today,,Owings Mills has been gutted,and it's ready for the wrecking ball.,The last time I was there,nit was in the evening,,and it was about three daysnbefore they closed the mall for good.,And you kind of felt --,they never announced the mall was closing,,but you had this sort of feeling,nthis ominous feeling,,that something big was going to happen,,like it was the end of the road.,It was a very creepy walknthrough the mall.,Let me show you. 
 (Music) 
 So when I started producingn"The Dead Mall Series,",I put the videos up onto YouTube,,and while I thought they were interesting,,frankly I didn't think othersnwould share the enthusiasm,for such a drab and depressing topic.,But apparently I was wrong,,because a lot of peoplenstarted to comment.,And at first the comments were like --,basically like, "Oh my God,nthat's the mall from my childhood.,What happened?",And then I would get commentsnfrom people who were like,,"There's a dead mall in my town.nYou should come and film it.",So I started to travel aroundnthe mid-Atlantic region,filming these dead malls.,Some were open.,Some were abandoned.,It was kind of always hardnto get into the ones that were abandoned,,but I somehow always found a way in. 
 (Laughter) 
 The malls that are still open,,they always do this weird thing --nlike the dead malls.,They'll have three stores left,,but they try to spruce it up,to make it appearnlike things are on the up-and-up.,For example,,you'll have an empty store,and they bring the gate down.,So at Owings Mills, for example,nthey put this tarp over the gate.,Right?,And it's got a stock photo,of a woman who is so happy,and she's holding a blouse,,and she's like -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And then there's a guynstanding next to her, with, like,,an espresso cup, and he's like -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And it says, "What brings you today?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I wanted to be scared and depressed.,Thank you. 
 So the comments just kept pouring in,on the videos,,from all over the country,nand then all over the world.,And I started to think,nthis could really be something,,but I had to get creative,nbecause I'm like,,how long are people going to sit and watchnme waddling through an empty mall? 
 (Laughter) 
 So the original episodesnI filmed with an iPhone.,So I'd walk through the mallnwith an iPhone, and, you know.,Like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 And security -- because malls,nthey don't like photography --,so the security would come up and be like,n"Put that away," and I'm like, "OK.",So I had to get creative and sneaky,,so I started using a hidden cameranand different techniques,to get the footage that I needed,,and basically what I wanted to do,was make the video,like it was a first-person experience,,like you are sitting --,put your headphones onnwatching the screen --,it's like, you're there in the video,,like a video game, basically. 
 I also started to use music,,collaborating with artistsnwho create music called vaporwave.,And vaporwave is a music genre,that emerged in the early 2010snamong internet communities.,Here's an example. 
 (Music) 
 That's by an artist named Disconscious,from an album he didncalled "Hologram Plaza.",So if you look that up,nyou can hear more of those tunes.,Vaporwave is more than an art form.nIt's like a movement.,It's nihilistic, it's angsty,,but it's somehow comforting.,The whole aesthetic is a way of dealingnwith things you can't do anything about,,like no jobs, or sitting in your parents'nbasement eating ramen noodles.,Vaporwave came out of this generation'sndesire to express their hopelessness,,the same way thatnthe pre-internet generation did,sitting around in the food court. 
 One of my favorite malls,I've been to,is in Corpus Christi,nand it's called the Sunrise Mall.,When I was a kid,,my favorite thing to do was watch movies,,and I used to watch moviesnover and over and over again.,And one of my favorite filmsnwas "The Legend of Billie Jean.",Now, for those of you who have seenn"The Legend of Billie Jean,",you'll know that it's a great film.,I love it.,And Helen Slater and Christian Slater --,and if you didn't know,nthey are not related.,Many people thought that theynwere brother and sister. They're not.,But anyway, Sunrise Mall was usednin the film as a filming location.,The mall is exactly the samenas it was in 1984.,We're talking 32 years later.nLet me show you. 
 (Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jeannrunning across the fountain,,being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.,And she jumps over here.,And you can see the shot right herenis what it looks like today.,It's pretty incredible.,I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.,And there they arenfalling in the fountain,,and she runs up the stairs.,This is a nice shotnof the whole thing here. 
 Dan Bell: I love that so much. 
 (Laughter) 
 I always think in my head,nif I owned a dead mall --,why don't they embrace their vintage look?,Put in a bar,,like, put vegan food in the food court,and invite millennials and hipsters,to come and drink and eat,,and I guarantee you within three weeks,H&amp;M and Levi's will be bangingnon the door trying to get space.,I don't know why they don't do this,,but apparently,,it's only in my mind, it goes all day. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, in closing -- 
 (Laughter) 
 When they first asked me to do this talk,,I said,,"Do you have the right person?" 
 (Laughter) 
 These talks are supposednto be kind of inspiring and -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I remembered something, though.,I put my camera downnthree or four years ago,,and it took going to these malls,for me to be inspired again.,And to see my audience,and people from all over the worldnwriting me and saying,,"God, I love your videos,",is incredible.,I don't know how to even explain it,,as an artist,,how fulfilling that is.,If you would have told me a year ago,that I would be standing on this stage,talking to all of you wonderful people,,I would have never believed it.,I am humbled,and so appreciative. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Twenty-eight years ago,nI was a broken man.,And you probably wouldn't be ablento tell that if you met me.,I had a good job at a well-respectednacademic institution.,I dressed well, of course.,But my insides were rotting away.,You see, I grew up in a familynriddled with addiction,,and as a kid, I also struggled,with coming to termsnwith my own sexuality.,And even though I couldn't name it then,,growing up as a gay kid,just compounded my issuesnof isolation and insecurities.,But drinking took all of that away. 
 Like many, I drank at an early age.,I continued to drinknmy way through college.,And when I finally did come outnin the early 1980s,,about the only placesnto meet other gay people,,to socialize,,to be yourself, were gay bars.,And what do you do in gay bars?,You drink.,And I did --,a lot. 
 My story is not unique.,Like millions of Americans,nmy disease progressed undiagnosed.,It took me to peoplenand places and things,that I never would have chosen.,It wasn't untilnan intersection with the law,gave me an "opportunity" to get care,,that I began my journey of recovery. 
 My journey of recoverynhas been filled with love and with joy,,but it hasn't been without pain.,Like many of you, I've lost too manynfriends and family to this disease.,I've heard too manynheartbreaking stories,of people who've lostnloved ones to addiction.,And I've also lostncountless friends to HIV and AIDS. 
 Our current opioid epidemicnand the AIDS epidemic,tragically have much in common.,Right now, we are in the midst of onenof the greatest health crises of our time.,During 2014 alone, 28,000 people,died of drug overdoses associatednwith prescription drugs and heroin.,During the 1980s, scores of peoplenwere dying from HIV and AIDS.,Public officials ignored it.,Some wouldn't even utter the words.,They didn't want treatment.,And tragically, there are many parallelsnwith our current epidemic.,Some called it the gay plague.,They called for quarantines.,They wanted to separatenthe innocent victims from the rest of us.,I was afraid we were losing this battle,because people werenblaming us for being sick.,Public policy was being held hostagenby stigma and fear,,and also held hostage,were compassion, care,nresearch, recovery and treatment. 
 But we changed all that.,Because out of the pain of those deaths,,we saw a social and political movement.,AIDS galvanized us into action;,to stand up, to speak up and to act out.,And it also galvanizednthe LGBT movement.,We knew we werenin a battle for our lives,because silence equaled death,,but we changed,nand we made things happen.,And right now, we have the potential,to see the end of HIV/AIDSnin our lifetime.,These changes came in no small part,by the courageous, yet simple decision,for people to come out,to their neighbors,nto their friends, to their families,and to their coworkers. 
 Years ago, I was a volunteernfor the Names Project.,This was an effort startednby Cleve Jones in San Francisco,to show that people who died of AIDS,had names,and faces and families,and people who loved them.,I still recall unfoldingnthe AIDS memorial quilt,on the National Mallnon a brilliant day in October, 1988. 
 So fast forward to 2015.,The Supreme Court's decision to strikendown the ban on same-sex marriage.,My husband, Dave, and I walk overnto the steps of the Supreme Court,to celebrate that decisionnwith so many other people,,and I couldn't help but thinknhow far we came around LGBT rights,and yet how far we needed to gonaround issues of addiction. 
 When I was nominatednby President Obama,to be his Director of Drug Policy,,I was very open about my recoverynand about the fact that I was a gay man.,And at no point duringnmy confirmation process --,at least that I know of --,did the fact that I was a gay manncome to bear on my candidacy,or my fitness to do this job.,But my addiction did.,At one point, a congressional staffernsaid that there was no way,that I was going to be confirmednby the United States Senate,because of my past,,despite the fact that I had beennin recovery for over 20 years,,and despite the fact,that this job takes a little bitnof knowledge around addiction. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, you know, this is the stigma,that people withnsubstance use disorders,face every single day,,and you know, I have to tell you,it's still why I'm more comfortablencoming out as a gay man,than I am as a personnwith a history of addiction. 
 Nearly every family in Americanis affected by addiction.,Yet, unfortunately, too often,nit's not talked about openly and honestly.,It's whispered about.,It's met with derision and scorn.,We hear these stories,ntime and time again, on TV, online,,we hear it from public officials,nand we hear it from family and friends.,And those of us with an addiction,nwe hear those voices,,and somehow we believe that we arenless deserving of care and treatment.,Today in the United States,nonly one in nine people,get care and treatment for their disorder.,One in nine.,Think about that. 
 Generally, people with other diseasesnget care and treatment.,If you have cancer, you get treatment,,if you have diabetes, you get treatment.,If you have a heart attack,,you get emergency services,nand you get referred to care.,But somehow people with addictionnhave to wait for treatment,or often can't get when they need it.,And left untreated, addictionnhas significant, dire consequences.,And for many peoplenthat means death or incarceration.,We've been down that road before. 
 For too long our country felt,like we could arrest our waynout of this problem.,But we know that we can't.,Decades of scientific research has shown,that this is a medical issue --,that this is a chronic medical condition,that people inheritnand that people develop. 
 So the Obama administrationnhas taken a different tack on drug policy.,We've developed and implementedna comprehensive plan,to expand prevention services,ntreatment services,,early intervention and recovery support.,We've pushed criminal justice reform.,We've knocked down barriersnto give people second chances.,We see public health and public safetynofficials working hand in hand,at the community level.,We see police chiefs across the countrynguiding people to treatment,instead of jail and incarceration.,We see law enforcementnand other first responders,reversing overdoses with naloxonento give people a second chance for care.,The Affordable Care Actnis the biggest expansion,of substance use disorderntreatment in a generation,,and it also calls for the integrationnof treatment services within primary care.,But fundamentally,nall of this work is not enough.,Unless we change the waynthat we view people with addiction,in the United States. 
 Years ago when I finallynunderstood that I had a problem,and I knew that I needed help,,I was too afraid to ask for it.,I felt that people would thinknI was stupid, that I was weak-willed,,that I was morally flawed.,But I talk about my recoverynbecause I want to make change.,I want us to see that we need to be opennand candid about who we are,and what we can do.,I am public about my own recovery,not to be self-congratulatory.,I am open about my own recoverynto change public opinion,,to change public policy,and to change the course of this epidemicnand empower the millions of Americans,who struggle with this journey,to be open and candidnabout who they are.,People are more than their disease.,And all of us have the opportunitynto change public opinion,and to change public policy. 
 All of us know someonenwho has an addiction,,and all of us can do our part,to change how we view peoplenwith addiction in the United States.,So when you seensomeone with an addiction,,don't think of a drunk or a junkienor an addict or an abuser --,see a person;,offer them help;,give them kindness and compassion.,And together, we can be part,of a growing movementnin the United States,to change how we viewnpeople with addiction. 
 Together we can change public policy.,We can ensure that peoplenget care when they need it,,just like any other disease.,We can be part of a growing,nunstoppable movement,to have millions of Americansnenter recovery,,and put an end to this epidemic. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Zika fever:,our newest dread disease.,What is it? Where'd it come from? 
 What do we do about it?,Well for most adults,nit's a relatively mild disease --,a little fever, a little headache,njoint pain, maybe a rash.,In fact, most people who get itndon't even know they've had it.,But the more we find outnabout the Zika virus,the more terrifying it becomes.,For example, doctorsnhave noticed an uptick,of something called Guillain-Barrénsyndrome in recent outbreaks.,In Guillain-Barré, your immune systemnattacks your nerve cells,it can partiallynor even totally paralyze you.,Fortunately, that's quite rare,nand most people recover.,But if you're pregnantnwhen you're infected,you're at risk of something terrible.,Indeed, a child with a deformed head. 
 Here's a normal baby.,Here's that infantnwith what's called microcephaly.,a brain in a head that's too small.,And there's no known cure.,It was actually doctorsnin northeastern Brazil,who first noticed, just a year ago,nafter a Zika outbreak,,that there was a peaknin the incidence of microcephaly.,It took medical doctors another year,to be sure that it was causednby the Zika virus,,but they're now sure.,And if you're a "bring onnthe evidence" type,,check out this publication. 
 So where did it come from,nand how did it get here?,And it is here.,Like many of our viruses,nit came out of Africa,,specifically the Zika forest in Uganda.,Researchers at the nearbynYellow Fever Research Institute,identified an unknown virusnin a monkey in the Zika forest,which is how it got its name.,The first human cases of Zika fever,surfaced a few years laternin Uganda-Tanzania.,The virus then spread through West Africa,and east through equatorial Asia --nPakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.,But it was still mostly in monkeysnand, of course, mosquitoes.,In fact in the 60 years between the timenit was first identified in 1947 and 2007,there were only 13 reported casesnof human Zika fever.,And then something extraordinary happenednon the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.,There was an outbreak that affectednfully 75 percent of the population.,How did it get there? By air.,Today we have two billionncommercial airline passengers.,An infected passenger can board a plane,nfly halfway around the world,before developing symptoms --nif they develop symptoms at all.,Then when they land, the local mosquitoesnbegin to bite them and spread the fever.,Zika fever then next surfacednin 2013 in French Polynesia.,By December of that year, it was beingntransmitted locally by the mosquitoes.,That led to an explosive outbreak in whichnalmost 30,000 people were affected.,From there it radiated around the Pacific.,There were outbreaks in the CooknIslands, in New Caledonia,,in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands,and almost all the way around to the coastnof South America and Easter Island.,And then, in early 2015,,there was an upsurge of casesnof a dengue-like syndrome,in the city of Natalnin northeastern Brazil.,The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika,nand it spread rapidly --,Recife down the coast, a big metropolitanncenter, soon became the epicenter.,Well people have speculated that it wasn2014 World Cup soccer fans,that brought the virus into the country.,But others have speculated that perhapsnit was Pacific Islanders,participating in championship canoe races,that were held in Rio that yearnthat brought it in. 
 Well today, this is only a year later.,The virus is being locally transmittednby mosquitoes,virtually throughout South America,nCentral America, Mexico,and the Caribbean Islands,Until this year, the manynthousands of cases,that have been diagnosed in the USnwere contracted elsewhere.,But as of this summer, it's beingntransmitted locally in Miami.,It's here. 
 So what do we do about it?,Well, preventing infection,is either about protecting peoplenor about eliminating the mosquitoes.,Let's focus on people first.,You can get vaccinated.,You can not travel to Zika areas.,Or you can cover upnand apply insect repellent.,Getting vaccinated is not an option,nbecause there isn't a vaccine yet,and there probably won't benfor a couple of years.,Staying home isn'tna foolproof protection either,because we now know thatnit can be sexually transmitted.,Covering up and applyingninsect repellent does work ... 
 until you forget. 
 (Laughter),So that leaves the mosquitoes,nand here's how we control them now:,spraying insecticides.,The protective gear is necessarynbecause these are toxic chemicals,that kill people as well as bugs.,Although it does take quite a lot morento kill a person than to kill a bug.,These are pictures fromnBrazil and Nicaragua.,But it looks the same in Miami, Florida.,And we of course can sprayninsecticides from planes.,Last summer, mosquito control officialsnin Dorchester County, South Carolina,,authorized spraying of Naled,nan insecticide,,early one morning,nas recommended by the manufacturer.,Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters,that her bee yard lookednlike it had been nuked.,Oops.,Bees are the good guys.,The citizens of Florida protested,nbut spraying continued.,Unfortunately, so did the increasenin the number of Zika fever cases.,That's because insecticidesnaren't very effective. 
 So are there any approaches that arenperhaps more effective than spraying,but with less downsidesnthan toxic chemicals?,I'm a huge fan of biological controls,,and I share that view with Rachel Carson,nauthor of "Silent Spring,",the book that is credited with startingnthe environmental movement.,In this book she tells the story,nas an example,,of how a very nasty insectnpest of livestock,was eliminated in the last century.,No one knows thatnextraordinary story today.,So Jack Block and I,nwhen we were writing an editorial,about the mosquito problem today,nretold that story.,And in capsule form, it's that pupae --nthat's the immature form of the insect --,were irradiated until they were sterile,ngrown to adulthood,and then released from planesnall over the Southwest,,the Southeast and down into Mexiconand into Central America,literally by the hundreds of millionsnfrom little airplanes,,eventually eliminatingnthat terrible insect pest,for most of the Western Hemisphere.,Our real purpose in writing this editorial,was to introduce readersnto how we can do that today --,not with radiationnbut with our knowledge of genetics.,Let me explain. 
 This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.,It's the most common insectnvector of diseases,,not just Zika but dengue,nChikungunya, West Nile virus,and that ancient plague, yellow fever.,It's an urban mosquito,,and it's the femalenthat does the dirty work.,She bites to get a blood mealnto feed her offspring.,Males don't bite; they don't evennhave the mouth parts to bite.,A little British company called Oxitecngenetically modified that mosquito,so that when it mates with a wild female,nits eggs don't develop to adulthood.,Let me show you.,This is the normal reproductive cycle.,Oxitec designed the mosquito so thatnwhen the male mates with the wild female,the eggs don't develop.,Sounds impossible?,Well let me show younjust diagrammatically how they do it.,Now this represents the nucleusnof a mosquito cell,,and that tangle in the middlenrepresents its genome,,the sum total of its genes.,Scientists added a single gene,that codes for a protein representednby this orange ball,that feeds back on itselfnto keep cranking out more of that protein.,The extra copies, however,ngo and gum up the mosquitoes' genes,,killing the organism.,To keep it alive in the laboratorynthey use a compound called tetracycline.,Tetracycline shuts off that genenand allows normal development.,They added another little wrinklenso that they could study what happens.,And that is they added a genenthat makes the insect glow under UV light,so that when they released itnthey could follow exactly how far it went,how long it livednand all of the kinds of data,for a good scientific study.,Now this is the pupal stage,nand at this stage,the females are larger than the males.,That allows them to sort themninto the males and the females,and they allow only the malesnto grow to adulthood.,And let me remind younthat males don't bite.,From there it's pretty simple.,They take beakers full of male mosquitoes,,load them into milk cartons,nand drive around the city,,releasing them guided by GPS.,Here's the mayor of a citynreleasing the first batch,of what they call the "friendly Aedes.",Now I wish I could tell younthis is an American city, but it's not.,It's Piracicaba, Brazil.,The amazing thing is that in just a year,it brought down the casesnof dengue by 91 percent.,That's better than any insecticidenspraying can do. 
 So why aren't we using this remarkablenbiological control in the US?,That's because it's a GMO:na genetically modified organism.,Notice the subtitle here saysnif the FDA would let them,they could do the same thing here,nwhen Zika arrives.,And of course it has arrived.,So now I have to tell you the short form,of the long, torturous storynof GM regulation in the US,In the US, there are three agencies thatnregulate genetically modified organisms:,the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,,the EPA, the EnvironmentalnProtection Agency,,and the USDA, US Departmentnof Agriculture.,Took these folks two yearsnto decide that it would be the FDA,that would regulate the geneticallynmodified mosquito.,And they would do it as a new animal drug,nif that makes any sense.,Took them another five years going backnand forth and back and forth,to convince the FDAnthat this would not harm people,,and it would not harm the environment.,They finally gave them, this summer,npermission to run a little test,in the Florida Keys,,where they had been invited years earliernwhen they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.,Would that it were that easy.,When the local residents heard,that there would be genetically modifiednmosquitoes tested in their community,some of them began to organize protests.,They even organized a petition onnthe internet with this cuddly logo,,which eventually accumulatednsome 160,000 signatures,And they demanded a referendum,which will be conductednin just a couple of weeks,about whether the trialsnwould be permitted at all. 
 Well it's Miami that really needsnthese better ways of controlling insects.,And there the attitudes are changing.,In fact, very recently a bipartisan groupnof more than 60 legislators,wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell,asking that she, at the Federal level,nexpedite access for Florida,to this new technology. 
 So the bottom line is this:,biological control of harmful insects,can be both more effective andnvery much more environmentally friendly,than using insecticides,nwhich are toxic chemicals.,That was true in Rachel Carson'sntime; it's true today.,What's different is that we havenenormously more information,about genetics than we had then,,and therefore more abilitynto use that information,to affect these biological controls.,And I hope that what I've donenis aroused your curiosity enough,to start your own inquiry --nnot into just GM mosquitoes,but to the other genetically modifiednorganisms that are so controversial today.,I think if you do that, and you dig downnthrough all of the misinformation,,and the marketing,on the part of the organic food industrynand the Greenpeaces,and find the science,nthe accurate science,,you'll be surprised and pleased. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, imagine that you takena 19-hour, very long drive,to Disney World,,with two kids in the back seat.,And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip,,the immutable laws of nature dictate,that you get the question:,"Are we there yet?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So you answer this questionna hundred more times, easily,,in the negative,,but you finally arrive.,You have a wonderful,nwonderful, wonderful trip.,You drive 19 long hours back home.,And when you get there,,the police are waiting on you.,They accuse you of committing a crime,that occurred while younwere away in Florida.,You tell anybody and everybodynwho will listen,,"I didn't do it!,I couldn't have done it!,I was hanging out with Mickeynand Minnie and my kids!",But no one believes you.,Ultimately, you're arrested,,you're tried,,you're convicted,and you are sentenced.,And you spend 25 years in jail,,until someone comes along and proves --,has the evidence to prove --,that you actually were in Florida,when this crime was committed.,So. 
 So, I'm a Harvard Law professor,,and the last several years,nI have worked on,winning the release of innocent people,who've been wrongfully convicted --,people like Jonathan Fleming,,who spent 24 years, eight months in jail,for a murder that was committednin Brooklyn, New York,,while he was in Disney World,with his kids.,How do we know this?,Because when he was arrested,,among his property in his back pocket,was a receipt --,time-stamped receipt,that showed that he was in Disney World.,That receipt was put in the police file,,a copy of it was putnin the prosecutor's file,,and they never gave itnto his public defender.,In fact, nobody even knew it was there.,It just sat there for 20-some-odd years.,My team looked through the file,nand we found it,,did the rest of the investigation,,and figured out someone elsencommitted the crime.,Mr. Fleming was in Disney World,,and he is now released. 
 Let me give you a little bit of context.,So about three years ago, I got a callnfrom the Brooklyn District Attorney.,He asked whether I'd be interestednin designing a program,called a "conviction review unit.",So I said yes.,A conviction review unit is essentiallyna unit in a prosecutor's office,where prosecutors look at their past cases,to determine whether or notnthey made mistakes.,Over the course of the first year,,we found about 13 wrongful convictions,,people having been in jail for decades,,and we released all of them.,It was the most in New York history.,The program is still going on,,and they're up to 21 releases now --,21 people who spentnsignificant time behind bars. 
 So let me tell you about a couple othernof the men and women,that I interacted withnin the course of this program.,One name is Roger Logan.,Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years,and wrote me a letter.,It was a simple letter; it basically said,,"Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent.nI've been framed.,Can you look at my case?",At first blush, the case seemednlike it was open and shut,,but my research had shown,that single-witness identification cases,are prone to error.,It doesn't mean he was innocent,,it just means we ought to lookna little bit closer at those cases. 
 So we did.,And the facts were relatively simple.,The eyewitness said she heard a shot,,and she ran to the next buildingnand turned around and looked,,and there was Mr. Logan.,And he was tried and convictednand in jail for 17-some-odd years.,But it was a single-witness case,nso we took a look at it.,I sent some people to the scene,nand there was an inconsistency.,And to put it politely:,Usain Bolt couldn't have runnfrom where she said she was,to the other spot.,Right?,So we knew that wasn't true.,So it still didn't meannthat he didn't do it,,but we knew something was maybe fishynabout this witness.,So we looked through the file,,a piece of paper in the filenhad a number on it.,The number indicatednthat this witness had a record.,We went back through 20 yearsnof non-digitized papers,to figure out what this record was about,,and it turned out -- it turned out --,the eyewitness was in jail,when she said she saw what she saw.,The man spent 17 years behind bars. 
 The last one is a case about two boys,,Willie Stuckey, David McCallum.,They were arrested at 15,,and their conviction was vacatedn29 years later.,Now this was a case,,once again -- first blush,nit looked open and shut.,They had confessed.,But my research showednthat juvenile confessions,without a parent present,are prone to error.,The DNA cases proved this several times. 
 So we took a close look.,We looked at the confession,,and it turned out,,there was something in the confession,that those boys could not have known.,The only people who knew itnwere police and prosecutors.,We knew what really happened;,someone told them to say this.,We don't exactly know who,,which person did,,but any rate, the confession was coerced,,we determined.,We then went back and did forensics,and did a fulsome investigation,and found that two other,,much older, different heights,ndifferent hairstyle,,two other people committed the crime,,not these two boys. 
 I actually went to court that day,,for what's called a "vacatur hearing,",where the conviction is thrown out.,I went to court; I wanted to see,Mr. McCallum walk out of there.,So I went to court,,and the judge said somethingnthat judges say all the time,,but this took on a really special meaning.,He looked up after the arguments and said,,"Mr. McCallum,",he said five beautiful words:,"You are free to go.",Can you imagine?,After just about 30 years:,"You are free to go.",And he walked out of that courtroom. 
 Unfortunately,nhis codefendant, Mr. Stuckey,,didn't get the benefit of that.,You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison,at 34 years old,,and his mother satnat counsel table in his place.,I'll never forget thisnthe rest of my life.,She just rocked at the table, saying,,"I knew my baby didn't do this.,I knew my baby didn't do this.",And her baby didn't do this.,Two other guys did it. 
 If there's anything that we've learned,nanything that I've learned,,with this conviction integrity work,,it's that justice doesn't happen.,People make justice happen.,Justice is not a thingnthat just descends from above,and makes everything right.,If it did, Mr. Stuckeynwouldn't have died in prison.,Justice is something,that people of goodwill make happen.,Justice is a decision.,Justice is a decision.,We make justice happen. 
 You know, the scary thing is,,in each of these three cases I described,,it would have only takennjust an extra minute --,an extra minute --,for someone to look through the file,and find this receipt.,Just one -- to look through the file,nfind the receipt,,give it to the public defender.,It would have taken someone just a minute,to look at the video confessionnand say, "That cannot be.",Just a minute.,And perhaps Mr. Stuckeynwould be alive today. 
 It reminds me of one of my favorite poems.,It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Maysnwould always recite,,and he called it "God's Minute.",And it goes something like this:,"I have only just a minute,,only 60 seconds in it,,forced upon me, can't refuse it,,didn't seek it, didn't choose it.,But it's up to me to use it.,I must suffer if I lose it,ngive account if I abuse it.,Just a tiny little minute,,but eternity is in it." 
 If I were to charge,each and every one of us,,I would want to say something like,,"Every day,,every day,,take just one extra minute,and do some justice.,You don't have to --,I mean, some people spendntheir careers and their lives,,like public defenders,,doing justice every day.,But in your professional lives,nwhatever you do,,take time out,to just,do some justice.,Make a colleague feel better.,If you hear something that's sexist,,don't laugh, speak up.,If someone is down, lift them up,,one extra minute each day,,and it'll be a great, great place. 
 I want to show you something.,Now, above me is a picture,of David McCallum.,This is the daynhe was released from prison.,After 30 years, he got to hug a niece,he had never been able to touch before.,And I asked him then,,I said, "What's the first thingnyou want to do?",And he said, "I just wantnto walk on the sidewalk,without anybody telling me where to go.",Wasn't bitter,,just wanted to walk on the sidewalk. 
 I spoke to Mr. McCallumnabout two weeks ago.,I went to New York.,It was on the two-year anniversary,of his release.,And we talked,,we laughed, we hugged, we cried.,And he's doing quite well.,And one of the things he saidnwhen we met with him,is that he now has dedicated his life,and his career,to ensuring that nobody elsenis locked up unjustly. 
 Justice, my friends,,is a decision. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 Roughly 43,000 years ago,,a young cave bearndied in the rolling hills,on the northwest bordernof modern day Slovenia.,A thousand years later,na mammoth died in southern Germany.,A few centuries after that,na griffon vulture also died,in the same vicinity.,And we know almost nothingnabout how these animals met their deaths,,but these different creaturesndispersed across both time and space,did share one remarkable fate.,After their deaths,na bone from each of their skeletons,was crafted by human hands,into a flute. 
 Think about that for a second.,Imagine you're a caveman,n40,000 years ago.,You've mastered fire.,You've built simple tools for hunting.,You've learned how to craftngarments from animal skins,to keep yourself warm in the winter.,What would you choose to invent next?,It seems preposterousnthat you would invent the flute,,a tool that creatednuseless vibrations in air molecules.,But that is exactlynwhat our ancestors did. 
 Now this turns outnto be surprisingly common,in the history of innovation.,Sometimes people invent things,because they want to stay alivenor feed their children,or conquer the village next door.,But just as often,,new ideas come into the world,simply because they're fun.,And here's the really strange thing:,many of those playfulnbut seemingly frivolous inventions,ended up sparkingnmomentous transformations,in science, in politics and society. 
 Take what may be the mostnimportant invention of modern times:,programmable computers.,Now, the standard story is that computersndescend from military technology,,since many of the early computersnwere designed specifically,to crack wartime codesnor calculate rocket trajectories.,But in fact, the originsnof the modern computer,are much more playful,,even musical,,than you might imagine.,The idea behind the flute,,of just pushing air through tubesnto make a sound,,was eventually modifiednto create the first organ,more than 2,000 years ago.,Someone came up with the brilliant ideanof triggering sounds,by pressing small levers with our fingers,,inventing the first musical keyboard.,Now, keyboards evolvednfrom organs to clavichords to harpsichords,to the piano,,until the middle of the 19th century,,when a bunch of inventorsnfinally hit on the idea,of using a keyboardnto trigger not sounds but letters.,In fact, the very first typewriter,was originally calledn"the writing harpsichord." 
 Flutes and music lednto even more powerful breakthroughs.,About a thousand years ago,,at the height of the Islamic Renaissance,,three brothers in Baghdadndesigned a device,that was an automated organ.,They called it "the instrumentnthat plays itself.",Now, the instrumentnwas basically a giant music box.,The organ could be trained to playnvarious songs by using instructions,encoded by placing pinsnon a rotating cylinder.,And if you wanted the machinento play a different song,,you just swapped a new cylinder innwith a different code on it.,This instrument was the first of its kind.,It was programmable. 
 Now, conceptually,nthis was a massive leap forward.,The whole idea of hardware and software,becomes thinkable for the first timenwith this invention.,And that incredibly powerful concept,didn't come to us as an instrumentnof war or of conquest,,or necessity at all.,It came from the strange delightnof watching a machine play music. 
 In fact, the idea of programmable machines,was exclusively kept alive by musicnfor about 700 years.,In the 1700s, music-making machines,became the playthingsnof the Parisian elite.,Showmen used the same coded cylinders,to control the physical movementsnof what were called automata,,an early kind of robot.,One of the most famous of those robots,was, you guessed it,nan automated flute player,designed by a brilliant French inventor,named Jacques de Vaucanson. 
 And as de Vaucansonnwas designing his robot musician,,he had another idea.,If you could program a machinento make pleasing sounds,,why not program it to weavendelightful patterns of color out of cloth?,Instead of using the pins of the cylindernto represent musical notes,,they would representnthreads with different colors.,If you wanted a new patternnfor your fabric,,you just programmed a new cylinder.,This was the first programmable loom. 
 Now, the cylinders were too expensivenand time-consuming to make,,but a half century later,,another French inventor named Jacquard,hit upon the brilliant ideanof using paper-punched cards,instead of metal cylinders.,Paper turned out to benmuch cheaper and more flexible,as a way of programming the device.,That punch card system inspirednVictorian inventor Charles Babbage,to create his analytical engine,,the first true programmable computer,ever designed.,And punch cards were usednby computer programmers,as late as the 1970s. 
 So ask yourself this question:,what really madenthe modern computer possible?,Yes, the military involvementnis an important part of the story,,but inventing a computernalso required other building blocks:,music boxes,,toy robot flute players,,harpsichord keyboards,,colorful patterns woven into fabric,,and that's just a small part of the story.,There's a long list of world-changingnideas and technologies,that came out of play:,public museums, rubber,,probability theory, the insurance business,and many more. 
 Necessity isn't alwaysnthe mother of invention.,The playful state of mindnis fundamentally exploratory,,seeking out new possibilitiesnin the world around us.,And that seekingnis why so many experiences,that started with simplendelight and amusement,eventually led usnto profound breakthroughs. 
 Now, I think this has implicationsnfor how we teach kids in school,and how we encourage innovationnin our workspaces,,but thinking about playnand delight this way,also helps us detect what's coming next.,Think about it: if you werensitting there in 1750,trying to figure outnthe big changes coming to society,in the 19th, the 20th centuries,,automated machines, computers,,artificial intelligence,,a programmable flute,entertaining the Parisian elite,would have been as powerful a cluenas anything else at the time.,It seemed like an amusement at best,,not useful in any serious way,,but it turned out to benthe beginning of a tech revolution,that would change the world. 
 You'll find the future,wherever people are having the most fun."Look at me!" 
 That phrase turned meninto an eye-contact coach.,I'm the mother of Ivan; he's 15 years old.,Ivan has autism,,he doesn't speak,,and he communicates through an iPad,,where his whole universe of wordsnexists in images. 
 He was diagnosednwhen he was two and a half.,I still remember that day painfully.,My husband and I felt really lost;,we didn't know where to begin.,There was no internet,,you couldn't Google information,,so we made those first steps,out of sheer intuition. 
 Ivan would not maintain eye contact,,he had lost the words that he did know,,and he didn't respond to his namenor to anything we asked him,,as if words were noise.,The only way I could know,what was going on with him,,what he felt,,was looking him in the eye.,But that bridge was broken. 
 How could I teach him about life?,When I did things he liked,nhe would look at me,,and we were connected.,So I dedicated myselfnto working with him on those things,,so we would have more and moreneye-contact moments.,We would spend hours and hours playing tagnwith his older sister, Alexia,,and when we said: "I caught you!",he would look around for us,,and at that moment,nI could feel he was alive. 
 We also hold a record for hours spentnin a swimming pool.,Ivan always had a passion for water.,I remember when he was two and a half,,on a rainy winter day,,I was taking him to an indoor pool,,because even on rainy daysnwe'd go swimming.,We were on the highway,nand I took the wrong exit.,He burst into tears and criedninconsolably, nonstop,,until I turned back.,Only then did he calm down. 
 How was it possiblenthat a two and a half year old,didn't respond to his own name,,yet in the middle of the rain and fog,nwhere I couldn't see anything,,he knew the exact route?,That's when I realized that Ivannhad an exceptional visual memory,,and that that would be my way in. 
 So I started takingnpictures of everything,,and teaching him what life was like,,showing it to him, picture by picture.,Even now, it's the way Ivan communicates,what he wants,,what he needs,and also what he feels. 
 But it wasn't justnIvan's eye contact that mattered.,Everyone else's did, too.,How could I make people seennot only his autism,,but see him the person,and everything he can give;,everything he can do;,the things he likes and doesn't like,,just like any one of us?,But for that, I also hadnto give of myself.,I had to have the strength to let him go,,which was extremely difficult. 
 Ivan was 11 years old,,and he went for treatmentnin a neighborhood near our house.,One afternoon,nwhile I was waiting for him,,I went into a greengrocer,,a typical neighborhood storenwith a little bit of everything.,While doing the shopping,,I started talking to Jose, the owner.,I told him about Ivan,,that he had autism,,and that I wanted him to learnnto walk down the street by himself,,without anyone holding his hand. 
 So I decided to ask Josenif Thursdays around 2pm,,Ivan could come and help him arrangenthe water bottles on the shelves,,because he loved to organize things.,And as a reward, he could buynsome chocolate cookies,,which were his favorite.,He said "yes" right away.,So that's how it went for a year:,Ivan would go to Jose's greengrocer,,help him arrange the shelvesnof water bottles,with the labels perfectlynlined up on the same side,,and he would leave happynwith his chocolate cookies. 
 Jose is not an expert in autism.,There is no need to be an expert,nor do anything heroic to include someone.,We just need to be there -- 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Really, no heroic deed --,we simply need to be close.,And if we are afraid of something,or we don't understand something,,we need to ask. 
 Let's be curious,but never indifferent.,Let's have the couragento look each other in the eye,,because by looking,,we can open a whole world to someone else. 
 (Applause) 
 (Cheers)Eight years ago, I was hauntednby an evil spirit. 
 I was 25 at the time,,and I was living in a tiny housenbehind someone else's house,in Los Angeles.,It was this guest house,nit had kind of been dilapidated,,not taken care of for a long time.,And one night, I was sitting there,and I got this really spooky feeling,,kind of the feelingnlike you're being watched.,But no one was there except my two dogs,,and they were just chewing their feet.,And I looked around. No one was there.,And I thought, OK,nit's just my imagination.,But the feeling just kept getting worse,,and I started to feelnthis pressure in my chest,,sort of like the feelingnwhen you get bad news.,But it started to sink lower and lower,and almost hurt. 
 And over the course of that week,nthis feeling got worse and worse,,and I started to become convincednthat something was there,in my little guest house, haunting me. 
 And I started to hear these sounds,,this "whoosh," kind of whisper,nlike something passing through me.,I called my best friend, Claire, and said,,"I know this is going to sound crazy,,but, um ...,I think there's a ghost in my house,nand I need to get rid of it.",And she said -- she's verynopen-minded -- and she said,,"I don't think you're crazy.,I think you just neednto do a cleansing ritual." 
 (Laughter) 
 "So get some sage and burn it,,and tell it to go away." 
 So I said, "OK,"nand I went and I bought sage.,I had never done this before,nso I set the sage on fire,,waved it about, and said, "Go away!nThis is my house! I live here.,You don't live here!",But the feeling stayed.nNothing got better.,And then I started to think,,OK, well now this thing is probablynjust laughing at me,,because it hasn't left,,and I probably just look likenthis impotent, powerless thing,that couldn't get it to go away. 
 So every day I'd come home,and you guys, this feeling got so badnthat -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now --,but I would sit there in bednand cry every night.,And the feeling on my chestngot worse and worse.,It was physically painful.,And I even went to a psychiatrist,and tried to get hernto prescribe me medicine,,and she wouldn't just becausenI don't have schizophrenia, OK. 
 (Laughter),So finally I got on the internet,nand I Googled "hauntings.",And I came upon this forumnof ghost hunters.,But these were a specialnkind of ghost hunters --,they were skeptics.,They believed that every case of ghostsnthat they had investigated so far,had been explained away by science.,And I was like, "OK, smart guys,nthis is what's happening to me,,and if you have an explanation for me,nI would love to hear it." 
 And one of them said, "OK.,Um, have you heardnof carbon monoxide poisoning?" 
 And I said, "Yeah.,Like, gas poisoning?" 
 Carbon monoxide poisoningnis when you have a gas leak,leaking into your home.,I looked it up, and the symptomsnof carbon monoxide poisoning,include a pressure on your chest,,auditory hallucinations -- whoosh --,and an unexplained feeling of dread.,So that night, I called the gas company.,I said, "I have an emergency.nI need you to come out.,I don't want to get into the story now,nbut I need you to come out." 
 (Laughter) 
 They came out. I said,n"I suspect a gas leak.",They brought their carbonnmonoxide detector,,and the man said,,"It's a really good thingnthat you called us tonight,,because you could have beenndead very soon." 
 Thirty-seven percent of Americansnbelieve in haunted houses,,and I wonder how many of themnhave been in one,and how many of them have been in danger. 
 So that haunting storynhas led me to my job.,I'm an investigator, and I'mnan investigator in two senses:,I'm an investigative journalist,,and I'm also an investigatornof the claims of the paranormal,and claims of the spiritual.,And that means a few things.,Sometimes that means that I'm pretendingnto need an exorcism,so I can get -- yes, that's right! --nso I can go to an exorcist,and see if he's using gimmicksnor psychological tricks,to try to convince someonenthat they're possessed.,Sometimes that meansnI'm going undercover in a fringe group,which I report onnfor a podcast that I co-host.,And I've done over 70 investigationsnlike this with my co-host, Ross.,I would love to tell younthat nine times out of 10, science wins,,saves the day, it's all explained.,That's not true.,The truth is, 10 times out of 10,nscience wins, it saves the day. 
 (Applause) 
 And that doesn't meannthere's no such thing as a mystery.,Of course there are mysteries,nbut a mystery is a mystery.,It is not a ghost. 
 Now, I believe there arentwo kinds of truth,,and it's taken me a while to getnto this place, but I think this is right,,so hear me out.,I think there is outer truthnand there's inner truth.,So if you say to me,,"There was a man named Jesusnand he once existed,",that's outer truth, right?,And we can go and looknat the historical record.,We can determinenwhether that seems to be true.,And I would argue,nit does seem to be true.,If you say, "Jesus rosenfrom the dead," -- ooh, trickier. 
 (Laughter) 
 I would say that's an outer-truth claim,,because he physically rose or he didn't.,I'm not going to get intonwhether he rose or he didn't,,but I would saynthat's an outer-truth claim.,It happened or it didn't happen.,But if you say, "I don't carenwhether he rose from the dead.,It's symbolically important to me,,and that metaphor is so meaningful,nso purposeful to me,,and I'm not going to trynto persuade you of it,",now you've moved itnfrom outer truth to inner truth,,from science to art.,And I think we have a tendencynto not be clear about this,,to try to move our inner truthsnto outer truths,,or to not be fair about it to each other,,and when people are telling usntheir inner truths,,to try to make them defend themnby outer-truth standards. 
 So I'm talking here about outer truth,nabout objective things.,And there was an objective realitynin my haunted house, right?,Now that I've told you about the gas leak,,I doubt a single person herenwould be like,,"I still think there was a ghost, too" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 because as soon as we haventhese scientific explanations,,we know to give up the ghost.,We use these things as stopgapsnfor things that we can't explain.,We don't believe them because of evidence;,we believe them becausenof a lack of evidence. 
 So there is a group in Los Angeles,called the IndependentnInvestigations Group, or the IIG,,and they do great work.,They'll give a $10,000 prize,to anyone who can show,nunder scientific conditions,,that they have a paranormal ability.,No one's done it yet,,but they've had a couple peoplenwho claim that they were clairaudients,,which means that they can hear voicesneither from the great beyond,or they can read minds.,And they had one personnwho was very sincere,,who believed that he could read minds.,So they set up a test with him,nand this is the way it always works.,The group says, "OK, we have a protocol,,we have a way to scientifically test this.,Do you agree with it?",The person says yes. Then they test it.,It's very important that both sides agree.,They did that, they tested him.,They said, "OK, you know what?,You weren't able to predictnwhat Lisa was thinking.,It matched up about the same as chance.,Looks like you don't have the power." 
 And that gave them the opportunity,to compassionately sit down with himnand have a very difficult discussion,,which basically amounted to,,"Hey, we know you're sincere,nand what that means is,,you do hear something in your head." 
 And that guy got to makenthe very difficult decision,,but really the life-changing decisionnabout whether to go get help.,We're actually helping peoplento make these connections,that maybe before seemed likenotherworldly explanations,,help draw us into realitynand maybe change our lives for the better. 
 Now, on the other hand,nmaybe one time it'll turn out to be true.,Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts,,and holy shit, it will be the best thing!,And every time I donone of these investigations,,I still get so excited,,and I'm like 75 into them,,and still I swear on number 76,nI'm going to be like, "This is the one!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic,nbut I hope I never lose this hope,,and I invite you to takenthis same attitude,when people sharentheir outer beliefs with you.,When talking about testable claims,,respect them enough to asknthese good questions.,Challenge and seenhow you can examine them together,,because there's this ideanthat you can't respect a belief,and still challenge it,nbut that's not true.,When we jiggle the lock,nwhen we test the claim,,we're saying, OK, I respect you,nI'm listening to what you're saying,,I'm going to test it out with you.,We've all had that experiencenwhere you're telling someone something,,and they're like, "Oh,nthat's really interesting, yeah,",you know you're being had.,But when someone says, "Really? Huh.,Sounds a little sketchy to me,nbut I'm listening,",you at least knownyou're being engaged and respected.,And that's the kind of attitudenwe should have with these claims.,That's showing someonenthat you care what they're saying.,That's respect. 
 Now, yes, most of these searchesnwill come up empty,,but that's how all of science works.,Every cure for cancer so farnhas not panned out,,but we don't stop looking,,for two reasons.,Because number one, the answer matters.,Whether it's looking at the afterlifenor the paranormal or the cure for cancer,,it all amounts to the same question:,How long will we be here? 
 And two, because looking for the truth,,being open-minded,,and being willing to be wrongnand to change your whole worldview,is awe-inspiring. 
 I still get excited at ghost storiesnevery single time.,I still consider that every groupnI join might be right,,and I hope I never lose that hope.,Let's all never lose that hope,,because searching for what's out there,helps us understand what's in here.,And also, please havena carbon monoxide detector in your home. 
 Thank you.

 This is Nina Rodríguez's Facebook profile.,This person had three different profiles,and 890 kids between 8 and 13 years oldnamong her friends list.,These are excerpts of a chatnwith one of those kids.,This is an exact copy of the chat.,It's part of the case file.,This kid started sending private photos,until his family realizednwhat was going on.,The police report and subsequentninvestigation lead them to a house.,This was the girl's bedroom.,Nina Rodríguez was actuallyna 24-year-old man,that used to do this with lots of kids. 
 Micaela Ortega was 12 years old,when she went to meetnher new Facebook friend,,also 12.,"Rochi de River," was her name.,She actually met Jonathan Luna,nwho was 26 years old.,When they finally caught him,,he confessed that he killed the girlnbecause she refused to have sex with him.,He had four Facebook profiles,and 1,700 women on his contact list;,90 percent of themnwere under 13 years old. 
 These are two differentncases of "grooming":,an adult contacts a kidnthrough the internet,,and through manipulation or lying,nleads that kid into sexual territory --,from talking about sex,to sharing private photos,,recording the kid using a webcam,or arranging an in-person meeting.,This is grooming.,This is happening, and it's on the rise.,The question is: What are we going to do?,Because, in the meantime, kids are alone.,They finish dinner, go to their rooms,,close the door,,get on their computer, their cell phones,,and get into a bar,,into a club. 
 Think for one secondnabout what I've just said:,they're in a place full of strangers,in an uninhibited environment.,The internet broke physical boundaries.,When we're alone in our bedroomnand we go online,,we're not really alone. 
 There are at least two reasonsnwhy we're not taking care of this,,or at least not in the right way.,First, we're sure that everythingnthat happens online is "virtual.",In fact, we call it "the virtual world.",If you look it up in the dictionary,,something virtual is somethingnthat seems to exist,but is not real.,And we use that wordnto talk about the internet:,something not real.,And that's the problem with grooming.,It is real.,Degenerate, perverted adultsnuse the internet to abuse boys and girls,and take advantage of, among other things,,the fact that the kids and their parentsnthink that what happens online,doesn't actually happen. 
 Several years ago,nsome colleagues and I founded an NGO,called "Argentina Cibersegura,",dedicated to raising awarenessnabout online safety.,In 2013, we attended meetingsnat the House of Legislature,to discuss a law about grooming.,I remember that a lot of people thought,that grooming was strictly a precursor,to arranging an in-person meetingnwith a kid to have sex with them.,But they didn't think about what happenednto the kids who were exposed,by talking about sexnwith an adult without knowing it,,or who shared intimate photos thinkingnonly another kid would see them,,or even worse,,who had exposed themselvesnusing their web cam.,Nobody considered that rape.,I'm sure lots of you find it odd to thinknone person can abuse another,without physical contact.,We're programmed to think that way.,I know, because I used to think that way.,I was just an IT security guy,until this happened to me. 
 At the end of 2011,,in a little town in Buenos Aires Province,,I heard about a case for the first time.,After giving a talk,,I met the parents of an 11-year-old girlnwho had been a victim of grooming.,A man had manipulated herninto masturbating in front of her web cam,,and recorded it.,And the video was on several websites.,That day, her parents asked us, in tears,,to tell them the magic formula,for how to delete those videosnfrom the internet.,It broke my heart and changed me forever,to be their last disappointment,ntelling them it was too late:,once content is online,,we've already lost control. 
 Since that day, I think about that girl,waking up in the morning,nhaving breakfast with her family,,who had seen the video,,and then walking to school, meetingnpeople that had seen her naked,,arriving to school, playing withnher friends, who had also seen her.,That was her life.,Exposed.,Of course, nobody raped her body.,But hadn't her sexuality been abused? 
 We clearly use different standardsnto measure physical and digital things.,And we get angry at social networks,because being angry with ourselvesnis more painful and more true.,And this brings usnto the second reason why,we aren't paying propernattention to this issue.,We're convinced that kidsndon't need our help,,that they "know everything"nabout technology. 
 When I was a kid,,at one point, my parents startednletting me walk to school alone.,After years of taking me by the handnand walking me to school,,one day they sat me down,,gave me the house keys,and said, "Be very careful with these;ndon't give them to anyone,,take the route we showed you,nbe at home at the time we said,,cross at the corner,nand look both ways before you cross,,and no matter what,ndon't talk to strangers.",I knew everything about walking,,and yet, there was a responsible adultnthere taking care of me.,Knowing how to do something is one thing,,knowing how to take carenof yourself is another.,Imagine this situation:,I'm 10 or 11 years old,nI wake up in the morning,,my parents toss me the keys and say,,"Seba, now you can walk to school alone.",And when I come back late,,they say, "No, you need to be homenat the time we said.",And two weeks later,,when it comes up,nthey say, "You know what?,You have to cross at the corner,nand look both ways before crossing.",And two years later, they say,,"And also, don't talk to strangers.",It sounds absurd, right? 
 We have the same absurd behaviornin relation to technology.,We give kids total access,and we see if one day, sooner or later,,they learn how to take care of themselves.,Knowing how to do something is one thing,,knowing how to take carenof yourself is another. 
 Along those same lines,nwhen we talk to parents,,they often say they don't carenabout technology and social networks.,I always rejoin that by askingnif they care about their kids.,As adults, being interestednor not in technology,is the same as being interestednor not in our kids.,The internet is part of their lives.,Technology forces us to rethinknthe relationship between adults and kids.,Education was always basednon two main concepts:,experience and knowledge.,How do we teach our kids to be safe onlinenwhen we don't have either? 
 Nowadays, we adultsnhave to guide our children,through what is often for usnunfamiliar territory --,territory much more inviting for them.,It's impossible to find an answer,without doing new things --nthings that make us uncomfortable,,things we're not used to. 
 A lot of you may think it's easy for me,,because I'm relatively young.,And it used to be that way.,Used to.,Until last year,,when I felt the weightnof my age on my shoulders,the first time I opened Snapchat. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I didn't understand a thing!,I found it unnecessary,,useless, hard to understand;,it looked like a camera!,It didn't have menu options!,It was the first time I felt the gap,that sometimes existsnbetween kids and adults.,But it was also an opportunitynto do the right thing,,to leave my comfort zone, to force myself.,I never thought I'd ever use Snapchat,,but then I asked my teenage cousinnto show me how to use it.,I also asked why she used it.,What was fun about it?,We had a really nice talk.,She showed me her Snapchat,nshe told me things,,we got closer, we laughed.,Today, I use it. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know if I do it right,,but the most important thingnis that I know it and I understand it.,The key was to overcome the initial shock,and do something new.,Something new.,Today, we have the chancento create new conversations.,What's the last app you downloaded?,Which social network do you usento contact your friends?,What kind of information do you share?,Have you ever beennapproached by strangers?,Could we have these conversationsnbetween kids and adults?,We have to force ourselvesnto do it. All of us.,Today, lots of kids are listening to us.,Sometimes when we gonto schools to give our talks,,or through social networks,,kids ask or tell us things,they haven't toldntheir parents or their teachers.,They tell us -- they don't even know us.,Those kids need to know,what the risks of being online are,,how to take care of themselves,,but also that, fundamentally,nas with almost everything else,,kids can learn this from any adult. 
 Online safety needs to bena conversation topic,in every house and everynclassroom in the country.,We did a survey this year that showednthat 15 percent of schools said,they knew of cases of groomingnin their school.,And this number is growing.,Technology changednevery aspect of our life,,including the risks we face,and how we take care of ourselves. 
 Grooming shows us thisnin the most painful way:,by involving our kids.,Are we going to do somethingnto avoid this?,The solution startsnwith something as easy as:,talking about it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What if I told you that time has a race,,a race in the contemporary waynthat we understand race,in the United States?,Typically, we talk about racenin terms of black and white issues.,In the African-American communitiesnfrom which I come,,we have a long-standingnmulti-generational joke,about what we call "CP time,",or "colored people's time.",Now, we no longer refernto African-Americans as "colored,",but this long-standing joke,about our perpetual lateness to church,,to cookouts, to family events,and even to our own funerals, remains. 
 I personally am a stickler for time.,It's almost as if my mother,nwhen I was growing up, said,,"We will not be those black people.",So we typically arrive to eventsn30 minutes early. 
 But today, I want to talk to younmore about the political nature of time,,for if time had a race,,it would be white.,White people own time. 
 I know, I know.,Making such "incendiary statements"nmakes us uncomfortable:,Haven't we moved past the pointnwhere race really matters?,Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?,Shouldn't we go aheadnwith our enlightened, progressive selves,and relegate useless concepts like racento the dustbins of history?,How will we ever get over racismnif we keep on talking about race?,Perhaps we should lock up our conceptsnof race in a time capsule,,bury them and dig them upnin a thousand years,,peer at them with the clearlynmore enlightened,,raceless versions of ourselvesnthat belong to the future.,But you see there,,that desire to mitigate the impactnof race and racism shows up,in how we attempt to manage time,,in the ways we narrate history,,in the ways we attempt to shoventhe negative truths of the present,into the past,,in the ways we attempt to arguenthat the future that we hope for,is the present in whichnwe're currently living. 
 Now, when Barack Obamanbecame President of the US in 2008,,many Americans declarednthat we were post-racial.,I'm from the academy,where we're enamorednwith being post-everything.,We're postmodern, we're post-structural,nwe're post-feminist.,"Post" has becomena simple academic appendage,that we apply to a range of terms,to mark the way we were.,But prefixes alone don't have the powernto make race and racism,a thing of the past.,The US was never "pre-race.",So to claim that we're post-race when wenhave yet to grapple with the impact,of race on black people,nLatinos or the indigenous,is disingenuous.,Just about the momentnwe were preparing to celebrate,our post-racial future,,our political conditions becamenthe most racial they've been,in the last 50 years. 
 So today, I want to offer to younthree observations,,about the past, the presentnand the future of time,,as it relates to the combatingnof racism and white dominance. 
 First: the past.,Time has a history,,and so do black people.,But we treat time as thoughnit is timeless,,as though it has always been this way,,as though it doesn't havena political history,bound up with the plundernof indigenous lands,,the genocide of indigenous people,and the stealing of Africansnfrom their homeland.,When white male European philosophers,first thought to conceptualizentime and history, one famously declared,,"[Africa] is no historicalnpart of the World.",He was essentially saying,that Africans were peoplenoutside of history,who had had no impact on time,or the march of progress. 
 This idea, that black peoplenhave had no impact on history,,is one of the foundational ideasnof white supremacy.,It's the reason that Carter G. Woodsonncreated "Negro History Week" in 1926.,It's the reason that we continuento celebrate Black History Month,in the US every February. 
 Now, we also see this idea,that black people are people eithernalternately outside of the bounds of time,or stuck in the past,,in a scenario where,nmuch as I'm doing right now,,a black person stands up and insistsnthat racism still matters,,and a person, usually white,,says to them,,"Why are you stuck in the past?,Why can't you move on?,We have a black president.,We're past all that." 
 William Faulkner famously said,,"The past is never dead.,It's not even past.",But my good friendnProfessor Kristie Dotson says,,"Our memory is longer than our lifespan.",We carry, all of us,,family and communalnhopes and dreams with us.,We don't have the luxurynof letting go of the past.,But sometimes,,our political conditions are so troubling,that we don't knownif we're living in the past,or we're living in the present.,Take, for instance,nwhen Black Lives Matter protesters,go out to protest unjust killingsnof black citizens by police,,and the pictures that emergenfrom the protest,look like they could have beenntaken 50 years ago.,The past won't let us go.,But still, let us press our wayninto the present. 
 At present, I would argue,that the racial strugglesnwe are experiencing,are clashes over time and space.,What do I mean?,Well, I've already told younthat white people own time.,Those in power dictatenthe pace of the workday.,They dictate how much moneynour time is actually worth.,And Professor George Lipsitz argues,that white people even dictatenthe pace of social inclusion.,They dictate how longnit will actually take,for minority groups to receive the rightsnthat they have been fighting for. 
 Let me loop back to the past quicklynto give you an example.,If you think aboutnthe Civil Rights Movement,and the cries of its leadersnfor "Freedom Now,",they were challenging the slow pacenof white social inclusion.,By 1965, the yearnthe Voting Rights Act was passed,,there had been a full 100 years,between the end of the Civil War,and the conferral of voting rightsnon African-American communities.,Despite the urgency of a war,,it still took a full 100 yearsnfor actual social inclusion to occur. 
 Since 2012,,conservative state legislaturesnacross the US have ramped up attempts,to roll back African-Americannvoting rights,by passing restrictive voter ID laws,and curtailing early voting opportunities.,This past July, a federal courtnstruck down North Carolina's voter ID law,saying it "... targeted African-Americansnwith surgical precision." 
 Restricting African-American inclusionnin the body politic,is a primary way that we attemptnto manage and control people,by managing and controlling time.,But another place that we seenthese time-space clashes,is in gentrifying citiesnlike Atlanta, Brooklyn,,Philadelphia, New Orleansnand Washington, DC --,places that have hadnblack populations for generations.,But now, in the namenof urban renewal and progress,,these communities are pushed out,,in service of bringing themninto the 21st century. 
 Professor Sharon Holland asked:,What happens when a personnwho exists in time,meets someone who only occupies space?,These racial struggles,are battles over thosenwho are perceived to be space-takers,and those who are perceivednto be world-makers.,Those who control the flownand thrust of history,are considered world-makersnwho own and master time.,In other words: white people.,But when Hegel famously said that Africanwas no historical part of the world,,he implied that it was merelyna voluminous land mass,taking up spacenat the bottom of the globe.,Africans were space-takers.,So today, white people continue to controlnthe flow and thrust of history,,while too often treating black peoplenas though we are merely taking up space,to which we are not entitled.,Time and the march of progressnis used to justify,a stunning degree of violencentowards our most vulnerable populations,,who, being perceived as space-takersnrather than world-makers,,are moved out of the placesnwhere they live,,in service of bringing themninto the 21st century. 
 Shortened life span according to zip codenis just one example of the ways,that time and space coherenin an unjust manner,in the lives of black people.,Children who are bornnin New Orleans zip code 70124,,which is 93 percent white,,can expect to live a full 25 years longer,than children bornnin New Orleans zip code 70112,,which is 60 percent black.,Children born in Washington, DC'snwealthy Maryland suburbs,can expect to live a full 20 years longer,than children bornnin its downtown neighborhoods. 
 Ta-Nehisi Coates argues,that, "The defining featurenof being drafted into the Black race,is the inescapable robbery of time.",We experience time discrimination,,he tells us,,not just as structural,,but as personal:,in lost moments of joy,,lost moments of connection,,lost quality of time with loved ones,and lost years of healthy quality of life. 
 In the future, do you see black people?,Do black people have a future?,What if you belongnto the very race of people,who have always been pitted against time?,What if your group is the groupnfor whom a future was never imagined?,These time-space clashes --,between protesters and police,,between gentrifiers and residents --,don't paint a very pretty picture,of what America hopesnfor black people's future.,If the present is any indicator,,our children will be under-educated,,health maladies will take their toll,and housing will continuento be unaffordable. 
 So if we're really readynto talk about the future,,perhaps we should beginnby admitting that we're out of time.,We black peoplenhave always been out of time.,Time does not belong to us.,Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency.,Time is used to displace us,,or conversely, we are urgedninto complacency,through endless calls to just be patient.,But if past is prologue,,let us seize upon the ways in whichnwe're always out of time anyway,to demand with urgency,freedom now. 
 I believe the future is what we make it.,But first, we have to decidenthat time belongs to all of us.,No, we don't all get equal time,,but we can decide that the timenwe do get is just and free.,We can stop making your zip codenthe primary determinant,of your lifespan.,We can stop stealing learning timenfrom black children,through excessive usenof suspensions and expulsions.,We can stop stealing timenfrom black people,through long periodsnof incarceration for nonviolent crimes.,The police can stopnstealing time and black lives,through use of excessive force. 
 I believe the future is what we make it.,But we can't get therenon colored people's time,or white time,or your time,or even my time.,It's our time.,Ours. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was a kid, I was obsessednwith the Guinness Book of World Records,,and I really wantednto set a world record myself.,But there was just one small problem:,I had absolutely no talent.,So I decided to setna world record in something,that demanded absolutely no skill at all.,I decided to set a world record,in crawling. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the record at the timenwas 12 and a half miles,,and for some reason,nthis seemed totally manageable. 
 (Laughter) 
 I recruited my friend Anne,,and together we decided,nwe didn't even need to train. 
 (Laughter) 
 And on the day of our record attempt,,we put furniture padsnon the outside of our good luck jeans,and we set off,,and right away, we were in trouble,,because the denim was against our skin,and it began to chafe,,and soon our knees were being chewed up.,Hours in,,it began to rain.,Then, Anne dropped out.,Then, it got dark.,Now, by now, my kneesnwere bleeding through my jeans,,and I was hallucinating from the cold,and the pain and the monotony.,And to give you an ideanof the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,,the first lap aroundnthe high school track took 10 minutes.,The last lap took almost 30. 
 After 12 hours of crawling,,I stopped,,and I had gone eight and a half miles.,So I was short ofnthe 12-and-a-half-mile record. 
 Now, for many years, I thoughtnthis was a story of abject failure,,but today I see it differently,,because when I wasnattempting the world record,,I was doing three things.,I was getting outside my comfort zone,,I was calling upon my resilience,,and I was finding confidence in myself,and my own decisions.,I didn't know it then,,but those are notnthe attributes of failure.,Those are the attributes of bravery. 
 Now, in 1989, at the age of 26,,I became a San Francisco firefighter,,and I was the 15th womannin a department of 1,500 men. 
 (Applause) 
 And as you can imagine, when I arrived,there were many doubtsnabout whether we could do the job.,So even though I was a 5'10",n150-pound collegiate rower,,and someone who could enduren12 hours of searing knee pain -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I knew I still had to provenmy strength and fitness. 
 So one day a call came in for a fire,,and sure enough,nwhen my engine group pulled up,,there was black smoke billowingnfrom a building off an alleyway.,And I was with a big guy named Skip,,and he was on the nozzle,nand I was right behind,,and it was a typical sort of fire.,It was smoky, it was hot,,and all of a sudden,,there was an explosion,,and Skip and I were blown backwards,,my mask was knocked sideways,,and there was this moment of confusion.,And then I picked myself up,,I groped for the nozzle,,and I did what a firefighternwas supposed to do:,I lunged forward,,opened up the water,and I tackled the fire myself.,The explosion had been causednby a water heater,,so nobody was hurt,nand ultimately it was not a big deal,,but later Skip came up to me and said,,"Nice job, Caroline,",in this surprised sort of voice. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was confused, becausenthe fire hadn't been difficult physically,,so why was he looking at menwith something like astonishment?,And then it became clear:,Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy,and an excellent firefighter,,not only thoughtnthat women could not be strong,,he thought that theyncould not be brave either.,And he wasn't the only one.,Friends, acquaintances and strangers,,men and women throughout my career,ask me over and over,,"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,,aren't you scared?",Honestly, I never heardna male firefighter asked this.,And I became curious.,Why wasn't bravery expected of women? 
 Now, the answer began to come,when a friend of mine lamented to me,that her young daughternwas a big scaredy-cat,,and so I began to notice,,and yes, the daughter was anxious,,but more than that,nthe parents were anxious.,Most of what they said to hernwhen she was outside began with,,"Be careful," "Watch out," or "No.",Now, my friends were not bad parents.,They were just doing what most parents do,,which is cautioning their daughtersnmuch more than they caution their sons. 
 There was a study involvingna playground fire pole, ironically,,in which researchers saw that little girlsnwere very likely to be warned,by both their moms and dadsnabout the fire pole's risk,,and if the little girlsnstill wanted to play on the fire pole,,a parent was very likely to assist her.,But the little boys?,They were encouragednto play on the fire pole,despite any trepidationsnthat they might have,,and often the parents offerednguidance on how to use it on their own.,So what message does this sendnto both boys and girls?,Well, that girls are fragilenand more in need of help,,and that boys can and shouldnmaster difficult tasks by themselves.,It says that girls should be fearful,and boys should be gutsy. 
 Now, the irony is that at this young age,,girls and boys are actuallynvery alike physically.,In fact, girls are oftennstronger until puberty,,and more mature.,And yet we adults act,as if girls are more fragile,and more in need of help,,and they can't handle as much.,This is the messagenthat we absorb as kids,,and this is the messagenthat fully permeates as we grow up.,We women believe it, men believe it,,and guess what?,As we become parents,nwe pass it on to our children,,and so it goes. 
 Well, so now I had my answer.,This is why women, even firewomen,,were expected to be scared.,This is why women often are scared. 
 Now, I know some of younwon't believe me when I tell you this,,but I am not against fear.,I know it's an important emotion,nand it's there to keep us safe.,But the problem isnwhen fear is the primary reaction,that we teach and encourage in girls,whenever they face somethingnoutside their comfort zone. 
 So I was a paraglider pilotnfor many years -- 
 (Applause) 
 and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,,and it does fly very well,,but to many people I realizenit looks just like a bedsheet,with strings attached. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops,inflating this bedsheet,,running off and flying.,And I know what you're thinking.,You're like, Caroline,na little fear would make sense here.,And you're right, it does.,I assure you, I did feel fear.,But on that mountaintop,,waiting for the windnto come in just right,,I felt so many other things, too:,exhilaration, confidence.,I knew I was a good pilot.,I knew the conditions were good,nor I wouldn't be there.,I knew how great it was going to bena thousand feet in the air.,So yes, fear was there,,but I would take a good hard look at it,,assess just how relevant it was,and then put it where it belonged,,which was more often than not,behind my exhilaration, my anticipation,and my confidence.,So I'm not against fear.,I'm just pro-bravery. 
 Now, I'm not sayingnyour girls must be firefighters,or that they should be paragliders,,but I am saying that we are raisingnour girls to be timid, even helpless,,and it begins when we caution themnagainst physical risk.,The fear we learnnand the experiences we don't,stay with us as we become women,and morphs into all those thingsnthat we face and try to shed:,our hesitation in speaking out,,our deference so that we can be liked,and our lack of confidencenin our own decisions. 
 So how do we become brave?,Well, here's the good news.,Bravery is learned,,and like anything learned,,it just needs to be practiced.,So first,,we have to take a deep breath,and encourage our girls,to skateboard, climb trees,and clamber aroundnon that playground fire pole.,This is what my own mother did.,She didn't know it then,,but researchers have a name for this.,They call it risky play,,and studies show that risky playnis really important for kids, all kids,,because it teaches hazard assessment,,it teaches delayed gratification,,it teaches resilience,,it teaches confidence.,In other words,,when kids get outsidenand practice bravery,,they learn valuable life lessons. 
 Second, we have to stopncautioning our girls willy-nilly.,So notice next time you say,,"Watch out, you're going to get hurt,",or, "Don't do that, it's dangerous.",And remember that oftennwhat you're really telling her,is that she shouldn't be pushing herself,,that she's really not good enough,,that she should be afraid. 
 Third,,we women have to startnpracticing bravery, too.,We cannot teach our girlsnuntil we teach ourselves.,So here's another thing:,fear and exhilaration,feel very similar --,the shaky hands,nthe heightened heart rate,,the nervous tension,,and I'm betting that for many of you,the last time you thoughtnyou were scared out of your wits,,you may have been feelingnmostly exhilaration,,and now you've missed an opportunity.,So practice.,And while girls should be gettingnoutside to learn to be gutsy,,I get that adults don't wantnto get on hoverboards or climb trees,,so we all should be practicing,at home, in the office,and even right here getting up the guts,to talk to someone that you really admire. 
 Finally, when your girl is, let's say,,on her bike on the top of the steep hill,that she insistsnshe's too scared to go down,,guide her to access her bravery.,Ultimately, maybe that hillnreally is too steep,,but she'll come to that conclusionnthrough courage, not fear.,Because this is notnabout the steep hill in front of her.,This is about the life ahead of her,and that she has the tools,to handle and assess,all the dangersnthat we cannot protect her from,,all the challenges that we won'tnbe there to guide her through,,everything that our girls here,and around the world,face in their future. 
 So by the way,,the world record for crawling today -- 
 (Laughter) 
 is 35.18 miles,,and I would really lovento see a girl go break that. 
 (Applause)Every summer, my family and Intravel across the world,,3,000 miles away,to the culturally diversencountry of India.,Now, India is a country infamousnfor its scorching heat and humidity.,For me, the only relief from this heatnis to drink plenty of water.,Now, while in India,,my parents always remind mento only drink boiled or bottled water,,because unlike here in America,,where I can just turn on a tapnand easily get clean, potable water,,in India, the water is often contaminated.,So my parents have to make sure,that the water we drink is safe. 
 However, I soon realized,that not everyone is fortunate enough,to enjoy the clean water we did.,Outside my grandparents' housenin the busy streets of India,,I saw people standing in long lines,under the hot sun,filling buckets with water from a tap.,I even saw children,,who looked the same age as me,,filling up these clear plastic bottles,with dirty waternfrom streams on the roadside.,Watching these kids,forced to drink water,that I felt was too dirty to touch,changed my perspective on the world.,This unacceptable social injustice,compelled me to want to find a solution,to our world's clean water problem.,I wanted to knownwhy these kids lacked water,,a substance that is essential for life.,And I learned that we are facing,a global water crisis. 
 Now, this may seem surprising,,as 75 percent of our planetnis covered in water,,but only 2.5 percentnof that is freshwater,,and less than one percentnof Earth's freshwater supply,is available for human consumption.,With rising populations,,industrial developmentnand economic growth,,our demand for clean water is increasing,,yet our freshwater resourcesnare rapidly depleting.,According to thenWorld Health Organization,,660 million people in our world,lack access to a clean water source.,Lack of access to clean waternis a leading cause of death,in children under the age of fivenin developing countries,,and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children,die every day fromna water-related disease. 
 So after returning homenone summer in eighth grade,,I decided that I wantednto combine my passion,for solving the global water crisis,with my interest in science.,So I decided that the best thing to do,would be to convert my garageninto a laboratory. 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, at first I convertednmy kitchen into a laboratory,,but my parents didn't really approvenand kicked me out. 
 I also read a lot of journal papersnon water-related research,,and I learned that currentlynin developing countries,,something called solar disinfection,,or SODIS, is used to purify water.,In SODIS, clear plastic bottlesnare filled with contaminated water,and then exposed to sunlightnfor six to eight hours.,The UV radiation from the sun,destroys the DNAnof these harmful pathogens,and decontaminates the water.,Now, while SODIS is really easy to usenand energy-efficient,,as it only uses solar energy,,it's really slow,,as it can take up to two daysnwhen it's cloudy.,So in order to makenthe SODIS process faster,,this new method called photocatalysis,has recently been used. 
 So what exactly is this photocatalysis?,Let's break it down:,"photo" means from the sun,,and a catalyst is somethingnthat speeds up a reaction.,So what photocatalysis is doing,is it's just speeding upnthis solar disinfection process.,When sunlight comes innand strikes a photocatalyst,,like TiO2, or titanium dioxide,,it creates thesenreally reactive oxygen species,,like superoxides, hydrogen peroxidenand hydroxyl radicals.,These reactive oxygen species,are able to remove bacteria and organics,and a whole lot of contaminantsnfrom drinking water. 
 But unfortunately,nthere are several disadvantages,to the way photocatalytic SODISnis currently deployed.,See, what they do is they takenthe clear plastic bottles,and they coat the insidenwith this photocatalytic coating.,But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide,are actually commonly used in sunscreens,to block UV radiation.,So when they're coatednon the inside of these bottles,,they're actually blockingnsome of the UV radiation,and diminishing the efficiencynof the process.,Also, these photocatalytic coatings,are not tightly boundnto the plastic bottle,,which means they wash off,nand people end up drinking the catalyst.,While TiO2 is safe and inert,,it's really inefficientnif you keep drinking the catalyst,,because then you havento continue to replenish it,,even after a few uses. 
 So my goal wasnto overcome the disadvantages,of these current treatment methods,and create a safe, sustainable,,cost-effective and eco-friendlynmethod of purifying water.,What started off as an eighth gradenscience fair project,is now my photocatalytic compositenfor water purification.,The composite combinesntitanium dioxide with cement.,The cement-like composite can be formedninto several different shapes,,which results in an extremelynversatile range of deployment methods.,For example, you could create a rod,that can easily be placedninside water bottles for individual use,or you could create a porous filternthat can filter water for families.,You can even coat the insidenof an existing water tank,to purify larger amounts of water,for communitiesnover a longer period of time. 
 Now, over the course of this,,my journey hasn't really been easy.,You know, I didn't have accessnto a sophisticated laboratory.,I was 14 years old when I started,,but I didn't let my age deter me,in my interestnin pursuing scientific research,and wanting to solventhe global water crisis. 
 See, water isn'tnjust the universal solvent.,Water is a universal human right.,And for that reason,,I'm continuing to worknon this science fair project from 2012,to bring it from the laboratoryninto the real world.,And this summer,nI founded Catalyst for World Water,,a social enterprise aimed at catalyzingnsolutions to the global water crisis. 
 (Applause) 
 Alone, a single drop of waterncan't do much,,but when many drops come together,,they can sustain life on our planet.,Just as water dropsncome together to form oceans,,I believe that we all must come together,when tackling this global problem. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a relationship builder.,When you think of a relationship builder,,don't you just automaticallynthink "architect?",Probably not.,That's because most people thinknarchitects design buildings and cities,,but what we really designnare relationships,,because cities are about people.,They're places where people come togethernfor all kinds of exchange.,And besides, skylinesnare highly specific urban habitats,with their own insects,nplants and animals,,and even their own weather. 
 But today, urban habitatsnare out of balance.,Climate change, together with politicalnand economic troubles,,are having an impact;,they're adding upnand stressing out cities and us,,the people who live in them. 
 For me, the field of ecologynhas provided important insight,,because ecologists don't just looknat individual species on their own,,they look at the relationshipsnbetween living things,and their environment.,They look at how all the diverse partsnof the ecosystem are interconnected,,and it's actually this balance,nthis web of life, that sustains life.,My team and I have been applyingninsights from ecology to architecture,to see how physical spacencan help build stronger relationships.,The projects I'm going to show you today,use the idea of building relationshipsnas the key driver for design. 
 Here's an example of what I mean.,Recently, we were asked to designna center for social justice leadership,called the Arcus Center.,They asked us for a buildingnthat could break down traditional barriers,between different groups,and in doing so, create possibilitiesnfor meaningful conversations,around social justice.,The students wanted a placenfor cultural exchange.,They thought a place for preparingnfood together could do that.,And they wanted to be welcomingnto the outside community.,They thought a fireplacencould draw people in,and help start conversations.,And everybody wanted the worknof social justice to be visible,to the outside world.,There really wasn't a precedentnfor this kind of space,,so we looked around the globenand found examples,of community meeting houses.,Community meeting houses are places,where there's very specificnrelationships between people,,like this one in Mali,nwhere the elders gather.,The low roof keeps everybody seatednand at equal eye level.,It's very egalitarian.,I mean, you can't stand upnand take over the meeting.,You'd actually bump your head. 
 (Laughter) 
 In meeting houses,nthere's always a central space,where you can sit around a circlenand see each other.,So we designed a space just like that,right in the middle of the Arcus Center,,and we anchored itnwith a fireplace and a kitchen.,It's pretty hard to get a kitchennand a fireplace in a building like this,with the building codes,,but it was so importantnto the concept, we got it done.,And now the central spacenworks for big social gatherings,and a place to meet one-on-onenfor the very first time.,It's almost likenthis three-way intersection,that encourages bumping into peoplenand starting a conversation.,Now you can always pass the kitchennand see something going on.,You can sit by the fireplacenand share stories.,You can study togethernin big groups or in small ones,,because the architecturensets up these opportunities. 
 Even the constructionnis about building relationships.,It's made of cordwood masonry,,which is using logsnthe way you would use bricks.,It's super low-tech and easy to donand anyone can do it --,and that's the entire point.,The act of making is a social activity. 
 And it's good for the planet, too:,the trees absorbed carbonnwhen they were growing up,,and they gave off oxygen,,and now that carbonnis trapped inside the walls,and it's not being releasedninto the atmosphere.,So making the walls is equivalentnto taking cars right off the road.,We chose the building method,because it connects peoplento each other and to the environment. 
 But is it working?,Is it creating relationshipsnand nurturing them?,How can we know?,Well, more and more peoplenare coming here, for one,,and as a result of the fireside chats,and a full calendar of programming,,people are applyingnfor the Arcus Fellowships.,In fact, applications have increasedntenfold for the Arcus Fellowship,since the building opened.,It's working. It's bringingnpeople together. 
 So I've shown how architecturencan connect people,on this kind of horizontal campus scale.,But we wondered if social relationshipsncould be scaled up --,or rather, upward -- in tall buildings.,Tall buildings don't necessarily lendnthemselves to being social buildings.,They can seem isolating and inward.,You might only see peoplenin those awkward elevator rides.,But in several major cities,nI've been designing tall buildings,that are based on creatingnrelationships between people. 
 This is Aqua.,It's a residential high-rise in Chicago,aimed at young urban professionalsnand empty nesters,,many of them new to the city.,With over 700 apartments, we wanted to seenif we could use architecture,to help people get to knowntheir neighbors,,even when their homes are organizednin the vertical dimension.,So we invented a way to use balconiesnas the new social connectors.,The shapes of the floor slabsnvary slightly and they transition,as you go up the tower.,The result of thisnis that you can actually see people,from your balcony.,The balconies are misregistered.,You can lean over your balconynand say, "Hey!",just like you would across the backyard.,To make the balconies more comfortable,for a longer period of timenduring the year,,we studied the windnwith digital simulations,,so the effect of the balcony shapesnbreaks up the wind,and confuses the wind,and makes the balconiesnmore comfortable and less windy. 
 Now, just by being ablento go outside on your balcony,or on the third floor roof terrace,,you can be connected to the outdoors,,even when you're way aboventhe ground plane.,So the building acts to create community,within the building and the citynat the same time.,It's working.,And people are starting to meet each othernon the building surface,and we've heard -- 
 (Laughter) 
 they've even starting gettingntogether as couples.,But besides romantic relationships,,the building has a positive social effect,on the community,,as evidenced by peoplenstarting groups together,and starting big projects together,,like this organic community gardennon the building's roof terrace. 
 So I've shown how tall buildingsncan be social connectors,,but what about public architecture?,How can we create betternsocial cohesion in public buildings,and civic spaces,,and why is it important?,Public architecturenis just not as successful,if it comes from the top down. 
 About 15 years ago in Chicago,,they started to replacenold police stations,,and they built this identical modelnall over the city.,And even though they had good intentions,of treating all neighborhoods equally,,the communities didn't feelninvested in the process,or feel a sense of ownershipnof these buildings.,It was equality in the sense thatneverybody gets the same police station,,but it wasn't equitynin the sense of responding,to each community's individual needs.,And equity is the key issue here. 
 You know, in my field, there's a debate,about whether architecturencan even do anything,to improve social relationships.,But I believe that we need architecturenand every tool in our tool kit,to improve these relationships.,In the US, policy reformsnhave been recommended,in order to rebuild trust.,But my team and I wondered,if design and a more inclusivendesign process,could help add something positivento this policy conversation.,We asked ourselves simply:,Can design help rebuild trust? 
 So we reached out to community membersnand police officers in North Lawndale;,it's a neighborhood in Chicago,where the police stationnis perceived as a scary fortress,surrounded by a parking lot.,In North Lawndale,npeople are afraid of police,and of going anywherennear the police station,,even to report a crime.,So we organized this brainstorming session,with both groups participating,,and we came up with this wholennew idea for the police station.,It's called "Polis Station.","Polis" is a Greek word that meansna place with a sense of community.,It's based on the idea,that if you can increase opportunitiesnfor positive social interactions,between police and community members,,you can rebuild that relationship,and activate the neighborhoodnat the same time. 
 Instead of the police stationnas a scary fortress,,you get highly active spacesnon the public side of the station --,places that spark conversation,,like a barbershop, a coffee shop,or sports courts as well.,Both cops and kids said they love sports.,These insights came directlynfrom the community members,and the police officers themselves,,and as designers, our rolenwas just to connect the dots,and suggest the first step.,So with the helpnof the city and the parks,,we were able to raise fundsnand design and build a half-court,,right on the police station parking lot. 
 It's a start.,But is it rebuilding trust?,The people in North Lawndale saynthe kids are using the courts every day,and they even organize tournamentsnlike this one shown here,,and once in a while an officer joins in.,But now, they even have basketballsninside the station,that kids can borrow.,And recently they've asked usnto expand the courts,and build a park on the site.,And parents report something astonishing.,Before, there was fear of goingnanywhere the station, and now they say,there's a sense that the court is safernthan other courts nearby,,and they prefer their kids to play here. 
 So maybe in the future,,on the public side of the station,,you might be able to drop innfor a haircut at the barbershop,or reserve the community roomnfor a birthday party,or renew your driver's license,or get money out of an ATM.,It can be a place for neighborsnto meet each other,and to get to knownthe officers, and vice versa.,This is not a utopian fantasy.,It's about how do you designnto rebuild trust,,trusting relationships? 
 You know, every city has parks,nlibraries, schools,and other public buildings,that have the potentialnto be reimagined as social connectors.,But reimagining the buildingsnfor the future is going to require,engaging the people who live there.,Engaging the public can be intimidating,nand I've felt that, too.,But maybe that's becausenin architecture school,,we don't really learn how to engagenthe public in the act of design.,We're taught to defendnour design against criticism.,But I think that can change, too. 
 So if we can focus the design mind,on creating positive,nreinforcing relationships,in architecture and through architecture,,I believe we can do much morenthan create individual buildings.,We can reduce the stressnand the polarization,in our urban habitats.,We can create relationships.,We can help steadynthis planet we all share. 
 See?,Architects really arenrelationship builders. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Why do we think,that stories by men are deemednto be of universal importance,,and stories by women are thoughtnto be merely about women? 
 My grandmother left schoolnwhen she was 12.,She had 14 children.,My mother left school when she was 15.,She was a secretary.,I graduated from universitynto become a theater director,,and that progress is entirely to donwith the fact that people I'll never meet,fought for women to have rights,,get the vote, get education,nhave progress.,And I'm determined to do the same,nand obviously you are, too.,Why not? 
 (Applause) 
 So I started a festival called WOW,nWomen of the World, seven years ago,,and it's now in 20 countriesnacross five continents.,And one of those countriesnis Somaliland in Africa.,So I traveled there last year,,and part of the joy I had in going therenwas going to these caves.,The Laas Geel caves.,Now, these caves contain somenof the oldest cave paintings in the world.,These paintings are thought to benround about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.,Art:,what humanity has donenever since it evolved.,It's how we speak about ourselves,,how we understand our identity,,how we look at our surroundings,,who we find out about each other,because of the meaning of our lives.,That's what art is for. 
 So look at this little picture.,I think it's a little girl.,I thought it was a bit like menwhen I was a little girl.,And I thought, well, who paintednthis joyful, youthful figure?,And I asked the curator of the caves.,I said, "Tell me about the mennand women who painted these.",And he looked at menabsolutely askance, and he said,,"Women didn't paint these pictures.",And I said, "Well,nit was 11,000 years ago.",I said, "How do you know?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And he said, "Women don't do these things.,Men made these marks. Women don't." 
 Now, I wasn't really surprised,,because that's an attitudenthat I've seen continuously,all my life as a theater maker.,We are told that divine knowledgencomes down through the masculine,,whether it be to the imam,nthe priest, the rabbi, the holy man.,Similarly, we're told that creative geniusnresides in the masculine,,that it is the masculine,that will be able to tell usnabout who we really are,,that the masculine will tellnthe universal story,on behalf of all of us,,whereas women artists will reallynjust talk about women's experiences,,women's issuesnonly really relevant to women,and of passing interest to men --,and really only some men.,And it's that conviction,,that that we are taught,,that I think colors so muchnof whether we're prepared to believe,that women's stories really matter.,And unless we're prepared to believenthat women's stories really matter,,then women's rights don't really matter,,and then change can't really come. 
 I want to tell younabout two examples of stories,that are thought to benof universal importance:,"E.T." and "Hamlet." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I took my two childrennwhen they were little --,Caroline was eight and Robby was five --,to see "E.T.",And it's a fantastic storynof this little alien,who ends up in an American family,with a mum, two brothers and a sister,,but he wants to go home.,Not only that, but somenreally bad scientists,want to do some experiments on him,,and they're looking for him.,So the children have a plot.,They decide they're going to take himnback to his spaceship,as soon as they can,,and they plop him in a bicycle basket,,and off they ride.,But unfortunately, the baddiesnhave found out, and they're catching up,and they've got sirensnand they've got their guns,,they've got the loud-hailers,nit's terribly frightening,,and they're closing up on the children,,and the children are neverngoing to make it.,And then all of a sudden, magically,nthe bikes fly up in the air,,over the clouds,,over the moon,,and they're going to save "E.T." 
 So I turn to see my children's faces,,and Robby is enraptured,nhe's there with them, he's saving E.T.,,he's a happy boy.,And I turn to Caroline,nand she's crying her eyes out.,And I said, "What's the matter?",And she said, "Why can't I save E.T.?nWhy can't I come?",And then all of a sudden I realized:,they weren't children;,they were boys --,all boys.,And Caroline, who had investednso much in E.T.,,well, she wasn't invited to save him,,and she felt humiliated and spurned. 
 So I wrote to Steven Spielberg -- 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 and I said, "I don't knownif you understand,the psychological importancenof what's happened,,and are you prepared to paynfor the therapy bills?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Twenty years later, I haven'tnhad a word back from him,,but I'm still hopeful. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I thought it was interesting,,because if you read reviewsnof what he intended with E.T.,,he says very specifically,,"I wanted the world to understand,that we should lovenand embrace difference.",But somehow he didn't includenthe idea of girls' difference,in this thinking.,He thought he was writing a storynabout all humanity.,Caroline thought he was marginalizing,half of humanity.,He thought he was writing a storynabout human goodness;,she thought he was writingna lad's heroic adventure. 
 And this is common.,Men feel they have been given the mantlenfor universal communication,,but of course, how could they be?,They are writing from male experiencenthrough male's eyes.,We have to have a look at this ourselves.,We have to be prepared to go backnthrough all our books and our films,,all our favorite things,,and say, "Actually, this is writtennby a male artist --,not an artist.,We have to seenthat so many of these stories,are written through a male perspective.,Which is fine,,but then females need to haven50 percent of the rights,for the stage, the film, the novel,,the place of creativity. 
 Let me talk about "Hamlet.",To be or not to be.,That is the question.,But it's not my question.,My question is: Why was I taughtnas a young woman,that this was the quintessentialnexample of human dilemma,and human experience?,It's a marvelous story,,but actually, it's about a young mannfearful that he won't be able to make it,as a powerful figure in a male world,unless he takes revengenfor his father's murder.,He talks a great deal to usnabout suicide being an option,,but the reality is that the personnwho actually commits suicide, Ophelia,,after she's been humiliatednand abused by him,,never gets a chance to talknto the audience about her feelings.,And then when he's finished with Ophelia,nhe turns on his mum,,because basically she has the audacitynto fall in love with his uncle,and enjoy sex. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is a great story,,but it is a story about male conflict,nmale dilemma, male struggle.,But I was told this was the storynof human beings,,despite the fact that it onlynhad two women in it.,And unless I reeducate myself,,I am always going to think,that women's storiesnmatter less than men's.,A woman could have written "Hamlet,",but she would have written it differently,,and it wouldn't have hadnglobal recognition.,As the writer Margaret Atwood says,,"When a man writes about doing the dishes,,it's realism.,When a woman writes about doing it,,it's an unfortunate genetic disposition." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this is not just somethingnthat belongs to then.,I mean, when I was a young girl,,wanting desperatelynto be a theater director,,this is what my male lecturer said to me:,"Well, there are three womenndirectors in Britain," he said, "Jude.","There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian,nthere's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,,and there's Buzz Goodbody,nwho's just killed herself.,So, which of those threenwould you like to be?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, leaving asidenthe disgusting slur on gay women,,the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.,He thought it was sillynthat I wanted to be a director.,And I told my friend Marin Alsop,nthe conductor, and she said,,"Oh yes, well, my music teachernsaid exactly the same.,He said, 'Women don't conduct.'",But all these years later,nwe've made our mark.,You think, "Well, it'll be different now.",I'm afraid it's not different now.,The current headnof the Paris Conservatoire,said recently, "It takesngreat physical strength,to conduct a symphony,,and women are too weak." 
 (Laughter) 
 The artist George Baselitz said,,"Well, the fact is women can't paint.,Well -- they can't paint very well." 
 The writer V.S. Naipaulnsaid two years ago,,"I can read two paragraphs and knownimmediately if it's written by a woman,,and I just stop reading,nbecause it's not worthy of me." 
 Audience: Whoa! 
 And it goes on. 
 We have to find a way,of stopping young girls and women,feeling not only thatntheir story doesn't matter,,but they're not allowednto be the storyteller.,Because once you feelnthat you can't stand in the central space,and speak on behalf of the world,,you will feel that you can offernyour goods up to a small, select group.,You will tend to do smaller worknon smaller stages,,your economic power will be less,,your reach of audiences will be less,,and your credit will be less as an artist.,And we do finally give artistsnthese incredible, prominent spaces,in the world,,because they are our storytellers. 
 Now, why should it matter to younif you're not an artist?,Supposing you're an accountantnor an entrepreneur or a medic,or a scientist:,Should you care about women artists?,Absolutely, you must,,because as you can seenfrom the cave paintings,,all civilizations,,all of humanity,have relied upon artistsnto tell the human story,,and if the human storynis finally told by men,,take my word for it,,it will be about men. 
 So let's make a change.,Let's make a changento all our institutions,,and not just in the West.,Don't forget -- this messagenof incapability of women,to hold creative genius,is being told to girls and womennin Nigeria, in China, in Russia,,in Indonesia.,All over the world, girlsnand women are being told,that they can't finally hold the ideanof creative inspiration.,And I want to ask you:,Do you believe that?,Do you believe that womenncan be a creative genius? 
 (Applause and cheers) 
 Well then, please go forward,,support women artists,,buy their work,,insist that their voices are heard,,find platforms on whichntheir voices will be made.,And remember this:,that in a sense, if we're goingnto get past this moment,of a world where we knownthat we are unequal,,it's artists who have to imaginena different world.,And I'm calling on all artists,nwomen and men,,to imagine a gender-equal world.,Let's paint it. Let's draw it.,Let's write about it. Let's film it.,And if we could imagine it,,then we would have the energynand the stamina,to work towards it. 
 When I see this little girl,,11,000 years ago,,I want to know that the little girl now,can stand there and thinknshe's entitled to her dreams,,she's entitled to her destiny,and she's entitled to speaknon behalf of the whole world,,be recognized for it,and applauded. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to introduce you to somenvery wise kids that I've known,,but first I wantnto introduce you to a camel.,This is Cassie, a therapy camelnvisiting one of our young patients,in her room,,which is pretty magical.,A friend of mine raises camelsnat his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.,He has about eight of them,,and he started 30 years ago,because he thoughtnhorses were too mundane.,John is an out-of-the-box thinker,,which explains why the two of usnhave been such good friends,all of our lives.,Over the years, I've convinced himnto shuttle those sweet furry beasts,up to hang out with our sick kidsnfrom time to time.,Talking to John, I was surprised to learn,that camels have an averagenlife expectancy of 40 to 50 years.,The life expectancy of manynof the children with whom I work,is less than a year. 
 This is a picturenof the George Mark Children's House,,the first pediatricnpalliative respite care center,to open in the United States.,I founded it in 2004,,after years of working as a psychologist,on pediatric intensive care units,,frustrated with the undignified deathsnthat so many children experienced,and their families had to endure.,As I sat with families whose childrennwere at the end of their lives,,I was acutely aware of our surroundings.,While the elevated trainnrumbled overhead on its track,,quite literally the room reverberatednwith each passing train car.,The lights on the wardnwere fluorescent and too bright.,Monitors beeped, as did the elevator,,noisily announcing its arrival.,These families were experiencing,some of the most excruciatingnmoments of their lives,,and I so wanted themnto have a more peaceful place,in which to say a last goodbyento their young daughters and sons.,Surely, I thought,,there must be a better spotnthan a hospital intensive care unit,for children at the end of their lives. 
 Our children's house,is calm and nurturing.,It's a place where familiesncan stay together,to enjoy quality time with their children,,many of whom are there for respite stays,,some with repeated visitsnover a span of many years.,We call those kids our frequent flyers.,Rather than the bright,nnoisy quarters of the hospital,,their rooms are calm and comfortable,,with actual living spacesnfor the families,,a sanctuary of gardens,and a wonderful outdoor playground,with special structuresnfor children with physical limitations. 
 This sweet baby Lars,came to us directlynfrom a hospital intensive care unit.,Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news,that none of us would ever want to hear.,His parents had been toldnthat Lars had a brain anomaly,that would keep him from ever swallowing,,walking, talking,or developing mentally.,Recognizing what little chancenhe had for survival,,his parents chosento focus on the quality of time,that they could spend together.,They moved intonone of our family apartments,and treasured each day that they had,,which were far too few.,Lars's life was brief, to be sure,,mere weeks,,but it was calm and comfortable.,He went on hikes with his parents.,The time that he spent in the poolnwith our aquatic therapist,lessened the seizures he was experiencing,and helped him to sleep at night.,His family had a peaceful place,in which to both celebrate his life,and mourn his death. 
 It has been five yearsnsince Lars was with us,,and in that time,,his family has welcomed,a daughter and another son.,They are such a powerful testament,to the positive outcome that specializednchildren's hospice care can create.,Their baby's physical discomfortnwas well managed,,giving all of them the gift of timento be together in a beautiful place. 
 I'm going to talk to you now,about the elephant,rather than the camel in the room.,Very few people want to talk about death,,and even fewer about children's death.,Loss of a child,,especially for those of usnwho have our own children,,is frightening,,more than frightening,,paralyzing,,debilitating,,impossible.,But what I've learned is this:,children don't stop dying,just because we the adults,can't comprehendnthe injustice of losing them.,And what's more,,if we can be brave enough,to face the possibility of death,,even among the most innocent,,we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom. 
 Take Crystal, for example.,She was one of the first childrennto come for care,after we opened our doors.,She was nine when she arrived,,and her neurologist expectednthat she might live another two weeks.,She had an inoperable brain tumor,,and her decline had really accelerated,in the week before she came to us.,After settling into her room,,dressed entirely in pink and lavender,,surrounded by the Hello Kittynaccessories that she loved,,she spent the next several days,winning over the heartsnof every staff member.,Bit by bit, her condition stabilized,,and then to our astonishment,,she actually improved.,There were a variety of factors,that contributed to Crystal's improvement,which we later came to callnthe "George Mark bump,",a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon,where children outliventhe prognoses of their illnesses,if they're outside of the hospital.,The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,,tasty meals that were fixednoften to accommodate her requests,,the resident pets,,the therapy dog and rabbitnspent lots of cozy time with Crystal. 
 After she had been with usnfor about a week,,she called her grandmother,,and she said,,"Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,,and there's room for you to come, too.,And guess what?,You don't have to bring any quarters,because the washer and dryer are free." 
 (Laughter) 
 Crystal's grandmothernsoon arrived from out of town,,and they spent the remainingnfour months of Crystal's life,enjoying very special days together.,Some days were special because Crystalnwas outside in her wheelchair,sitting by the fountain.,For a little girl who had spent mostnof the year earlier in a hospital bed,,being outside counting hummingbirds,made for an amazing time with her grandma,,and lots of laughter.,Other days were specialnbecause of the activities,that our child life specialistncreated for her.,Crystal strung beads and made jewelrynfor everybody in the house.,She painted a pumpkinnto help decorate for Halloween.,She spent many excited daysnplanning her tenth birthday,,which of course none of usnthought she would ever see.,All of us wore pink boas for the occasion,,and Crystal, as you can see,,queen for a day,,wore a sparkly tiara. 
 One hot morning, I arrived at work,and Crystal and her partnernin crime, Charlie, greeted me.,With some help, they had set upna lemonade and cookie stand,outside the front door,,a very strategic location.,I asked Crystal the pricenof the cookie that I had selected,,and she said, "Three dollars." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said that seemed a bit highnfor one cookie. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was small.,"I know," she acknowledged with a grin,,"but I'm worth it." 
 And therein lie the words of wisdom,of a young girl whose brief lifenforever impacted mine.,Crystal was worth it,,and shouldn't every child whose lifenis shortened by a horrific illness,be worth it?,Together, all of us today,can offer that same specialized carenthat Crystal received,by recognizing that children'snrespite and hospice care,is a critical component missingnfrom our healthcare landscape.,It's also interesting to note,that we are able to provide this care,at about one third of the costnof a hospital intensive care unit,,and our families don't see a bill.,We are ever grateful to the supporters,who believe in this important worknthat we're doing. 
 The truth is that my colleagues and I,and the parents and other family members,who get to experience this special wisdom,are in a unique position.,There are only two freestandingnpediatric hospices in the United States,,although I'm happy to reportnthat based on our model,,there are 18 othersnunder various stages of development. 
 (Applause) 
 Still, most of the childrennwho die in the United States every year,die in hospital rooms,,surrounded by beeping machines,and anxious, exhausted adults,who have no other option,but to say goodbyenunder those harsh, institutional lights,and among virtual strangers.,For comparison's sake,,the United Kingdom,,which is a country with about one fifthnthe population of the United States,,and about half the sizenof the state of California,,has 54 hospice and respite centers.,Why is that?,I've asked myself that questionnobviously many times.,My best guess is that Americans,nwith our positive can-do attitude,hold the expectationnthat our medical care system will fix it,,even though it may be a childhood illnessnfor which there is no cure.,We go to extraordinary measuresnto keep children alive,when in fact the greatest kindnessnthat we might give them,would be a peaceful, pain-free,end of life.,The transition from cure to care,remains a challenging onenfor many hospital physicians,whose training has really beennabout saving lives,,not about gently guiding the patientnto the end of life.,The dad of a sweet babynfor whom we cared at the end of her life,certainly captured this dichotomy,when he reflected,that there are a lot of peoplento help you bring an infant into the world,but very few to help you usher a baby out. 
 So what is the magic ingredientnat George Mark?,The complex medical diagnosesnthat bring our young patients to us,mean that their livesnhave often been restricted,,some to a hospital bednfor long periods of time,,others to wheelchairs,,still others to intensive coursesnof chemotherapy or rehab.,We make a practicenof ignoring those limitations.,Our default answer is "yes",and our default question is, "Why not?",That's why we took a young boy,who wasn't going to livenfor another baseball season,to Game 5 of the World Series.,That's why we have a talent shownput on by the staff and kids,for family and friends.,Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boynplaying a piano piece with his feet,,because his arms are atrophied?,That's why we have a prom every year.,It's pretty magical.,We started the prom,after hearing a dad lament,that he would never pinna boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.,The weeks before the dance,,the house is in a flurry,,and I don't know who's more excited,nthe staff or the kids. 
 (Laughter) 
 The night of the event,involves rides in vintage cars,,a walk on a red carpet,into the great room,,a terrific DJ,and a photographer at the ready,to capture pictures of these attendees,and their families.,At the end of the evening this year,,one of our young,ndelightful teenaged girls,,Caitlin, said to her mom,,"That was the best nightnof my whole life.",And that's just the point,,to capture the best days and nights,,to abolish limitations,,to have your default answer be "yes",and your default question be, "Why not?" 
 Ultimately life is too short,,whether we livento be 85 years or just eight.,Trust me.,Better yet, trust Sam.,It's not by pretendingnthat death doesn't exist,that we keep the people,,especially the little people that we love,,safe.,In the end,,we can't control how long any of us lives.,What we can control,is how we spend our days,,the spaces we create,,the meaning and joy that we make.,We cannot change the outcome,,but we can change the journey.,Isn't it time,to recognize that children deserve,nothing less than ournmost uncompromising bravery,and our wildest imagination. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Have you ever heard the onenabout how breastfeeding is free? 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, it's pretty funny,,because it's only free if we don't valuenwomen's time and energy.,Any mother can tell younhow much time and energy it takes,to liquify her body --,to literally dissolve herself -- 
 (Laughter) 
 as she feeds this preciousnlittle cannibal. 
 (Laughter) 
 Milk is why mammals suck.,At Arizona State University,,in the Comparative Lactation Lab,,I decode mothers' milk composition,to understand its complexity,and how it influences infant development.,The most important thing that I've learned,is that we do not do enoughnto support mothers and babies.,And when we fail mothers and babies,,we fail everyonenwho loves mothers and babies:,the fathers, the partners,nthe grandparents, the aunties,,the friends and kinnthat make our human social networks.,It's time that we abandonnsimple solutions and simple slogans,,and grapple with the nuance. 
 I was very fortunate,to run smack-dabninto that nuance very early,,during my first interviewnwith a journalist,when she asked me,,"How long should a mothernbreastfeed her baby?",And it was that word "should"nthat brought me up short,,because I will never tell a womannwhat she should do with her body. 
 Babies survive and thrive,because their mother's milknis food, medicine and signal.,For young infants,,mother's milk is a complete diet,that provides all the buildingnblocks for their bodies,,that shapes their brain,and fuels all of their activity.,Mother's milk also feeds the microbes,that are colonizingnthe infant's intestinal tract.,Mothers aren't just eating for two,,they're eating for two to the trillions.,Milk provides immunofactorsnthat help fight pathogens,and mother's milk provides hormonesnthat signal to the infant's body. 
 But in recent decades,,we have come to take milk for granted.,We stopped seeingnsomething in plain sight.,We began to think of milk as standardized,nhomogenized, pasteurized,,packaged, powdered,nflavored and formulated.,We abandoned the milk of human kindness,and turned our priorities elsewhere. 
 At the National Institutes of Health,in Washington DC,is the National Library of Medicine,,which contains 25 million articles --,the brain trust of life sciencenand biomedical research.,We can use keywordsnto search that database,,and when we do that,,we discover nearly a millionnarticles about pregnancy,,but far fewer aboutnbreast milk and lactation.,When we zoom in on the number of articlesnjust investigating breast milk,,we see that we know much morenabout coffee, wine and tomatoes. 
 (Laughter) 
 We know over twice as muchnabout erectile dysfunction. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm not saying we shouldn'tnknow about those things --,I'm a scientist, I thinknwe should know about everything.,But that we know so much less -- 
 (Laughter) 
 about breast milk --,the first fluid a young mammalnis adapted to consume --,should make us angry.,Globally, nine out of 10 women willnhave at least one child in her lifetime.,That means that nearly 130 millionnbabies are born each year.,These mothers and babiesndeserve our best science. 
 Recent research has shownnthat milk doesn't just grow the body,,it fuels behaviornand shapes neurodevelopment.,In 2015, researchers discovered,that the mixture of breast milknand baby saliva --,specifically, baby saliva --,causes a chemical reactionnthat produces hydrogen peroxide,that can kill staph and salmonella.,And from humans and other mammal species,,we're starting to understandnthat the biological recipe of milk,can be different when producednfor sons or daughters.,When we reach for donor milknin the neonatal intensive care unit,,or formula on the store shelf,,it's nearly one-size-fits-all.,We aren't thinking about how sonsnand daughters may grow at different rates,,or different ways,,and that milk may be a part of that. 
 Mothers have gotten the message,and the vast majority of mothersnintend to breastfeed,,but many do not reachntheir breastfeeding goals.,That is not their failure;,it's ours.,Increasingly common medical conditionsnlike obesity, endocrine disorders,,C-section and preterm births,all can disrupt the underlyingnbiology of lactation.,And many women do not havenknowledgeable clinical support. 
 Twenty-five years ago,,the World Health Organizationnand UNICEF established criteria,for hospitals to benconsidered baby friendly --,that provide the optimal levelnof support for mother-infant bonding,and infant feeding.,Today, only one in five babiesnin the United States,is born in a baby-friendly hospital.,This is a problem,,because mothers can grapplenwith many problems,in the minutes, hours, daysnand weeks of lactation.,They can have strugglesnwith establishing latch,,with pain,,with milk letdown,and perceptions of milk supply.,These mothers deservenknowledgeable clinical staff,that understand these processes. 
 Mothers will call me as they'rengrappling with these struggles,,crying with wobbly voices.,"It's not working.,This is what I'm supposednto naturally be able to do.,Why is it not working?",And just because somethingnis evolutionarily ancient,doesn't mean that it's easynor that we're instantly good at it.,You know what elsenis evolutionarily ancient? 
 (Laughter) 
 Sex.,And nobody expects usnto start out being good at it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Clinicians best delivernquality equitable care,when they have continuing education,about how to best supportnlactation and breastfeeding.,And in order to haventhat continuing education,,we need to anchor itnto cutting-edge research,in both the life sciencesnand the social sciences,,because we need to recognize,that too often,historical traumas and implicit biases,sit in the space betweenna new mother and her clinician.,The body is political.,If our breastfeeding supportnis not intersectional,,it's not good enough.,And for moms who have to return for work,,because countries like the United Statesndo not provide paid parental leave,,they can have to go back in as shortnas just a few days after giving birth. 
 How do we optimizenmother and infant health,just by messagingnabout breast milk to moms,without providingnthe institutional support,that facilitatesnthat mother-infant bonding,to support breastfeeding?,The answer is: we can't.,I'm talking to you, legislators,,and the voters who elect them.,I'm talking to you, job creatorsnand collective bargaining units,,and workers, and shareholders.,We all have a stakenin the public health of our community,,and we all have a rolento play in achieving it.,Breast milk is a partnof improving human health.,In the NICU, when infants are bornnearly or sick or injured,,milk or bioactive constituents in milkncan be critically important.,Environments or ecologies,,or communities where there'snhigh risk of infectious disease,,breast milk can be incredibly protective.,Where there are emergenciesnlike storms and earthquakes,,when the electricity goes out,,when safe water is not available,,breast milk can keep babiesnfed and hydrated.,And in the context of humanitarian crises,,like Syrian mothers fleeing war zones,,the smallest drops can buffer babiesnfrom the biggest global challenges. 
 But understanding breast milknis not just about messaging to mothers,and policy makers.,It's also about understandingnwhat is important in breast milk,so that we can deliver better formulas,to moms who cannot or do notnbreastfeed for whatever reason.,We can all do a better job,of supporting the diversitynof moms raising their babies,in a diversity of ways. 
 As women around the world struggle,to achieve political,nsocial and economic equality,,we must reimagine motherhood,as not the central,ncore aspect of womanhood,,but one of the many potential facetsnof what makes women awesome. 
 It's time. 
 (Applause)We all have milestones in lifenthat we remember so vividly.,The first one for menwas when I was entering kindergarten.,My big brother was in school,nand by golly, it was my time.,And I went trottin' down that hallway.,I was so excited, I almost wet myself.,And I go to the door,,and there was the teachernwith a warm welcome,,and she took me into the classroom,,showed me my little cubbyhole --,we all remember thosenlittle cubbyholes, don't we --,and we put our stuff in there.,And then she said, "Go over to the circle,and play with the kidsnuntil class starts.",So I went over therenand plopped down like I owned the place,,and I'm playing,,and all of a sudden, the boy next to me,,he was wearing a white shirtnwith blue shorts.,I remember it like it was yesterday.,Suddenly he stopped playing and he said,,"Why are you so short?",And I just kept playing.nI didn't think he was talking to me. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in a louder voice, he said,,"Hey, why are you so short?",So I looked up and I said,,"What are you talking about?nLet's just play. We're happy.,I've been waiting for this." 
 And so we played,nand about a minute later,,the girl next to him,nin a white shirt and a pink skirt,,stood up, put her hands on her hips,,and said, "Yeah,nwhy do you look so different?",And I went, "What are you talking about?,I don't look different. I'm not short.nAgain, let's just play." 
 About this time, I lookednall around the circle I was in,,and all the kids had stopped playingnand they were all looking at me.,And I'm thinking --,in today's language,nit would be "OMG" or "WTF." 
 (Laughter) 
 What just happened? 
 So all the confidencenthat I went in with that morning,was withering away as the morning went on,and the questions kept coming.,And at the end of the morning,nbefore I went home,,the teacher had us in a circle,,and I actually found myselfnoutside of the circle.,I couldn't look at anybody.,I could not understand what just happened. 
 And over the next few years,,I hated to go out in public.,I felt every stare, every giggle,,every pointed finger,,not the finger,,but every pointed finger,,and I hated it.,I would hide behind my parents' legsnlike nobody could see me.,And as a child,,you can't understandnanother child's curiosity,,nor an adult's ignorance.,It became very apparent to menthat the real world was not built,for someone of my size,nboth literally or figuratively. 
 And so I have no anonymity,nas you can probably tell,,and while you can see my size,,we all go through many challengesnthrough our lifetime.,And some you can see, like mine.,Most you can't.,You can't tell if someone's dealingnwith a mental illness,,or they're strugglingnwith their gender identity,,they're caring for an aging parent,,they're having financial difficulty.,You can't see that kind of stuff.,So while you can see,one of my challenges is my size,,seeing does not mean you understand,what it's truly to be me on a daily basis,nor what I go through.,And so I'm here to debunk a myth.,I do not believe you cannwalk in someone else's shoes,,and because of that, we must adoptna new way of giving of ourselves.,Simply stated, I will never knownwhat it's like to be you,and you will never knownwhat it's like to be me.,I cannot face your fearsnor chase your dreams,,and you can't do that for me,,but we can be supportive of each other.,Instead of trying to walknin each other's shoes,,we must adopt a new waynof giving of ourselves. 
 I learned at an early age,that I did have to do some thingsndifferent than most people,,but I also learned there were thingsnI was on equal footing with,,and one of those was the classroom.,Heh, heh, heh. I was equal.,As a matter of fact,nI excelled in the classroom.,This was vitally important,nI discovered as I grew older,and realized I wasn't going to be ablento do a physical job.,I needed an education.,So I went on and got a university degree,,but I felt to be one step aheadnof everyone for employment,,I needed to havenan advanced university degree,,so I went ahead and got that. 
 Now I'm ready for my interview.,Remember your first interview?nWhat am I going to wear?,What questions?,And don't forget that firm handshake.,I was right there with you.,So 24 hours before my interview,,a friend of minenwho I've known all my life,called and said, "Michele,nthe building you're going in has steps.",And she knew I couldn't climb steps.,So suddenly, my focus changed.,In my shoes, I was worriednabout how am I going to get there?,So I went early and found a loading docknand got in and had a great interview.,They had no idea what I went throughnfor the day and that's OK. 
 You're probably thinking my greatestnchallenge that day was the interview,,or getting in the building.,In reality, my biggest challenge that day,was getting through the loading docknwithout getting run over.,I am very vulnerablenin certain situations:,airports, hallways, parking lots,,loading docks.,And so I have to be very careful.,I have to anticipate and be flexible,and move as quickly as I can sometimes. 
 So I got the job,,and in my current rolenI travel quite a bit.,And travel is a challengenfor all of us these days.,And so you probably get to the airport,nrun through security, get to the gate.,Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat?nDid I get my upgrade?,Me, first of all,nI don't run through anything. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I especially don't run through the TSA,because I get to experiencenthe personal patdown.,I won't comment on that.,And then I make my way to the gate,,and with my gift of gabnthat my parents said I was born with,,I talk to the gate agent, and then I say,n"By the way, my scooter weighs this much,,I have a dry cell battery,,and I can drive it downnto the door of the plane.",Also, the day before, I had callednthe city where I'm traveling to,to find out where I could rent a scooternin case mine gets broken on the way.,So in my shoes,nit's a little bit different. 
 When I get onto the plane,,I use my gift of gab to ask the ladynto put my bag up, and they graciously do.,I try not to eat or drink on a plane,because I don't want to have tonget up and walk on the plane,,but nature has its own schedule,,and not long ago,nit knocked and I answered.,So I walked up to the front of the plane,and gabbed with the flight attendant,,and said, "Can you watch the door?nI can't reach the lock.",So I'm in there doing my business,nand the door flies open.,And there's a gentleman there,with a look of horror on his face.,I'm sure I had the same look.,As I came out, I noticednthat he was sitting right across from me,,and he's in total, complete embarrassment.,So I walk up to him and I quietly go,,"Are you going to remember thisnas much as I am?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And he goes, "I think so." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, while he's probablynnot talking about it publicly, I am. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we talked for the rest of the flight,,and we got to know each other,nour families, sports, work,,and when we landed, he said,,"Michele, I noticednsomeone put your bag up.,Can I get that for you?",And I said, "Of course, thank you.",And we wished each other well,,and the most important thing that day,was that he was not going to leavenwith that embarrassment,,that experience of embarrassment.,He won't forget it, and neither will I,,but I think he will remember more,our chat and our different perspectives. 
 When you travel internationally,,it can be even more challengingnin certain ways.,A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar,,and I come wheeling in,,and think about that.,Short, white, blond woman in a chair.,That doesn't probably happen every day.,So I go up, and with my gift of gab,nI start to talk to the agent.,So friendly, and I asknabout their culture and so forth,,and I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.,So I had to kind of say,,"Not only do you have to lift my chair,,I could use some helpngetting up the steps.",So we got to spend about an hour togethernwhile we waited for the flight,,and it was the most magnificent hour.,Our perspective changednfor both of us that day.,And once I got on the flight,,he patted me on the backnand wished me well,,and I thanked him so much.,And again, I think he's goingnto remember that experience more,than when I first came in,nand there was a bit of hesitation. 
 And as you notice, I get a lot of help.,I would not be where I am today,if it was not for my family,nmy friends, my colleagues,and the many strangers,that help me every single day of my life.,And it's importantnthat we all have a support system.,Asking for help is a strength,,not a weakness. 
 (Applause) 
 We all need help throughout our lifetime,,but it is just as important,that we are partnof other people's support systems.,We must adopt that way of giving back.,We all obviously have a role to playnin our own successes,,but think about the role we have to playnin other people's successes,,just like people do for menevery single day. 
 It's vitally importantnthat we help each other,,because society is increasinglynplacing people in silos,based on biases and ideologies.,And we must look past the surface,and be confronted with the truth,that none of us are what you can see.,There's more to us than that,,and we're all dealing with thingsnthat you cannot see.,So living a life free of judgment,allows all of us to sharenthose experiences together,and have a totally different perspective,,just like the couple of peoplenI mentioned earlier in my stories. 
 So remember, the only shoes,you truly can walk in are your own.,I cannot walk in yours.,I know you can't walk in my size 1s -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but you can try.,But we can do something better than that.,With compassion,ncourage and understanding,,we can walk side by side,and support one another,,and think about how society can change,if we all do that,instead of judgingnon only what you can see. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.Most of you can probably relatento what I'm feeling right now.,My heart is racing in my chest.,My palms are a little bit clammy.,I'm sweating.,And my breath is a little bit shallow.,Now, these familiar sensationsnare obviously the result,of standing upnin front of a thousand of you,and giving a talknthat might be streamed online,to perhaps a million more.,But the physical sensationsnI'm experiencing right now,are actually the result of a much morenbasic mind-body mechanism.,My nervous system is sendingna flood of hormones,like cortisol and adrenalineninto my bloodstream.,It's a very old and very necessarynresponse that sends blood and oxygen,to the organs and musclesnthat I might need,to respond quickly to a potential threat. 
 But there's a problem with this response,,and that is, it can get over-activated.,If I face these kinds of stressorsnon a daily basis,,particularly over an extendednperiod of time,,my system can get overloaded.,So basically, if this responsenhappens infrequently: super-necessary,for my well-being and survival.,But if it happens too much,,it can actually make me sick. 
 There's a growing body of researchnexamining the relationship,between chronic stress and illness.,Things like heart disease and even cancer,are being shown to havena relationship to stress.,And that's because, over time,ntoo much activation from stress,can interfere with my body's processesnthat keep me healthy. 
 Now, let's imagine for a momentnthat I was pregnant.,What might this kind of stress,,particularly over the lengthnof my pregnancy,,what kind of impact might that have,on the health of my developing fetus?,You probably won't be surprisednwhen I tell you,that this kind of stressnduring pregnancy is not good.,It can even cause the bodynto initiate labor too early,,because in a basic sense,nthe stress communicates,that the womb is no longerna safe place for the child.,Stress during pregnancy is linkednwith things like high blood pressure,and low infant birth weight,,and it can begin a cascadenof health challenges,that make birth much more dangerous,for both parent and child. 
 Now of course stress,nparticularly in our modern lifestyle,,is a somewhat universal experience, right?,Maybe you've never stood upnto give a TED Talk,,but you've faced a bignpresentation at work,,a sudden job loss,,a big test,,a heated conflictnwith a family member or friend.,But it turns out that the kindnof stress we experience,and whether we're able to staynin a relaxed state long enough,to keep our bodies working properly,depends a lot on who we are.,There's also a growing body of research,showing that people who experiencenmore discrimination,are more likely to have poor health.,Even the threat of discrimination,,like worrying you might be stoppednby police while driving your car,,can have a negative impact on your health.,Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams,,the person who pioneerednthe tools that have proven these linkages,,says that the more marginalizedngroups in our society,experience more discriminationnand more impacts on their health. 
 I've been interested in these issuesnfor over a decade.,I became interested in maternal health,when a failed premed trajectoryninstead sent me down a path,looking for other waysnto help pregnant people.,I became a doula,,a lay person trained to provide support,to people during pregnancy and childbirth.,And because I'm Latinanand a Spanish speaker,,in my first volunteer doula gignat a public hospital in North Carolina,,I saw clearly how race and classnimpacted the experiences,of the women that I supported. 
 If we take a look at the statisticsnabout the rates of illness,during pregnancy and childbirth,,we see clearly the patternnoutlined by Dr. Williams.,African-American women in particular,have an entirely differentnexperience than white women,when it comes to whetherntheir babies are born healthy.,In certain parts of the country,nparticularly the Deep South,,the rates of mothernand infant death for black women,actually approximatenthose rates in Sub-Saharan African.,In those same communities,,the rates for white women are near zero. 
 Even nationally, black womennare four times more likely,to die during pregnancy and childbirth,than white women.,Four times more likely to die.,They're also twice as likelynfor their infants to die,before the first year of life,than white infants,,and two to three times more likely,to give birth too early or too skinny --,a sign of insufficient development.,Native women are also more likelynto have higher rates of these problems,than white women,,as are some groups of Latinas.,For the last decade as a doulanturned journalist and blogger,,I've been trying to raise the alarm,about just how differentnthe experiences of women of color,,but particularly black women,,are when it comes to pregnancynand birth in the US. 
 But when I tell peoplenabout these appalling statistics,,I'm usually met with an assumptionnthat it's about either poverty,or lack of access to care.,But it turns out, neither of these thingsntell the whole story.,Even middle-class black womennstill have much worse outcomes,than their middle-classnwhite counterparts.,The gap actually widens among this group.,And while access to carenis definitely still a problem,,even women of color who receiventhe recommended prenatal care,still suffer from these high rates. 
 And so we come back to the path,from discrimination to stressnto poor health,,and it begins to paint a picturenthat many people of color know to be true:,racism is actually making us sick.,Still sound like a stretch?,Consider this: immigrants,nparticularly black and Latina immigrants,,actually have better health whennthey first arrive in the United States.,But the longer they stay in this country,nthe worse their health becomes.,People like me, born in the United Statesnto Cuban immigrant parents,,are actually more likely to havenworse health than my grandparents did.,It's what researchers calln"the immigrant paradox,",and it further illustrates,that there's somethingnin the US environment,that is making us sick. 
 But here's the thing:,this problem, that racismnis making people of color,,but especially blacknwomen and babies, sick, is vast.,I could spend all of my timenwith you talking about it,,but I won't, because I want to make surento tell you about one solution.,And the good news is, it's a solutionnthat isn't particularly expensive,,and doesn't requirenany fancy drug treatments,or new technologies.,The solution is called, "The JJ Way." 
 Meet Jennie Joseph.,She's a midwifenin the Orlando, Florida area,who has been servingnpregnant women for over a decade.,In what she calls her easy-access clinics,,Jennie and her team provide prenatal carento over 600 women per year.,Her clients, most of whom are black,nHaitian and Latina,,deliver at the local hospital.,But by providing accessiblenand respectful prenatal care,,Jennie has achieved something remarkable:,almost all of her clients give birthnto healthy, full-term babies. 
 Her method is deceptively simple.,Jennie says that all of her appointmentsnstart at the front desk.,Every member of her team,nand every moment a women is at her clinic,,is as supportive as possible.,No one is turned awayndue to lack of funds.,The JJ Way is to make the finances worknno matter what the hurdles.,No one is chastised for showing upnlate to their appointments.,No one is talked down to or belittled.,Jennie's waiting room feels more likenyour aunt's living room than a clinic.,She calls this spacen"a classroom in disguise.",With the plush chairsnarranged in a circle,,women wait for their appointmentsnin one-on-one chats,with a staff educator,,or in group prenatal classes. 
 When you finally are called backnto your appointment,,you are greeted by Alexis or Trina,,two of Jennie's medical assistants.,Both are young, African-Americannand moms themselves.,Their approach is casual and friendly.,During one visit I observed,,Trina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom,while she took her blood pressure.,This Latina mom was having troublenkeeping food down due to nausea.,As Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff,,she said, "We'll see about changingnyour prescription, OK?,We can't have you not eating.",That "we" is actually a really crucialnaspect of Jennie's model.,She sees her staff as part of a team that,nalongside the woman and her family,,has one goal:,get mom to term with a healthy baby. 
 Jennie says that Trina and Alexisnare actually the center of her care model,,and that her role as a providernis just to support their work.,Trina spends a lot of her daynon her cell phone,,texting with clientsnabout all sorts of things.,One woman texted to ask if a medicationnshe was prescribed at the hospital,was OK to take while pregnant.,The answer was no.,Another woman texted with picturesnof an infant born under Jennie's care.,Lastly, when you finally are called backnto see the provider,,you've already taken your own weightnin the waiting room,,and done your own pee testnin the bathroom. 
 This is a big departurenfrom the traditional medical model,,because it placesnresponsibility and information,back in the woman's hands.,So rather than a medical settingnwhere you might be chastised,for not keeping upnwith provider recommendations --,the kind of settings often availablento low-income women --,Jennie's model is to benas supportive as possible.,And that support provides a crucial buffer,to the stress of racism and discriminationnfacing these women every day. 
 But here's the best thingnabout Jennie's model:,it's been incredibly successful.,Remember those statistics I told you,,that black women are more likelynto give birth too early,,to give birth to low birth weight babies,,to even die due to complicationsnof pregnancy and childbirth?,Well, The JJ Way has almost entirelyneliminated those problems,,starting with what Jennie callsn"skinny babies.",She's been able to get almost allnher clients to term,with healthy, chunky babies like this one. 
 Audience: Aw! 
 Miriam Zoila Pérez:nThis is a baby girl,born to a client of Jennie'snthis past June. 
 A similar demographicnof women in Jennie's area,who gave birth at the samenhospital her clients did,were three times more likely to give birth,to a baby below a healthy weight.,Jennie is making headwayninto what has been seen for decades,as an almost intractable problem.,Some of you might be thinking,,all this one-on-one attentionnthat The JJ Way requires,must be too expensive to scale.,Well, you'd be wrong.,The visit with the providernis not the center of Jennie's model,,and for good reason.,Those visits are expensive,nand in order to maintain her model,,she's got to see a lotnof clients to cover costs.,But Jennie doesn't have to spendna ton of time with each woman,,if all of the members of her teamncan provide the support, information,and care that her clients need.,The beauty of Jennie's modelnis that she actually believes,it can be implementednin pretty much any health care setting.,It's a revolution in carenjust waiting to happen. 
 These problems I've been sharingnwith you are big.,They come from long historiesnof racism, classism,,a society based on racenand class stratification.,They involve elaboratenphysiological mechanisms,meant to protect us,,that, when overstimulated,nactually make us sick.,But if there's one thing I've learnednfrom my work as a doula,,it's that a little bit of unconditionalnsupport can go a really long way.,History has shown that peoplenare incredibly resilient,,and while we can't eradicate racism,or the stress that resultsnfrom it overnight,,we might just be able to createnenvironments that provide a buffer,to what people of colornexperience on a daily basis.,And during pregnancy,nthat buffer can be an incredible tool,towards shifting the impact of racism,for generations to come. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)For several years now,,we've been engaged in a national debatenabout sexual assault on campus.,No question --,it's crucial that young peoplenunderstand the ground rules for consent,,but that's where the conversationnabout sex is ending.,And in that vacuum of information,the media and the Internet --,that new digital street corner --,are educating our kids for us.,If we truly want young peoplento engage safely, ethically,,and yes, enjoyably,,it's time to have open honest discussionnabout what happens after "yes,",and that includes breakingnthe biggest taboo of all,and talking to young people,about women's capacity fornand entitlement to sexual pleasure.,Yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 Come on, ladies. 
 (Applause) 
 I spent three yearsntalking to girls ages 15 to 20,about their attitudesnand experience of sex.,And what I found was,that while young women may feelnentitled to engage in sexual behavior,,they don't necessarilynfeel entitled to enjoy it.,Take this sophomorenat the Ivy League college,who told me,,"I come from a long linenof smart, strong women.,My grandmother was a firecracker,,my mom is a professional,,my sister and I are loud,nand that's our form of feminine power.",She then proceedednto describe her sex life to me:,a series of one-off hookups,,starting when she was 13,,that were ...,not especially responsible,,not especially reciprocal,and not especially enjoyable.,She shrugged.,"I guess we girls are just socializednto be these docile creatures,who don't express our wants or needs.","Wait a minute," I replied.,"Didn't you just tell menwhat a smart, strong woman you are?",She hemmed and hawed.,"I guess," she finally said,,"no one told me that that smart,nstrong image applies to sex." 
 I should probably say right up topnthat despite the hype,,teenagers are not engaging in intercoursenmore often or at a younger age,than they were 25 years ago.,They are, however,nengaging in other behavior.,And when we ignore that,,when we label that as "not sex,",that opens the doornto risky behavior and disrespect.,That's particularly true of oral sex,,which teenagers considernto be less intimate than intercourse.,Girls would tell me, "it's no big deal,",like they'd all readnthe same instruction manual --,at least if boysnwere on the receiving end.,Young women have lotsnof reasons for participating.,It made them feel desired;,it was a way to boost social status.,Sometimes, it was a waynto get out of an uncomfortable situation.,As a freshman at a West Coastncollege said to me,,"A girl will give a guy a blow jobnat the end of the night,because she doesn'tnwant to have sex with him,,and he expects to be satisfied.,So, if I want him to leave,and I don't want anything to happen ... ",I heard so many storiesnof girls performing one-sided oral sex,that I started asking,,"What if every timenyou were alone with a guy,,he told you to get himna glass of water from the kitchen,,and he never got you a glass of water --,or if he did, it was like ...,'you want me to uh ...?'",You know, totally begrudging.,You wouldn't stand for it. 
 But it wasn't alwaysnthat boys didn't want to.,It was that girls didn't want them to.,Girls expressed a sense of shamenaround their genitals.,A sense that they werensimultaneously icky and sacred.,Women's feelings about their genitals,have been directly linkednto their enjoyment of sex.,Yet, Debby Herbenick,na researcher at Indiana University,,believes that girls' genitalnself-image is under siege,,with more pressure than ever,to see them as unacceptablenin their natural state.,According to research,,about three-quarters of college womennremove their pubic hair -- all of it --,at least on occasion,,and more than half do so regularly.,Girls would tell me that hair removalnmade them feel cleaner,,that it was a personal choice.,Though, I kind of wonderednif left alone on a desert island,,if this was how they wouldnchoose to spend their time. 
 (Laughter) 
 And when I pushed further,,a darker motivation emerged:,avoiding humiliation.,"Guys act like theynwould be disgusted by it,",one young woman told me.,"No one wants to bentalked about like that.",The rising pubic hair removalnreminded me of the 1920s,,when women first started regularlynshaving their armpits and their legs.,That's when flapper dressesncame into style,,and women's limbs were suddenly visible,,open to public scrutiny.,There's a way that I thinknthat this too is a sign.,That a girl's most intimate partnis open to public scrutiny,,open to critique,,to becoming more aboutnhow it looks to someone else,than how it feels to her. 
 The shaving trend has sparkednanother rise in labiaplasty.,Labiaplasty, which is the trimmingnof the inner and outer labia,,is the fastest-growing cosmeticnsurgery among teenage girls.,It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015,,and whereas girls under 18 comprisentwo percent of all cosmetic surgeries,,they are five percent of labiaplasty.,The most sought-after look, incidentally,,in which the outer labianappear fused like a clam shell,,is called ...,wait for it ...,"The Barbie." 
 (Groan) 
 I trust I don't have to tell you,that Barbie is a) made of plastic,and b) has no genitalia. 
 (Laughter) 
 The labiaplasty trendnhas become so worrisome,that the American Collegenof Obstetricians and Gynecologists,has issued a statement on the procedure,,which is rarely medically indicated,,has not been proven safe,and whose side effectsninclude scarring, numbness, pain,and diminished sexual sensation.,Now, admittedly,,and blessedly,,the number of girls involvednis still quite small,,but you could see themnas canaries in a coal mine,,telling us something importantnabout the way girls see their bodies. 
 Sara McClelland,,a psychologistnat the University of Michigan,,coined what is my favorite phrase evernin talking about all of this:,"Intimate justice.",That's the idea that sex has political,nas well as personal implications,,just like, who doesnthe dishes in your house,,or who vacuums the rug.,And it raises similarnissues about inequality,,about economic disparity,,violence,,physical and mental health.,Intimate justice asks us to consider,who is entitlednto engage in an experience.,Who is entitled to enjoy it?,Who is the primary beneficiary?,And how does each partnerndefine "good enough"?,Honestly, I think those questionsnare tricky and sometimes traumatic,for adult women to confront,,but when we're talking about girls,,I just kept coming back to the ideanthat their early sexual experience,shouldn't have to bensomething that they get over. 
 In her work,,McClelland found that young womennwere more likely than young men,to use their partner's pleasurenas a measure of their satisfaction.,So they'd say things like,,"If he's sexually satisfied,,then I'm sexually satisfied.",Young men were more likely to measurentheir satisfaction by their own orgasm.,Young women also definednbad sex differently.,In the largest ever survey,ever conductednon American sexual behavior,,they reported painnin their sexual encounters,30 percent of the time.,They also used words like "depressing,","humiliating,","degrading.",The young men never used that language.,So when young womennreport sexual satisfaction levels,that are equal tonor greater than young men's --,and they do in research --,that can be deceptive.,If a girl goes into an encounternhoping that it won't hurt,,wanting to feel close to her partner,and expecting him to have an orgasm,,she'll be satisfiednif those criteria are met.,And there's nothing wrong with wantingnto feel close to your partner,,or wanting him to be happy,,and orgasm isn't the onlynmeasure of an experience ...,but absence of pain --,that's a very low barnfor your own sexual fulfillment. 
 Listening to all of thisnand thinking about it,,I began to realize that we performedna kind of psychological clitoridectomy,on American girls.,Starting in infancy,,parents of baby boys are more likelynto name all their body parts,,at least they'll say,n"here's your pee-pee.",Parents of baby girlsngo right from navel to knees,,and they leave this wholensituation in here unnamed. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's no better waynto make something unspeakable,than not to name it.,Then kids go intontheir puberty education classes,and they learn that boysnhave erections and ejaculations,,and girls have ...,periods and unwanted pregnancy.,And they see that internal diagramnof a woman's reproductive system --,you know, the one that looksnkind of like a steer head -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And it always grays out between the legs.,So we never say vulva,,we certainly never say clitoris.,No surprise,,fewer than halfnof teenage girls age 14 to 17,have ever masturbated.,And then they goninto their partnered experience,and we expect that somehownthey'll think sex is about them,,that they'll be able to articulatentheir needs, their desires, their limits.,It's unrealistic. 
 Here's something, though.,Girls' investmentnin their partner's pleasure remains,regardless of the gender of the partner.,So in same-sex encounters,,the orgasm gap disappears.,And young women climaxnat the same rate as men.,Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me,that they felt liberatednto get off the script --,free to create an encounternthat worked for them.,Gay girls also challengednthe idea of first intercourse,as the definition of virginity.,Not because intercourse isn't a big deal,,but it's worth questioningnwhy we consider this one act,,which most girls associatenwith discomfort or pain,,to be the line in the sandnof sexual adulthood --,so much more meaningful,,so much more transformativenthan anything else.,And it's worth consideringnhow this is serving girls;,whether it's keeping themnsafer from disease,,coercion, betrayal, assault.,Whether it's encouragingnmutuality and caring;,what it means about the waynthey see other sex acts;,whether it's giving them more control over,and joy in their experience,,and what it means about gay teens,,who can have multiple sex partnersnwithout heterosexual intercourse.,So I asked a gay girl that I met,,"How'd you knownyou weren't a virgin anymore?",She said she had to Google it. 
 (Laughter) 
 And Google wasn't sure. 
 (Laughter) 
 She finally decidednthat she wasn't a virgin anymore,after she'd hadnher first orgasm with a partner.,And I thought --,whoa.,What if just for a second,we imagined that was the definition?,Again, not becausenintercourse isn't a big deal --,of course it is --,but it isn't the only big deal,,and rather than thinking about sexnas a race to a goal,,this helps us reconceptualize itnas a pool of experiences,that include warmth, affection, arousal,,desire, touch, intimacy.,And it's worth asking young people:,who's really the more sexuallynexperienced person?,The one who makes outnwith a partner for three hours,and experiments with sensualntension and communication,,or the one who gets wasted at a partynand hooks up with a random,in order to dump their "virginity"nbefore they get to college? 
 The only way that shiftnin thinking can happen though,is if we talk to young peoplenmore about sex --,if we normalize those discussions,,integrating them into everyday life,,talking about those intimate actsnin a different way --,the way we mostly have changed,in the way that we talknabout women in the public realm. 
 Consider a surveynof 300 randomly chosen girls,from a Dutch and an American university,,two similar universities,,talking about their earlynexperience of sex.,The Dutch girls embodied everythingnwe say we want from our girls.,They had fewer negative consequences,,like disease, pregnancy, regret --,more positive outcomes,like being able to communicatenwith their partner,,who they said they knew very well;,preparing for the experience responsibly;,enjoying themselves.,What was their secret?,The Dutch girls saidnthat their doctors, teachers and parents,talked to them candidly,,from an early age,,about sex, pleasurenand the importance of mutual trust.,What's more,,while American parents weren't necessarilynless comfortable talking about sex,,we tend to frame those conversations,entirely in terms or risk and danger,,whereas Dutch parents talknabout balancing responsibility and joy.,I have to tell you,,as a parent myself,,that hit me hard,,because I know,,had I not delved into that research,,I would have talked to my own childnabout contraception,,about disease protection,,about consent because I'm a modern parent,,and I would have thought ...,job well done. 
 Now I know that's not enough.,I also know what I hope for for our girls.,I want them to see sexualitynas a source of self-knowledge,,creativity and communication,,despite its potential risks.,I want them to be ablento revel in their bodies' sensuality,without being reduced to it.,I want them to be ablento ask for what they want in bed,,and to get it.,I want them to be safenfrom unwanted pregnancy,,disease,,cruelty,,dehumanization,,violence.,If they are assaulted,,I want them to have recoursenfrom their schools,,their employers,,the courts.,It's a lot to ask,,but it's not too much. 
 As parents, teachers,nadvocates and activists,,we have raised a generationnof girls to have a voice,,to expect egalitarianntreatment in the home,,in the classroom,,in the workplace.,Now it's time to demandnthat intimate justice,in their personal lives as well. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today, I want to tell younabout a pressing social issue.,Now, it's not nuclear arms,,it's not immigration,,and it's not malaria.,I'm here to talk about movies. 
 Now, in all seriousness,nmovies are actually really important.,In film, we can be wildly entertained,,and we can also be transportednthrough storytelling.,Storytelling is so important.,Stories tell us what societies value,,they offer us lessons,,and they share and preserve our history.,Stories are amazing. 
 But stories don't give everyone,the same opportunitynto appear within them,,particularly not stories,compartmentalizednin the form of American movies.,In film, interestingly enough,,females are still erased and marginalized,in a lot of our stories.,And I learned this for the first timenabout 10 years ago,when I did my first studynon gender role in G-rated films.,Since then, we've conductednmore than 30 investigations.,My team is tired.,And I've committed my life,as researcher and activist,to fighting the inclusion crisis,in Hollywood. 
 So today, what I'd like to donis tell you about that crisis.,I want to talk aboutngender inequality in film.,I want to tell you how it is perpetuated,,and then I'm going to tell younhow we're going to fix it. 
 However, one caveat before I begin:,my data are really depressing.,So I want to apologize in advance,,because I'm going to put you allnin a really bad mood.,But I'm going to bring it up at the end,,and I'm going to present a silver lining,to fix this mess that we've been in,for a very, very long time. 
 So, let's start with the gravitynof the situation.,Each year, my research teamnexamines the top 100 grossing films,in the United States.,What we do is we look at every speakingnor named character on-screen.,Now, to count in one of my investigations,,all a character has to do is say one word.,This is a very low bar. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies,,from 2007 to 2015,,cataloguing every speaking characternon-screen for gender, race, ethnicity,,LGBT and characters with a disability. 
 Let's take a looknat really some problematic trends.,First, females are stillnnoticeably absent on-screen in film.,Across 800 moviesnand 35,205 speaking characters,,less than a third of all rolesngo to girls and women.,Less than a third!,There's been no change from 2007 to 2015,,and if you compare our results,to a small sample of filmsnfrom 1946 to 1955,,there's been no changenin over a half of a century.,Over half of a century!,But we're half of the population. 
 Now, if we look at this datanintersectionally,,which has been a focus of today,,the picture becomes even more problematic.,Across the top 100 filmsnof just last year,,48 films didn't feature one blacknor African-American speaking character,,not one.,70 films were devoid of Asiannor Asian-American speaking characters,that were girls or women.,None.,Eighty-four films didn't feature onenfemale character that had a disability.,And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexualnor transgender female speaking characters.,This is not underrepresentation.,This is erasure,,and I call thisnthe epidemic of invisibility. 
 Now, when we movenfrom prevalence to protagonist,,the story is still problematic.,Out of a hundred films last year,,only 32 featured a female leadnor colead driving the action.,Only three out of a hundred films,featured an underrepresentednfemale driving the story,,and only one diverse woman,that was 45 years of age or oldernat the time of theatrical release. 
 Now let's look at portrayal.,In addition to the numbers you just saw,,females are far more likelynto be sexualized in film,than their male counterparts.,Matter of fact, they're aboutnthree times as likely,to be shown in sexuallynrevealing clothing,,partially naked,,and they're far more likely to be thin.,Now, sometimes, in animation,nfemales are so thin,that their waist size approximatesnthe circumference of their upper arm. 
 (Laughter) 
 We like to say that these galsnhave no room for a womb,or any other internal organ. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, all joking aside,,theories suggest, research confirms,,exposure to thin idealsnand objectifying content,can lead to body dissatisfaction,ninternalization of the thin ideal,and self-objectificationnamong some female viewers.,Obviously, what we see on-screen,and what we see in the world,,they do not match.,They do not match!,Matter of fact,nif we lived in the screen world,,we would have a populationncrisis on our hands. 
 So, as soon as I recognizednthese patterns,,I wanted to find out why,,and it turns out that there arentwo drivers to inequality on-screen:,content creator gendernand misperceptions of the audience.,Let's unpack them really quick. 
 If you want to changenany of the patterns I just talked about,,all you have to donis hire female directors.,Turns out, the female directors,are associated with,nin terms of short films and indie films,,more girls and women on-screen,,more stories with women in the center,,more stories with womenn40 years of age or older on-screen,,which I think is good news for this crowd.,More underrepresented -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry but not sorry.,More underrepresented charactersnin terms of race and ethnicity,,and most importantly,,more women working behind the camera,in key production roles.,Easy answer to the problemsnthat we just talked about.,Or is it?,It's actually not.,800 films, 2007-2015,,886 directors.,Only 4.1 percent are women.,Only three are African-American or black,,and only one woman was Asian. 
 So why is it so difficult,to have female directors,if they're part of the solution?,Well, to answer this question,,we conducted a study.,We interviewed dozens of industry insiders,and asked them about directors.,Turns out, both malenand female executives,,when they think director,,they think male.,They perceive the traits of leadership,to be masculine in nature.,So when they're going to hire a director,to command a crew, lead a ship,,be a visionary or be General Patton,,all the things that we've heard --,their thoughts and ideations pull male.,The perception of director or a leader,is inconsistentnwith the perception of a woman.,The roles are incongruous,,which is consistent with a lot of researchnin the psychological arena. 
 Second factor contributingnto inequality on-screen,is misperceptions of the audience.,I don't need to tell this crowd:,50 percent of the peoplenthat go to the box office and buy tickets,are girls and women in this country.,Right?,But we're not perceived to be a viablenor financially lucrative target audience.,Further, there's some misperceptions,about whether females can open a film.,Open a film means that if younplace a female at the center,,it doesn't have the return on investment,that if you place a malenat the center of a story does. 
 This misperception is actually costly.,Right?,Especially in the wakenof franchise successes,like "The Hunger Games,","Pitch Perfect",or that small little indie film,n"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",Our own economic analyses shownthat gender of the lead character,doesn't play a role in economic successnin the United States.,But what does?,Production costs alone,or in conjunction with how widelyna film is distributed in this country.,It's not the gender of the lead character. 
 So at this point, we shouldnall be sufficiently depressed.,No change in 50 years,,few female directorsnworking behind the camera,and the entertainment industryndoes not trust us as an audience.,Well, I told younthere would be a silver lining,,and there is.,There are actuallynsimple and tangible solutions,to fixing this problem,that involve content creators,,executives and consumers,like the individuals in this room.,Let's talk about a few of them. 
 The first is what I call "just add five.",Did you know if we lookednat the top 100 films next year,and simply added five femalenspeaking characters on-screen,to each of those films,,it would create a new norm.,If we were to do thisnfor three contiguous years,,we would be at gender parity,for the first timenin over a half of a century.,Now, this approach is advantageousnfor a variety of reasons.,One? It doesn't take away jobsnfor male actors.,Heaven forbid. 
 (Laughter) 
 Two, it's actually cost-effective.nIt doesn't cost that much.,Three, it builds a pipeline for talent.,And four, it humanizesnthe production process.,Why? Because it makes surenthat there's women on set. 
 Second solution is for A-list talent.,A-listers, as we all know,ncan make demands in their contracts,,particularly the ones that worknon the biggest Hollywood films.,What if those A-listers,simply added an equity clausenor an inclusion rider,into their contract?,Now, what does that mean?,Well, you probably don't know,but the typical feature film,has about 40 to 45nspeaking characters in it.,I would argue that only 8 to 10nof those characters,are actually relevant to the story.,Except maybe "Avengers." Right?,A few more in "Avengers.",The remaining 30 or so roles,,there's no reason why those minor roles,can't match or reflect the demography,of where the story is taking place.,An equity rider by an A-listernin their contract,can stipulate that those roles,reflect the worldnin which we actually live.,Now, there's no reason why a network,,a studio or a production company,cannot adopt the same contractual language,in their negotiation processes. 
 Third solution:,this would be fornthe entertainment industry,,Hollywood in particular,,to adopt the Rooney Rule,when it comes to hiring practicesnaround directors.,Now, in the NFL,nthe Rooney Rule stipulates,that if a team wants to hire a coachnfrom outside the organization,,what they have to do is interviewnan underrepresented candidate.,The exact same principlencan apply to Hollywood films.,How?,Well, on these top films,,executives and agents can make sure,that women and people of colornare not only on the consideration list,,but they're actuallyninterviewed for the job.,Now, one might say,,why is this important?,Because it exposes or introducesnexecutives to female directors,who otherwise fall preynto exclusionary hiring practices. 
 The fourth solution,is for consumers like me and you.,If we want to see more filmsnby, for and about women,,we have to support them.,It may mean goingnto the independent theater chain,instead of the multiplex.,Or it might mean scrolling downna little further online,to find a film by a female director.,Or it may be writing a checknand funding a film,,particularly by a female directornfrom an underrepresented background.,Right?,We need to write, call and email companies,that are making and distributing films,,and we need to postnon our social media accounts,when we want to seeninclusive representation,,women on-screen,,and most importantly,nwomen behind the camera.,We need to make our voices heardnand our dollars count. 
 Now, we actually have the abilitynto change the world on this one.,The US and its content,,films in particular,,have captured the imaginationsnof audiences worldwide.,Worldwide.,So that means that the film industrynhas unprecedented access,to be able to distributenstories about equality,all around the world.,Imagine what would happen,if the film industry aligned its values,with what it shows on-screen.,It could foster inclusion,and acceptance for girls and women,,people of color,,the LGBT community,,individuals with disabilities,,and so many more around the world.,The only thing that the film industrynhas to do is unleash its secret weapon,,and that's storytelling. 
 Now, at the beginning of this talk,,I said that films --,that they can actually transport us,,but I would like to arguenthat films, they can transform us.,None of us in this room,have grown up or experiencedna storytelling landscape,with fully realized female characters,,none of us,,because the numbers haven't changed.,What would happennif the next generation of audiences,grew up with a wholendifferent screen reality?,What would happen?,Well I'm here to tell you today,that it's not only possiblento change what we see on-screen,but I am impatient for it to get here. 
 So let's agree to take action today,to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.,And let's agree to take action today,to agree that US audiencesnand global viewers,demand and deserve more.,And let's agree today,that the next generationnof viewers and audiences,,that they deserve to see the stories,we were never able to see. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)[This talk contains graphic languagenand descriptions of sexual violence,Viewer discretion is advised] 
 Tom Stranger: In 1996,nwhen I was 18 years old,,I had the golden opportunity to gonon an international exchange program.,Ironically I'm an Australiannwho prefers proper icy cold weather,,so I was both excited and tearfulnwhen I got on a plane to Iceland,,after just having farewellednmy parents and brothers goodbye.,I was welcomed into the homenof a beautiful Icelandic family,who took me hiking,,and helped me get a graspnof the melodic Icelandic language.,I struggled a bit with the initialnperiod of homesickness.,I snowboarded after school,,and I slept a lot.,Two hours of chemistry class in a languagenthat you don't yet fully understand,can be a pretty good sedative. 
 (Laughter) 
 My teacher recommendednI try out for the school play,,just to get me a bit more socially active.,It turns out I didn't end upnbeing part of the play,,but through it I met Thordis.,We shared a lovely teenage romance,,and we'd meet at lunchtimesnto just hold hands,and walk around old downtown Reykjavík.,I met her welcoming family,nand she met my friends.,We'd been in a budding relationshipnfor a bit over a month,when our school's Christmas Ball was held. 
 Thordis Elva: I was 16nand in love for the first time.,Going together to the Christmas dance,was a public confirmationnof our relationship,,and I felt like the luckiestngirl in the world.,No longer a child, but a young woman.,High on my newfound maturity,,I felt it was only natural to try drinkingnrum for the first time that night, too.,That was a bad idea.,I became very ill,,drifting in and out of consciousness,in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.,The security guards wantednto call me an ambulance,,but Tom acted as my knightnin shining armor,,and told them he'd take me home. 
 It was like a fairy tale,,his strong arms around me,,laying me in the safety of my bed.,But the gratitude that I feltntowards him soon turned to horror,as he proceeded to take off my clothesnand get on top of me.,My head had cleared up,,but my body was stillntoo weak to fight back,,and the pain was blinding.,I thought I'd be severed in two.,In order to stay sane,,I silently counted the secondsnon my alarm clock.,And ever since that night,,I've known that there are 7,200nseconds in two hours. 
 Despite limping for daysnand crying for weeks,,this incident didn't fit my ideasnabout rape like I'd seen on TV.,Tom wasn't an armed lunatic;,he was my boyfriend.,And it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway,,it happened in my own bed.,By the time I could identifynwhat had happened to me as rape,,he had completed his exchange program,and left for Australia.,So I told myself it was pointlessnto address what had happened.,And besides,,it had to have been my fault, somehow. 
 I was raised in a worldnwhere girls are taught,that they get raped for a reason.,Their skirt was too short,,their smile was too wide,,their breath smelled of alcohol.,And I was guilty of all of those things,,so the shame had to be mine.,It took me years to realize,that only one thing could have stopped menfrom being raped that night,,and it wasn't my skirt,,it wasn't my smile,,it wasn't my childish trust.,The only thing that could've stopped menfrom being raped that night,is the man who raped me --,had he stopped himself. 
 TS: I have vague memories of the next day:,the after effects of drinking,,a certain hollownessnthat I tried to stifle.,Nothing more.,But I didn't show up at Thordis's door.,It is important to now state,that I didn't see my deed for what it was.,The word "rape" didn't echonaround my mind as it should've,,and I wasn't crucifying myselfnwith memories of the night before.,It wasn't so much a conscious refusal,,it was more like any acknowledgmentnof reality was forbidden.,My definition of my actions completelynrefuted any recognition,of the immense trauma I caused Thordis.,To be honest,,I repudiated the entire actnin the days afterwards,and when I was committing it.,I disavowed the truth by convincingnmyself it was sex and not rape.,And this is a lie I've feltnspine-bending guilt for. 
 I broke up with Thordisna couple of days later,,and then saw her a number of times,during the remaindernof my year in Iceland,,feeling a sharp stabnof heavyheartedness each time.,Deep down, I knew I'd donensomething immeasurably wrong.,But without planning it,nI sunk the memories deep,,and then I tied a rock to them. 
 What followed is a nine-year period,that can best be titlednas "Denial and Running.",When I got a chance to identifynthe real torment that I caused,,I didn't stand still long enough to do so.,Whether it be via distraction,,substance use,,thrill-seeking,or the scrupulous policingnof my inner speak,,I refused to be static and silent. 
 And with this noise,,I also drew heavilynupon other parts of my life,to construct a picture of who I was.,I was a surfer,,a social science student,,a friend to good people,,a loved brother and son,,an outdoor recreation guide,,and eventually, a youth worker.,I gripped tight to the simple notionnthat I wasn't a bad person.,I didn't think I had this in my bones.,I thought I was made up of something else.,In my nurtured upbringing,,my loving extended family and role models,,people close to me were warm and genuine,in their respect shown towards women.,It took me a long time to stare downnthis dark corner of myself,,and to ask it questions. 
 TE: Nine years after the Christmas dance,,I was 25 years old,,and headed straightnfor a nervous breakdown.,My self-worth was buriednunder a soul-crushing load of silence,that isolated me from everyonenthat I cared about,,and I was consumednwith misplaced hatred and anger,that I took out on myself. 
 One day, I stormed outnof the door in tears,after a fight with a loved one,,and I wandered into a café,,where I asked the waitress for a pen.,I always had a notebook with me,,claiming that it was to jot down ideasnin moments of inspiration,,but the truth was that I needednto be constantly fidgeting,,because in moments of stillness,,I found myself counting seconds again.,But that day, I watched in wondernas the words streamed out of my pen,,forming the most pivotal letternI've ever written,,addressed to Tom.,Along with an account of the violencenthat he subjected me to,,the words, "I want to find forgiveness",stared back at me,,surprising nobody more than myself.,But deep down I realized that thisnwas my way out of my suffering,,because regardless of whether or notnhe deserved my forgiveness,,I deserved peace.,My era of shame was over. 
 Before sending the letter,,I prepared myself for all kindsnof negative responses,,or what I found likeliest:nno response whatsoever.,The only outcomenthat I didn't prepare myself for,was the one that I then got --,a typed confession from Tom,nfull of disarming regret.,As it turns out, he, too,nhad been imprisoned by silence.,And this marked the startnof an eight-year-long correspondence,that God knows was never easy,,but always honest.,I relieved myself of the burdensnthat I'd wrongfully shouldered,,and he, in turn, wholeheartedlynowned up to what he'd done.,Our written exchanges became a platform,to dissect the consequences of that night,,and they were everythingnfrom gut-wrenching,to healing beyond words. 
 And yet, it didn't bring aboutnclosure for me.,Perhaps because the email formatndidn't feel personal enough,,perhaps because it's easy to be brave,when you're hiding behind a computernscreen on the other side of the planet.,But we'd begun a dialogue,that I felt was necessarynto explore to its fullest.,So, after eight years of writing,,and nearly 16 years after that dire night,,I mustered the couragento propose a wild idea:,that we'd meet up in person,and face our past once and for all. 
 TS: Iceland and Australianare geographically like this.,In the middle of the two is South Africa.,We decided upon the city of Cape Town,,and there we met for one week.,The city itself proved to bena stunningly powerful environment,to focus on reconciliationnand forgiveness.,Nowhere else has healingnand rapprochement been tested,like it has in South Africa.,As a nation, South Africa soughtnto sit within the truth of its past,,and to listen to the detailsnof its history.,Knowing this only magnified the effectnthat Cape Town had on us. 
 Over the course of this week,,we literally spokenour life stories to each other,,from start to finish.,And this was about analyzingnour own history.,We followed a strict policynof being honest,,and this also camenwith a certain exposure,,an open-chested vulnerability.,There were gutting confessions,,and moments where we justnabsolutely couldn't fathom,the other person's experience.,The seismic effects of sexual violencenwere spoken aloud and felt,,face to face.,At other times, though,,we found a soaring clarity,,and even some totally unexpectednbut liberating laughter.,When it came down to it,,we did out best to listennto each other intently.,And our individual realitiesnwere aired with an unfiltered purity,that couldn't do any lessnthan lighten the soul. 
 TE: Wanting to take revengenis a very human emotion --,instinctual, even.,And all I wanted to do for years,was to hurt Tom back as deeplynas he had hurt me.,But had I not found a waynout of the hatred and anger,,I'm not sure I'd be standing here today.,That isn't to say that I didn't havenmy doubts along the way.,When the plane bouncednon that landing strip in Cape Town,,I remember thinking,,"Why did I not just get myselfna therapist and a bottle of vodka,like a normal person would do?" 
 (Laughter) 
 At times, our searchnfor understanding in Cape Town,felt like an impossible quest,,and all I wanted to do was to give up,and go home to my lovingnhusband, Vidir,,and our son.,But despite our difficulties,,this journey did resultnin a victorious feeling,that light had triumphed over darkness,,that something constructivencould be built out of the ruins. 
 I read somewhere,that you should try and be the personnthat you needed when you were younger.,And back when I was a teenager,,I would have needed to knownthat the shame wasn't mine,,that there's hope after rape,,that you can even find happiness,,like I share with my husband today.,Which is why I started writing feverishlynupon my return from Cape Town,,resulting in a book co-authored by Tom,,that we hope can be of usento people from both ends,of the perpetrator-survivor scale.,If nothing else,,it's a story that we would've needednto hear when we were younger. 
 Given the nature of our story,,I know the wordsnthat inevitably accompany it --,victim, rapist --,and labels are a way to organize concepts,,but they can also be dehumanizingnin their connotations.,Once someone's been deemed a victim,,it's that much easier to file them awaynas someone damaged,,dishonored,,less than.,And likewise, once someonenhas been branded a rapist,,it's that much easiernto call him a monster --,inhuman.,But how will we understandnwhat it is in human societies,that produces violence,if we refuse to recognizenthe humanity of those who commit it?,And how -- 
 (Applause) 
 And how can we empower survivorsnif we're making them feel less than?,How can we discuss solutionsnto one of the biggest threats,to the lives of women and childrennaround the world,,if the very words we usenare part of the problem? 
 TS: From what I've now learnt,,my actions that night in 1996nwere a self-centered taking.,I felt deserving of Thordis's body.,I've had primarily positivensocial influences,and examples of equitablenbehavior around me.,But on that occasion,,I chose to draw upon the negative ones.,The ones that see womennas having less intrinsic worth,,and of men having some unspokennand symbolic claim to their bodies.,These influences I speak ofnare external to me, though.,And it was only me in that roomnmaking choices,,nobody else. 
 When you own something,and really square up to your culpability,,I do think a surprising thing can happen.,It's what I call a paradox of ownership.,I thought I'd bucklenunder the weight of responsibility.,I thought my certificatenof humanity would be burnt.,Instead, I was offerednto really own what I did,,and found that it didn't possessnthe entirety of who I am.,Put simply,,something you've done doesn't havento constitute the sum of who you are.,The noise in my head abated.,The indulgent self-pitynwas starved of oxygen,,and it was replacednwith the clean air of acceptance --,an acceptance that I did hurtnthis wonderful person standing next to me;,an acceptance that I am part of a largenand shockingly everyday grouping of men,who have been sexually violentntoward their partners. 
 Don't underestimate the power of words.,Saying to Thordis that I raped hernchanged my accord with myself,,as well as with her.,But most importantly,,the blame transferred from Thordis to me.,Far too often,,the responsibility is attributednto female survivors of sexual violence,,and not to the males who enact it.,Far too often,,the denial and running leaves all partiesnat a great distance from the truth.,There's definitely a publicnconversation happening now,,and like a lot of people,,we're heartenednthat there's less retreating,from this difficultnbut important discussion.,I feel a real responsibilitynto add our voices to it. 
 TE: What we did is not a formulanthat we're prescribing for others.,Nobody has the right to tell anyone elsenhow to handle their deepest pain,or their greatest error.,Breaking your silence is never easy,,and depending on wherenyou are in the world,,it can even be deadlynto speak out about rape.,I realize that even the mostntraumatic event of my life,is still a testament to my privilege,,because I can talk about itnwithout getting ostracized,,or even killed.,But with that privilege of having a voice,comes the responsibility of using it.,That's the least I owenmy fellow survivors who can't. 
 The story we've just relayed is unique,,and yet it is so common with sexualnviolence being a global pandemic.,But it doesn't have to be that way.,One of the things that I found usefulnon my own healing journey,is educating myself about sexual violence.,And as a result,nI've been reading, writing,and speaking about this issuenfor over a decade now,,going to conferences around the world.,And in my experience,,the attendees of such eventsnare almost exclusively women.,But it's about time that we stop treatingnsexual violence as a women's issue. 
 (Applause) 
 A majority of sexual violencenagainst women and men,is perpetrated by men.,And yet their voices are sorelynunderrepresented in this discussion.,But all of us are needed here.,Just imagine all the sufferingnwe could alleviate,if we dared to face this issue together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matternimportant for the US right now,and in the world? 
 Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matternis our call to action.,It is a tool to reimagine a world,where black people are free to exist,,free to live.,It is a tool for our alliesnto show up differently for us. 
 I grew up in a neighborhoodnthat was heavily policed.,I witnessed my brothers and my siblings,continuously stopped and friskednby law enforcement.,I remember my home being raided.,And one of my questionsnas a child was, why?,Why us?,Black Lives Matternoffers answers to the why.,It offers a new visionnfor young black girls around the world,that we deserve to be fought for,,that we deserve to callnon local governments to show up for us. 
 Opal Tometi: And antiblack racism -- 
 (Applause) 
 And antiblack racism is not onlynhappening in the United States.,It's actually happeningnall across the globe.,And what we need now more than evernis a human rights movement,that challenges systemic racismnin every single context. 
 (Applause) 
 We need this because the global reality,is that black peoplenare subject to all sorts of disparities,in most of our most challengingnissues of our day.,I think about issues like climate change,,and how six of the 10 worst impactednnations by climate change,are actually on the continent of Africa.,People are reelingnfrom all sorts of unnatural disasters,,displacing themnfrom their ancestral homes,and leaving them without a chancenat making a decent living. 
 We also see disastersnlike Hurricane Matthew,,which recently wreaked havocnin many different nations,,but caused the most damage to Haiti.,Haiti is the poorest countrynin this hemisphere,,and its inhabitants are black people.,And what we're seeing in Haiti,is that they were actually facingna number of challenges,that even preceded this hurricane.,They were reeling from the earthquake,,they were reeling from choleranthat was brought in by UN peacekeepers,and still hasn't been eradicated.,This is unconscionable.,And this would not happen if this nationndidn't have a population that was black,,and we have to be real about that. 
 But what's most heartening right now,is that despite these challenges,,what we're seeing isnthat there's a network of Africans,all across the continent,who are rising up and fighting backnand demanding climate justice. 
 (Applause) 
 MB: So Alicia,,you've said that whennblack people are free,,everyone is free.,Can you talk about what that means? 
 Alicia Garza: Sure.,So I think race and racismnis probably the most studied,social, economic and politicalnphenomenon in this country,,but it's also the least understood.,The reality is that racenin the United States,operates on a spectrumnfrom black to white.,Doesn't mean that people who arenin between don't experience racism,,but it means that the closernyou are to white on that spectrum,,the better off you are.,And the closer to blacknthat you are on that spectrum,the worse off your are.,When we think aboutnhow we address problems in this country,,we often start from a placenof trickle-down justice.,So using white folksnas the control we say,,well, if we make thingsnbetter for white folks,then everybody else is going to get free.,But actually it doesn't work that way.,We have to address problems at the root,,and when you deal with what'snhappening in black communities,,it creates an effervescence, right?,So a bubble up rather than a trickle down.,Let me give an example.,When we talk about the wage gap,,we often say women make 78 centsnto every dollar that a man makes.,You all have heard that before.,But those are the statisticsnfor white women and white men.,The reality is that black womennmake something like 64 cents,to every 78 cents that white women make.,When we talk about latinas,nit goes down to about 58 cents.,If we were to talk about indigenous women,,if we were to talk about trans women,,it would even go further down.,So again,,if you deal with thosenwho are the most impacted,,everybody has an opportunitynto benefit from that,,rather than dealing with the folksnwho are not as impacted,,and expecting it to trickle down. 
 MB: So I love the effervescence,,bubbling up. 
 AG: Effervescence -- like champagne. 
 (Laughter) 
 MB: Who doesn't lovena glass of champagne, right?,Champagne and freedom, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 What more could we want, y'all? 
 So you all have beenndoing this for a minute,,and the last few years have been --,well, I can't even imagine,,but I'm sure very transformative.,And I know that you allnhave learned a lot about leadership.,What do you wantnto share with these people,about what you've learnednabout leadership?,Patrisse, let's start with you. 
 PC: Yeah, we have to investnin black leadership.,That's what I've learned the mostnin the last few years. 
 (Applause) 
 What we've seen is thousandsnof black people showing up for our lives,with very little infrastructurenand very little support.,I think our work as movement leadersnisn't just about our own visibility,but rather how do wenmake the whole visible.,How do we not just fightnfor our individual selves,but fight for everybody?,And I also think,leadership looks likeneverybody in this audience,showing up for black lives.,It's not just about comingnand watching people on a stage, right?,It's about how do younbecome that leader --,whether it's in your workplace,nwhether it's in your home --,and believe that the movementnfor black lives isn't just for us,,but it's for everybody. 
 (Applause) 
 MB: What about you, Opal? 
 OT: So I've been learningna great deal about interdependence.,I've been learningnabout how to trust your team.,I've come up with this new mantra,after coming backnfrom a three-month sabbatical,,which is rare for black women to takenwho are in leadership,,but I felt it was really importantnfor my leadership and for my team,to also practice stepping back,as well as also sometimes stepping in.,And what I learned in this processnwas that we need to acknowledge,that different peoplencontribute different strengths,,and that in ordernfor our entire team to flourish,,we have to allow themnto share and allow them to shine.,And so during my sabbatical,with the organizationnthat I also work with,,I saw our team rise up in my absence.,They were able to launch new programs,,fundraise.,And when I came back,,I had to give themna lot of gratitude and praise,because they showed menthat they truly had my back,and that they truly had their own backs. 
 You know, in this processnof my sabbatical,,I was really reminded,of this Southern Africannphilosophy of Ubuntu.,I am because you are;,you are because I am.,And I realized that my own leadership,,and the contributionsnthat I'm able to make,,is in large part due to the contributionsnthat they make, right?,And I have to acknowledge that,nand I have to see that,,and so my new mantra is,n"Keep calm and trust the team.",And also,,"Keep calm and thank the team." 
 MB: You know, one of the thingsnI feel like I've heard,in the context of the Black Lives Matternmovement more than anywhere else,is about being a leaderful movement,,and that's such a beautiful concept,,and I think that something,that women often bringnto the conversation about leadership,is really the collective piece.,What about you, Alicia? 
 AG: Yeah ...,How many of you heard that sayingnthat leadership is lonely?,I think that there is an elementnwhere leadership is lonely,,but I also believenthat it doesn't have to be like that.,And in order for us to get to that point,,I think there's a few thingsnthat we need to be doing. 
 So one is we have to stopntreating leaders like superheroes.,We are ordinary peoplenattempting to do extraordinary things,,and so we need to bensupported in that way. 
 The other thing thatnI've learned about leadership,is that there's a differencenbetween leadership and celebrities, right?,And there's a way in which we've beennkind of transformed into celebrities,rather than peoplenwho are trying to solve a problem.,And the way that we treatncelebrities is very fickle, right?,We like them one day,,we don't like what they'renwearing the next day,,and all of a sudden we have issues, right?,So we need to stop deifying leaders,so that more peoplenwill step into leadership.,Lots of people are terrifiednto step into leadership,because of how much scrutiny they receive,and how brutal we are with leaders. 
 And then the last thingnthat I've learned about leadership,is that it's really easy to be a leadernwhen everybody likes you.,But it's hard to be a leadernwhen you have to make hard choices,and when you have to do what's right,,even though peoplenare not going to like you for it.,And so in that way,,I think another waynthat we can support leaders,is to struggle with us,,but struggle with us politically,,not personally.,We can have disagreementsnwithout being disagreeable,,but it's important for usnto sharpen each other,,so that we all can rise. 
 MB: That's beautiful, thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So you all are doing work,that forces you to facensome brutal, painful realities,on a daily basis.,What gives you hope,and inspires you in that context? 
 PC: I am hopeful for black futures.,And I say that becausenwe live in a society,that's so obsessed with black death.,We have images of our deathnon the TV screen,,on our Twitter timelines,,on our Facebook timelines,,but what if insteadnwe imagine black life?,We imagine black peoplenliving and thriving.,And that --,that inspires me. 
 OT: What inspires menthese days are immigrants.,Immigrants all over the worldnwho are doing the best that they can,to make a living,nto survive and also to thrive.,Right now there arenover 244 million people,who aren't livingnin their country of origin.,This is a 40 percent increasensince the year 2000.,So what this tells me,is that the disparities across the globenare only getting worse.,Yet there are people who are findingnthe strength and wherewithal to travel,,to move,,to eke out a better living for themselves,and to provide for their familiesnand their loved ones.,And some of these peoplenwho are immigrants,are also undocumented.,They're unauthorized.,And they inspire me even more,because although our societynis telling them, you're not wanted,,you're not needed here,,and they're highly vulnerablenand subject to abuse, to wage theft,,to exploitation and xenophobic attacks,,many of them are also beginningnto organize in their communities.,And what I'm seeing isnthat there's also an emerging network,of black, undocumented peoplenwho are resisting the framework,,and resisting the criminalizationnof their existence.,And that to me is incredibly powerful,and inspires me every singe day. 
 MB: Thank you.,Alicia? 
 AG: So we know that young peoplenare the present and the future,,but what inspires me are older people,who are becoming transformednin the service of this movement.,We all know that as you get older,,you get a little morenentrenched in your ways.,It's happening to me, I know that's right.,But I'm so inspired when I see peoplenwho have a way that they do things,,have a way that theynthink about the world,,and they're courageous enough to be opennto listening to what the experiences are,of so many of us who wantnto live in world that's just,and want to livenin a world that's equitable.,And I'm also inspired by the actionsnthat I'm seeing older people taking,in service of this movement.,I'm inspired by seeing older peoplenstep into their own power and leadership,and say, "I'm not passing a torch,,I'm helping you light the fire." 
 (Applause) 
 MB: I love that --,yes. 
 So in terms of action,,I think that it is awesome to sit herenand be able to listen to you all,,and to have our minds open and shift,,but that's not going to getnblack people free.,So if you had one thingnyou would like this audience,and the folks who are watchingnaround the world to actually do,,what would that be? 
 AG: OK, two quick ones.,One, call the White House.,The water protectorsnare being forcibly removed,from the camp that they have set upnto defend what keeps us alive.,And that is intricatelynrelated to black lives.,So definitely call the White Housenand demand that they stop doing that.,There are tanks,and police officers arrestingnevery single person there as we speak. 
 (Applause) 
 The second thing that you can do,is to join something.,Be a part of something.,There are groups, collectives --,doesn't have to be a non-profit,nyou know what I mean?,But there are groups that are doingnwork in our communities right now,to make sure that black lives matternso all lives matter.,Get involved;,don't sit on your couch and tell peoplenwhat you think they should be doing.,Go do it with us. 
 MB: Do you guys want to add anything?,That's good? All right. So --,And I think that the joining something,,like if you feel like there'snnot something where you are, start it. 
 AG: Start it. 
 MB: These conversations that we're having,,have those conversationsnwith somebody else.,And then instead of justnletting it be a talk that you had,,actually decide to start something. 
 OT: That's right. 
 MB: I mean, that's what you all did.,You started something,nand look what's happened.,Thank you all so muchnfor being here with us today. 
 OT: Thank you.

 Online misogyny is a globalngender rights tragedy,,and it is imperative that it ends. 
 (Applause) 
 Girls' and women's voices,,and our allies' voicesnare constrained in ways,that are personally, economically,,professionally and politically damaging.,And when we curb abuse,,we will expand freedom. 
 I am a Kentucky basketball fan,,so on a fine March day last year,,I was doing one of the things I do best:,I was cheering for my Wildcats.,The daffodils were blooming,,but the referees were not blowingnthe whistle when I was telling them to. 
 (Laughter) 
 Funny, they're very friendlynto me before the opening tip,,but they really ignore me during the game. 
 (Laughter) 
 Three of my players were bleeding,nso I did the next best thing ...,I tweeted. 
 [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kissnmy team's free throw making a --,@KySportsRadio @marchmadnessn@espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] 
 It is routine for me to be treatednin the ways I've already described to you.,It happens to me every single day,on social media platformsnsuch as Twitter and Facebook.,Since I joined Twitter in 2011,,misogyny and misogynistsnhave amply demonstrated,they will dog my every step.,My spirituality, my faith,,being a hillbilly --nI can say that, you can't --,all of it is fair game. 
 And I have responded to thisnwith various strategies.,I've tried engaging people.,This one guy was sending menhypersexual, nasty stuff,,and there was a girl in his avatar.,I wrote him back and said ...,"Is that your daughter?,I feel a lot of fearnthat you may think about,and talk to women this way.",And he surprised me by saying,,"You know what?nYou're right. I apologize.",Sometimes peoplenwant to be held accountable.,This one guy was musingnto I don't know who,that maybe I was the definition of a cunt.,I was married to a Scot for 14 years,,so I said, "Cunt means manyndifferent things in different countries -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but I'm pretty sure you epitomizenthe global standard of a dick." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I've tried to rise above it,nI've tried to get in the trenches,,but mostly I would scroll throughnthese social media platforms,with one eye partially closed,ntrying not to see it,,but you can't makena cucumber out of a pickle.,What is seen goes in.,It's traumatic.,And I was always secretly hopingnin some part of me,that what was being said to menand about me wasn't ...,true.,Because even I,,an avowed, self-declared feminist,,who worships at the altar of Gloria -- 
 (Laughter) 
 internalize the patriarchy.,This is really critical.,Patriarchy is not boys and men.,It is a systemnin which we all participate,,including me. 
 On that particular day, for some reason,,that particular tweetnafter the basketball game,triggered something called a "cyber mob.",This vitriolic, global outpouringnof the most heinous hate speech:,death threats, rape threats.,And don't you know,,when I was sitting at homenalone in my nightgown,,I got a phone call,nand it was my beloved former husband,,and he said on a voice mail,,"Loved one ...,what is happening to you is not OK." 
 And there was something about himntaking a stand for me that night ...,that allowed mento take a stand for myself.,And I started to write.,I started to write about sharing the fact,that I'm a survivornof all forms of sexual abuse,,including three rapes.,And the hate speechnI get in response to that --,these are just some of the commentsnposted to news outlets.,Being told I'm a "snitch" is really fun. 
 [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] 
 Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. 
 Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus.nMay your grace and mercy shine. 
 So, I wrote this feminist op-ed,nit is entitled,,"Forget Your Team:,It Is Your Online Gender ViolencenToward Girls And Women,That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And I did that alone,nand I published it alone,,because my chief advisor said,,"Please don't,,the rain of retaliatory garbagenthat is inevitable --,I fear for you.",But I trust girls and I trust women,,and I trust our allies.,It was published, it went viral,,it proves that every single day,online misogyny is a phenomenonnendured by us all,,all over the world,,and when it is intersectional,,it is worse.,Sexual orientation, gender identity,,race, ethnicity, religion --,you name it,,it amplifies the violencenendured by girls and women,,and for our younger girls, it is worse. 
 It's clearly traumatizing.,Our mental health,nour emotional well-being,are so gravely affected,because the threat of violence,is experiencednneurobiologically as violence.,The cortisol shoots up,nthe limbic system gets fired,,we lose productivity at work. 
 And let's talk about work.,Our ability to work is constrained.,Online searches of women applying for jobsnreveal nude pictures of them,,false allegations they have STDs,,their addresses indicatingnthat they are available for sex,with real examples,of people showing upnat this house for said sex. 
 Our ability to go to school is impaired.,96 percent of all postings,of sexual images of our young people ...,girls.,Our girls.,Our boys are two to threentimes more likely --,nonconsensually --,to share images. 
 And I want to say a wordnabout revenge porn.,Part of what came out of this tweet,was my getting connectednwith allies and other activists,who are fightingnfor a safe and free internet.,We started somethingncalled the Speech Project;,curbing abuse, expanding freedom.,And that websitenprovides a critical forum,,because there is no global, legal thing,to help us figure this out.,But we do provide on that websitena standardized list of definitions,,because it's hard to attackna behavior in the right way,if we're not all sharingna definition of what that behavior is.,And I learned that revenge pornnis often dangerously misapplied.,It is the nonconsensualnsharing of an image,used tactically to shamenand humiliate a girl or woman,that attempts to pornography us.,Our natural sexuality is --,I don't know about yours --npretty gorgeous and wonderful.,And my expressing itndoes not pornography make. 
 (Applause) 
 So, I have all these resources,that I'm keenly awarenso many people in the world do not.,I was able to startnthe Speech Project with colleagues.,I can often get a social mediancompany's attention.,I have a wonderful visitnto Facebook HQ coming up.,Hasn't helped the idioticnreporting standards yet ...,I actually pay someonento scrub my social media feeds,,attempting to spare my brain,the daily iterationsnof the trauma of hate speech.,And guess what?,I get hate speech for that.,"Oh, you live in an echo chamber.",Well, guess what?,Having someone post a photographnof me with my mouth open,saying they "can't waitnto cum on my face,",I have a right to set that boundary. 
 (Applause) 
 And this distinctionnbetween virtual and real is specious,because guess what --,that actually happened to menonce when I was a child,,and so that tweet brought up that trauma,,and I had to do work on that. 
 But you know what we do?nWe take all of this hate speech,,and we disaggregate it,,and we code it,,and we give that data,so that we understandnthe intersectionality of it:,when I get porn,,when it's about political affiliation,,when it's about age,nwhen it's about all of it.,We're going to win this fight. 
 There are a lot of solutions --,thank goodness.,I'm going to offer just a few,,and of course I challenge younto create and contribute your own.,Number one: we have to startnwith digital media literacy,,and clearly it must have a gendered lens.,Kids, schools, caregivers, parents:,it's essential.,Two ...,shall we talk about our friends in tech?,Said with dignity and respect,,the sexism in your workplaces must end. 
 (Applause) 
 (Cheers) 
 EDGE,,the global standard for gender equality,,is the minimum standard.,And guess what, Silicon Valley?,If L'Oréal in India,,in the Philippines, in Brazil,and in Russia can do it,,you can, too.,Enough excuses.,Only when women have critical massnin every department at your companies,,including building platformsnfrom the ground up,,will the conversationsnabout priorities and solutions change. 
 And more love for my friends in tech:,profiteering off misogynynin video games must end.,I'm so tired of hearing yountalk to me at cocktail parties --,like you did a couplenweeks ago in Aspen --,about how deplorable #Gamergate was,,when you're still makingnbillions of dollars off games,that maim and dump women for sport.,Basta! -- as the Italians would say.,Enough. 
 (Applause) 
 Our friends in law enforcementnhave much to do,,because we've seen,that online violencenis an extension of in-person violence.,In our country,,more girls and women have beennmurdered by their intimate partners,than died on 9/11,and have died sincenin Afghanistan and Iraq combined.,And it's not cool to say that,,but it is true.,We care so much geopoliticallynabout what men are doing over there,to women over there ...,In 2015,,72,828 women used intimatenpartner violence services in this country.,That is not counting the girlsnand women and boys who needed them.,Law enforcement must be empowered,with up-to-date internet technology,,the devices and an understandingnof these platforms --,how they work.,The police wanted to be helpfulnwhen Amanda Hess called,about the death threatnshe was getting on Twitter,,but they couldn't really when they said,,"What's Twitter?" 
 Our legislators must writenand pass astute legislation,that reflects today's technology,and our notions of free and hate speech.,In New York recently, the lawncould not be applied to a perpetrator,because the crimesnmust have been committed --,even if it was anonymous --,they must have been committednby telephone, in mail,,by telegraph -- 
 (Laughter) 
 The language must bentechnologically neutral. 
 So apparently,,I've got a pretty bold voice.,So, let's talk about our friends ...,white men.,You have a role to playnand a choice to make.,You can do something,,or you can do nothing.,We're cool in this room,,but when this goes out, everyone will say,,"Oh my God, she's a reverse racist.",That quote was saidnby a white man, Robert Moritz,,chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers,,he asked me to include it in my talk. 
 We need to grow support linesnand help groups,,so victims can help each other,when their lives and financesnhave been derailed.,We must as individuals disruptngender violence as it is happening.,92 percent of young people,29 and under witness it.,72 percent of us have witnessed it.,We must have the courage and urgency,to practice stopping itnas it is unfolding. 
 And lastly,,believe her.,Believe her. 
 (Applause) 
 This is fundamentallyna problem of human interaction.,And as I believe that human interactionnis at the core of our healing,,trauma not transformednwill be trauma transferred. 
 Edith Wharton said,n"The end is latent in the beginning,",so we are going to end this talknreplacing hate speech with love speech.,Because I get lonely in this,,but I know that we are allies.,I recently learned,about how gratitude and affirmationsnoffset negative interactions.,It takes five of thosento offset one negative interaction,,and gratitude in particular --,free, available globallynany time, anywhere,,to anyone in any dialect --,it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate,,a watershed part of the brain,that floods it with great, good stuff.,So I'm going to saynawesome stuff about myself.,I would like for younto reflect it back to me.,It might sound something like this -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I am a powerful and strong woman,nand you would say, "Yes, you are." 
 Audience: Yes, you are. 
 Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. 
 A: Yes, she does. 
 AJ: I did a great job with my talk. 
 A: Yes, you did. 
 AJ: I have a right to be here. 
 A: Yes, you do. 
 AJ: I'm really cute. 
 (Laughter) 
 A: Yes, you are. 
 AJ: God does good work. 
 A: Yes, He does. 
 AJ: And I love you.,Thank you so muchnfor letting me be of service. 
 Bless you. 
 (Applause)Like many of us,,I've had several careers in my life,,and although they've been varied,,my first job set the foundationnfor all of them.,I was a home-birth midwifenthroughout my 20s.,Delivering babies taught menvaluable and sometimes surprising things,,like how to start a car at 2am.,when it's 10 degrees below zero. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or how to revive a fathernwho's fainted at the sight of blood. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so,,to make a beautiful belly button. 
 But those aren't the thingsnthat stuck with me or guided me,when I stopped being a midwifenand started other jobs.,What stuck with me was this bedrock belief,that each one of us comes into this worldnwith a unique worth.,When I looked into the face of a newborn,,I caught a glimpse of that worthiness,,that sense of unapologetic selfhood,,that unique spark.,I use the word "soul"nto describe that spark,,because it's the only word in Englishnthat comes close to naming,what each baby brought into the room. 
 Every newborn was as singularnas a snowflake,,a matchless mash-up of biology,and ancestry and mystery.,And then that baby grows up,,and in order to fit into the family,,to conform to the culture,,to the community, to the gender,,that little one begins to cover its soul,,layer by layer.,We're born this way,,but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But as we grow, a lotnof things happen to us,that make us ...,want to hide our soulfulneccentricities and authenticity.,We've all done this.,Everyone in this room is a former baby -- 
 (Laughter) 
 with a distinctive birthright.,But as adults, we spend so muchnof our time uncomfortable in our own skin,,like we have ADD:nauthenticity deficit disorder.,But not those babies --,not yet.,Their message to me was:,uncover your soul,and look for that soul-spark,in everyone else.,It's still there. 
 And here's what I learnednfrom laboring women.,Their message was about staying open,,even when things are painful.,A woman's cervix normally looks like this.,It's a tight little muscle,at the base of the uterus.,And during labor,nit has to stretch from this,to this.,Ouch!,If you fight against that pain,,you just create more pain,,and you block what wants to be born. 
 I'll never forget the magicnthat would happen,when a woman stopped resisting the pain,and opened.,It was as if the forcesnof the universe took notice,and sent in a wave of help.,I never forgot that message,,and now, when difficultnor painful things happen to me,in my life or my work,,of course at first I resist them,,but then I remembernwhat I learned from the mothers:,stay open.,Stay curious.,Ask the pain what it's come to deliver.,Something new wants to be born. 
 And there was one more big soulful lesson,,and that one I learnednfrom Albert Einstein.,He wasn't at any of the births, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It was a lesson about time.,At the end of his life,nAlbert Einstein concluded,that our normal, hamster-wheelnexperience of life,is an illusion.,We run round and round, faster and faster,,trying to get somewhere.,And all the while,,underneath surface timenis this whole other dimension,where the past and the presentnand the future merge,and become deep time.,And there's nowhere to get to. 
 Albert Einstein callednthis state, this dimension,,"only being.",And he said when he experienced it,,he knew sacred awe.,When I was delivering babies,,I was forced off the hamster wheel.,Sometimes I had to sit for days,nhours and hours,,just breathing with the parents;,just being.,And I got a big dose of sacred awe. 
 So those are the three lessonsnI took with me from midwifery.,One: uncover your soul.,Two: when things get difficultnor painful, try to stay open.,And three: every now and then,nstep off your hamster wheel,into deep time. 
 Those lessons have served menthroughout my life,,but they really served me recently,,when I took on the mostnimportant job of my life thus far. 
 Two years ago, my younger sisterncame out of remission,from a rare blood cancer,,and the only treatment left for hernwas a bone marrow transplant.,And against the odds,nwe found a match for her,,who turned out to be me.,I come from a family of four girls,,and when my sisters found out thatnI was my sister's perfect genetic match,,their reaction was, "Really? You?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "A perfect match for her?",Which is pretty typical for siblings.,In a sibling society,nthere's lots of things.,There's love and there's friendshipnand there's protection.,But there's also jealousy,and competition,and rejection and attack.,In siblinghood, that's where we startnassembling many of those first layers,that cover our soul. 
 When I discovered I was my sister's match,,I went into research mode.,And I discovered that,the premise of transplantsnis pretty straightforward.,You destroy all the bone marrownin the cancer patient,with massive doses of chemotherapy,,and then you replace that marrow,with several million healthynmarrow cells from a donor.,And then you do everything you can,to make sure that those new cellsnengraft in the patient.,I also learned that bone marrowntransplants are fraught with danger.,If my sister made itnthrough the near-lethal chemotherapy,,she still would face other challenges.,My cells,might attack her body.,And her body might reject my cells.,They call this rejection or attack,,and both could kill her. 
 Rejection. Attack.,Those words had a familiar ring,in the context of being siblings.,My sister and I hadna long history of love,,but we also had a long historynof rejection and attack,,from minor misunderstandingsnto bigger betrayals.,We didn't haventhe kind of the relationship,where we talked about the deeper stuff;,but, like many siblings and like peoplenin all kinds of relationships,,we were hesitant to tell our truths,,to reveal our wounds,,to admit our wrongdoings. 
 But when I learned aboutnthe dangers of rejection or attack,,I thought, it's time to change this.,What if we left the bone marrowntransplant up to the doctors,,but did something that we later camento call our "soul marrow transplant?",What if we faced any painnwe had caused each other,,and instead of rejection or attack,,could we listen?,Could we forgive?,Could we merge?,Would that teach our cells to do the same? 
 To woo my skeptical sister,nI turned to my parents' holy text:,the New Yorker Magazine. 
 (Laughter) 
 I sent her a cartoon from its pages,as a way of explainingnwhy we should visit a therapist,before having my bone marrow harvestednand transplanted into her body.,Here it is. 
 "I have never forgiven him for that thingnI made up in my head." 
 (Laughter) 
 I told my sister,we had probably been doing the same thing,,carting around made-up storiesnin our heads that kept us separate.,And I told her that after the transplant,,all of the blood flowing in her veins,would be my blood,,made from my marrow cells,,and that inside the nucleusnof each of those cells,is a complete set of my DNA.,"I will be swimming around in younfor the rest of your life,",I told my slightly horrified sister. 
 (Laughter) 
 "I think we better clean upnour relationship." 
 A health crisis makes peoplendo all sorts of risky things,,like quitting a jobnor jumping out of an airplane,and, in the case of my sister,,saying "yes" to several therapy sessions,,during which we got down to the marrow.,We looked at and released years of stories,and assumptions about each other,and blame and shame,until all that was left was love. 
 People have said I was bravento undergo the bone marrow harvest,,but I don't think so.,What felt brave to me,was that other kindnof harvest and transplant,,the soul marrow transplant,,getting emotionally nakednwith another human being,,putting aside pride and defensiveness,,lifting the layers,and sharing with each othernour vulnerable souls.,I called on those midwife lessons:,uncover your soul.,Open to what's scary and painful.,Look for the sacred awe. 
 Here I am with my marrow cellsnafter the harvest.,That's they call it -- "harvest,",like it's some kind of bucolicnfarm-to-table event -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Which I can assure you it is not.,And here is my brave, brave sister,receiving my cells.,After the transplant, we began to spendnmore and more time together.,It was as if we were little girls again.,The past and the present merged.,We entered deep time.,I left the hamster wheel of work and life,to join my sister,on that lonely island,of illness and healing.,We spent months together --,in the isolation unit,,in the hospital and in her home. 
 Our fast-paced society,does not support or even valuenthis kind of work.,We see it as a disruptionnof real life and important work.,We worry about the emotional drainnand the financial cost --,and, yes, there is a financial cost.,But I was paid,in the kind of currency our culturenseems to have forgotten all about.,I was paid in love.,I was paid in soul.,I was paid in my sister. 
 My sister said the year after transplantnwas the best year of her life,,which was surprising.,She suffered so much.,But she said life never tasted as sweet,,and that because of the soul-baring,and the truth-tellingnwe had done with each other,,she became more unapologetically herself,with everyone.,She said thingsnshe'd always needed to say.,She did things she always wanted to do.,The same happened for me.,I became braver about being authenticnwith the people in my life.,I said my truths,,but more important than that,nI sought the truth of others. 
 It wasn't untilnthe final chapter of this story,that I realized just how wellnmidwifery had trained me.,After that best year of my sister's life,,the cancer came roaring back,,and this time there was nothing morenthe doctors could do.,They gave her justna couple of months to live. 
 The night before my sister died,,I sat by her bedside.,She was so small and thin.,I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.,It was my blood, her blood, our blood.,When she died, part of me would die, too. 
 I tried to make sense of it all,,how becoming one with each other,had made us more ourselves,,our soul selves,,and how by facing and openingnto the pain of our past,,we'd finally been delivered to each other,,and how by stepping out of time,,we would now be connected forever. 
 My sister left me with so many things,,and I'm going to leave you nownwith just one of them.,You don't have to waitnfor a life-or-death situation,to clean up the relationshipsnthat matter to you,,to offer the marrow of your soul,and to seek it in another.,We can all do this.,We can be like a new kindnof first responder,,like the one to takenthe first courageous step,toward the other,,and to do something or try to do something,other than rejection or attack.,We can do this with our siblings,and our mates,and our friends and our colleagues.,We can do this with the disconnection,and the discord all around us.,We can do this for the soul of the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to try something new.,Those of you who are able,,please stand up.,OK, so I'm going to name some names.,When you hear a namenthat you don't recognize,,you can't tell me anything about them,,I'd like you to take a seat,and stay seated.,The last person standing,nwe're going to see what they know. OK? 
 (Laughter) 
 All right.,Eric Garner.,Mike Brown.,Tamir Rice.,Freddie Gray. 
 So those of you who are still standing,,I'd like you to turn aroundnand take a look.,I'd say half to most of the peoplenare still standing.,So let's continue. 
 Michelle Cusseaux.,Tanisha Anderson.,Aura Rosser.,Meagan Hockaday. 
 So if we look around again,,there are about four peoplenstill standing,,and actually I'm not goingnto put you on the spot.,I just say that to encourage transparency,nso you can be seated. 
 (Laughter) 
 So those of you who recognizednthe first group of names know,that these were African-Americansnwho have been killed by the police,over the last two and a half years.,What you may not know,is that the other listnis also African-Americans,who have been killednwithin the last two years.,Only one thing distinguishesnthe names that you know,from the names that you don't know:,gender. 
 So let me first let you knownthat there's nothing at all distinct,about this audience,that explains the pattern of recognitionnthat we've just seen.,I've done this exercisendozens of times around the country.,I've done it to women'snrights organizations.,I've done it with civil rights groups.,I've done it with professors.nI've done it with students.,I've done it with psychologists.nI've done it with sociologists.,I've done it even withnprogressive members of Congress.,And everywhere, the awarenessnof the level of police violence,that black women experience,is exceedingly low. 
 Now, it is surprising, isn't it,nthat this would be the case.,I mean, there are two issuesninvolved here.,There's police violencenagainst African-Americans,,and there's violence against women,,two issues that have beenntalked about a lot lately.,But when we think aboutnwho is implicated by these problems,,when we think aboutnwho is victimized by these problems,,the names of these black womennnever come to mind. 
 Now, communications experts tell us,that when facts do not fitnwith the available frames,,people have a difficult timenincorporating new facts,into their way of thinkingnabout a problem.,These women's namesnhave slipped through our consciousness,because there are no framesnfor us to see them,,no frames for us to remember them,,no frames for us to hold them.,As a consequence,,reporters don't lead with them,,policymakers don't think about them,,and politicians aren't encouragednor demanded that they speak to them. 
 Now, you might ask,,why does a frame matter?,I mean, after all,,an issue that affects black peoplenand an issue that affects women,,wouldn't that necessarily includenblack people who are women,and women who are black people?,Well, the simple answer is that this isna trickle-down approach to social justice,,and many times it just doesn't work.,Without frames that allow us to see,how social problems impactnall the members of a targeted group,,many will fall through the cracksnof our movements,,left to suffer in virtual isolation.,But it doesn't have to be this way. 
 Many years ago, I began to usenthe term "intersectionality",to deal with the factnthat many of our social justice problems,like racism and sexism,are often overlapping,,creating multiple levelsnof social injustice. 
 Now, the experiencenthat gave rise to intersectionality,was my chance encounternwith a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.,Emma DeGraffenreidnwas an African-American woman,,a working wife and a mother.,I actually read about Emma's storynfrom the pages of a legal opinion,written by a judgenwho had dismissed Emma's claim,of race and gender discrimination,against a local car manufacturing plant.,Emma, like so many African-American women,,sought better employmentnfor her family and for others.,She wanted to create a better lifenfor her children and for her family.,But she applied for a job,,and she was not hired,,and she believed that she was not hirednbecause she was a black woman. 
 Now, the judge in questionndismissed Emma's suit,,and the argumentnfor dismissing the suit was,that the employerndid hire African-Americans,and the employer hired women.,The real problem, though, that the judgenwas not willing to acknowledge,was what Emma was actually trying to say,,that the African-Americansnthat were hired,,usually for industrial jobs,nmaintenance jobs, were all men.,And the women that were hired,,usually for secretarialnor front-office work,,were all white.,Only if the court was able to seenhow these policies came together,would he be able to seenthe double discrimination,that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.,But the court refused to allow Emmanto put two causes of action together,to tell her story,because he believed that,nby allowing her to do that,,she would be ablento have preferential treatment.,She would have an advantagenby having two swings at the bat,,when African-American men and white womennonly had one swing at the bat.,But of course, neithernAfrican-American men or white women,needed to combine a racenand gender discrimination claim,to tell the story of the discriminationnthey were experiencing.,Why wasn't the real unfairness,law's refusal to protectnAfrican-American women,simply because their experiencesnweren't exactly the same,as white women and African-American men?,Rather than broadening the framento include African-American women,,the court simply tossed their casencompletely out of court. 
 Now, as a studentnof antidiscrimination law,,as a feminist,,as an antiracist,,I was struck by this case.,It felt to me like injustice squared.,So first of all,,black women weren't allowednto work at the plant.,Second of all, the courtndoubled down on this exclusion,by making it legally inconsequential.,And to boot, there wasnno name for this problem.,And we all know that,nwhere there's no name for a problem,,you can't see a problem,,and when you can't see a problem,nyou pretty much can't solve it. 
 Many years later, I had come to recognize,that the problem that Emma was facingnwas a framing problem.,The frame that the court was using,to see gender discriminationnor to see race discrimination,was partial, and it was distorting.,For me, the challenge that I faced was,trying to figure out whethernthere was an alternative narrative,,a prism that would allow usnto see Emma's dilemma,,a prism that would allow usnto rescue her from the cracks in the law,,that would allow judges to see her story. 
 So it occurred to me,,maybe a simple analogy to an intersection,might allow judgesnto better see Emma's dilemma.,So if we think about this intersection,nthe roads to the intersection would be,the way that the workforcenwas structured by race and by gender.,And then the traffic in those roadsnwould be the hiring policies,and the other practicesnthat ran through those roads.,Now, because Emmanwas both black and female,,she was positioned preciselynwhere those roads overlapped,,experiencing the simultaneous impact,of the company's gender and race traffic.,The law -- the law isnlike that ambulance that shows up,and is ready to treat Emmanonly if it can be shown,that she was harmednon the race road or on the gender road,but not where those roads intersected. 
 So what do you callnbeing impacted by multiple forces,and then abandoned to fend for yourself?,Intersectionality seemed to do it for me. 
 I would go on to learnnthat African-American women,,like other women of color,,like other socially marginalized peoplenall over the world,,were facing all kindsnof dilemmas and challenges,as a consequence of intersectionality,,intersections of race and gender,,of heterosexism, transphobia,nxenophobia, ableism,,all of these social dynamics come together,and create challengesnthat are sometimes quite unique.,But in the same way,that intersectionality,raised our awareness to the waynthat black women live their lives,,it also exposes the tragic circumstances,under which African-American women die. 
 Police violence against black women,is very real.,The level of violencenthat black women face,is such that it's not surprising,that some of them do not surviventheir encounters with police.,Black girls as young as seven,,great grandmothers as old as 95,have been killed by the police.,They've been killed in their living rooms,,in their bedrooms.,They've been killed in their cars.,They've been killed on the street.,They've been killednin front of their parents,and they've been killednin front of their children.,They have been shot to death.,They have been stomped to death.,They have been suffocated to death.,They have been manhandled to death.,They have been tasered to death.,They've been killednwhen they've called for help.,They've been killed when they were alone,,and they've been killednwhen they were with others.,They've been killed shopping while black,,driving while black,,having a mental disability while black,,having a domestic disturbance while black.,They've even been killednbeing homeless while black.,They've been killedntalking on the cell phone,,laughing with friends,,sitting in a car reported as stolen,and making a U-turnnin front of the White House,with an infant strappednin the backseat of the car.,Why don't we know these stories?,Why is it that their lost lives,don't generate the same amountnof media attention and communal outcry,as the lost livesnof their fallen brothers?,It's time for a change. 
 So what can we do?,In 2014, the African-AmericannPolicy Forum began to demand,that we "say her name",at rallies, at protests,,at conferences, at meetings,,anywhere and everywhere,that state violence against black bodiesnis being discussed.,But saying her name is not enough.,We have to be willing to do more.,We have to be willing to bear witness,,to bear witnessnto the often painful realities,that we would just rather not confront,,the everyday violence and humiliationnthat many black women have had to face,,black women across color,,age, gender expression,,sexuality and ability. 
 So we have the opportunity right now --,bearing in mind that some of the imagesnthat I'm about to share with you,may be triggering for some --,to collectively bear witnessnto some of this violence.,We're going to hear the voicenof the phenomenal Abby Dobson.,And as we sit with these women,,some who have experienced violencenand some who have not survived them,,we have an opportunity,to reverse what happenednat the beginning of this talk,,when we could not stand for these women,because we did not know their names. 
 So at the end of this clip,nthere's going to be a roll call.,Several black women's names will come up.,I'd like those of you who are ablento join us in saying these names,as loud as you can,,randomly, disorderly.,Let's create a cacophony of sound,to represent our intention,to hold these women up,,to sit with them,,to bear witness to them,,to bring them into the light. 
 (Singing) Abby Dobson: Say,,say her name. 
 Say,,say her name. 
 (Audience) Shelly! 
 (Audience) Kayla! 
 AD: Oh,,say her name. 
 (Audience shouting names) 
 Say, say,,say her name. 
 Say her name. 
 For all the names,I'll never know, 
 say her name. 
 KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones,nJanisha Fonville,,Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore,,Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd,,Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith. 
 AD: Say her name. 
 KC: So I said at the beginning,,if we can't see a problem,,we can't fix a problem.,Together, we've come togethernto bear witness,to these women's lost lives.,But the time now is to move,from mourning and grief,to action and transformation.,This is something that we can do.,It's up to us. 
 Thank you for joining us.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)When people find outnI write about time management,,they assume two things.,One is that I'm always on time,,and I'm not.,I have four small children,,and I would like to blame themnfor my occasional tardiness,,but sometimes it's just not their fault.,I was once late to my own speechnon time management. 
 (Laughter) 
 We all had to just take a momentntogether and savor that irony. 
 The second thing they assumenis that I have lots of tips and tricks,for saving bits of time here and there.,Sometimes I'll hear from magazinesnthat are doing a story along these lines,,generally on how to help their readersnfind an extra hour in the day.,And the idea is that we'll shavenbits of time off everyday activities,,add it up,,and we'll have time for the good stuff.,I question the entire premisenof this piece, but I'm always interested,in hearing what they've comenup with before they call me.,Some of my favorites:,doing errands where you onlynhave to make right-hand turns -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Being extremely judiciousnin microwave usage:,it says three to three-and-a-halfnminutes on the package,,we're totally getting in onnthe bottom side of that.,And my personal favorite,nwhich makes sense on some level,,is to DVR your favorite shows so you cannfast-forward through the commercials.,That way, you saveneight minutes every half hour,,so in the course of two hoursnof watching TV,,you find 32 minutes to exercise. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which is true.,You know another way to findn32 minutes to exercise?,Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, the idea is we'll save bitsnof time here and there, add it up,,we will finally getnto everything we want to do.,But after studying how successfulnpeople spend their time,and looking at theirnschedules hour by hour,,I think this ideanhas it completely backward.,We don't build the livesnwe want by saving time.,We build the lives we want,,and then time saves itself. 
 Here's what I mean.,I recently did a time diary project,looking at 1,001 days in the livesnof extremely busy women.,They had demanding jobs,nsometimes their own businesses,,kids to care for,nmaybe parents to care for,,community commitments --,busy, busy people.,I had them keep tracknof their time for a week,so I could add up how muchnthey worked and slept,,and I interviewed themnabout their strategies, for my book. 
 One of the women whose time log I studied,goes out on a Wednesday nightnfor something.,She comes home to findnthat her water heater has broken,,and there is now waternall over her basement.,If you've ever had anythingnlike this happen to you,,you know it is a hugely damaging,nfrightening, sopping mess.,So she's dealing with the immediatenaftermath that night,,next day she's got plumbers coming in,,day after that, professional cleaningncrew dealing with the ruined carpet.,All this is being recordednon her time log.,Winds up taking seven hours of her week.,Seven hours.,That's like findingnan extra hour in the day. 
 But I'm sure if you had asked hernat the start of the week,,"Could you find seven hoursnto train for a triathlon?","Could you find seven hoursnto mentor seven worthy people?",I'm sure she would've saidnwhat most of us would've said,,which is, "No -- can't you seenhow busy I am?",Yet when she had to find seven hours,because there is waternall over her basement,,she found seven hours.,And what this shows usnis that time is highly elastic.,We cannot make more time,,but time will stretch to accommodatenwhat we choose to put into it. 
 And so the key to time management,is treating our priorities,as the equivalentnof that broken water heater.,To get at this,,I like to use language from onenof the busiest people I ever interviewed.,By busy, I mean she was runningna small business,with 12 people on the payroll,,she had six children in her spare time.,I was getting in touch with hernto set up an interview,on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.,I remember it was a Thursday morning,,and she was not availablento speak with me.,Of course, right? 
 But the reason she wasnunavailable to speak with me,is that she was out for a hike,,because it was a beautiful spring morning,,and she wanted to go for a hike.,So of course this makes meneven more intrigued,,and when I finally do catch up with her,nshe explains it like this.,She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,,every minute I spend, is my choice.",And rather than say,,"I don't have time to do x, y or z,",she'd say, "I don't do x, y or znbecause it's not a priority.","I don't have time," often meansn"It's not a priority.",If you think about it,nthat's really more accurate language.,I could tell you I don't have timento dust my blinds,,but that's not true.,If you offered to pay me $100,000nto dust my blinds,,I would get to it pretty quickly. 
 (Laughter) 
 Since that is not going to happen,,I can acknowledge this is notna matter of lacking time;,it's that I don't want to do it.,Using this language reminds usnthat time is a choice.,And granted,,there may be horrible consequencesnfor making different choices,,I will give you that.,But we are smart people,,and certainly over the long run,,we have the power to fill our lives,with the things that deserve to be there. 
 So how do we do that?,How do we treat our priorities,as the equivalentnof that broken water heater? 
 Well, first we neednto figure out what they are.,I want to give you two strategiesnfor thinking about this.,The first, on the professional side:,I'm sure many peoplencoming up to the end of the year,are giving or gettingnannual performance reviews.,You look back overnyour successes over the year,,your "opportunities for growth.",And this serves its purpose,,but I find it's more effectivento do this looking forward.,So I want you to pretendnit's the end of next year.,You're giving yourselfna performance review,,and it has been an absolutelynamazing year for you professionally.,What three to five things did you donthat made it so amazing?,So you can write nextnyear's performance review now. 
 And you can do thisnfor your personal life, too.,I'm sure many of you,nlike me, come December,,get cards that contain these folded upnsheets of colored paper,,on which is written what is knownnas the family holiday letter. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bit of a wretched genrenof literature, really,,going on about how amazingneveryone in the household is,,or even more scintillating,,how busy everyone in the household is.,But these letters serve a purpose,,which is that they tellnyour friends and family,what you did in your personal lifenthat mattered to you over the year.,So this year's kind of done,,but I want you to pretendnit's the end of next year,,and it has been an absolutely amazing year,for you and the people you care about.,What three to five things did you donthat made it so amazing?,So you can write nextnyear's family holiday letter now.,Don't send it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Please, don't send it.,But you can write it.,And now, between the performancenreview and the family holiday letter,,we have a list of six to ten goalsnwe can work on in the next year. 
 And now we need to breaknthese down into doable steps.,So maybe you wantnto write a family history.,First, you can readnsome other family histories,,get a sense for the style.,Then maybe think about the questionsnyou want to ask your relatives,,set up appointments to interview them.,Or maybe you want to run a 5K.,So you need to find a race and sign up,nfigure out a training plan,,and dig those shoesnout of the back of the closet.,And then -- this is key --,we treat our priorities as the equivalentnof that broken water heater,,by putting them into our schedules first.,We do this by thinking through our weeksnbefore we are in them. 
 I find a really good time to do thisnis Friday afternoons.,Friday afternoon is whatnan economist might call,a "low opportunity cost" time.,Most of us are not sitting therenon Friday afternoons saying,,"I am excited to make progress,toward my personalnand professional priorities,right now." 
 (Laughter) 
 But we are willing to thinknabout what those should be.,So take a little bitnof time Friday afternoon,,make yourself a three-category prioritynlist: career, relationships, self.,Making a three-category list reminds us,that there should be somethingnin all three categories.,Career, we think about;,relationships, self --,not so much.,But anyway, just a short list,,two to three items in each.,Then look out over the wholenof the next week,,and see where you can plan them in. 
 Where you plan them in is up to you.,I know this is going to be morencomplicated for some people than others.,I mean, some people's livesnare just harder than others.,It is not going to be easynto find time to take that poetry class,if you are caring for multiplenchildren on your own.,I get that.,And I don't want to minimizenanyone's struggle.,But I do think that the numbersnI am about to tell you are empowering. 
 There are 168 hours in a week.,Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.,That is a lot of time.,If you are working a full-timenjob, so 40 hours a week,,sleeping eight hours a night,nso 56 hours a week --,that leaves 72 hours for other things.,That is a lot of time.,You say you're working 50 hours a week,,maybe a main job and a side hustle.,Well, that leaves 62 hoursnfor other things.,You say you're working 60 hours.,Well, that leaves 52 hoursnfor other things.,You say you're working more than 60 hours.,Well, are you sure? 
 (Laughter) 
 There was once a study comparingnpeople's estimated work weeks,with time diaries.,They found that people claimingn75-plus-hour work weeks,were off by about 25 hours. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can guess in which direction, right?,Anyway, in 168 hours a week,,I think we can find timenfor what matters to you.,If you want to spendnmore time with your kids,,you want to study morenfor a test you're taking,,you want to exercise for three hoursnand volunteer for two,,you can.,And that's even if you're workingnway more than full-time hours. 
 So we have plenty of time, which is great,,because guess what?,We don't even need that muchntime to do amazing things.,But when most of us havenbits of time, what do we do?,Pull out the phone, right?,Start deleting emails.,Otherwise, we're putteringnaround the house,or watching TV. 
 But small moments can have great power.,You can use your bits of time,for bits of joy.,Maybe it's choosing to readnsomething wonderful on the bus,on the way to work.,I know when I had a jobnthat required two bus rides,and a subway ride every morning,,I used to go to the librarynon weekends to get stuff to read.,It made the whole experiencenalmost, almost, enjoyable.,Breaks at work can be usednfor meditating or praying.,If family dinner is outnbecause of your crazy work schedule,,maybe family breakfastncould be a good substitute. 
 It's about looking atnthe whole of one's time,and seeing where the good stuff can go.,I truly believe this.,There is time.,Even if we are busy,,we have time for what matters.,And when we focus on what matters,,we can build the lives we want,in the time we've got. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am so excited to be here.,Everything in Americanis so much bigger than in Europe.,Look at me -- I am huge! 
 (Laughter) 
 It's fantastic!,And TED Talks -- TED Talksnare where everybody has great ideas.,So the question is: Where donthose great ideas come from?,Well, it's a little bit of debate,,but it's generally reckonednthat the average person --,that's me --,has about 50,000 thoughts a day.,Which is a lot,,until you realize that 95 percent of them,are the same ones you had the day before. 
 (Laughter) 
 And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?,I think things like,,"Oh! I know -- I must clean the floor.,Oh! I forgot to walk the dog.",My most popular:,"Don't eat that cookie." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, 95 percent repetition.,That leaves us with just a five percentnwindow of opportunity each day,to actually think something new.,And some of my new thoughts are useless.,The other day I was watchingnsome sports on television,,and I was trying to decidenwhy I just don't engage with it.,Some of it I find curious.,This is odd. 
 (Laughter) 
 Do you think it would benworth being that flexible,just to be able to seenyour heel at that angle? 
 (Laughter) 
 And here's the thing:,I'm never going to be ablento relate to that,,because I'm never goingnto be able to do it, OK?,Well, not twice, anyway. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I'll tell you the truth.,The truth is I have never beennany good at sport, OK?,I've reached that wonderful agenwhen all my friends say,,"Oh, I wish I was as fitnas I was when I was 18.",And I always feel rather smug then. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm exactly as fit as I was when I -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I couldn't run then. I'm certainlynnot going to do it now. 
 (Laughter) 
 So then I had my new idea:,Why not engage people like me in sport?,I think what the world needs now,is the Olympics for peoplenwith zero athletic ability. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, it would be so much more fun.,We'd have three basic rules, OK?,Obviously no drugs;nno corruption, no skills. 
 (Laughter) 
 It would be --,No, it's a terrible idea.,And I also know why I don't engagenwith sport when I watch it on television.,It's because probably 97 percent of itnis about men running,and men kicking things,,men trying to looknneatly packaged in Lycra.,There is -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Not always successfully.,There is -- 
 (Laughter) 
 There is so littlenfemale sport on television,,that a young woman watchingnmight be forgiven for thinking,,and how can I put this nicely,,that the male membernis the very lever you need,to get yourself off the couchnand onto a sports ground. 
 (Laughter) 
 The inequalities in sportnare breathtaking. 
 So this is what happens to me:,I have a brand new idea,,and immediately I come back to an old one.,The fact is, there is not now,,nor has there ever beennin the whole of history,,a single country in the worldnwhere women have equality with men.,Not one.,196 countries,,it hasn't happenednin the whole of evolution. 
 So, here is a picture of evolution. 
 (Laughter) 
 We women are not even in it! 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a wonder men have been ablento evolve quite so brilliantly.,So -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It bugs me, and I knownI should do something about it.,But I'm busy, OK?,I have a full-on career,,I've got three kids,nI've got an elderly mom.,In fact, if I'm honest with you,,one of the reasons I came out here,is because TED Talks saidnI could have 15 minutes to myself,,and I never have that much time -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So I'm busy.,And anyway, I already had a gonat changing the world.,Here's the thing, OK?,Everybody has inside themselvesnwhat I call an "activation button.",It's the button that getsnpressed when you think,,"I must do something about this.",It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.,Maybe you face some kind of inequality,,or you've come acrossnan injustice of some kind,,sometimes an illness strikes,,or you're born in some way disadvantaged,,or perhaps underprivileged.,So I was born gay, OK?,I've always known,,I don't think my familynwere the least bit surprised.,Here is a picture of me aged four.,I look cute,,but inside I genuinely believednthat I looked like Clint Eastwood. 
 (Laughter) 
 So my activation buttonnwas pressed when I had my kids --,three wonderful kids,nborn to my then-partner.,Now here's the thing:nI work on television in Britain.,By the time they were born,nI was already hosting my own shows,and working in the public eye.,I love what I do,,but I love my kids more.,And I didn't want themnto grow up with a secret.,1994, when my son, my youngest was born,,there was not, as far as I was aware,,a single out, gay womannin British public life.,I don't think secrets are a good thing.,I think they are a cancer of the soul.,So I decided to come out. 
 Everybody warned menthat I would never work again,,but I decided it wasnabsolutely worth the risk.,Well, it was hell.,In Britain, we have a particularly viciousnsection of the right-wing press,,and they went nuts.,And their hatred stirred upnthe less stable elements of society,,and we got death threats --,enough death threatsnthat I had to take the kids into hiding,,and we had to have police protection.,And I promise you there werenmany moments in the still of the night,when I was terrified by what I had done. 
 Eventually the dust settled.,Against all expectationnI carried on working,,and my kids were and continuento be absolutely fantastic.,I remember when my son was six,nhe had a friend over to play.,They were in the next room;nI could hear them chatting.,The friend said to my son,n"What's it like having two mums?",I was a little anxious to hear,nso I leant in to hear and my son said,,"It's fantastic,nbecause if one of them's sick,,you've still got another onento cook for you." 
 (Laughter) 
 So my activation buttonnfor gay equality was pressed,,and along with many, many others,,I campaigned for years for gay rights,,and in particular, the right to marrynthe person that I love.,In the end, we succeeded.,And in 2014, on the daynthat the law was changed,,I married my wife,nwho I love very much, indeed. 
 (Applause) 
 We didn't do it in a quiet way --nwe did it on the stage,at the Royal Festival Hall in London.,It was a great event.,The hall seats two-and-a-halfnthousand people.,We invited 150 family and friends,nthen I let it be known to the public:,anybody who wanted to come and celebrate,nplease come and join us.,It would be free to anybodynwho wanted to come.,Two-and-half thousand people turned up. 
 (Applause) 
 Every kind of person you can imagine:,gays, straights, rabbis,nnuns, married people,,black, white -- the wholenof humanity was there.,And I remember standingnon that stage thinking, "How fantastic.,Job done.,Love triumphs.,Law changed.",And I -- 
 (Applause) 
 And I genuinely thoughtnmy activation days were over, OK?,So every year in that same hall,,I host a fantastic concert to celebratenInternational Women's Day.,We gather the world's onlynall-female orchestra,,we play fantastic music by forgottennor overlooked women composers,,we have amazing conductors --,it's Marin Alsop therenfrom Baltimore conducting,,Petula Clark singing --,and I give a lecture on women's history.,I love to gather inspirational storiesnfrom the past and pass them on.,Too often, I think history's what I callnthe Mount Rushmore model.,It looks majestic, but the womennhave been entirely left out of it. 
 And I was giving a talk in 2015nabout the suffragettes --,I'm sure you know those magnificentnwomen who fought so hard,for the right for womennin Britain to vote.,And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words.",And boy, they succeeded,,because women did indeednget the vote in 1928.,So I'm giving this talk about this,,and as I'm talking, what I realized is:,this was not a historynlecture I was giving;,this was not somethingnwhere the job was done.,This was something wherenthere was so much left to do.,Nowhere in the world, for example,,do women have equal representationnin positions of power. 
 OK, let's take a very quick looknat the top 100 companies,in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.,Top 100 companies:nHow many women running them?,Seven. OK. Seven.nThat's all right, I suppose.,Until you realize that 17nare run by men called "John." 
 (Laughter) 
 There are more men called Johnnrunning FTSE 100 companies -- 
 (Laughter) 
 than there are women.,There are 14 run by men called "Dave." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I'm sure Dave and Johnnare doing a bang-up job. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. Why does it matter?,Well, it's that pesky businessnof the gender pay gap.,Nowhere in the worldndo women earn the same as men.,And that is never going to change,unless we have more womennat the top in the boardroom.,We have plenty of laws;,the Equal Pay Act in Britainnwas passed in 1975.,Nevertheless, there are stillnmany, many women,who, from early Novembernuntil the end of the year,,by comparison to their male colleagues,,are effectively working for free.,In fact, the World EconomicnForum estimates,that women will finallynget equal pay in ...,2133!,Yay! 
 (Laughter) 
 That's a terrible figure.,And here's the thing:,the day before I came out to give my talk,,the World Economic Forum revised it.,So that's good, becausenthat's a terrible -- 2133.,Do you know what they revised it to?,2186. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, another 53 years, OK?,We are not going to get equal pay,in my grandchildren'sngrandchildren's lives,under the current system. 
 And I have waited long enough.,I've waited long enoughnin my own business.,In 2016 I became the verynfirst woman on British television,to host a prime-time panel show.,Isn't that great? Wonderful, I'm thrilled.,But -- 
 (Applause) 
 But 2016! The first!,Television's been around for 80 years! 
 (Laughter) 
 It may be television's not so important,,but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?,2016, the UN were lookingnfor a brand new ambassador,to represent women's empowermentnand gender equality,,and who did they choose?,Wonder Woman.,Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK? 
 (Laughter) 
 Because no woman was up to the job. 
 The representation of womennin positions of power is shockingly low.,It's true in Congress, and it's certainlyntrue in the British Parliament.,In 2015, the number of mennelected to the Parliament that year,was greater than the total number of women,who have ever been members of Parliament.,And why does it matter?,Here's the thing:nif they're not at the table --,literally, in Britain, at that tablenhelping to make the laws --,do not be surprised if the femalenperspective is overlooked. 
 It's a great role model for young peoplento see a woman in charge.,In 2016, Britain got its secondnfemale Prime Minister;,Theresa May came to power.,The day she came to powernshe was challenged:,just do one thing.,Do one thing in the firstn100 days that you're in office,to try and improvenlives for women in Britain.,And what did she do? Nothing.,Nothing.,Because she's much too busyncleaning up the mess the boys made.,Even having a female leader,,they always find something better to do,than to sort out the peskynissue of inequality. 
 So I keep talking about equalitynlike it matters. Does it?,Well, let's take a very quick looknat the STEM industries, OK?,So science, technology,nengineering and mathematics.,Pretty much important in everynsingle aspect of our daily lives.,There is the thickest and most incrediblynwell-documented glass ceiling,in the STEM industries.,What if the cure for cancer,or the answer the global warming,lies in the head of a young femalenscientist who fails to progress? 
 So I thought all these things,,and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words.",And I spoke to my wonderful friend,,brilliant journalistnCatherine Mayer in Britain,,and we rather foolishly --,and I suspect there was wine involved -- 
 (Laughter) 
 We decided to foundna brand new political party.,Because here's the critical thing:,the one place women and mennare absolutely equal is at the ballot box.,We had no idea what we were doing,,we didn't know how complicatednit was to start a political party.,I thought, "It can't be that difficult,nmen have been doing it for years." 
 (Laughter) 
 So we started by calling itn"The Women's Equality Party.",And straightaway people said to me,,"Why did you call it that?",I said, "I don't know,nI just thought we'd be clear." 
 (Laughter) 
 I didn't want what we were doingnto be a secret, you know? I just -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Some people said, "You can't call it that!nIt's much too feminist!",Ooh! Scary word! Ahh!,I can't tell you how many timesnI've heard somebody say,,"I'm not a feminist, but ...",And I always thinknif there's a "but" in the sentence,,it can't all be roses in the garden.,And then I started getting askednthe hilarious question,,"Are you all going to burn your bras?",Yes! Because bras are famouslynmade of flammable material. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's why all women spark when they walk. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's quick history sidebar for you:,no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.,It's a story made up by a journalist.,Thank goodness journalismnhas improved since then.,So -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I announced what we were goingnto do in a broadcast interview,,and straightaway,nthe emails started coming.,First hundreds,nthen thousands and thousands,,from every age group: from the very youngnto women in their '90s,,to hundreds of wonderful men.,People wrote and said,n"Please, can I help?,Please, can I visit younat party headquarters?",We didn't have a headquarters --nwe didn't have a party!,We didn't have anything.,All we had was a wonderful,ntight group of fabulous friends,trying to answer emailsnpretty much 24-7 in our pajamas. 
 We were all busy.,Many of us had careers,nmany of us had children,,but we did what women do,nand we shared the work.,And almost instantly, we agreednon certain fundamental things.,First thing: we want to benthe only political party in the world,whose main aim wasnto no longer need to exist.,That's a fantastic idea.,We wanted to be the only political partynwith no particular political leaning.,We wanted people from the left,nfrom the right, from the middle,,every age group.,Because the whole pointnwas to work with a simple agenda:,let's get equalitynin every aspect of our lives,,and when we're finished,,let's go home and getnthe other chores done. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we wanted to changenhow politics is conducted.,I don't know if you have this,,but in Britain we haventwo major political parties.,They're the dinosaurs of politics.,And how they speak to each othernis shameful and poisonous.,I'm sure you've never hadnthat kind of name-calling -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And lying here.,Wouldn't it be greatnif just one politician said,,"Do you know, my opponent has a point.,Let's see if we can't work togethernand get the job done." 
 (Applause) 
 And let's get more womenninto politics, OK?,Let's immediately getnmore women into politics,by being the only political partynto offer free childcare to our candidates,,so they can get out of the housenand start campaigning. 
 (Applause) 
 Within 10 months,,we had more than 70 branchesnof our party across the UK.,We stood candidates for electionnin London, Scotland and Wales,in May 2016.,One in 20 people votednfor our candidate for London Mayor.,And when the men in the racensaw how many votes we were attracting,,wonder of wonders,,they began to talk about the neednto tackle gender equality. 
 (Applause) 
 You know, I've been promisednchange since I was a child.,It was always coming:,women were going to standnshoulder to shoulder with men.,All I got were empty promisesnand disappointment --,enough disappointmentnto found a political party.,But here is my new idea for today --nthis is my five percent, OK?,And this one is really good.,The fact is, this is not enough.,It is not enough to found one politicalnparty for equality in a single country.,What we need is a seismic changenin the global political landscape.,And the wonderful thingnabout the model we have created,is that it would work anywhere.,It would work in America,,it would work in Australia,nit would work in India.,It's like we've made the perfect recipe:nanybody can cook it,,and it's good for everybody.,And we want to give it away.,If you want to know what we did,nwe're giving it away.,Can you imagine if we could mobilizenmillions of women across the world,to say, "That's enough!"nto the traditional battles of politics?,To say, "Stop the bickering,nlet's get the work done.",We could literally change the world.,And I want that. 
 (Applause) 
 I want ... 
 (Applause) 
 I want that for our daughters,,and I want it for our sons.,Because the fact is:nequality is better for everyone. 
 Come on people, let's activate!nLet's change the world!,I know we can do it, and it wants doing! 
 (Applause)So earlier this year,,I was informed that I would bendoing a TED Talk.,So I was excited, then I panicked,,then I was excited, then I panicked,,and in between the excitementnand the panicking,,I started to do my research,,and my research primarily consistednof Googling how to give a great TED Talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 And interspersed with that,,I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.,How many of you know who that is? 
 (Cheers) 
 So I was Googling hernbecause I always Google her,because I'm just a fan,,but also because she always hasnimportant and interesting things to say.,And the combination of those searches,kept leading me to her talk,on the dangers of a single story,,on what happensnwhen we have a solitary lens,through which to understandncertain groups of people,,and it is the perfect talk.,It's the talk that I would have givennif I had been famous first. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, and you know,nlike, she's African and I'm African,,and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist,,and she's a storytellernand I'm a storyteller,,so I really felt like it's my talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I decided that I was goingnto learn how to code,,and then I was going to hack the internet,and I would take down all the copiesnof that talk that existed,,and then I would memorize it,,and then I would come herenand deliver it as if it was my own speech.,So that plan was going really well,nexcept the coding part,,and then one morning a few months ago,,I woke up,to the news that the wifenof a certain presidential candidate,had given a speech that -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 that sounded eerily like a speechngiven by one of my other faves,,Michelle Obama. 
 (Cheers) 
 And so I decided that I shouldnprobably write my own TED Talk,,and so that is what I am here to do.,I'm here to talk aboutnmy own observations about storytelling.,I want to talk to younabout the power of stories, of course,,but I also want to talknabout their limitations,,particularly for those of usnwho are interested in social justice. 
 So since Adichie gave that talknseven years ago,,there has been a boom in storytelling.,Stories are everywhere,,and if there was a dangernin the telling of one tired old tale,,then I think there has got to benlots to celebrate about the flourishing,of so many stories and so many voices.,Stories are the antidote to bias.,In fact, today, if you are middle classnand connected via the internet,,you can download storiesnat the touch of a button,or the swipe of a screen.,You can listen to a podcast,about what it's likento grow up Dalit in Kolkata.,You can hear an indigenousnman in Australia,talk about the trials and triumphsnof raising his children in dignity,and in pride.,Stories make us fall in love.,They heal rifts and they bridge divides.,Stories can even make it easier for us,to talk about the deathsnof people in our societies,who don't matter,nbecause they make us care.,Right? 
 I'm not so sure,,and I actually work for a placencalled the Centre for Stories.,And my job is to help to tell stories,that challenge mainstream narrativesnabout what it means to be black,or a Muslim or a refugeenor any of those other categories,that we talk about all the time.,But I come to this work,after a long historynas a social justice activist,,and so I'm really interested in the ways,that people talknabout nonfiction storytelling,as though it's aboutnmore than entertainment,,as though it's about beingna catalyst for social action.,It's not uncommon to hear people say,that stories makenthe world a better place.,Increasingly, though, I worrynthat even the most poignant stories,,particularly the stories about peoplenwho no one seems to care about,,can often get in the waynof action towards social justice.,Now, this is not becausenstorytellers mean any harm.,Quite the contrary.,Storytellers are often do-goodersnlike me and, I suspect, yourselves.,And the audiences of storytellers,are often deeply compassionatenand empathetic people.,Still, good intentionsncan have unintended consequences,,and so I want to propose that storiesnare not as magical as they seem.,So three -- becausenit's always got to be three --,three reasons why I think,that stories don't necessarilynmake the world a better place. 
 Firstly, stories can createnan illusion of solidarity.,There is nothingnlike that feel-good factor you get,from listening to a fantastic story,where you feel like younclimbed that mountain, right,,or that you befriendednthat death row inmate.,But you didn't.,You haven't done anything.,Listening is an important,but insufficient stepntowards social action. 
 Secondly, I think often we are drawn,towards characters and protagonists,who are likable and human.,And this makes sense, of course, right?,Because if you like someone,nthen you care about them.,But the inverse is also true.,If you don't like someone,,then you don't care about them.,And if you don't care about them,,you don't have to see yourselfnas having a moral obligation,to think about the circumstancesnthat shaped their lives. 
 I learned this lessonnwhen I was 14 years old.,I learned that actually,nyou don't have to like someone,to recognize their wisdom,,and you certainlyndon't have to like someone,to take a stand by their side.,So my bike was stolen,while I was riding it -- 
 (Laughter) 
 which is possible if you'renriding slowly enough, which I was. 
 (Laughter) 
 So one minutenI'm cutting across this field,in the Nairobi neighborhoodnwhere I grew up,,and it's like a very bumpy path,,and so when you're riding a bike,,you don't want to be like, you know -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I'm going like this,nslowly pedaling,,and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor.,I'm on the ground, and I look up,,and there's this kid peddling awaynin the getaway vehicle,,which is my bike,,and he's about 11 or 12 years old,nand I'm on the floor,,and I'm crying because I savedna lot of money for that bike,,and I'm crying and I stand upnand I start screaming.,Instinct steps in,nand I start screaming, "Mwizi, mwizi!",which means "thief" in Swahili.,And out of the woodworks,nall of these people come out,and they start to give chase.,This is Africa, so mob justice in action.,Right?,And I round the corner,nand they've captured him,,they've caught him.,The suspect has been apprehended,,and they make him give me my bike back,,and they also make him apologize.,Again, you know,ntypical African justice, right?,And so they make him say sorry.,And so we stand there facing each other,,and he looks at me, and he says sorry,,but he looks at menwith this unbridled fury.,He is very, very angry.,And it is the first time that I have beennconfronted with someone,who doesn't like mensimply because of what I represent.,He looks at menwith this look as if to say,,"You, with your shiny skinnand your bike, you're angry at me?" 
 So it was a hard lessonnthat he didn't like me,,but you know what, he was right.,I was a middle-class kidnliving in a poor country.,I had a bike, and he barely had food.,Sometimes, it's the messagesnthat we don't want to hear,,the ones that make usnwant to crawl out of ourselves,,that we need to hear the most.,For every lovable storytellernwho steals your heart,,there are hundreds morenwhose voices are slurred and ragged,,who don't get to stand up on a stagendressed in fine clothes like this.,There are a millionnangry-boy-on-a-bike stories,and we can't afford to ignore them,simply because we don't likentheir protagonists,or because that's not the kidnthat we would bring home with us,from the orphanage. 
 The third reason that I think,that stories don't necessarilynmake the world a better place,is that too often we are so investednin the personal narrative,that we forgetnto look at the bigger picture.,And so we applaud someone,when they tell usnabout their feelings of shame,,but we don't necessarilynlink that to oppression.,We nod understandinglynwhen someone says they felt small,,but we don't link that to discrimination.,The most important stories,nespecially for social justice,,are those that do both,,that are both personal and allow usnto explore and understand the political. 
 But it's not justnabout the stories we like,versus the stories we choose to ignore.,Increasingly, we are living in a societynwhere there are larger forces at play,,where stories are actually for many peoplenbeginning to replace the news.,Yeah?,We live in a time where we are witnessingnthe decline of facts,,when emotions rule,and analysis, it's kind of boring, right?,Where we value what we feelnmore than what we actually know.,A recent report by the Pew Centernon trends in America,indicates that only 10 percentnof young adults under the age of 30,"place a lot of trust in the media.",Now, this is significant.,It means that storytellersnare gaining trust,at precisely the same moment,that many in the medianare losing the confidence in the public.,This is not a good thing,,because while stories are important,and they help usnto have insights in many ways,,we need the media.,From my yearsnas a social justice activist,,I know very well that we needncredible facts from media institutions,combined with the powerful voicesnof storytellers.,That's what pushes the needle forwardnin terms of social justice. 
 In the final analysis, of course,,it is justice,that makes the world a better place,,not stories. Right?,And so if it is justice that we are after,,then I think we mustn't focusnon the media or on storytellers.,We must focus on audiences,,on anyone who has ever turned on a radio,or listened to a podcast,,and that means all of us. 
 So a few concluding thoughts,on what audiences can donto make the world a better place.,So firstly, the worldnwould be a better place, I think,,if audiences were more curiousnand more skeptical,and asked more questionsnabout the social context,that created those storiesnthat they love so much.,Secondly, the worldnwould be a better place,if audiences recognizednthat storytelling is intellectual work.,And I think it wouldnbe important for audiences,to demand more buttonsnon their favorite websites,,buttons for example that say,,"If you liked this story,,click here to support a causenyour storyteller believes in.",Or "click here to contributento your storyteller's next big idea.",Often, we are committed to the platforms,,but not necessarilynto the storytellers themselves.,And then lastly, I think that audiencesncan make the world a better place,by switching off their phones,,by stepping away from their screens,and stepping out into the real worldnbeyond what feels safe. 
 Alice Walker has said,,"Look closely at the presentnyou are constructing.,It should look like the futurenyou are dreaming.",Storytellers can help us to dream,,but it's up to all of usnto have a plan for justice. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Tiq Milan: Our first conversationnwas on Facebook,,and it was three days long. 
 (Laughter) 
 We shared over 3,000 messages between us,,and it was during those 72 hoursnthat I knew she was going to be my wife.,We didn't wait any prerequisitenamount of time for our courtship;,we told each othernthe vulnerable truths up front:,I am a transgender man,,which means the F on my birthncertificate should have stood for "False,",instead of "Female." 
 (Laughter) 
 Walking around as a woman in the world,felt like walking withnpebbles in my shoes.,It took the rhythm out of my swagger,,it threw me off balance,,it pained me with every stepnI took forward.,But today I'm a man of my own intention;,a man of my own design. 
 Kim Katrin Milan: I amna cisgender queer woman.,Cisgender means the gendernI was assigned at birth,is still and has always been female.,This doesn't make me natural or normal,,this is just one way of describingnthe many different ways,that we exist in this world.,And queer is a cultural term,,but in this case,,it refers to the way that I'm notnrestricted by gender,when it comes to choosing partners.,I've identified in a few different ways --,as a bisexual, as a lesbian --,but for me,,queerness encompasses all of the layersnof who I am and how I've loved.,I'm layers, and not fractions.,And for me,,the fact that he was queer,meant that I could trust his courtshipnfrom the very beginning. 
 As queer and trans people,,we're so often excludednfrom institutions and traditions.,We create spaces outside of convention,,including the conventions of time.,And in those 3,000 messages between us,,we collapsed time;,we queered it;,we laid it all on the table. 
 (Laughter) 
 With no pretense at all.,And this meant that we were ablento commit to each other,in a profoundly different way. 
 So often what we're told is this ideanof the "Golden Rule,",that we should treat other peoplenthe way we want to be treated.,But the problem with that,is that it assumes that we arenthe standard for other people,,and we're not.,We need to treat other peoplenthe way they want to be treated,,which means we had to ask.,I couldn't assume that the kindnof love that Tiq needed,was the same kind of love that I needed.,So I asked him everything --nabout his fears, his insecurities --,and we started from there. 
 TM: I didn't know whatnkind of love I needed.,I had just come out of a year-long fog,of being rejected and utterly depleted.,I had someone look me in my eyes,and tell me that I was unworthynof their love because I was trans.,And there's a culture of lovelessness,that we've created aroundntransgender people.,It's reasoned, justifiednand often signed into law.,And I was a heartbeat awaynfrom internalizing that message,,that I wasn't worthy.,But Kim said that I was her ideal --,the heartbroken mess that I was. 
 (Laughter) 
 KKM: He totally was my ideal. 
 (Laughter) 
 In more ways than one.,Both poets, writers, creatives,with a long historynof community work behind us,,and big, huge dreamsnof a family in front of us,,we shared a lot of things in common,,but we were also incredibly different.,I've been a lifelong travelernand a bit of an orphan,,whereas he comes from a huge family,,and definitely stays grounded.,I often kind of sum upnthe differences in our strengths,by saying, "Keep me safe,,and I'll keep you wild." 
 (Laughter) 
 TM: We have marginalized identitiesnbut we don't live marginalized lives.,Being queer and trans is about creatingnnew ways of existing.,It's about loving people as they are,,not as they're supposed to be.,Kim is unapologetically feminine,in a world that is often cruel and violent,to women who arentoo proud and too freeing.,And I didn't enter into this union,under the auspices that shenwas going to be my helper or my rib,,but a fully complex -- 
 (Laughter) 
 KKM: Right? That's not right. 
 TM: But a fully complex human being,whose femininity wasn't for mento rein in, control or critique.,It's her brilliance,,the way she leads with compassion,,and how she never losesnsight of her empathy.,She has been my hero since day one. 
 (Applause) 
 KKM: Our relationship has always beennabout setting each other free.,One of the first questions I asked him,was what dreams he had left to accomplish,,and how would I help him get there.,His dreams to live as a poet,,to adopt and raise a family together,,to live a life that he was proud of,,and one that would live up tonhis mother's incredible legacy.,And I really appreciated that wenwere able to start from that place,,and not from a placenthat was around figuring out,how to make each other work together.,And I think this really allowed usnto grow into the people that we were,in a way that was incredibly different.,I love him whole;,pre-transition, now and in the future.,And it's this love that had usncommitted to each other,before we'd even seen each other's faces. 
 TM: My mother's biggestnconcern when I transitioned,was who was going to love me as I am.,Had being transgender somehownprecluded me from love and monogamy,because I was supposedlynborn in the wrong body?,But it's this type of structuringnthat has to be reframed,in order to let love in.,My body never betrayed me,,and my body was never wrong.,It's this restrictive,nbinary thinking on gender,that said that I didn't exist.,But when we met,,she loved me for exactly how I showed up.,She would trace her fingersnalong the numb keloid scars,left by my top surgery.,Scars that run from the middle of my chestnall the way out to my outer torso.,She said that these werenreminders of my strength,and everything that I went through,and nothing for me to be ashamed of.,So sprinting towards her hand in marriage,was the queerest thing that I could do. 
 (Laughter) 
 It flew in the face of morenconventional trajectories,of love and relationships,,because God was never supposednto bless a union for folks like us,,and the law was nevernsupposed to recognize it. 
 KKM: So on May 5, 2014,,just about three monthsnafter meeting online,,we were married on the stepsnof City Hall in Manhattan,,and it was beautifulnin every conceivable way.,It's safe to say that wenreimagined some traditions,,but we also kept some old onesnthat we worked in,,and we created somethingnthat worked for us.,My bouquet and corsage was actually fillednwith wildflowers from Brooklyn --,also added in a little bit of lavendernand sage to keep us grounded,because we were so nervous.,And it was put together by a sweetnsister healer friend of ours.,I never wanted a diamond ring,,because conflict and conventionnare not my thing,,so my ring is the deepest purple,,like the color of my crown chakra,,and set in place with my birthstones. 
 The gift of queerness is options.,I never had to choose his last name,,it was never an exception,,but I did because I amnmy father's bastard child,,someone who has always beennan apology, a secret, an imposition.,And it was incredibly freeing,to choose the name of a mannwho chose me first. 
 (Applause) 
 TM: So we told some familynand some close friends,,many of whom were still in disbeliefnas we took our vows.,Fittingly, we posted all of our weddingnphotos on Facebook,,where we met --,and Instagram, of course.,And we quickly realized,that our coming together was morenthan just a union of two people,,but was a model of possibilitynfor the millions of LGBTQ folks,who have been sold this lie,that family and matrimonynis antithetical to who they are --,for those of usnwho rarely get to see ourselves,reflected in love and happiness. 
 KKM: And the thing is,,absolutely we are marginalizednbecause of our identities,,but it also emboldens usnto be the people that we are.,Queerness is our major key;,blackness is our magic.,It's because of these things,that we are able to be hopeful, open,nreceptive and shape-shifting.,These are the things that give us,,and are such an incrediblensource of, our strength.,Our queerness is a sourcenof that strength. 
 I think of the words of Ottawa-basednpoet Brandon Wint:,"Not queer like gay;nqueer like escaping definition.,Queer like some sort of fluiditynand limitlessness all at once.,Queer like a freedomntoo strange to be conquered.,Queer like the fearlessnessnto imagine what love can look like,,and to pursue it." 
 TM: We are part of a community of folks --,Yeah, that's good right? 
 (Laughter) 
 We are part of a community of folksnwho are living their authentic selves,all along the gender spectrum,,despite the ubiquitous threat of violence,,despite the undercurrent of anxietynthat always is present,for people who live on their own terms.,Globally, a transgender personnis murdered every 21 hours.,And the United States has had morentrans murders on record this year,than any year to date.,However, our stories are much morenthan this rigid dichotomy,of strength and resilience.,We are expanding the humanncomplexity on these margins,,and we are creating freedomnon these margins. 
 KKM: And we don't have any blueprints.,We're creating a worldnthat we have literally never seen before;,organizing families basednon love and not by blood,,guiding by a compassion that so few of usnhave been shown ourselves. 
 So many of us have not receivednlove from our families --,have been betrayed by the peoplenthat we trust most.,So what we do here is we createnentirely new languages of love.,Ones that are about creating the spacenfor us to be our authentic selves,and not imposing this standard,of what masculinity or femininitynis supposed to be. 
 TM: We are interestednin love and inclusion,as a tool of revolutionary change, right?,And the idea is simply,,if we drop all our preconceived notions,about how somebody is supposed to be --,in their body, in theirngender, in their skin --,if we take the intentional stepsnto unlearn these deep-seated biases,and create space for peoplento be self-determined,,and embrace who they are,,then we will definitely create a betternworld than the one we were born into. 
 (Applause) 
 KKM: We want to mark this time in history,by leaving evidence of the factnthat we were here.,We open up little windowsninto our relationship,for our community to bear witness,,and we do this because we wantnto make maps to the future,and not monuments to ourselves.,Our experience does not invalidatenother peoples' experience,,but it should and necessarily doesncomplicate this idea,of what love and marriagenare supposed to be. 
 TM: OK, now for all the talking,,and inspiring,,and possibility-modeling we've done,,we've been nowhere near perfect.,And we've had to holdna mirror up to ourselves.,And I saw that I wasn'tnalways the best listener,,and that my ego got in the waynof our progress as a couple.,And I've had to really assessnthese deep-seated, sexist ideas,that I've had about the valuenof a woman's experience in the world.,I've had to reevaluate what it meansnto be in allyship with my wife. 
 KKM: And I had to remind myselfnof a lot of things, too.,What it means to be hard on the issues,,but soft on the person.,While we were writing this,nwe got into a massive fight. 
 (Laughter) 
 For so many different reasons,,but based on the content about our valuesnand our lived experiences --,and we were really hurt, you know?,Because what we do and how we lovenputs ourselves entirely on the line.,But even though the fight lastednover the course of two days -- 
 (Laughter) 
 We were able to come backntogether to each other,,and recommit to ourselves,nto each other and to our marriage.,And that really yieldednsome of the most passionate parts,of what we share with you here today. 
 TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,,which I think doesn't happen enough.,I've had to interrogate masculinity;,the toxic privileges that comenwith being a man don't define me,,but I have to be accountablenfor how it shows up in my life every day.,I have allowed my wifento do all of the emotional labor,of prying open the lines of communicationnwhen I'd rather clam up and run away. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've stripped away emotional supportninstead of facing my own vulnerabilities,,particularly around the heartbreakingnmiscarriage we suffered last year,,and I'm sorry for that.,Sometimes as men,nwe get to take the easy way out.,And so my journey as a trans personnis about reimagining masculinity.,About creating a manhoodnthat isn't measured,by the power it wields,nby the entitlements afforded to it,,or any simulacrum of controlnthat it can muster,,but works in tandem with femininity,,and is guided by my spirit. 
 KKM: Y'all ... 
 (Applause) 
 And this has created the spacenfor my femininity to flourish,in a way I had never experienced before.,He never is threatened by my sexuality,,he never polices what I wear or how I act.,I cook but he does way morenof the cleaning than I do.,And when we're rushingnto get out of the house,and we have so much to handle,,he handles everything,,so I have time to do my hair and makeup. 
 (Laughter) 
 He understands that this is my armor,,and he never treats femininitynas though it is frivolous or superficial,,and this, and him --,he grows my experiencenof gender every single day. 
 TM: I love to watch hernget dressed in the morning.,Watching her in the closet,,looking for something comfortablenand colorful, and tight,,and safe -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's challenging to watch hernnegotiate her decisions,looking for something that's goingnto get the least amount of attention,,but at the same time be an expressionnof the vibrant and sexy woman she is.,And all I want to do is celebratenher for her beauty,,and the things that make hernbeautiful and special and free,,from her long acrylic nails,,to her uncompromising black feminism. 
 (Applause) 
 KKM: I love you. TM: I love you. 
 (Laughter) 
 KKM: There are so many queernand trans people,who have come before us,,whose stories we will never get to hear.,We constantly experiencenthis retelling of history,where we are conspicuously left out.,And it's really hardnto not see ourselves there.,And so living out loud for usnis about that representation.,It's about having possibility models,,and having hope that love is partnof our inheritance in this world, too. 
 TM: The possibility that we are practicing,is about reinventing time,nlove and institutions.,We are creating a future of multiplicity.,We are expanding the spectrumnof gender and sexuality,,imagining ourselves into existence,,imagining a world where gendernis self-determined and not imposed,,and where who we arenis a kaleidoscope of possibility,without the narrow-minded limitationsnmasquerading as science or justice. 
 (Applause) 
 KKM: And I can't lie:,it is really, really hard.,It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry,with an open heart and a smile on my face.,It is really hard to face the injusticenthat exists in the world,,while still believing in the abilitynof people to really change.,That takes an enormous amountnof faith and dedication.,And beyond that,,marriage is hard work. 
 (Laughter) 
 Piles of dirty socks on the floor,,more boring sports showsnthan I ever thought possible -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And fights that bring me to tears,when it feels like we're notnspeaking the same language.,But there is not a day that goes by,where I am not so gratefulnto be married to this man;,where I'm not so grateful fornthe possibility of changing minds,,and rewarding conversations,,and creating a worldnwhere love belongs to us all. 
 I think about our acronym:,LGBTQ2SIA.,A seemingly endless evolutionnof self and a community,,but also this really deep desirennot to leave anyone behind.,We've learned how to love each other,,and we've committed to loving each othernthroughout changes to gender,and changes in spirit.,And we learned this lovenin our chat rooms,,in our clubs, in our barsnand in our community centers.,We've learned how to loveneach other for the long haul. 
 TM &amp; KKM: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Tell your daughters of this year,,how we woke needing coffee,but discovered instead cadaversnstrewn about our morning papers,,waterlogged facsimilesnof our sisters, spouses, small children.,Say to your baby of this yearnwhen she asks, as she certainly should,,tell her it was too late coming.,Admit even in the year we leased freedom,nwe didn't own it outright.,There were still lawsnfor every way we used our privates,while they pawed at the soft folds of us,,grabbed with no concern for consent,,no laws made for the mennthat enforced them.,We were trained to dodge,,to wait, to cower and cover,,to wait more, still, wait.,We were told to be silent. 
 But speak to your girls of this wartime,,a year preceded by a score of the same,,so as in two decades before,,we wiped our eyes,,laced caskets with flags,,evacuated the crime scene of the club,,caterwauled in the street,,laid our bodies on the concretenagainst the outlines of our fallen,,cried, "Of course we mattered,",chanted for our disappeared.,The women wept this year.,They did. 
 In the same year, we were ready.,The year we lost our inhibitionnand moved with courageous abandon,was also the year we stared down barrels,,sang of cranes in skies,nducked and parried,,caught gold in hijab,ncollected death threats,,knew ourselves as patriots,,said, "We're 35 now, time we settled downnand found a running mate,",made road maps for infant joy,nshamed nothing but fear,,called ourselves fat and meant, of course,,impeccable. 
 This year, we were women,,not brides or trinkets,,not an off-brand gender,,not a concession, but women. 
 Instruct your babies.,Remind them that the year has passednto be docile or small.,Some of us said for the first timenthat we were women,,took this oath of solidarity seriously.,Some of us bore childrennand some of us did not,,and none of us questionednwhether that made us real,or appropriate or true. 
 When she asks you of this year,,your daughter, whether your offspringnor heir to your triumph,,from her comforted side of historynteetering towards woman,,she will wonder and ask voraciously,,though she cannot fathom your sacrifice,,she will hold your estimation of it holy,,curiously probing, "Where were you?,Did you fight?nWere you fearful or fearsome?,What colored the walls of your regret?,What did you do for womennin the year it was time?,This path you made for me,nwhich bones had to break?,Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?,And are you a hero?",She will ask the difficult questions. 
 She will not carenabout the arc of your brow,,the weight of your clutch.,She will not ask of your mentions.,Your daughter, for whom you havenalready carried so much, wants to know,what you brought, what gift,nwhat light did you keep from extinction?,When they came for victims in the night,,did you sleep through itnor were you roused?,What was the cost of staying woke?,What, in the year we said time's up,nwhat did you do with your privilege?,Did you sup on others' squalor?,Did you look awaynor directly into the flame?,Did you know your skillnor treat it like a liability?,Were you fooled by the epithetsnof "nasty" or "less than"?,Did you teach with an open heartnor a clenched fist?,Where were you? 
 Tell her the truth. Make it your life.,Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there,with the momentndrawn on my face like a dagger,,and flung it back at itself,,slicing space for you.",Tell her the truth, how you livednin spite of crooked odds.,Tell her you were brave,,and always, alwaysnin the company of courage,,mostly the daysnwhen you just had yourself.,Tell her she was born as you were,,as your mothers before,nand the sisters beside them,,in the age of legends, like always. 
 Tell her she was born just in time,,just in time,to lead. 
 (Applause)Let me ask you all a question.,How much weapons-grade nuclearnmaterial do you think it would take,to level a city the size of San Francisco?,How many of you thinknit would be an amount,about the size of this suitcase?,OK. And how about this minibus? 
 All right.,Well actually, undernthe right circumstances,,an amount of highly enriched uraniumnabout the size of your morning latte,would be enough to kill 100,000 people,instantly.,Hundreds of thousands of othersnwould become horribly ill,,and parts of the citynwould be uninhabitable for years,,if not for decades. 
 But you can forget that nuclear latte,,because today's nuclear weaponsnare hundreds of times more powerful,even than those we droppednon Hiroshima and Nagasaki.,And even a limited nuclear warninvolving, say, tens of nuclear weapons,,could lead to the endnof all life on the planet. 
 So it's really important that you know,that right now we havenover 15,000 nuclear weapons,in the hands of nine nations.,And if you live in a citynor near a military facility,,one is likely pointed right at you.,In fact, if you live in anynof the rural areas,where nuclear weapons are stored globally,,one is likely pointed at you.,About 1,800 of these weaponsnare on high alert,,which means they can be launchednwithin 15 minutes,of a presidential command. 
 So I know this is a bummer of an issue,,and maybe you have that --nwhat was it? -- psychic fatigue,that we heard about a little bit earlier.,So I'm going to switch gearsnfor just a second,,and I'm going to talknabout my imaginary friend,,who I like to think of as Jasmine,,just for a moment. 
 Jasmine, at the age of 25,,is part of a generation that is morenpolitically and socially engaged,than anything we've seen in 50 years.,She and her friends think of themselves,as change agentsnand leaders and activists.,I think of them as Generation Possible.,They regularly protestnabout the issues they care about,,but nuclear weapons are not one of them,nwhich makes sense,,because Jasmine was born in 1991,nat the end of the Cold War.,So she didn't grow up hearing a lotnabout nuclear weapons.,She never had to duck and covernunder her desk at school.,For Jasmine, a fallout shelternis an app in the Android store.,Nuclear weapons help win games.,And that is really a shame,,because right now, we neednGeneration Possible,to help us make some really importantndecisions about nuclear weapons. 
 For instance, will we further reducenour nuclear arsenals globally,,or will we spend billions,,maybe a trillion dollars,,to modernize them so they lastnthroughout the 21st century,,so that by the time Jasmine is my age,nshe's talking to her children,and maybe even her grandchildren,about the threat of nuclear holocaust?,And if you're paying any attentionnat all to cyberthreats,,or, for instance, if you've readnabout the Stuxnet virus,or, for God's sake, if you've evernhad an email account or a Yahoo account,or a phone hacked,,you can imagine the whole new worldnof hurt that could be triggered,by modernization in a periodnof cyberwarfare. 
 Now, if you're payingnattention to the money,,a trillion dollars could go a long way,to feeding and educatingnand employing people,,all of which could reduce the threatnof nuclear war to begin with.,So -- 
 (Applause) 
 This is really crucial right now,,because nuclear weapons --nthey're vulnerable.,We have solid evidence,that terrorists are tryingnto get ahold of them.,Just this last spring,,when four retireesnand two taxi drivers were arrested,in the Republic of Georgia,for trying to sell nuclear materialsnfor 200 million dollars,,they demonstrated that the black marketnfor this stuff is alive and well.,And it's really important,,because there have beenndozens of accidents,involving nuclear weapons,,and I bet most of us have never heardnanything about them. 
 Just here in the United States,,we've dropped nuclear weaponsnon the Carolinas twice.,In one case, one of the bombs,,which fell out of an Air Force plane,,didn't detonate,because the nuclear corenwas stored somewhere else on the plane.,In another case, the weaponndid arm when it hit the ground,,and five of the switches designednto keep it from detonating failed.,Luckily, the sixth one didn't.,But if that's not enoughnto get your attention,,there was the 1995 Black Brant incident.,That's when Russian radar technicians saw,what they thought was a US nuclear missile,streaking towards Russian airspace.,It later turned out to bena Norwegian rocket,collecting data about the northern lights.,But at that time,,Russian President Boris Yeltsinncame within five minutes,of launching a full-scalenretaliatory nuclear attack,against the United States. 
 So, most of the world's nuclear nations,have committed to getting ridnof these weapons of mass destruction.,But consider this:,the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationnof Nuclear Weapons,,which is the most widely adoptednarms control treaty in history,with 190 signatories,,sets no specific date by whichnthe world's nuclear-armed nations,will get rid of their nuclear weapons. 
 Now, when John F. Kennedynsent a man to the moon,and decided to bring him back,nor decided to do both those things,,he didn't say, "Hey, whenevernyou guys get to it.",He gave us a deadline.,He gave us a challenge,that would have been incrediblenjust a few years earlier.,And with that challenge,,he inspired scientists and marketers,,astronauts and schoolteachers.,He gave us a vision.,But along with that vision,,he also tried to give us -- and mostnpeople don't know this, either --,he tried to give us a partner,in the form of our fiercestnCold War rival, the Soviet Union.,Because part of Kennedy's visionnfor the Apollo program,was that it be a cooperation,nnot a competition, with the Soviets.,And apparently, Nikita Khrushchev,nthe Soviet Premier, agreed.,But before that cooperationncould be realized,,Kennedy was assassinated,,and that part of the vision was deferred. 
 But the promise of joint innovationnbetween these two nuclear superpowers,wasn't totally extinguished.,Because in 1991, which is the yearnthat Jasmine was born,and the Soviet Union fell,,these two nations engaged in a project,that genuinely does seem incredible today,in the truest sense of that word,,which is that the US sent cashnto the Russians when they needed it most,,to secure loose nuclear materials,and to employ out-of-worknnuclear scientists.,They worked alongside American scientistsnto convert weapons-grade uranium,into the type of fuel that can be usednfor nuclear power instead.,They called it, "Megatons to Megawatts.",So the result is that for over 20 years,,our two nations had a program,that meant that one in 10 lightbulbsnin the United States,was essentially fuelednby former Russian warheads. 
 So, together these two nationsndid something truly audacious.,But the good news is,nthe global community has the chance,to do something just as audacious today.,To get rid of nuclear weapons,and to end the supply of the materialsnrequired to produce them,,some experts tell me would take 30 years.,It would take a renaissance of sorts,,the kinds of innovation that,nfor better or worse,,underpinned both the Manhattan Project,nwhich gave rise to nuclear weapons,,and the Megatons to Megawatts program.,It would take design constraints.,These are fundamental to creativity,,things like a platformnfor international collaboration;,a date certain, which isna forcing mechanism;,and a positive visionnthat inspires action.,It would take us to 2045. 
 Now, 2045 happens to benthe 100th anniversary,of the birth of nuclear weaponsnin the New Mexico desert.,But it's also an important datenfor another reason.,It's predicted to be the adventnof the singularity,,a new moment in human development,,where the lines between artificialnintelligence and human intelligence blur,,where computing and consciousnessnbecome almost indistinguishable,and advanced technologies help us solventhe 21st century's greatest problems:,hunger, energy, poverty,,ushering in an era of abundance.,And we all get to go to space,on our way to becomingna multi-planetary species. 
 Now, the people who really believenthis vision are the first to say,they don't yet know preciselynhow we're going to get there.,But the values behind their vision,and the willingness to ask "How might we?",have inspired a generation of innovators.,They're working backwardnfrom the outcomes they want,,using the creative problem-solving methodsnof collaborative design.,They're busting through obstacles.,They're redefiningnwhat we all consider possible. 
 But here's the thing:,that vision of abundance isn't compatible,with a world that still reliesnon a 20th-century nuclear doctrine,called "mutually assured destruction.",It has to be about buildingnthe foundations for the 22nd century.,It has to be about strategiesnfor mutually assured prosperity,or, at the very least,nmutually assured survival. 
 Now, every day, I get to meetnpeople who are real pioneers,in the field of nuclear threats.,As you can see, many of themnare young women,,and they're doing fiercelyninteresting stuff,,like Mareena Robinson Snowden here,nwho is developing new ways,,better ways, to detect nuclear warheads,,which will help usnovercome a critical hurdle,to international disarmament.,Or Melissa Hanham, who is usingnsatellite imaging,to make sense of what's going onnaround far-flung nuclear sites.,Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,,who has been campaigningnto make nuclear weapons illegal,in international courts of law,,and just won a big victorynat the UN last week. 
 (Applause) 
 And yet,,and yet,,with all of our talk in this culturenabout moon shots,,too few members of Generation Possiblenand those of us who mentor them,are taking on nuclear weapons.,It's as if there's a taboo.,But I remember something Kennedy saidnthat has really stuck with me,,and that is something to the effect,that humans can be as big as the solutions,to all the problems we've created.,No problem of human destiny, he said,,is beyond human beings.,I believe that.,And I bet a lot of you herenbelieve that, too.,And I know GenerationnPossible believes it. 
 So it's time to commit to a date.,Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter,on the 100th anniversary of its inception.,After all, by 2045, we will have heldnbillions of people hostage,to the threat of nuclear annihilation.,Surely, 100 years will have been enough.,Surely, a century of economic development,and the development of military strategy,will have given us better waysnto manage global conflict.,Surely, if ever there was a globalnmoon shot worth supporting,,this is it. 
 Now, in the face of real threats --,for instance, North Korea's recentnnuclear weapons tests,,which fly in the face of sanctions --,reasonable people disagree,about whether we should maintainnsome number of nuclear weapons,to deter aggression.,But the question is:nWhat's the magic number?,Is it a thousand?,Is it a hundred? Ten?,And then we have to ask:,Who should be responsible for them?,I think we can agree, however,,that having 15,000 of themnrepresents a greater global threat,to Jasmine's generation than a promise. 
 So it's time we make a promise,of a world in which we've brokennthe stranglehold,that nuclear weapons havenon our imaginations;,in which we investnin the creative solutions,that come from working backwardnfrom the future we desperately want,,rather than plodding forwardnfrom a present,that brings all of the mental modelsnand biases of the past with it.,It's time we pledge our resourcesnas leaders across the spectrum,to work on this old problem in new ways,,to ask, "How might we?",How might we make good on a promise,of greater securitynfor Jasmine's generation,in a world beyond nuclear weapons?,I truly hope you will join us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I feel incredibly lucky,to be from a country,that's generally considerednto be the best place in the world,to be a woman. 
 In 1975, when I was seven years old,,women in Iceland went on a strike.,They did no work that day,,whether they held professional jobs,or had the work of the home.,They marched intonthe center of Reykjavík --,90 percent of women participated --,and peacefully and in solidarity,asked for equality.,Nothing worked in Iceland that day,,because nothing worksnwhen women are not at work. 
 (Applause) 
 Five years later,nIcelanders had the courage,to be the first country in the world,to democratically elect a womannas their president.,I will never forget this day,,that President Vigdís,nas we know her by her first name,,stepped out on the balconynof her own home,,a single mom with her daughternby her side as she had won. 
 (Applause) 
 This woman was an incredible role model,for me and everyonengrowing up at that time,,including boys.,She frequently shares the storynof how a young boy approached her,after a couple of terms in office,and asked, "Can boysnreally grow up to be president?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Role models really matter,,but even with such strong role models,who I am so grateful for,,when I was encouragednto run for president,,my first reaction was,n"Who am I to run for president?,Who am I to be president?" 
 It turns out that women,are less likelynto consider running than men.,So a study done in the US in 2011,showed that 62 percent of mennhad considered running for office,,but 45 percent of women.,That's gap of 16 percentage points,,and it's the same gapnthat existed a decade earlier.,And it really is a shame,,because I am so convinced that the worldnis in real need for women leaders,and more principle-based leadership,in general. 
 So my decision to run,ultimately came down to the fact,that I felt,that I had to do my bit,,even if I had no political experience,,to step up and try to be partnof creating the world,that will make sense and be sustainable,for our kids,,and a world where we truly allownboth our boys and girls,to be all they can be. 
 And it was the journey of my life.,It was amazing.,The journey started with potentiallynas many as 20 candidates.,It boiled down tonnine candidates qualifying,,and ultimately the racencame down to four of us,,three men and me. 
 (Applause) 
 But that's not all the drama yet.,You may think you have drama in the US,,but I can -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I can assure younwe had our own drama in Iceland.,So our sitting president of 20 years,announced initiallynthat he was not going to run,,which is probably what gave rise,to so many candidates considering running.,Then later he changed his mind,when our prime minister resigned,following the infamous Panama Papers,that implicated him and his family.,And there was a popularnprotest in Iceland,,so the sitting president thoughtnthey needed a trusted leader.,A few days later, relationsnto his wife and her family's companies,were also discovered in the Panama Papers,,and so he withdrew from the race again.,Before doing so, he said he was doing that,because now there were two qualified men,who he felt could fill his shoesnrunning for office. 
 So on May 9, 45 days before election day,,it was not looking too good for me.,I did not even make the graphnin the newspaper.,The polls had me at 1 percent,,but that was still the highest,that any woman announcingnher candidacy had earned.,So it would be an understatementnto say that I had to work extremely hard,to get my seat at the table,and access to television,,because the network decidednthat they would only include,those with 2.5 percentnor more in the polls,in the first TV debate.,I found out on the afternoonnof the first TV debate,that I would participatenalong with the three men,,and I found out on live TV,that I came in at exactly 2.5 percentnon the day of the first TV debate. 
 (Applause) 
 So, challenges.,The foremost challenges I had to facenand overcome on this journey,had to do with media, muscle and money.,Let's start with media.,There are those who sayngender doesn't matter,when it comes to media and politics.,I can't say that I agree.,It proved harder for mento both get access and airtime in media.,As a matter of fact, the leading candidatenappeared in broadcast media,87 times in the monthsnleading up to the elections,,whereas I appeared 31 times.,And I am not sayingnmedia is doing this consciously.,I think largely this has to donwith unconscious bias,,because in media,nmuch like everywhere else,,we have both consciousnand unconscious bias,,and we need to have the couragento talk about it if we want to change it. 
 When I finally got access to TV,,the first question I got was,n"Are you going to quit?",And that was a hard one.,But of course, with 1 percentnto 2.5 percent in the polls,,maybe it's understandable.,But media really matters,nand every time I appeared on TV,,we saw and experiencedna rise in the polls,,so I know firsthand how much this matters,and why we have to talk about it.,I was the only onenout of the final four candidates,that never got a front page interview.,I was sometimes left out of the questionsnasked of all other candidates,and out of coverage about the elections.,So I did face this,,but I will say thisnto compliment the Icelandic media.,I got few if any commentsnabout my hair and pantsuit. 
 (Applause) 
 So kudos to them.,But there is another experiencenthat's very important.,I ran as an independent candidate,,not with any political partynor muscle behind me.,That lack of experience,and lack of access to resources,probably came at a cost to our campaign,,but it also allowed us to innovatenand do politics differently.,We ran a positive campaign,,and we probably changed the tonenof the election for others by doing that.,It may be the reasonnwhy I had less airtime on TV,,because I wanted to shownother contenders respect. 
 When access to medianproved to be so difficult,,we ran our own media.,I ran live Facebook sessions,where I took questions from votersnon anything and responded on the spot.,And we put all the questions I gotnand all the answers on an open Facebook,because we thoughtntransparency is important,if you want to establish trust.,And when reaching young votersnproved to be challenging,,I became a Snapchatter.,I got young peoplento teach me how to do that,,and I used every filter on Snapchatnduring the last part of the campaign.,And I actually had to use a lot of humornand humility, as I was very bad at it.,But we grew the followingnamongst young people by doing that.,So it's possible to runna different type of campaign. 
 But unfortunately, one cannot talknabout politics without mentioning money.,I am sad that it is that way,nbut it's true,,and we had less financial resourcesnthan the other candidates.,This probably was partly due to the fact,that I think I had a harder timenasking for financial support.,And maybe I also had the ambitionnto do more with less.,Some would call that very womanly of me. 
 But even with one third the media,none third the financial resources,,and only an entrepreneurial team,nbut an amazing team,,we managed to surprise everyonenon election night,,when the first numbers came in.,I surprised myself,nas you may see in that photo. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the first numbers,,I came in neck to necknto the leading candidate. 
 (Cheers) 
 Well, too early,nbecause I didn't quite pull that,,but I came in second,,and we went a long waynfrom the one percent,,with nearly a third of the vote,,and we beat the pollsnby an unprecedented margin,,or 10 percentage pointsnabove what the last poll came in at. 
 Some people call me the real winnernof the election because of this,,and there are many peoplenwho encouraged me to run again.,But what really makes me proud,is to know that I earned,proportionately higher percentagensupport from the young people,,and a lot of people encouragednmy daughter to run in 2040. 
 (Applause) 
 She is 13,,and she had never been on TV before.,And on election day,nI observed her on TV repeatedly,,and she was smart, she was self-confident,,she was sincere, and she wasnsupportive of her mother.,This was probablynthe highlight of my campaign. 
 (Applause) 
 But there was another one.,These are preschool girls out on a walk,,and they foundna poster of me on a bus stop,,and they saw the need to kiss it. 
 Audience: Aw! 
 This picture was reallynenough of a win for me.,What we see, we can be.,So screw fear and challenges. 
 (Applause) 
 It matters that women run,,and it's time for women to run for office,,be it the office of the CEOnor the office of the president.,I also managed to put an impressionnon your very own "New Yorker.",I earned a new title,n"A living emoji of sincerity." 
 (Cheers) 
 It is possibly my proudest title yet,,and the reason isnthat women too often get penalized,for using what I callntheir emotional capital,,but I know from experiencenthat we become so good,when we do just that. 
 (Applause) 
 And we need more of that. 
 We celebrated as if we had wonnon election night,,because that's how we felt.,So you don't necessarilynhave to reach that office.,You just have to go for it,,and you, your family, your friends,neveryone working with you,,if you do it well, you will grow beyondnanything you will experience before. 
 So we had a good time,,and I learned a lot on this journey,,probably more lessonsnthan I can share here,in the time we have today.,But rest assured, it was hard work.,I lost a lot of sleep during those months.,It took resiliencenand perseverance to not quit,,but I learned somethingnthat I knew before on the one percent day,,and that is that you can only be good,when you are truly, authenticallynlistening to your own voice,and working in alignment with that.,As a good sister of mine sometimes says,,you may cheat on your intuition,,but your intuition never cheats on you. 
 I think it's also very important,nand you all know this,,that on any journey you go on,,it's the team you take along.,It's having people around younwho share your values, your vision,,but are different in every other way.,That's the formula for success for me,,and I am blessed with an amazing husband,,here today,,an incredible family -- 
 (Applause) 
 and great friends,,and we came togethernas entrepreneurs in the political arena,,and pulled something offnthat everyone said would be impossible.,As a matter of fact,nthe leading PR expert told me,before I made my decision,that I would do well to get seven percent.,I appreciated his perspective,nbecause he was probably right,,and he was basing itnon valuable experience.,But on the one percent day,,I decided here to show himnthat he was wrong. 
 It's very important to mention this,nbecause I did lose a lot of sleep,,and I worked hard,nand so did the people with me.,We can never go the distancenif we forget to take care of ourselves.,And it's two things that I thinknare very important in that,,in surrounding yourself with peoplenand practices that nourish you,,but it's equally important,nmaybe even more important,,to have the couragento get rid of people and practices,that take away your energy,,including the wonderful bloggersnand commentators.,I took a lot of supportnfrom others in doing this,,and I made the decision to go highnwhen others went low,,and that's partly how I keptnmy energy going throughout all of this.,And when I lost my energy for a moment --,and I did from time to time,nit wasn't easy --,I went back to why I decided to run,,and how I had decided to run my own race. 
 I called it a 4G campaign,,the G's representing the Icelandic words.,And the first one is called "Gagn.",I ran to do good,,to be of service,,and I wanted servant leadership,to be at the center of how I workednand everybody else in the campaign.,Second one is "Gleði," or joy.,I decided to enjoy the journey.,There was a lot to be takennout of the journey,,no matter if the destinationnwas reached or not.,And I tried my utmostnto inspire others to do so as well.,Third is "Gagnsæi.",I was open to any questions.,I kept no secrets,,and it was all open,non Facebook and websites.,Because I think if you'renchoosing your president,,you deserve answers to your questions.,Last but not least,,I don't need to explain that in this room,,we ran on the principle of Girlpower. 
 (Cheers) 
 I am incredibly glad,that I had the courage to run,,to risk failure but receive success,on so many levels.,I can't tell you that it was easy,,but I can tell you,,and I think my entire teamnwill agree with me,,that it was worth it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet. 
 Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd. 
 PM: I can't let you gonwithout saying,that probably everybody in the roomnis ready to move to Iceland,and vote for you.,But of course we probablyncan't vote there,,but one thing we can get from Iceland,and have always gotten is inspiration.,I mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975,when all the Icelandic women walked out,,and that really was a very big factornin launching the women's movement.,You made a reference to it earlier.nI'd love to bring the picture back up,and just have us remember what it was likenwhen a country came to a standstill.,And then what you may not know,because our American mediandid not report it,,the Icelandic womennwalked out again on Monday. Right? 
 HT: Yes, they did.nPM: Can you tell us about that? 
 HT: Yes, so 41 yearsnafter the original strike,,we may be the best placenin the world to be a woman,,but our work isn't done.,So at 2:38pm on Monday,,women in Iceland left work,,because that's whennthey had earned their day's salary. 
 (Applause) 
 What's really cool about this,is that young women and men participated,in greater numbers than before,,because it is timenthat we close the pay gap. 
 PM: So I'm not going to asknHalla to commit right now,to what she's doing next,,but I will say that you'd havena very large volunteer army,should you decide to do that again.,Thank you Halla. 
 HT: Thank you all. 
 (Applause)I was a new mother,and a young rabbi,in the spring of 2004,and the world was in shambles.,Maybe you remember.,Every day, we heard devastating reportsnfrom the war in Iraq.,There were waves of terrornrolling across the globe.,It seemed like humanitynwas spinning out of control.,I remember the night that I read,about the series of coordinated bombings,in the subway system in Madrid,,and I got up and I walked over to the crib,where my six-month-old baby girl,lay sleeping sweetly,,and I heard the rhythm of her breath,,and I felt this sense of urgencyncoursing through my body.,We were living through a timenof tectonic shifts in ideologies,,in politics, in religion, in populations.,Everything felt so precarious.,And I remember thinking,,"My God, what kind of worldndid we bring this child into?,And what was I as a mothernand a religious leader,willing to do about it? 
 Of course, I knew it was clear,that religion would bena principle battlefield,in this rapidly changing landscape,,and it was already clear,that religion was a significantnpart of the problem.,The question for me was,,could religionnalso be part of the solution?,Now, throughout history,,people have committednhorrible crimes and atrocities,in the name of religion.,And as we entered the 21st century,,it was very clear that religious extremismnwas once again on the rise.,Our studies now show,that over the coursenof the past 15, 20 years,,hostilities and religion-related violence,have been on the increasenall over the world.,But we don't even neednthe studies to prove it,,because I ask you,nhow many of us are surprised today,when we hear the storiesnof a bombing or a shooting,,when we later find outnthat the last word that was uttered,before the trigger is pullednor the bomb is detonated,is the name of God?,It barely raises an eyebrow today,when we learn that yet another person,has decided to show his love of God,by taking the lives of God's children.,In America, religious extremism,looks like a white,nantiabortion Christian extremist,walking into Planned Parenthoodnin Colorado Springs,and murdering three people.,It also looks like a couple,inspired by the Islamic State,walking into an office partynin San Bernardino and killing 14.,And even when religion-related extremismndoes not lead to violence,,it is still usednas a political wedge issue,,cynically leading peoplento justify the subordination of women,,the stigmatization of LGBT people,,racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.,This ought to concern deeply,those of us who carenabout the future of religion,and the future of faith.,We need to call this what it is:,a great failure of religion. 
 But the thing is, this isn't even the onlynchallenge that religion faces today.,At the very same time,that we need religionnto be a strong force against extremism,,it is sufferingnfrom a second pernicious trend,,what I call religious routine-ism.,This is when our institutionsnand our leaders,are stuck in a paradigmnthat is rote and perfunctory,,devoid of life, devoid of vision,and devoid of soul. 
 Let me explain what I mean like this.,One of the great blessingsnof being a rabbi,is standing under the chuppah,nunder the wedding canopy, with a couple,,and helping them proclaim publicly,and make holy the loventhat they found for one another.,I want to ask you now, though,,to think maybe from your own experience,or maybe just imagine it,about the differencenbetween the intensity of the experience,under the wedding canopy,,and maybe the experiencenof the sixth or seventh anniversary. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if you're lucky enoughnto make it 16 or 17 years,,if you're like most people,nyou probably wake up in the morning,realizing that you forgot to makena reservation at your favorite restaurant,and you forgot so much as a card,,and then you just hope and praynthat your partner also forgot. 
 Well, religious ritual and rites,were essentially designednto serve the function of the anniversary,,to be a container in whichnwe would hold on to the remnants,of that sacred, revelatory encounter,that birthed the religionnin the first place.,The problem is that after a few centuries,,the date remains on the calendar,,but the love affair is long dead.,That's when we find ourselvesnin endless, mindless repetitions,of words that don't mean anything to us,,rising and being seatednbecause someone has asked us to,,holding onto jealously guarded doctrine,that's completely and wildly out of stepnwith our contemporary reality,,engaging in perfunctory practice,simply because that's the waynthings have always been done. 
 Religion is waning in the United States.,Across the board,nchurches and synagogues and mosques,are all complaining,about how hard it is to maintain relevance,for a generation of young peoplenwho seem completely uninterested,,not only in the institutionsnthat stand at the heart of our traditions,but even in religion itself.,And what they need to understand,is that there is todayna generation of people,who are as disgusted by the violencenof religious extremism,as they are turned off,by the lifelessnessnof religious routine-ism. 
 Of course there isna bright spot to this story.,Given the crisis of these twonconcurrent trends in religious life,,about 12 or 13 years ago,nI set out to try to determine,if there was any way,that I could reclaim the heartnof my own Jewish tradition,,to help make it meaningfulnand purposeful again,in a world on fire.,I started to wonder,,what if we could harnessnsome of the great minds of our generation,and think in a bold and robustnand imaginative way again,about what the next iterationnof religious life would look like?,Now, we had no money,nno space, no game plan,,but we did have email.,So my friend Melissa and Insat down and we wrote an email,which we sent outnto a few friends and colleagues.,It basically said this:,"Before you bail on religion,,why don't we come togethernthis Friday night,and see what we might makenof our own Jewish inheritance?" 
 We hoped maybe 20 people would show up.,It turned out 135 people came.,They were cynics and seekers,,atheists and rabbis.,Many people said that nightnthat it was the first time,that they had a meaningful religiousnexperience in their entire lives.,And so I set out to do the onlynrational thing,that someone would donin such a circumstance:,I quit my job and tried to buildnthis audacious dream,,a reinvented, rethought religious life,which we called "IKAR,",which means "the essence"nor "the heart of the matter." 
 Now, IKAR is not alone,out there in the religiousnlandscape today.,There are Jewish and Christiannand Muslim and Catholic religious leaders,,many of them women, by the way,,who have set out to reclaimnthe heart of our traditions,,who firmly believe that now is the timenfor religion to be part of the solution.,We are going backninto our sacred traditions,and recognizing that all of our traditions,contain the raw materialnto justify violence and extremism,,and also contain the raw materialnto justify compassion,,coexistence and kindness --,that when others choose to read our textsnas directives for hate and vengeance,,we can choose to read those same texts,as directives for lovenand for forgiveness. 
 I have found now,in communities as variednas Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts,to a woman's mosque,,to black churchesnin New York and in North Carolina,,to a holy bus loaded with nuns,that traverses this countrynwith a message of justice and peace,,that there is a shared religious ethos,that is now emerging in the formnof revitalized religion in this country.,And while the theologiesnand the practices vary very much,between these independent communities,,what we can see are some common,nconsistent threads between them. 
 I'm going to share with younfour of those commitments now. 
 The first is wakefulness.,We live in a time today,in which we have unprecedented access,to information about every global tragedy,that happens on every cornernof this Earth.,Within 12 hours, 20 million people,saw that imagenof Aylan Kurdi's little body,washed up on the Turkish shore.,We all saw this picture.,We saw this picturenof a five-year-old child,pulled out of the rubblenof his building in Aleppo.,And once we see these images,,we are called to a certain kind of action. 
 My tradition tells a storynof a traveler who is walking down a road,when he sees a beautiful house on fire,,and he says, "How can it benthat something so beautiful would burn,,and nobody seems to even care?",So too we learn that our world is on fire,,and it is our job to keep our heartsnand our eyes open,,and to recognizenthat it's our responsibility,to help put out the flames. 
 This is extremely difficult to do.,Psychologists tell us that the morenwe learn about what's broken in our world,,the less likely we are to do anything.,It's called psychic numbing.,We just shut down at a certain point.,Well, somewhere along the way,nour religious leaders forgot,that it's our jobnto make people uncomfortable.,It's our job to wake people up,,to pull them out of their apathy,and into the anguish,,and to insist that we donwhat we don't want to do,and see what we do not want to see.,Because we knownthat social change only happens -- 
 (Applause) 
 when we are awake enoughnto see that the house is on fire. 
 The second principle is hope,,and I want to say this about hope.,Hope is not naive,,and hope is not an opiate.,Hope may be the singlengreatest act of defiance,against a politics of pessimism,and against a culture of despair.,Because what hope does for us,is it lifts us out of the container,that holds us and constrains usnfrom the outside,,and says, "You can dreamnand think expansively again.,That they cannot control in you." 
 I saw hope made manifestnin an African-American church,in the South Side of Chicago this summer,,where I brought my little girl,,who is now 13,and a few inches taller than me,,to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.,That summer, there had already beenn3,000 people shot,between January and July in Chicago.,We went into that churchnand heard Rev. Moss preach,,and after he did,,this choir of gorgeous women,n100 women strong,,stood up and began to sing.,"I need you. You need me.,I love you. I need you to survive.",And I realized in that moment,that this is what religionnis supposed to be about.,It's supposed to be aboutngiving people back a sense of purpose,,a sense of hope,,a sense that they and their dreamsnfundamentally matter in this world,that tells themnthat they don't matter at all. 
 The third principlenis the principle of mightiness.,There's a rabbinic traditionnthat we are to walk around,with two slips of paper in our pockets.,One says, "I am but dust and ashes.",It's not all about me.,I can't control everything,nand I cannot do this on my own.,The other slip of paper says,n"For my sake the world was created.",Which is to say it's truenthat I can't do everything,,but I can surely do something.,I can forgive.,I can love.,I can show up.,I can protest.,I can be a part of this conversation.,We even now have a religious ritual,,a posture,,that holds the paradoxnbetween powerlessness and power.,In the Jewish community,,the only time of yearnthat we prostrate fully to the ground,is during the high holy days.,It's a sign of total submission.,Now in our community,nwhen we get up off the ground,,we stand with our handsnraised to the heavens,,and we say, "I am strong,nI am mighty, and I am worthy.,I can't do everything,nbut I can do something." 
 In a world that conspiresnto make us believe that we are invisible,and that we are impotent,,religious communities and religious ritual,can remind us that for whatevernamount of time we have here on this Earth,,whatever gifts and blessingsnwe were given,,whatever resources we have,,we can and we must use them,to try to make the worldna little bit more just,and a little bit more loving. 
 The fourth and finalnis interconnectedness.,A few years ago, there was a mannwalking on the beach in Alaska,,when he came across a soccer ball,that had some Japanesenletters written on it.,He took a picture of itnand posted it up on social media,,and a Japanese teenager contacted him.,He had lost everything in the tsunaminthat devastated his country,,but he was ablento retrieve that soccer ball,after it had floatednall the way across the Pacific.,How small our world has become.,It's so hard for us to remembernhow interconnected we all are,as human beings.,And yet, we know,that it is systems of oppression,that benefit the mostnfrom the lie of radical individualism. 
 Let me tell you how this works.,I'm not supposed to care,when black youth are harassed by police,,because my white-looking Jewish kids,probably won't ever get pulled overnfor the crime of driving while black.,Well, not so, becausenthis is also my problem.,And guess what?nTransphobia and Islamophobia,and racism of all forms,nthose are also all of our problems.,And so too is anti-Semitismnall of our problems.,Because Emma Lazarus was right. 
 (Applause) 
 Emma Lazarus was rightnwhen she said until all of us are free,,we are none of us free.,We are all in this together.,And now somewhere at the intersectionnof these four trends,,of wakefulness and hopenand mightiness and interconnectedness,,there is a burgeoning, multifaithnjustice movement in this country,that is staking a claim on a countertrend,,saying that religion can and must bena force for good in the world. 
 Our hearts hurt fromnthe failed religion of extremism,,and we deserve morenthan the failed religion of routine-ism.,It is time for religious leadersnand religious communities,to take the lead in the spiritualnand cultural shift,that this country and the worldnso desperately needs --,a shift toward love,,toward justice, toward equalitynand toward dignity for all.,I believe that our childrenndeserve no less than that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Last year,,three of my family membersnwere gruesomely murdered,in a hate crime.,It goes without sayingnthat it's really difficult,for me to be here today,,but my brother Deah,,his wife Yusor,,and her sister Razan,don't give me much of a choice.,I'm hopeful that by the endnof this talk you will make a choice,,and join me in standing up against hate. 
 It's December 27, 2014:,the morning of my brother's wedding day.,He asks me to come over and comb his hair,in preparationnfor his wedding photo shoot.,A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball,nparticularly Steph Curry, fanatic -- 
 (Laughter) 
 An American kid in dental schoolnready to take on the world.,When Deah and Yusornhave their first dance,,I see the love in his eyes,,her reciprocated joy,,and my emotions begin to overwhelm me.,I move to the back of the hallnand burst into tears.,And the second the song finishes playing,,he beelines towards me,,buries me into his arms,and rocks me back and forth.,Even in that moment,,when everything was so distracting,,he was attuned to me. 
 He cups my face and says,,"Suzanne,,I am who I am because of you.,Thank you for everything.,I love you." 
 About a month later, I'm back homenin North Carolina for a short visit,,and on the last evening,nI run upstairs to Deah's room,,eager to find out how he's feelingnbeing a newly married man.,With a big boyish smile he says,,"I'm so happy. I love her.nShe's an amazing girl.",And she is.,At just 21, she'd recentlynbeen accepted to join Deah,at UNC dental school.,She shared his love for basketball,nand at her urging,,they started their honeymoon offnattending their favorite team of the NBA,,the LA Lakers.,I mean, check out that form. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll never forget that momentnsitting there with him --,how free he was in his happiness.,My littler brother,na basketball-obsessed kid,,had become and transformedninto an accomplished young man.,He was at the topnof his dental school class,,and alongside Yusor and Razan,,was involved in local and internationalncommunity service projects,dedicated to the homeless and refugees,,including a dental relief tripnthey were planning,for Syrian refugees in Turkey. 
 Razan, at just 19,,used her creativitynas an architectural engineering student,to serve those around her,,making care packagesnfor the local homeless,,among other projects.,That is who they were. 
 Standing there that night,,I take a deep breathnand look at Deah and tell him,,"I have never been more proud of younthan I am in this moment.",He pulls me into his tall frame,,hugs me goodnight,,and I leave the next morningnwithout waking him,to go back to San Francisco.,That is the last time I ever hug him. 
 Ten days later, I'm on callnat San Francisco General Hospital,when I receive a barrage of vaguentext messages expressing condolences.,Confused, I call my father,nwho calmly intones,,"There's been a shootingnin Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.,It's on lock-down. That's all we know.",I hang up and quickly Google,n"shooting in Chapel Hill.",One hit comes up.,Quote:,"Three people were shotnin the back of the head,and confirmed dead on the scene.",Something in me just knows.,I fling out of my chair and faintnonto the gritty hospital floor,,wailing. 
 I take the first red-eyenout of San Francisco,,numb and disoriented.,I walk into my childhood homenand faint into my parents' arms,,sobbing.,I then run up to Deah's roomnas I did so many times before,,just looking for him,,only to find a voidnthat will never be filled. 
 Investigation and autopsy reportsneventually revealed,the sequence of events.,Deah had just gottennoff the bus from class,,Razan was visiting for dinner,,already at home with Yusor.,As they began to eat,nthey heard a knock on the door.,When Deah opened it,,their neighbor proceedednto fire multiple shots at him.,According to 911 calls,,the girls were heard screaming.,The man turned towards the kitchennand fired a single shot into Yusor's hip,,immobilizing her.,He then approached her from behind,,pressed the barrel of his gunnagainst her head,,and with a single bullet,nlacerated her midbrain.,He then turned towards Razan,nwho was screaming for her life,,and, execution-style, with a single bullet,to the back of the head,,killed her.,On his way out,,he shot Deah one last time --na bullet in the mouth --,for a total of eight bullets:,two lodged in the head,,two in his chest,and the rest in his extremities. 
 Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed,in a place that was meantnto be safe: their home.,For months, this mannhad been harassing them:,knocking on their door,,brandishing his gunnon a couple of occasions.,His Facebook was clutterednwith anti-religion posts.,Yusor felt particularly threatened by him.,As she was moving in,,he told Yusor and her momnthat he didn't like the way they looked.,In response, Yusor's mom told hernto be kind to her neighbor,,that as he got to know them,,he'd see them for who they were.,I guess we've all becomenso numb to the hatred,that we couldn't have ever imaginednit turning into fatal violence. 
 The man who murdered my brothernturned himself in to the police,shortly after the murders,,saying he killed three kids,,execution-style,,over a parking dispute.,The police issued a prematurenpublic statement that morning,,echoing his claimsnwithout bothering to question it,or further investigate.,It turns out there was no parking dispute.,There was no argument.,No violation.,But the damage was already done.,In a 24-hour media cycle,,the words "parking dispute" had alreadynbecome the go-to sound bite. 
 I sit on my brother's bednand remember his words,,the words he gave menso freely and with so much love,,"I am who I am because of you.",That's what it takes for mento climb through my crippling grief,and speak out.,I cannot let my family's deathsnbe diminished to a segment,that is barely discussed on local news.,They were murdered by their neighbornbecause of their faith,,because of a piece of clothnthey chose to don on their heads,,because they were visibly Muslim. 
 Some of the rage I felt at the time,was that if roles were reversed,,and an Arab, Muslimnor Muslim-appearing person,had killed three white Americanncollege students execution-style,,in their home,,what would we have called it?,A terrorist attack.,When white men commitnacts of violence in the US,,they're lone wolves,,mentally ill,or driven by a parking dispute.,I know that I have to givenmy family voice,,and I do the only thing I know how:,I send a Facebook messagento everyone I know in media. 
 A couple of hours later,,in the midst of a chaotic housenoverflowing with friends and family,,our neighbor Neal comes over,nsits down next to my parents,and asks, "What can I do?",Neal had over two decadesnof experience in journalism,,but he makes it clear that he's notnthere in his capacity as journalist,,but as a neighbor who wants to help.,I ask him what he thinks we should do,,given the bombardmentnof local media interview requests.,He offers to set up a press conferencenat a local community center.,Even now I don't haventhe words to thank him.,"Just tell me when, and I'll havenall the news channels present," he said. 
 He did for us what wencould not do for ourselves,in a moment of devastation.,I delivered the press statement,,still wearing scrubsnfrom the previous night.,And in under 24 hours from the murders,,I'm on CNN being interviewednby Anderson Cooper.,The following day, major newspapers --,including the New York Times,nChicago Tribune --,published stories about Deah,nYusor and Razan,,allowing us to reclaim the narrative,and call attention the mainstreamingnof anti-Muslim hatred. 
 These days,,it feels like Islamophobianis a socially acceptable form of bigotry.,We just have to put up with it and smile.,The nasty stares,,the palpable fear when boarding a plane,,the random pat downs at airportsnthat happen 99 percent of the time. 
 It doesn't stop there.,We have politicians reaping politicalnand financial gains off our backs.,Here in the US,,we have presidential candidatesnlike Donald Trump,,casually calling to registernAmerican Muslims,,and ban Muslim immigrants and refugeesnfrom entering this country.,It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise,in parallel with election cycles. 
 Just a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara,,a Lebanese-American Christian,,was murdered in Oklahomanby his neighbor --,a man who called him a "filthy Arab.",This man was previously jailednfor a mere 8 months,,after attempting run overnKhalid's mother with his car.,Chances are you haven't heardnKhalid's story,,because it didn't make itnto national news.,The least we can do is call it what it is:,a hate crime.,The least we can do is talk about it,,because violence and hatredndoesn't just happen in a vacuum. 
 Not long after coming back to work,,I'm the senior on rounds in the hospital,,when one of my patientsnlooks over at my colleague,,gestures around her facenand says, "San Bernardino,",referencing a recent terrorist attack.,Here I am having just lost threenfamily members to Islamophobia,,having been a vocal advocatenwithin my program,on how to deal with such microaggressions,,and yet --,silence.,I was disheartened.,Humiliated. 
 Days later rounding on the same patient,,she looks at me and says,,"Your people are killingnpeople in Los Angeles.",I look around expectantly.,Again:,silence.,I realize that yet again,,I have to speak up for myself.,I sit on her bed and gently ask her,,"Have I ever done anythingnbut treat you with respect and kindness?,Have I done anything but givenyou compassionate care?",She looks down and realizesnwhat she said was wrong,,and in front of the entire team,,she apologizes and says,,"I should know better.nI'm Mexican-American.,I receive this kindnof treatment all the time." 
 Many of us experiencenmicroaggressions on a daily basis.,Odds are you may have experienced it,,whether for your race,,gender,,sexuality,or religious beliefs.,We've all been in situationsnwhere we've witnessed something wrong,and didn't speak up.,Maybe we weren't equippednwith the tools to respond in the moment.,Maybe we weren't even awarenof our own implicit biases.,We can all agree that bigotrynis unacceptable,,but when we see it,,we're silent,,because it makes us uncomfortable. 
 But stepping right into that discomfort,means you are also steppingninto the ally zone.,There may be over three millionnMuslims in America.,That's still just one percentnof the total population.,Martin Luther King once said,,"In the end,,we will remember notnthe words of our enemies,,but the silence of our friends." 
 So what made my neighbornNeal's allyship so profound?,A couple of things.,He was there as a neighbor who cared,,but he was also bringing innhis professional expertise and resources,when the moment called for it.,Others have done the same.,Larycia Hawkins drew on her platform,as the first tenured African-Americannprofessor at Wheaton College,to wear a hijab in solidarity,with Muslim women who facendiscrimination every day.,As a result, she lost her job.,Within a month,,she joined the facultynat the University of Virginia,,where she now works on pluralism,nrace, faith and culture. 
 Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian,,demonstrated that not all activenallyship needs to be so serious.,He stepped up to supportna 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission,to introduce a hijab emoji. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a simple gesture,,but it has a significantnsubconscious impact,on normalizing and humanizing Muslims,,including the communitynas a part of an "us",instead of an "other.",The editor in chiefnof Women's Running magazine,just put the first hijabi to ever benon the cover of a US fitness magazine.,These are all very different examples,of people who drew uponntheir platforms and resources,in academia, tech and media,,to actively express their allyship. 
 What resources and expertisendo you bring to the table?,Are you willing to stepninto your discomfort,and speak up when you witnessnhateful bigotry?,Will you be Neal? 
 Many neighbors appeared in this story.,And you, in your respective communities,nall have a Muslim neighbor,,colleague,or friend your child plays with at school.,Reach out to them.,Let them know you standnwith them in solidarity.,It may feel really small,,but I promise you it makes a difference. 
 Nothing will ever bring backnDeah, Yusor and Razan.,But when we raise our collective voices,,that is when we stop the hate. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I recently read aboutnwhat the young generation of workers want,in Harvard Business Review.,One thing that stuck out to menwas: don't just talk about impact,,but make an impact.,I'm a little bit older than you,,maybe much older than you,,but this is exactly the same goalnthat I had when I was in college.,I wanted to make my own impactnfor those who live under injustice;,it's the reason that I becamena documentary journalist,,the reason I became,a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days. 
 It was March 17, 2009.,It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,,but it was the daynthat turned my life upside down.,My team and I were making a documentarynabout North Korean refugees,living below human life in China.,We were at the border.,It was our last day of filming.,There was no wire fence,or bars,or sign to show that it is the border,,but this is a place that a lotnof North Korean defectors use,as an escape route.,It was still winter,,and the river was frozen.,When we were in the middlenof the frozen river,,we were filming aboutnthe condition of the cold weather,and the environment,that North Koreans had to deal with,when they seek their freedom.,And suddenly, onenof my team members shouted,,"Soldiers!",So I looked back,,and there were two small soldiersnin green uniforms with rifles,,chasing after us.,We all ran as fast as we could.,I prayed that, pleasendon't let them shoot my head.,And I was thinking that,,if my feet are on Chinese soil,,I'll be safe.,And I made it to Chinese soil.,Then I saw my colleaguenLaura Ling fall on her knees.,I didn't know what to donat that short moment,,but I knew that I could notnleave her alone there,when she said,n"Euna, I can't feel my legs." 
 In a flash, we were surroundednby these two Korean soldiers.,They were not much bigger than us,,but they were determinednto take us to their army base.,I begged and yelled for any kind of help,,hoping that someonenwould show up from China.,Here I was, being stubborn,towards a trained soldier with a gun.,I looked at his eyes.,He was just a boy.,At that moment,nhe raised his rifle to hit me,,but I saw that he was hesitating.,His eyes were shaking,,and his rifle was still up in the air.,So I shouted at him,,"OK, OK, I'll walk with you.",And I got up. 
 When we arrived at their army base,,my head was spinningnwith these worst-case scenarios,,and my colleague'snstatement wasn't helping.,She said, "We are the enemy.",She was right: we were the enemy.,And I was supposed to be frightened, too.,But I kept having these odd experiences.,This time, an officer brought me his coat,to keep me warm,,because I lost my coat on the frozen river,while battling with one of these soldiers. 
 I will tell you what I meannby these odd experiences.,I grew up in South Korea.,To us, North Korea was always the enemy,,even before I was born.,South and North have beennunder armistice for 63 years,,since the end of the Korean War.,And growing up in the Southnin the '80s and '90s,,we were taught propagandanabout North Korea.,And we heard so many graphic stories,,such as, a little young boynbeing brutally killed,by North Korean spiesnjust because he said,,"I don't like communists.",Or, I watched this cartoon series,about a young South Korean boyndefeating these fat, big, red pig,,which represented the North Koreans'nfirst leader at the time.,And the effect of hearingnthese horrible stories over and over,instilled one word in a young mind:,"enemy.",And I think at some point,nI dehumanized them,,and the people of North Koreanbecame equated,with the North Korean government. 
 Now, back to my detention.,It was the second day,of being in a cell.,I had not sleptnsince I was out at the border.,This young guard came to my cell,and offered me this small boiled egg,and said, "This will give younstrength to keep going.",Do you know what it is like,,receiving a small kindnessnin the enemy's hand?,Whenever they were kind to me,nI thought the worst case,was waiting for me after the kindness.,One officer noticed my nervousness.,He said, "Did you thinknwe were all these red pigs?",referring to the cartoonnthat I just showed you.,Every day was like a psychological battle.,The interrogator had me sit at a table,six days a week,and had me writing downnabout my journey, my work,,over and over until I wrote downnthe confession that they wanted to hear. 
 After about three months of detention,,the North Korean court sentenced me,to 12 years in a labor camp.,So I was just sitting in my roomnto be transferred.,At that time, I really hadnnothing else to do,,so I paid attentionnto these two female guards,and listened to whatnthey were talking about.,Guard A was older,,and she studied English.,She seemed like she camenfrom an affluent family.,She often showed upnwith these colorful dresses,,and then loved to show off.,And Guard B was the younger one,,and she was a really good singer.,She loved to sing Celine Dion'sn"My Heart Will Go On" --,sometimes too much.,She knew just hownto torture me without knowing. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this girl spent a lot of timenin the morning to put on makeup,,like you can see in any young girl's life.,And they loved to watchnthis Chinese drama,,a better quality production.,I remember Guard B said,,"I can no longer watch our TV showsnafter watching this.",She got scolded,for degrading her own country'snproduced TV shows.,Guard B had morenof a free mind than Guard A,,and she often got scolded by Guard Anwhenever she expressed herself. 
 One day, they invitednall these female colleagues --,I don't know where they came from --,to where I was held,,and they invited me,to their guard room,and asked,if one-night standsnreally happen in the US. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is the country wherenyoung couples are not even allowed,to hold hands in public.,I had no idea where theynhad gotten this information,,but they were shy and gigglyneven before I said anything.,I think we all forgotnthat I was their prisoner,,and it was like going backnto my high school classroom again.,And I learned that these girls alsongrew up watching a similar cartoon,,but just propaganda towardsnSouth Korea and the US.,I started to understand wherenthese people's anger was coming from.,If these girls grew upnlearning that we are enemies,,it was just naturalnthat they would hate us,just as I feared them.,But at that moment, we were all just girls,who shared the same interests,,beyond our ideologies that separated us. 
 I shared these stories with my bossnat Current TV at the time,after I came home.,His first reaction was,,"Euna, have you heardnof Stockholm Syndrome?",Yes, and I clearly remember,the feeling of fear,and being threatened,,and tension rising upnbetween me and the interrogator,when we talked about politics.,There definitely was a wallnthat we couldn't climb over.,But we were able to seeneach other as human beings,when we talked about family,,everyday life,,the importance of the futurenfor our children. 
 It was about a month before I came home.,I got really sick.,Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye,,because she was leavingnthe detention center.,She made sure that no one watched us,,no one heard us,,and quietly said,,"I hope you get better,and go back to your family soon.",It is these people --,the officer who brought me his coat,,the guard who offered me a boiled egg,,these female guards who asked menabout dating life in the US --,they are the onesnthat I remember of North Korea:,humans just like us.,North Koreans and I were notnambassadors of our countries,,but I believe that we were representing,the human race. 
 Now I'm back home and back to my life.,The memory of these peoplenhas blurred as time has passed.,And I'm in this place,where I read and hearnabout North Korea provoking the US.,I realized how easy it is,to see them as an enemy again.,But I have to keep reminding myselfnthat when I was over there,,I was able to see humanity,over hatred,in my enemy's eyes. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary. 
 Jonathan Haidt: Yeah. 
 CA: It feels like the world is in a place,that we haven't seen for a long time.,People don't just disagreenin the way that we're familiar with,,on the left-right political divide.,There are much deeper differences afoot.,What on earth is going on,nand how did we get here? 
 JH: This is different.,There's a much morenapocalyptic sort of feeling.,Survey research by Pew Research shows,that the degree to which we feelnthat the other side is not just --,we don't just dislike them;nwe strongly dislike them,,and we think that they arena threat to the nation.,Those numbers have been going up and up,,and those are over 50 percentnnow on both sides.,People are scared,,because it feels like this is differentnthan before; it's much more intense. 
 Whenever I looknat any sort of social puzzle,,I always apply the three basicnprinciples of moral psychology,,and I think they'll help us here.,So the first thing that younhave to always keep in mind,when you're thinking about politics,is that we're tribal.,We evolved for tribalism.,One of the simplest and greatestninsights into human social nature,is the Bedouin proverb:,"Me against my brother;,me and my brother against our cousin;,me and my brother and cousinsnagainst the stranger.",And that tribalism allowed usnto create large societies,and to come togethernin order to compete with others.,That brought us out of the junglenand out of small groups,,but it means that we haveneternal conflict.,The question you have to look at is:,What aspects of our societynare making that more bitter,,and what are calming them down? 
 CA: That's a very dark proverb.,You're saying that that's actuallynbaked into most people's mental wiring,at some level? 
 JH: Oh, absolutely. This is justna basic aspect of human social cognition.,But we can also live togethernreally peacefully,,and we've invented all kindsnof fun ways of, like, playing war.,I mean, sports, politics --,these are all ways that we getnto exercise this tribal nature,without actually hurting anyone.,We're also really good at tradenand exploration and meeting new people.,So you have to see our tribalismnas something that goes up or down --,it's not like we're doomednto always be fighting each other,,but we'll never have world peace. 
 CA: The size of that tribencan shrink or expand. 
 JH: Right. 
 CA: The size of what we consider "us",and what we consider "other" or "them",can change.,And some people believed that processncould continue indefinitely. 
 JH: That's right. 
 CA: And we were indeed expandingnthe sense of tribe for a while. 
 JH: So this is, I think,,where we're getting at what's possiblynthe new left-right distinction.,I mean, the left-rightnas we've all inherited it,,comes out of the labornversus capital distinction,,and the working class, and Marx.,But I think what we're seeingnnow, increasingly,,is a divide in all the Western democracies,between the peoplenwho want to stop at nation,,the people who are more parochial --,and I don't mean that in a bad way --,people who have much morenof a sense of being rooted,,they care about their town,ntheir community and their nation.,And then those who arenanti-parochial and who --,whenever I get confused, I just thinknof the John Lennon song "Imagine.","Imagine there's no countries,nnothing to kill or die for.",And so these are the peoplenwho want more global governance,,they don't like nation states,nthey don't like borders.,You see this all over Europe as well.,There's a great metaphor guy --nactually, his name is Shakespeare --,writing ten years ago in Britain.,He had a metaphor:,"Are we drawbridge-uppersnor drawbridge-downers?",And Britain is dividedn52-48 on that point.,And America is divided on that point, too. 
 CA: And so, those of usnwho grew up with The Beatles,and that sort of hippie philosophynof dreaming of a more connected world --,it felt so idealistic and "how couldnanyone think badly about that?",And what you're saying is that, actually,,millions of people todaynfeel that that isn't just silly;,it's actually dangerous and wrong,nand they're scared of it. 
 JH: I think the big issue, especiallynin Europe but also here,,is the issue of immigration.,And I think this is wherenwe have to look very carefully,at the social sciencenabout diversity and immigration.,Once something becomes politicized,,once it becomes somethingnthat the left loves and the right --,then even the social scientistsncan't think straight about it.,Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.,It clearly creates more innovation.,The American economynhas grown enormously from it.,Diversity and immigrationndo a lot of good things.,But what the globalists,nI think, don't see,,what they don't want to see,,is that ethnic diversityncuts social capital and trust. 
 There's a very importantnstudy by Robert Putnam,,the author of "Bowling Alone,",looking at social capital databases.,And basically, the more peoplenfeel that they are the same,,the more they trust each other,,the more they can havena redistributionist welfare state.,Scandinavian countries are so wonderful,because they have this legacynof being small, homogenous countries.,And that leads tona progressive welfare state,,a set of progressivenleft-leaning values, which says,,"Drawbridge down!nThe world is a great place.,People in Syria are suffering --nwe must welcome them in.",And it's a beautiful thing.,But if, and I was in Swedennthis summer,,if the discourse in Swedennis fairly politically correct,and they can't talk about the downsides,,you end up bringing a lot of people in.,That's going to cut social capital,,it makes it hard to have a welfare state,and they might end up,nas we have in America,,with a racially divided, visiblynracially divided, society.,So this is all verynuncomfortable to talk about.,But I think this is the thing,nespecially in Europe and for us, too,,we need to be looking at. 
 CA: You're saying that people of reason,,people who would considernthemselves not racists,,but moral, upstanding people,,have a rationale that saysnhumans are just too different;,that we're in danger of overloadingnour sense of what humans are capable of,,by mixing in people who are too different. 
 JH: Yes, but I can make itnmuch more palatable,by saying it's not necessarily about race.,It's about culture.,There's wonderful work by a politicalnscientist named Karen Stenner,,who shows that when people have a sense,that we are all united,nwe're all the same,,there are many people who havena predisposition to authoritarianism.,Those people aren't particularly racist,when they feel as throughnthere's not a threat,to our social and moral order.,But if you prime them experimentally,by thinking we're coming apart,npeople are getting more different,,then they get more racist, homophobic,nthey want to kick out the deviants.,So it's in part that you getnan authoritarian reaction.,The left, following throughnthe Lennonist line --,the John Lennon line --,does things that createnan authoritarian reaction. 
 We're certainly seeing thatnin America with the alt-right.,We saw it in Britain,nwe've seen it all over Europe.,But the more positive part of that,is that I think the localists,nor the nationalists, are actually right --,that, if you emphasizenour cultural similarity,,then race doesn't actuallynmatter very much.,So an assimilationistnapproach to immigration,removes a lot of these problems.,And if you value havingna generous welfare state,,you've got to emphasizenthat we're all the same. 
 CA: OK, so rising immigrationnand fears about that,are one of the causesnof the current divide.,What are other causes? 
 JH: The next principle of moral psychology,is that intuitions come first,nstrategic reasoning second.,You've probably heardnthe term "motivated reasoning",or "confirmation bias.",There's some really interesting work,on how our high intelligencenand our verbal abilities,might have evolvednnot to help us find out the truth,,but to help us manipulate each other,ndefend our reputation ...,We're really, really goodnat justifying ourselves.,And when you bringngroup interests into account,,so it's not just me,nit's my team versus your team,,whereas if you're evaluating evidencenthat your side is wrong,,we just can't accept that.,So this is why you can't winna political argument.,If you're debating something,,you can't persuade the personnwith reasons and evidence,,because that's notnthe way reasoning works.,So now, give us the internet,ngive us Google:,"I heard that Barack Obamanwas born in Kenya.,Let me Google that -- oh my God!n10 million hits! Look, he was!" 
 CA: So this has come as an unpleasantnsurprise to a lot of people.,Social media has often been framednby techno-optimists,as this great connecting forcenthat would bring people together.,And there have been somenunexpected counter-effects to that. 
 JH: That's right.,That's why I'm very enamorednof yin-yang views,of human nature and left-right --,that each side is rightnabout certain things,,but then it goes blind to other things.,And so the left generally believesnthat human nature is good:,bring people together, knock downnthe walls and all will be well.,The right -- social conservatives,nnot libertarians --,social conservatives generallynbelieve people can be greedy,and sexual and selfish,,and we need regulation,nand we need restrictions.,So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,,allow people to communicatenall over the world,,you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism. 
 CA: So help us understand.,These principles of human naturenhave been with us forever.,What's changed that's deepenednthis feeling of division? 
 JH: You have to see six to tenndifferent threads all coming together.,I'll just list a couple of them.,So in America, one of the big --nactually, America and Europe --,one of the biggest ones is World War II.,There's interesting researchnfrom Joe Henrich and others,that says if your country was at war,,especially when you were young,,then we test you 30 years laternin a commons dilemma,or a prisoner's dilemma,,you're more cooperative.,Because of our tribal nature, if you're --,my parents were teenagersnduring World War II,,and they would go outnlooking for scraps of aluminum,to help the war effort.,I mean, everybody pulled together.,And so then these people go on,,they rise up through businessnand government,,they take leadership positions.,They're really goodnat compromise and cooperation.,They all retire by the '90s.,So we're left with baby boomersnby the end of the '90s.,And their youth was spent fightingneach other within each country,,in 1968 and afterwards.,The loss of the World War II generation,n"The Greatest Generation,",is huge.,So that's one. 
 Another, in America,nis the purification of the two parties.,There used to be liberal Republicansnand conservative Democrats.,So America had a mid-20th centurynthat was really bipartisan.,But because of a variety of factorsnthat started things moving,,by the 90's, we had a purifiednliberal party and conservative party.,So now, the people in either partynreally are different,,and we really don't wantnour children to marry them,,which, in the '60s,ndidn't matter very much.,So, the purification of the parties.,Third is the internet and, as I said,,it's just the most amazing stimulantnfor post-hoc reasoning and demonization. 
 CA: The tone of what's happeningnon the internet now is quite troubling.,I just did a quick searchnon Twitter about the election,and saw two tweets next to each other.,One, against a picture of racist graffiti:,"This is disgusting!,Ugliness in this country,nbrought to us by #Trump.",And then the next one is:,"Crooked Hillaryndedication page. Disgusting!",So this idea of "disgust"nis troubling to me.,Because you can have an argumentnor a disagreement about something,,you can get angry at someone.,Disgust, I've heard you say,ntakes things to a much deeper level. 
 JH: That's right. Disgust is different.,Anger -- you know, I have kids.,They fight 10 times a day,,and they love each other 30 times a day.,You just go back and forth:nyou get angry, you're not angry;,you're angry, you're not angry.,But disgust is different.,Disgust paints the personnas subhuman, monstrous,,deformed, morally deformed.,Disgust is like indelible ink.,There's research from John Gottmannon marital therapy.,If you look at the faces -- if onenof the couple shows disgust or contempt,,that's a predictor that they're goingnto get divorced soon,,whereas if they show anger,nthat doesn't predict anything,,because if you deal with anger well,nit actually is good. 
 So this election is different.,Donald Trump personallynuses the word "disgust" a lot.,He's very germ-sensitive,nso disgust does matter a lot --,more for him, that's somethingnunique to him --,but as we demonize each other more,,and again, throughnthe Manichaean worldview,,the idea that the worldnis a battle between good and evil,as this has been ramping up,,we're more likely not just to saynthey're wrong or I don't like them,,but we say they're evil, they're satanic,,they're disgusting, they're revolting.,And then we want nothing to do with them.,And that's why I think we're seeing it,nfor example, on campus now.,We're seeing more the urgento keep people off campus,,silence them, keep them away.,I'm afraid that this wholengeneration of young people,,if their introduction to politicsninvolves a lot of disgust,,they're not going to want to be involvednin politics as they get older. 
 CA: So how do we deal with that?,Disgust. How do you defuse disgust? 
 JH: You can't do it with reasons.,I think ...,I studied disgust for many years,nand I think about emotions a lot.,And I think that the oppositenof disgust is actually love.,Love is all about, like ...,Disgust is closing off, borders.,Love is about dissolving walls.,So personal relationships, I think,,are probably the mostnpowerful means we have.,You can be disgusted by a group of people,,but then you meet a particular person,and you genuinely discovernthat they're lovely.,And then gradually that chips awaynor changes your category as well.,The tragedy is, Americans used to benmuch more mixed up in the their towns,by left-right or politics.,And now that it's becomenthis great moral divide,,there's a lot of evidencenthat we're moving to be near people,who are like us politically.,It's harder to find somebodynwho's on the other side.,So they're over there, they're far away.,It's harder to get to know them. 
 CA: What would you say to someonenor say to Americans,,people generally,,about what we should understandnabout each other,that might help us rethink for a minute,this "disgust" instinct? 
 JH: Yes.,A really importantnthing to keep in mind --,there's research by politicalnscientist Alan Abramowitz,,showing that American democracynis increasingly governed,by what's called "negative partisanship.",That means you think,nOK there's a candidate,,you like the candidate,nyou vote for the candidate.,But with the rise of negative advertising,and social medianand all sorts of other trends,,increasingly, the way elections are done,is that each side tries to makenthe other side so horrible, so awful,,that you'll vote for my guy by default. 
 And so as we more and more votenagainst the other side,and not for our side,,you have to keep in mindnthat if people are on the left,,they think, "Well, I used to thinknthat Republicans were bad,,but now Donald Trump proves it.,And now every Republican,nI can paint with all the things,that I think about Trump.",And that's not necessarily true.,They're generally not very happynwith their candidate. 
 This is the most negative partisanshipnelection in American history.,So you have to first separatenyour feelings about the candidate,from your feelings about the peoplenwho are given a choice.,And then you have to realize that,,because we all livenin a separate moral world --,the metaphor I use in the booknis that we're all trapped in "The Matrix,",or each moral community is a matrix,na consensual hallucination.,And so if you're within the blue matrix,,everything's completely compellingnthat the other side --,they're troglodytes, they're racists,nthey're the worst people in the world,,and you have all the factsnto back that up.,But somebody in the next house from yours,is living in a different moral matrix.,They live in a different video game,,and they see a completelyndifferent set of facts.,And each one seesndifferent threats to the country.,And what I've foundnfrom being in the middle,and trying to understand both sidesnis: both sides are right.,There are a lot of threatsnto this country,,and each side is constitutionallynincapable of seeing them all. 
 CA: So, are you sayingnthat we almost need a new type of empathy?,Empathy is traditionally framed as:,"Oh, I feel your pain.nI can put myself in your shoes.",And we apply it to the poor,nthe needy, the suffering.,We don't usually apply itnto people who we feel as other,,or we're disgusted by. 
 JH: No. That's right. 
 CA: What would it look likento build that type of empathy? 
 JH: Actually, I think ...,Empathy is a very, verynhot topic in psychology,,and it's a very popular wordnon the left in particular.,Empathy is a good thing, and empathynfor the preferred classes of victims.,So it's important to empathize,with the groups that we on the leftnthink are so important.,That's easy to do,nbecause you get points for that. 
 But empathy really should get you pointsnif you do it when it's hard to do.,And, I think ...,You know, we had a long 50-year periodnof dealing with our race problems,and legal discrimination,,and that was our top prioritynfor a long time,and it still is important.,But I think this year,,I'm hoping it will make people see,that we have an existentialnthreat on our hands.,Our left-right divide, I believe,,is by far the most importantndivide we face.,We still have issues about racenand gender and LGBT,,but this is the urgent neednof the next 50 years,,and things aren't goingnto get better on their own.,So we're going to need to dona lot of institutional reforms,,and we could talk about that,,but that's like a whole long,nwonky conversation.,But I think it starts with peoplenrealizing that this is a turning point.,And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.,We need to realize:,this is what our country needs,,and this is what you neednif you don't want to --,Raise your hand if you wantnto spend the next four years,as angry and worried as you've beennfor the last year -- raise your hand.,So if you want to escape from this,,read Buddha, read Jesus,nread Marcus Aurelius.,They have all kinds of great advicenfor how to drop the fear,,reframe things,,stop seeing other people as your enemy.,There's a lot of guidance in ancientnwisdom for this kind of empathy. 
 CA: Here's my last question:,Personally, what cannpeople do to help heal? 
 JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decidento overcome your deepest prejudices.,And there's research showing,that political prejudices are deepernand stronger than race prejudices,in the country now.,So I think you have to make an effort --nthat's the main thing.,Make an effort to actually meet somebody.,Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,,somebody who's on the other side.,So, after this election --,wait a week or two,,because it's probably going to feelnawful for one of you --,but wait a couple weeks, and thennreach out and say you want to talk.,And before you do it,,read Dale Carnegie, "How to WinnFriends and Influence People" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm totally serious.,You'll learn techniquesnif you start by acknowledging,,if you start by saying,,"You know, we don't agree on a lot,,but one thing I really respectnabout you, Uncle Bob,",or "... about you conservatives, is ... ",And you can find something.,If you start with somenappreciation, it's like magic.,This is one of the mainnthings I've learned,that I take into my human relationships.,I still make lots of stupid mistakes,,but I'm incredibly goodnat apologizing now,,and at acknowledging whatnsomebody was right about.,And if you do that,,then the conversation goes really well,nand it's actually really fun. 
 CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinatingnspeaking with you.,It really does feel likenthe ground that we're on,is a ground populated by deep questionsnof morality and human nature.,Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant.,Thank you so much for sharingnthis time with us. 
 JH: Thanks, Chris. 
 JH: Thanks, everyone. 
 (Applause)Most of us go through life tryingnto do our best at whatever we do,,whether it's our job, family, school,or anything else.,I feel that way. I try my best.,But some time ago, I came to a realization,that I wasn't getting much betternat the things I cared most about,,whether it was being a husband or a friend,or a professional or teammate,,and I wasn't improvingnmuch at those things,even though I was spending a lot of time,working hard at them.,I've since realized from conversationsnI've had and from research,that this stagnation, despite hard work,,turns out to be pretty common. 
 So I'd like to share with younsome insights into why that is,and what we can all do about it.,What I've learnednis that the most effective people,and teams in any domain,do something we can all emulate.,They go through life deliberatelynalternating between two zones:,the learning zonenand the performance zone. 
 The learning zonenis when our goal is to improve.,Then we do activitiesndesigned for improvement,,concentrating on whatnwe haven't mastered yet,,which means we have to expectnto make mistakes,,knowing that we will learn from them.,That is very different from what we donwhen we're in our performance zone,,which is when our goal is to do somethingnas best as we can, to execute.,Then we concentratenon what we have already mastered,and we try to minimize mistakes. 
 Both of these zonesnshould be part of our lives,,but being clear aboutnwhen we want to be in each of them,,with what goal, focus and expectations,,helps us better performnand better improve.,The performance zone maximizesnour immediate performance,,while the learning zonenmaximizes our growth,and our future performance.,The reason many of us don't improve much,despite our hard work,is that we tend to spend almostnall of our time in the performance zone.,This hinders our growth,,and ironically, over the long term,nalso our performance. 
 So what does the learning zone look like?,Take Demosthenes, a political leader,and the greatest oratornand lawyer in ancient Greece.,To become great,nhe didn't spend all his time,just being an orator or a lawyer,,which would be his performance zone.,But instead, he did activitiesndesigned for improvement.,Of course, he studied a lot.,He studied law and philosophynwith guidance from mentors,,but he also realized that being a lawyerninvolved persuading other people,,so he also studied great speeches,and acting.,To get rid of an odd habit he hadnof involuntarily lifting his shoulder,,he practiced his speechesnin front of a mirror,,and he suspended a sword from the ceiling,so that if he raised his shoulder,,it would hurt. 
 (Laughter) 
 To speak more clearly despite a lisp,,he went through his speechesnwith stones in his mouth.,He built an underground room,where he could practicenwithout interruptions,and not disturb other people.,And since courts at the timenwere very noisy,,he also practiced by the ocean,,projecting his voicenabove the roar of the waves. 
 His activities in the learning zone,were very differentnfrom his activities in court,,his performance zone.,In the learning zone,,he did what Dr. Anders Ericssonncalls deliberate practice.,This involves breaking downnabilities into component skills,,being clear about what subskillnwe're working to improve,,like keeping our shoulders down,,giving full concentrationnto a high level of challenge,outside our comfort zone,,just beyond what we can currently do,,using frequent feedbacknwith repetition and adjustments,,and ideally engaging the guidancenof a skilled coach,,because activitiesndesigned for improvement,are domain-specific,,and great teachers and coachesnknow what those activities are,and can also give us expert feedback.,It is this type of practicenin the learning zone,which leads to substantial improvement,,not just time on task performing.,For example, research showsnthat after the first couple of years,working in a profession,,performance usually plateaus.,This has been shown to be truenin teaching, general medicine,,nursing and other fields,,and it happens because once we thinknwe have become good enough,,adequate,,then we stop spending timenin the learning zone.,We focus all our timenon just doing our job,,performing,,which turns out not to bena great way to improve.,But the people who continuento spend time in the learning zone,do continue to always improve.,The best salespeople at least once a week,do activities withnthe goal of improvement.,They read to extend their knowledge,,consult with colleagues or domain experts,,try out new strategies,nsolicit feedback and reflect.,The best chess players,spend a lot of timennot playing games of chess,,which would be their performance zone,,but trying to predict the movesngrand masters made and analyzing them.,Each of us has probably spentnmany, many, many hours,typing on a computer,without getting faster,,but if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day,fully concentratingnon typing 10 to 20 percent faster,than our current reliable speed,,we would get faster,,especially if we also identifiednwhat mistakes we're making,and practiced typing those words.,That's deliberate practice. 
 In what other parts of our lives,,perhaps that we care more about,,are we working hard but not improving much,because we're alwaysnin the performance zone?,Now, this is not to saynthat the performance zone has no value.,It very much does.,When I needed a knee surgery,nI didn't tell the surgeon,,"Poke around in therenand focus on what you don't know." 
 (Laughter) 
 "We'll learn from your mistakes!",I looked for a surgeonnwho I felt would do a good job,,and I wanted her to do a good job.,Being in the performance zone,allows us to get things donenas best as we can.,It can also be motivating,,and it provides us with informationnto identify what to focus on next,when we go back to the learning zone.,So the way to high performance,is to alternate between the learning zonenand the performance zone,,purposefully building our skillsnin the learning zone,,then applying those skillsnin the performance zone. 
 When Beyoncé is on tour,,during the concert,nshe's in her performance zone,,but every night when shengets back to the hotel room,,she goes right backninto her learning zone.,She watches a videonof the show that just ended.,She identifies opportunitiesnfor improvement,,for herself, her dancersnand her camera staff.,And the next morning,,everyone receives pages of notesnwith what to adjust,,which they then work on during the daynbefore the next performance.,It's a spiral,to ever-increasing capabilities,,but we need to know when we seek to learn,nand when we seek to perform,,and while we wantnto spend time doing both,,the more time we spendnin the learning zone,,the more we'll improve. 
 So how can we spendnmore time in the learning zone?,First, we must believe and understand,that we can improve,,what we call a growth mindset.,Second, we must wantnto improve at that particular skill.,There has to be a purpose we care about,,because it takes time and effort.,Third, we must have an ideanabout how to improve,,what we can do to improve,,not how I used to practicenthe guitar as a teenager,,performing songs over and over again,,but doing deliberate practice.,And fourth, we must benin a low-stakes situation,,because if mistakes are to be expected,,then the consequence of making themnmust not be catastrophic,,or even very significant.,A tightrope walker doesn't practicennew tricks without a net underneath,,and an athlete wouldn't set outnto first try a new move,during a championship match. 
 One reason that in our lives,we spend so much timenin the performance zone,is that our environmentsnoften are, unnecessarily, high stakes.,We create social risks for one another,,even in schools which are supposednto be all about learning,,and I'm not talkingnabout standardized tests.,I mean that every minute of every day,,many students in elementarynschools through colleges,feel that if they make a mistake,nothers will think less of them.,No wonder they're always stressed out,and not taking the risksnnecessary for learning.,But they learnnthat mistakes are undesirable,inadvertently,when teachers or parentsnare eager to hear just correct answers,and reject mistakesnrather than welcome and examine them,to learn from them,,or when we look for narrow responses,rather than encouragenmore exploratory thinking,that we can all learn from.,When all homework or student worknhas a number or a letter on it,,and counts towards a final grade,,rather than being used for practice,nmistakes, feedback and revision,,we send the messagenthat school is a performance zone. 
 The same is true in our workplaces.,In the companies I consult with,nI often see flawless execution cultures,which leaders fosternto encourage great work.,But that leads employeesnto stay within what they know,and not try new things,,so companies strugglento innovate and improve,,and they fall behind. 
 We can create more spaces for growth,by starting conversations with one another,about when we want to be in each zone.,What do we want to get better at and how?,And when do we wantnto execute and minimize mistakes?,That way, we gain claritynabout what success is,,when, and how to best support one another. 
 But what if we find ourselvesnin a chronic high-stakes setting,and we feel we can'tnstart those conversations yet?,Then here are three thingsnthat we can still do as individuals.,First, we can create low-stakes islandsnin an otherwise high-stakes sea.,These are spaces where mistakesnhave little consequence.,For example, we might findna mentor or a trusted colleague,with whom we can exchange ideasnor have vulnerable conversations,or even role-play.,Or we can ask for feedback-orientednmeetings as projects progress.,Or we can set aside time to readnor watch videos or take online courses.,Those are just some examples.,Second, we can executenand perform as we're expected,,but then reflect on whatnwe could do better next time,,like Beyoncé does,,and we can observe and emulate experts.,The observation, reflectionnand adjustment is a learning zone.,And finally, we can lead,and lower the stakes for othersnby sharing what we want to get better at,,by asking questionsnabout what we don't know,,by soliciting feedbacknand by sharing our mistakes,and what we've learned from them,,so that othersncan feel safe to do the same. 
 Real confidence is aboutnmodeling ongoing learning.,What if, instead of spendingnour lives doing, doing, doing,,performing, performing, performing,,we spent more time exploring,,asking,,listening,,experimenting, reflecting,,striving and becoming?,What if we each always had something,we were working to improve?,What if we created more low-stakes islands,and waters?,And what if we got clear,,within ourselves and with our teammates,,about when we seek to learnnand when we seek to perform,,so that our effortsncan become more consequential,,our improvement never-ending,and our best even better? 
 Thank you.In 1956, a documentarynby Jacques Cousteau won,both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.,This film was called,n"Le Monde Du Silence,",or, "The Silent World.",The premise of the title was thatnthe underwater world was a quiet world.,We now know, 60 years later,,that the underwater worldnis anything but silent. 
 Although the soundsnare inaudible above water,depending on where you arenand the time of year,,the underwater soundscape can be as noisynas any jungle or rainforest.,Invertebrates like snapping shrimp,nfish and marine mammals,all use sound.,They use sound to study their habitat,,to keep in communication with each other,,to navigate,,to detect predators and prey.,They also use sound by listeningnto know something about their environment. 
 Take, for an example, the Arctic.,It's considered a vast,ninhospitable place,,sometimes described as a desert,,because it is so cold and so remote,and ice-covered for much of the year.,And despite this,,there is no place on Earthnthat I would rather be than the Arctic,,especially as days lengthennand spring comes. 
 To me, the Arctic reallynembodies this disconnect,between what we see on the surfacenand what's going on underwater.,You can look out across the ice --nall white and blue and cold --,and see nothing.,But if you could hear underwater,,the sounds you would hearnwould at first amaze,and then delight you.,And while your eyes are seeingnnothing for kilometers but ice,,your ears are telling you that out therenare bowhead and beluga whales,,walrus and bearded seals.,The ice, too, makes sounds.,It screeches and cracksnand pops and groans,,as it collides and rubs when temperaturenor currents or winds change.,And under 100 percent sea icenin the dead of winter,,bowhead whales are singing. 
 And you would never expect that,,because we humans,,we tend to be very visual animals.,For most of us, but not all,,our sense of sight is hownwe navigate our world.,For marine mammals that live underwater,,where chemical cuesnand light transmit poorly,,sound is the sense by which they see.,And sound transmits very well underwater,,much better than it does in air,,so signals can be heardnover great distances. 
 In the Arctic, thisnis especially important,,because not only do Arctic marinenmammals have to hear each other,,but they also have to listennfor cues in the environment,that might indicatenheavy ice ahead or open water.,Remember, although they spendnmost of their lives underwater,,they are mammals,,and so they have to surface to breathe.,So they might listennfor thin ice or no ice,,or listen for echoes off nearby ice. 
 Arctic marine mammals live in a richnand varied underwater soundscape.,In the spring,,it can be a cacophony of sound. 
 (Marine mammal sounds) 
 But when the ice is frozen solid,,and there are no big temperaturenshifts or current changes,,the underwater Arctic has somenof the lowest ambient noise levels,of the world's oceans.,But this is changing.,This is primarily due to a decreasenin seasonal sea ice,,which is a direct result of humanngreenhouse gas emissions.,We are, in effect, with climate change,,conducting a completely uncontrollednexperiment with our planet. 
 Over the past 30 years,,areas of the Arctic have seenndecreases in seasonal sea ice,from anywhere fromnsix weeks to four months.,This decrease in sea ice is sometimesnreferred to as an increase,in the open water season.,That is the time of year whennthe Arctic is navigable to vessels.,And not only is the extentnof ice changing,,but the age and the width of ice is, too. 
 Now, you may well have heard,that a decrease in seasonal sea icenis causing a loss of habitat,for animals that rely on sea ice,,such as ice seals,nor walrus, or polar bears.,Decreasing sea ice is also causingnincreased erosion along coastal villages,,and changing prey availabilitynfor marine birds and mammals. 
 Climate change and decreases in sea ice,are also altering the underwaternsoundscape of the Arctic.,What do I mean by soundscape?,Those of us who eavesdropnon the oceans for a living,use instruments called hydrophones,,which are underwater microphones,,and we record ambient noise --,the noise all around us.,And the soundscape describesnthe different contributors,to this noise field.,What we are hearing on our hydrophones,are the very real soundsnof climate change.,We are hearing these changesnfrom three fronts:,from the air,,from the water,and from land. 
 First: air.,Wind on water creates waves.,These waves make bubbles;,the bubbles break,,and when they do,,they make noise.,And this noise is like a hissnor a static in the background.,In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,,most of the noise from windndoesn't make it into the water column,,because the ice acts as a buffernbetween the atmosphere and the water.,This is one of the reasons,that the Arctic can havenvery low ambient noise levels.,But with decreases in seasonal sea ice,,not only is the Arctic now opennto this wave noise,,but the number of stormsnand the intensity of storms in the Arctic,has been increasing.,All of this is raising noise levelsnin a previously quiet ocean. 
 Second: water.,With less seasonal sea ice,,subarctic species are moving north,,and taking advantage of the new habitatnthat is created by more open water.,Now, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,,they have no dorsal fin,,because they have evolved to livenand swim in ice-covered waters,,and having something stickingnoff of your back is not very conducive,to migrating through ice,,and may, in fact, be excludingnanimals from the ice.,But now, everywhere we've listened,,we're hearing the soundsnof fin whales and humpback whales,and killer whales,,further and further north,,and later and later in the season.,We are hearing, in essence,,an invasion of the Arcticnby subarctic species.,And we don't know what this means.,Will there be competition for foodnbetween Arctic and subarctic animals?,Might these subarctic species introducendiseases or parasites into the Arctic?,And what are the new soundsnthat they are producing,doing to the soundscape underwater? 
 And third: land.,And by land ...,I mean people.,More open water meansnincreased human use of the Arctic.,Just this past summer,,a massive cruise ship made its waynthrough the Northwest Passage --,the once-mythical routenbetween Europe and the Pacific.,Decreases in sea ice have allowednhumans to occupy the Arctic more often.,It has allowed increases in oilnand gas exploration and extraction,,the potential for commercial shipping,,as well as increased tourism.,And we now know that ship noise increasesnlevels of stress hormones in whales,and can disrupt feeding behavior.,Air guns, which produce loud,nlow-frequency "whoomps",every 10 to 20 seconds,,changed the swimming and vocalnbehavior of whales.,And all of these sound sourcesnare decreasing the acoustic space,over which Arctic marine mammalsncan communicate. 
 Now, Arctic marine mammalsnare used to very high levels of noise,at certain times of the year.,But this is primarily from othernanimals or from sea ice,,and these are the soundsnwith which they've evolved,,and these are sounds that are vitalnto their very survival.,These new soundsnare loud and they're alien.,They might impact the environmentnin ways that we think we understand,,but also in ways that we don't.,Remember, sound is the mostnimportant sense for these animals.,And not only is the physical habitatnof the Arctic changing rapidly,,but the acoustic habitat is, too.,It's as if we've plucked these animals upnfrom the quiet countryside,and dropped them into a big citynin the middle of rush hour.,And they can't escape it. 
 So what can we do now?,We can't decrease wind speeds,or keep subarctic animalsnfrom migrating north,,but we can work on local solutions,to reducing human-caused underwater noise.,One of these solutionsnis to slow down ships,that traverse the Arctic,,because a slower ship is a quieter ship.,We can restrict accessnin seasons and regions,that are important for matingnor feeding or migrating.,We can get smarter about quieting ships,and find better waysnto explore the ocean bottom.,And the good news is,,there are peoplenworking on this right now.,But ultimately,,we humans have to do the hard work,of reversing or at the verynleast decelerating,human-caused atmospheric changes. 
 So, let's return to this ideanof a silent world underwater.,It's entirely possible,that many of the whalesnswimming in the Arctic today,,especially long-lived speciesnlike the bowhead whale,that the Inuits say can liventwo human lives --,it's possible that these whalesnwere alive in 1956,,when Jacques Cousteau made his film.,And in retrospect,,considering all the noisenwe are creating in the oceans today,,perhaps it really was "The Silent World." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It's six o'clock in the morning,,pitch black outside.,My 14-year-old sonnis fast asleep in his bed,,sleeping the reckless,ndeep sleep of a teenager.,I flip on the light and physicallynshake the poor boy awake,,because I know that,nlike ripping off a Band-Aid,,it's better to get it over with quickly. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have a friend who yells "Fire!"njust to rouse her sleeping teen.,And another who got so fed up,that she had to dump cold waternon her son's head,just to get him out of bed.,Sound brutal ...,but perhaps familiar? 
 Every morning I ask myself,,"How can I --,knowing what I know,and doing what I do for a living --,be doing this to my own son?",You see,,I'm a sleep researcher. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I know far too much about sleep,and the consequences of sleep loss.,I know that I'm depriving my sonnof the sleep he desperately needs,as a rapidly growing teenager.,I also know that by waking him up,hours before his naturalnbiological clock tells him he's ready,,I'm literally robbing himnof his dreams --,the type of sleep most associatednwith learning, memory consolidation,and emotional processing. 
 But it's not just my kidnthat's being deprived of sleep.,Sleep deprivation amongnAmerican teenagers is an epidemic.,Only about one in 10 getsnthe eight to 10 hours of sleep per night,recommended by sleep scientistsnand pediatricians.,Now, if you're thinking to yourself,,"Phew, we're doing good,nmy kid's getting eight hours,",remember,,eight hours isnthe minimum recommendation.,You're barely passing.,Eight hours is kind of likengetting a C on your report card. 
 There are many factorsncontributing to this epidemic,,but a major factor preventing teensnfrom getting the sleep they need,is actually a matter of public policy.,Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat.,Across the country,,many schools are startingnaround 7:30am or earlier,,despite the fact that majornmedical organizations recommend,that middle and high schoolnstart no earlier than 8:30am.,These early start policiesnhave a direct effect on how much --,or really how little sleepnAmerican teenagers are getting. 
 They're also pittingnteenagers and their parents,in a fundamentally unwinnable fightnagainst their own bodies.,Around the time of puberty,,teenagers experience a delaynin their biological clock,,which determines when we feel most awakenand when we feel most sleepy.,This is driven in part by a shiftnin the release of the hormone melatonin.,Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasingnmelatonin until around 11pm,,which is two hours later than whatnwe see in adults or younger children.,This means that waking a teenager upnat 6am is the biological equivalent,of waking an adult up at 4am.,On the unfortunate daysnwhen I have to wake up at 4am,,I'm a zombie.,Functionally useless.,I can't think straight,,I'm irritable,,and I probably shouldn't be driving a car.,But this is how many Americannteenagers feel every single school day.,In fact, many of the, shall we say,,unpleasant characteristicsnthat we chalk up to being a teenager --,moodiness, irritability,nlaziness, depression --,could be a productnof chronic sleep deprivation.,For many teensnbattling chronic sleep loss,,their go-to strategy to compensatenis consuming large quantities of caffeine,in the form of venti frappuccinos,,or energy drinks and shots.,So essentially,,we've got an entire populationnof tired but wired youth. 
 Advocates of sleep-friendlynstart times know,that adolescence is a periodnof dramatic brain development,,particularly in the parts of the brain,that are responsible for thosenhigher order thinking processes,,including reasoning, problem-solvingnand good judgment.,In other words, the very typenof brain activity that's responsible,for reining in those impulsivenand often risky behaviors,that are so characteristic of adolescence,and that are so terrifyingnto us parents of teenagers.,They know that like the rest of us,,when teenagers don'tnget the sleep they need,,their brains, their bodiesnand behaviors suffer,with both immediate and lasting effects.,They can't concentrate,,their attention plummets,and many will even shownbehavioral signs that mimic ADHD. 
 But the consequences of teen sleep lossngo well beyond the classroom,,sadly contributing to manynof the mental health problems,that skyrocket during adolescence,,including substance use,,depression and suicide.,In our work with teensnfrom LA Unified School District,,we found that teens with sleep problems,were 55 percent more likelynto have used alcohol in the past month.,In another study with overn30,000 high school students,,they found thatnfor each hour of lost sleep,,there was a 38 percent increasenin feeling sad or hopeless,,and a 58 percent increasenin teen suicide attempts.,And if that's not enough,,teens who skip out on sleepnare at increased risk,for a host of physical health problemsnthat plague our country,,including obesity,nheart disease and diabetes.,Then there's the risknof putting a sleep-deprived teen,,with a newly minted driver's license,,behind the wheel.,Studies have shown that getting five hoursnor less of sleep per night,is the equivalent of driving with a bloodnalcohol content above the legal limit. 
 Advocates of sleep-friendly start times,,and researchers in this area,,have produced tremendous science,showing the tremendous benefitsnof later start times.,The findings are unequivocal,,and as a sleep scientist,,I rarely get to speaknwith that kind of certainty.,Teens from districtsnwith later start times get more sleep.,To the naysayers who may thinknthat if schools start later,,teens will just stay up later,,the truth is,,their bedtimes stay the same,,but their wake-up times get extended,,resulting in more sleep.,They're more likely to show up for school;,school absences droppednby 25 percent in one district.,And they're less likely to drop out.,Not surprisingly,nthey do better academically. 
 So this has real implicationsnfor reducing the achievement gap.,Standardized test scoresnin math and reading,go up by two to three percentage points.,That's as powerful as reducing class sizesnby one-third fewer students,,or replacing a so-so teachernin the classroom,with a truly outstanding one.,Their mental and physical health improves,,and even their families are happier.,I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a littlenmore pleasantness from our teens,,and a little less crankiness?,Even their communities are safer,because car crash rates go down --,a 70 percent reduction in one district. 
 Given these tremendous benefits,,you might think,,well, this is a no-brainer, right?,So why have we as a societynfailed to heed this call?,Often the argument against laternstart times goes something like this:,"Why should we delaynstart times for teenagers?,We need to toughen them upnso they're ready for the real world!",But that's like sayingnto the parent of a two-year-old,,"Don't let Johnny nap,,or he won't be ready for kindergarten." 
 (Laughter) 
 Delaying start times also presentsnmany logistical challenges.,Not just for students and their families,,but for communities as a whole.,Updating bus routes,,increased transportation costs,,impact on sports,,care before or after school.,These are the same concernsnthat come up in district after district,,time and again around the country,as school start times are debated.,And they're legitimate concerns,,but these are problemsnwe have to work through.,They are not valid excuses,for failing to do the right thingnfor our children,,which is to start middle and high schoolsnno earlier than 8:30am.,And in districts around the country,,big and small,nwho have made this change,,they found that these fearsnare often unfounded,and far outweighed by the tremendousnbenefits for student health,and performance,,and our collective public safety. 
 So tomorrow morning,,when coincidentally we getnto set our clocks back by an hour,and you get that deliciousnextra hour of sleep,,and the day seems a little longer,,and a little more full of hope,,think about the tremendous power of sleep.,And think about what a gift it would be,for our children to be ablento wake up naturally,,in harmony with their own biology. 
 Thank you,,and pleasant dreams.Fresh out of college,,I went to work for a consulting firm.,During orientation,nthe leaders dished out advice.,Amongst them was one pithy counselnI will never forget.,He told us, "Be easy to manage.",Considering how naïvenI really was at the time,,I took his advice to heart.,I told myself,,"Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.,I will do everything I'm told.,I will be easy to manage.",It wasn't until I arrivednin graduate school,and witnessed firsthand the criminalnactions of scientists and engineers,in the water crisis in Flint, Michigan,that I realized how dangerousnand yet surprisingly common,this line of thinking really is. 
 Make no mistake:,the Flint water crisis is one of the mostnegregious environmental injustices,of our time.,For over 18 months,,100,000 residents,nincluding thousands of young children,,were exposed to contaminatedndrinking water with high levels of lead.,Lead is a potent neurotoxin,which causes cognitivenand developmental disabilities,and is especially harmfulnto growing fetuses and young children.,We've known about its dangersnsince the Roman Empire.,Amongst a whole host of health issues,,12 people died by contractingnLegionnaires' disease.,Flint's water infrastructure --,the complex networknof underground pipes --,has been severely damaged.,And while the water qualitynis slowly improving,and the pipes are being replaced now,,more than two years later,,the water is still not safe to drink. 
 So, people are still in shock.,They ask themselves,,"How could this have happened?",The short answer is: the crisis begannwhen an emergency manager,,appointed by Michigan's governor,,decided to switch their water sourcento a local river to save money.,But it continued for so long,because scientists and engineersnat government agencies,in the state of Michigannand in the federal government,did not follow federal regulationsnfor treating the water right.,What was more,,they actively cheated on the lawnand orchestrated cover-ups.,They ridiculed residents asking for help,,while publicly insisting that the brown,nsmelly water coming out of the tap,was safe to drink.,The system at the local, statenand federal levels completely failed,to protect our most vulnerable,,and an entire populationnwas left to fend for itself. 
 Now, amidst this injustice,nFlint residents were rallying together.,Amongst them were somenamazing women of Flint --,mothers concerned about their kids --,who came together formingnmany grassroots coalitions,,and these groups started protestingnand demanding change.,The group also reached outnto outside scientists for help,,and a few responded.,Amongst them was a guynnamed Miguel Del Toral,,a water expert at the US EPA --nthe Environmental Protection Agency --,who actually wrote this scientific memo,and sent it to the state of Michigannand the federal government,to bring their attention to this problem.,He was characterized a "rogue employee,",and silenced. 
 In collaboration with Flint residents,,our research team here at Tech,,of students and scientistsnled by professor Marc Edwards,,conducted citywide testing,to prove that Flint's waternwas indeed contaminated,,even toxic in some homes.,We substantiated what Flintnhad been screaming for months,,and put it on the Internetnfor the world to see. 
 Now, when I was getting involved,,when I said yes to this,,I had no idea what I was getting into.,But every second of this journeynhas been totally worth it.,This was sciencenin service to the public.,This is what I camento graduate school for,,and this is how I would rathernspend my life.,And so this coalition --,this unlikely coalition of citizens,npastors, journalists and scientists --,came together to uncover the truthnusing science, advocacy and activism. 
 A local pediatrician figured out,that the instances of childhoodnlead poisoning had indeed doubled,in Flint during the crisis.,And the state of Michigan was forcednto acknowledge the problem,and take steps to correct it.,This group and many othersngot Flint's kids protected. 
 A few months later,,President Obama came innand declared a federal emergency,,and now Flint is gettingnmore than 600 million dollars,in healthcare, nutrition, education,and overhaulingntheir water infrastructure.,However, the arrogance and the callousndisregard for public health,shown by scientists and engineersnat these government agencies,is beyond belief.,These unhealthy culturesnthat are festering in these groups,,where the focus is on meetingnregulations and checking boxes,as opposed to protecting public health,,is just appalling.,Just consider this emailnthat an EPA employee wrote,,where she goes,,"I'm not so sure Flint is a communitynwe want to go out on a limb for.",The dehumanization of an entire populationncould not be more obvious. 
 Now, contrast that to the firstncanon of engineering,,which, in my opinion, should benthe first law of humanity:,"To hold paramount the health,nsafety and welfare of the public,",above all else.,This is the Hippocratic Oathnwe've rarely acknowledged,,let alone embraced.,And so when scientists and engineers,nvery much like medical doctors,,screw up,,people can get hurt --,even die.,If our professionals and evennstudents fail to get that,,society pays a huge price. 
 Buried deep in history liesna character I deeply admire --,an engineer named Peter Palchinsky.,He lived in the time of the Soviet Union.,And Palchinsky repeatedly got in troublenfor his radical honesty,and willingness to point out major flawsnin the Soviets' mindless pursuit,of rapid industrialization.,Everyone was expected to follow ordersncoming from the top.,Anyone asking questionsnor offering feedback was unwelcome.,The Soviets had created the largest armynof engineers the world had ever seen,,and yet most of them were mere cogsnin a gigantic machine heading for doom.,Palchinsky, on the other hand,nimplored engineers,to look at the economic, politicalnand social consequences of their actions;,in other words, be more public-focused.,His fearless voice of reasonnwas seen as a threat,to the political establishment,,and Joseph Stalinnhad him executed in 1929. 
 Palchinsky's view on technocratsnis very different,from one that is still very popular,nstill very common --,that of a dispassionate researchernworking in his ivory tower lab,,or a nerdy engineernworking in his cubicle.,Brilliant, no doubt,,yet somehow cut off from the world,,shows little emotion --,kind of like Spocknfrom "Star Trek," you know?,This guy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's try and do the Spock salute.,I don't think I'll succeed ...,See, I can't be Spock.,Thank goodness I can't be Spock. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was reminded of this distinctionnbecause a recent article came out,in a very reputed scientific journal,,which kind of characterized our Flint worknas driven by "youthful idealism,",and "Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities.",It asks scientists to protectntheir research funding and institutions,at all costs, no matternhow just the cause.,And if you think you have to getninvolved in something,,even if it's an emergency,,try finding an activist group or an NGO,,and obtain the full supportnof the academic community --,whatever that means --,before you get involved.,Not one mention of our moralnand professional obligation,of preventing harm to the public,,or the fact that we havenall this expertise,,resources and, for some, even tenure,to, you know, accomplish this task.,I'm not saying every scientistnshould be an activist.,There are real and sometimes very painfulnconsequences of speaking up.,But to denounce this idea,nthis possibility so completely,so that you can protect research funding,,simply screams of self-serving cowardice,,and these are not the idealsnwe would want to pass to our students. 
 And so you may think,n"OK, all this sounds great,,but you'll never completely changenorganizational cultures,,or imbibe mindsets in studentsnand professionals,to look at their work as a public good --,science in service to the public.",Maybe so.,But could a big reason for that be,that we are not trainingnour students right?,Because if you look closely,,our education system todaynis focused more on creating,what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewiczncalls "excellent sheep" --,young people who are smart and ambitious,,and yet somehow risk-averse,ntimid, directionless,and, sometimes, full of themselves. 
 Now, kids ... you know,,we fell in love with sciencenwhen we were kids,,and yet we somehow spend most of our timenduring high school and college,just jumping through hoops,and doing thingsnso that we can polish our résumé,instead of sitting down,and reflecting on what we want to donand who we want to be.,And so,,the markers of empathynin our college graduates,have been dropping dramaticallynin the past two decades,,while those of narcissism are on the rise. 
 There is also a growing culturenof disengagement,between engineering studentsnand the public.,We are trained to build bridgesnand solve complex problems,but not how to think or livenor be a citizen of this world.,My undergraduate yearsnwere explicit job preparation,,and I cannot tell you how suffocatingnand painful it was at times.,And so,,some people think the solutionnto great engineers, to great scientists,,is more technical training.,Maybe so.,But where are the discussionsnon ethical decision-making,,or building character,,or discerning right from wrong? 
 Consider this projectnthat I deeply love and admire.,It's called, "Heroic Imagination Project.",A brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo,,famous for the Stanford Prison Experiment,,this program seeks to trainnschool-going children around the world,to look at themselvesnas heroes-in-waiting,,or heroes-in-training.,So, these young minds work over timento develop skills and virtues,so that when the opportunity comes,,no matter what that opportunity be,,to stand up and do the right thing.,In other words,,anyone can be a hero. 
 Think about that idea for a second.,Why don't we teach sciencenand engineering like that --,where heroism and public servicenare seen as key values,,because indeed, it's often heroism,that is not only the antidotento public indifference,,but also to systemic evilnlike we saw in Flint. 
 And so, dream with me,what a 21st-century scientistnslash engineer could look like:,individuals who are drivennto master the sciences,so that they can serve society,,and are also aware,of the tremendous powerntheir knowledge and decisions have;,folks who are developingntheir moral courage at all times,,and who realize that conflictnand controversy,are not necessarily bad things,if our ultimate loyaltynis to the public and the planet. 
 These are the people who willnstand up like we did in Flint --,not to be saviors or heroes in the media,,but altruistic and fundamentally goodnactors that you and I can trust.,Imagine fosteringnsuch a public-focused mindset,in classes, on service tripsnand during activities,during college or even high school,,so that these young mindsnwill hold onto those ideals,when they actually enter the real world,,whether that be consulting,nacademia, policy making --,or even becomingnthe president of a country. 
 Some of mankind's greatestnchallenges lie ahead of us;,contaminated drinking waternis just one example.,We could definitely use more --,nay, we desperately need more --ncompassionate upstanders,and public-focusednscientists and engineers,who will strive to the do right thing,,and not be easy to manage. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How many companiesnhave you interacted with today? 
 Well, you got up in the morning,,took a shower,,washed your hair,,used a hair dryer,,ate breakfast --,ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever --,had coffee --,tea.,You took public transport to come here,,or maybe used your private car.,You interacted with the companynthat you work for or that you own.,You interacted with your clients,,your customers,,and so on and so forth.,I'm pretty sure there arenat least seven companies,you've interacted with today. 
 Let me tell you a stunning statistic.,One out of sevennlarge, public corporations,commit fraud every year.,This is a US academic studynthat looks at US companies --,I have no reason to believenthat it's different in Europe.,This is a study that looksnat both detected and undetected fraud,using statistical methods.,This is not petty fraud.,These frauds costnthe shareholders of these companies,,and therefore society,,on the order ofn380 billion dollars per year. 
 We can all think of some examples, right?,The car industry's secretsnaren't quite so secret anymore.,Fraud has become a feature,,not a bug,,of the financial services industry.,That's not me who's claiming that,,that's the presidentnof the American Finance Association,who stated thatnin his presidential address.,That's a huge problemnif you think about, especially,,an economy like Switzerland,,which relies so much on the trustnput into its financial industry. 
 On the other hand,,there are six out of seven companiesnwho actually remain honest,despite all temptationsnto start engaging in fraud.,There are whistle-blowersnlike Michael Woodford,,who blew the whistle on Olympus.,These whistle-blowers risk their careers,,their friendships,,to bring out the truthnabout their companies.,There are journalistsnlike Anna Politkovskaya,who risk even their livesnto report human rights violations.,She got killed --,every year,,around 100 journalists get killed,because of their convictionnto bring out the truth. 
 So in my talk today,,I want to share with younsome insights I've obtained and learned,in the last 10 yearsnof conducting research in this.,I'm a researcher,na scientist working with economists,,financial economists,,ethicists, neuroscientists,,lawyers and others,trying to understandnwhat makes humans tick,,and how can we address this issuenof fraud in corporations,and therefore contributento the improvement of the world. 
 I want to start by sharing with yountwo very distinct visions,of how people behave.,First, meet Adam Smith,,founding father of modern economics.,His basic idea was that if everybodynbehaves in their own self-interests,,that's good for everybody in the end.,Self-interest isn'tna narrowly defined concept,just for your immediate utility.,It has a long-run implication.,Let's think about that.,Think about this dog here.,That might be us.,There's this temptation --,I apologize to all vegetarians, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Dogs do like the bratwurst. 
 (Laughter),Now, the straight-up,nself-interested move here,is to go for that.,So my friend Adam here might jump up,,get the sausage and thereby ruinnall this beautiful tableware.,But that's not what Adam Smith meant.,He didn't meanndisregard all consequences --,to the contrary.,He would have thought,,well, there may be negative consequences,,for example,,the owner might be angry with the dog,and the dog, anticipating that,nmight not behave in this way.,That might be us,,weighing the benefitsnand costs of our actions. 
 How does that play out?,Well, many of you, I'm sure,,have in your companies,,especially if it's a large company,,a code of conduct.,And then if you behavenaccording to that code of conduct,,that improves your chancesnof getting a bonus payment.,And on the other hand,nif you disregard it,,then there are higher chancesnof not getting your bonus,or its being diminished.,In other words,,this is a very economic motivation,of trying to get people to be more honest,,or more aligned withnthe corporation's principles. 
 Similarly, reputation is a verynpowerful economic force, right?,We try to build a reputation,,maybe for being honest,,because then peoplentrust us more in the future.,Right?,Adam Smith talked about the baker,who's not producing good breadnout of his benevolence,for those people who consume the bread,,but because he wants to sellnmore future bread.,In my research, we find, for example,,at the University of Zurich,,that Swiss banksnwho get caught up in media,,and in the context, for example,,of tax evasion, of tax fraud,,have bad media coverage.,They lose net new money in the future,and therefore make lower profits.,That's a very powerful reputational force.,Benefits and costs. 
 Here's another viewpoint of the world.,Meet Immanuel Kant,,18th-century German philosopher superstar.,He developed this notion,that independent of the consequences,,some actions are just right,and some are just wrong.,It's just wrong to lie, for example.,So, meet my friend Immanuel here.,He knows that the sausage is very tasty,,but he's going to turn awaynbecause he's a good dog.,He knows it's wrong to jump up,and risk ruiningnall this beautiful tableware.,If you believe that peoplenare motivated like that,,then all the stuff about incentives,,all the stuff about code of conductnand bonus systems and so on,,doesn't make a whole lot of sense.,People are motivatednby different values perhaps. 
 So, what are people actually motivated by?,These two gentlemen herenhave perfect hairdos,,but they give usnvery different views of the world.,What do we do with this?,Well, I'm an economist,and we conduct so-called experimentsnto address this issue.,We strip away factsnwhich are confusing in reality.,Reality is so rich,nthere is so much going on,,it's almost impossible to knownwhat drives people's behavior really. 
 So let's do a little experiment together.,Imagine the following situation.,You're in a room alone,,not like here.,There's a five-franc coinnlike the one I'm holding up right now,in front of you.,Here are your instructions:,toss the coin four times,,and then on a computernterminal in front of you,,enter the number of times tails came up.,This is the situation.,Here's the rub.,For every time that you announcenthat you had a tails throw,,you get paid five francs.,So if you say I had two tails throws,,you get paid 10 francs.,If you say you had zero,nyou get paid zero francs.,If you say, "I had four tails throws,",then you get paid 20 francs.,It's anonymous,,nobody's watching what you're doing,,and you get paid that money anonymously. 
 I've got two questions for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know what's coming now, right?,First, how would you behavenin that situation?,The second, look to your leftnand look to your right -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and think about hownthe person sitting next to you,might behave in that situation. 
 We did this experiment for real.,We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition,that took place here in Zurich recently,,not with students in the labnat the university,but with the real population,,like you guys.,First, a quick reminder of stats.,If I throw the coin four timesnand it's a fair coin,,then the probabilitynthat it comes up four times tails,is 6.25 percent.,And I hope you can intuitively see,that the probability that all fournof them are tails is much lower,than if two of them are tails, right? 
 Here are the specific numbers.,Here's what happened.,People did this experiment for real.,Around 30 to 35 percent of people said,,"Well, I had four tails throws.",That's extremely unlikely. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the really amazing thing here,,perhaps to an economist,,is there are around 65 percent of peoplenwho did not say I had four tails throws,,even though in that situation,,nobody's watching you,,the only consequence that's in place,is you get more moneynif you say four than less.,You leave 20 francs on the tablenby announcing zero.,I don't know whethernthe other people all were honest,or whether they also said a little bitnhigher or lower than what they did,because it's anonymous.,We only observed the distribution.,But what I can tell you --nand here's another coin toss.,There you go, it's tails. 
 (Laughter) 
 Don't check, OK? 
 (Laughter) 
 What I can tell you,is that not everybody behavednlike Adam Smith would have predicted. 
 So what does that leave us with?,Well, it seems people are motivatednby certain intrinsic values,and in our research, we look at this.,We look at the idea that people havenso-called protected values.,A protected value isn't just any value.,A protected value is a valuenwhere you're willing to pay a price,to uphold that value.,You're willing to pay a pricento withstand the temptation to give in.,And the consequence is you feel better,if you earn money in a waynthat's consistent with your values. 
 Let me show you this againnin the metaphor of our beloved dog here.,If we succeed in getting the sausagenwithout violating our values,,then the sausage tastes better.,That's what our research shows.,If, on the other hand,,we do so --,if we get the sausage,and in doing sonwe actually violate values,,we value the sausage less.,Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.,We can measure these protected values,,for example,,by a survey measure.,Simple, nine-item survey that's quitenpredictive in these experiments.,If you think about the averagenof the population,and then there'sna distribution around it --,people are different,nwe all are different.,People who have a set of protected values,that's one standard deviationnabove the average,,they discount money they receivenby lying by about 25 percent.,That means a dollar received when lying,is worth to them only 75 cents,without any incentives you put in placenfor them to behave honestly.,It's their intrinsic motivation. 
 By the way, I'm not a moral authority.,I'm not saying I havenall these beautiful values, right?,But I'm interested in how people behave,and how we can leveragenthat richness in human nature,to actually improventhe workings of our organizations. 
 So there are twonvery, very different visions here.,On the one hand,,you can appeal to benefits and costs,and try to get peoplento behave according to them.,On the other hand,,you can select people who have the values,and the desirablencharacteristics, of course --,competencies that gonin line with your organization. 
 I do not yet know wherenthese protected values really come from.,Is it nurture or is it nature?,What I can tell you,is that the distributionnlooks pretty similar for men and women.,It looks pretty similarnfor those who had studied economics,or those who had studied psychology.,It looks even pretty similarnaround different age categories,among adults.,But I don't know yetnhow this develops over a lifetime.,That will be the subjectnof future research. 
 The idea I want to leave you with,is it's all right to appeal to incentives.,I'm an economist;,I certainly believe in the factnthat incentives work.,But do think about selectingnthe right people,rather than having peoplenand then putting incentives in place.,Selecting the right peoplenwith the right values,may go a long waynto saving a lot of trouble,and a lot of money,in your organizations.,In other words,,it will pay off to put people first. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A long time ago,,I was a professional animator. 
 (Music) 
 [Eric Dyer] 
 [Animator] 
 [Compositor] 
 And at night,,I would make my own experimental films. 
 (Music) 
 And I was spending a lot of time,nway too much time, in front of a screen,for work that would benpresented on a screen,,and I had this great neednto get my hands back on the work again. 
 Now, before "The Simpsons,",before "Gumby,",before "Betty Boop,",before there was such a thingnas cinema and television,,animation was hugely popular in this form.,This is a zoetrope.,And you spin this drum,,and you look through the slitsninto the inside of the drum,,and you see the animation pop to life.,This is animation in physical form,,and it's animation I couldnget my hands on again. 
 I took these ideas to Denmark.,I went there with my familynon a Fulbright Fellowship.,That's my daughter, Mia.,I rode around the city on my bicycle,and shot all the interestingnmoving elements of Copenhagen:,the boaters in the canals,,the colors that explode in spring,,the free-use city bikes,,love,,textures,,the healthy cuisine -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And I brought all that videonback into the physical world,by printing it out on these longnstrips of ink-jet paper,and cutting out the forms. 
 Now, I invented my ownnform of the zoetrope,,which removes the drum,and replaces the slitsnwith a video camera.,And this was very exciting for me,,because it meant that I couldnmake these physical objects,,and I could make films from those objects.,That's me riding on my bicycle. 
 (Laughter) 
 I made about 25 paper sculptures,,each the size of a bicycle wheel.,I brought them into the studio,,spun them,and shot them to make the filmn"Copenhagen Cycles." 
 (Music) 
 This project not only allowed mento get my hands back on the work again,but it helped me get my life back.,Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a daynwith my face plastered to a screen,,I was having these little adventuresnwith our new family,and shooting video along the way,,and it was kind of a symbiosisnof art and life.,And I think that it's no mistake,that zoetrope translatesninto "wheel of life." 
 (Music) 
 But film and video does flatten sculpture,,so I tried to imagine,a way that animated sculpturencould be experienced as such,,and also a completely immersivenkind of animated sculpture.,And that's where I came up with the ideanfor the zoetrope tunnel.,You walk through with a handheld strobe,,and wherever you point the flashlight,,the animation pops to life.,I plan to finish this projectnin the next 30 to 40 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I did build a half-scale prototype.,It's covered in Velcro,,and I could lay inside on this bridge,and stick animated sequences to the walls,and test stuff out.,People would commentnthat it reminded them of an MRI.,And that medical connection spoke to me,,because at the age of 14,,I was diagnosed withna degenerative retinal condition,that's slowly taking my vision away,,and I'd never respondednto that in my work.,So I responded to itnin this piece called, "Implant.",It is an imaginary,nsuper-magnified medical device,that fits around the optic nerve.,And the public is, in a sense,nminiaturized to experience it.,With a handheld strobe,,they can explore the sculpture,,and discover thousandsnof cell-sized robots,hard at work, leapingnin and out of the optic nerve,,being deployed to the retina,to repair it.,It's my science fiction fantasy curenof my own incurable disorder. 
 (Machine buzzes) 
 Now, in the real-world gene therapynand gene therapy research,,healthy genes are being administerednto unhealthy cells using viruses.,There's a lot of colorful,nfluffy hope in this,,and there's also some creepy,nthreatening idea,of viruses maybe becomingnan invasive species in your body. 
 Vision loss has helpednto take me away from the things,that disconnect me from the world.,Instead of being sealed offnin an automobile,,I ride my bike,,take buses and trains,and walk a lot.,And instead of a visually intensivenprocess in the studio, primarily,,I'm also getting outdoors a lot more,and using more of my senses. 
 This landscape is a couple hours eastnof San Diego, California.,My brother lives out that way.,He and I went camping there for four days.,And I grabbed my camera,,and I walked through the canyons.,And I tried to imagine and figure out,what kind of motion would be present,in this place that was so stillnand so devoid of motion.,I think it's the stillestnplace I've ever been.,And I realized that it was the movementnof my own body through the landscape,that was creating the animation.,It was the motion of changing perspective. 
 So I created this piece called "Mud Caves"nfrom those photographs.,It's a multilayered print piece,,and you can think of it asna zoetrope laid flat.,It's kind of my westernnlandscape panorama.,And next to the print piecenthere's a video monitor,that shows the animationnhidden within the artwork.,I think one of the best partsnabout this project for me,was that I got to hang outnwith my brother a lot,,who lives 2,500 miles away from me.,And we would just sitnin this seemingly eternal landscape,sculpted by water over millions of years,and talk.,We'd talk about our kids growing up,and the slowing pace of our parents,,and our dad who's suffering from leukemia,nmemory loss and infection.,And it struck me that, as individuals,,we're finite,,but as a family,,we are an ongoing cycle --,a kind of wheel of life. 
 Now, I want to leave you with a tributento one of my mentors.,She reminds me that physicalnpresence is important,and that play is not a luxury,,but a necessity.,She's Pixie,,and she's our family dog.,And she loves to jump. 
 (Dog barking) 
 (Dog barking and spring boinging) 
 And this is a new kind of zoetrope,that I developednat the Imaging Research Center,at UMBC in Baltimore.,And I call it a "real-time zoetrope." 
 (Dog barking) 
 (Dog barking and spring boinging) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want you to looknaround the room for a minute,and try to find the mostnparanoid person here -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I want you to pointnat that person for me. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, don't actually do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But, as an organizational psychologist,,I spend a lot of time in workplaces,,and I find paranoia everywhere.,Paranoia is caused by peoplenthat I call "takers.",Takers are self-servingnin their interactions.,It's all about what can you do for me.,The opposite is a giver.,It's somebody who approachesnmost interactions by asking,,"What can I do for you?" 
 I wanted to give you a chancento think about your own style.,We all have moments of giving and taking.,Your style is how you treatnmost of the people most of the time,,your default.,I have a short test you can take,to figure out if you're morenof a giver or a taker,,and you can take it right now. 
 [The Narcissist Test] 
 [Step 1: Take a momentnto think about yourself.] 
 (Laughter) 
 [Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,nyou are not a narcissist.] 
 (Laughter) 
 This is the only thing I will say todaynthat has no data behind it,,but I am convinced the longer it takesnfor you to laugh at this cartoon,,the more worried we should benthat you're a taker. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, not all takers are narcissists.,Some are just givers who got burnednone too many times.,Then there's another kind of takernthat we won't be addressing today,,and that's called a psychopath. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was curious, though, about howncommon these extremes are,,and so I surveyed over 30,000npeople across industries,around the world's cultures.,And I found that most peoplenare right in the middle,between giving and taking.,They choose this third stylencalled "matching.",If you're a matcher, you try to keepnan even balance of give and take:,quid pro quo -- I'll do somethingnfor you if you do something for me.,And that seems like a safe waynto live your life.,But is it the most effectivenand productive way to live your life?,The answer to that questionnis a very definitive ...,maybe. 
 (Laughter) 
 I studied dozens of organizations,,thousands of people.,I had engineers measuringntheir productivity. 
 (Laughter) 
 I looked at medical students' grades --,even salespeople's revenue. 
 (Laughter) 
 And, unexpectedly,,the worst performers in eachnof these jobs were the givers.,The engineers who got the least work done,were the ones who did more favorsnthan they got back.,They were so busy doingnother people's jobs,,they literally ran out of time and energynto get their own work completed.,In medical school, the lowest gradesnbelong to the students,who agree most stronglynwith statements like,,"I love helping others,",which suggests the doctornyou ought to trust,is the one who came to med schoolnwith no desire to help anybody. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then in sales, too,nthe lowest revenue accrued,in the most generous salespeople.,I actually reached outnto one of those salespeople,who had a very high giver score.,And I asked him, "Why donyou suck at your job --",I didn't ask it that way, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 "What's the cost of generosity in sales?",And he said, "Well, I just carenso deeply about my customers,that I would never sell themnone of our crappy products." 
 (Laughter) 
 So just out of curiosity,,how many of you self-identify morenas givers than takers or matchers?,Raise your hands.,OK, it would have been morenbefore we talked about these data. 
 But actually, it turns outnthere's a twist here,,because givers are oftennsacrificing themselves,,but they make their organizations better.,We have a huge body of evidence --,many, many studies lookingnat the frequency of giving behavior,that exists in a teamnor an organization --,and the more often people are helpingnand sharing their knowledge,and providing mentoring,,the better organizations donon every metric we can measure:,higher profits, customer satisfaction,nemployee retention --,even lower operating expenses.,So givers spend a lot of timentrying to help other people,and improve the team,,and then, unfortunately,nthey suffer along the way.,I want to talk about what it takes,to build cultures where giversnactually get to succeed. 
 So I wondered, then, if giversnare the worst performers,,who are the best performers?,Let me start with the good news:nit's not the takers.,Takers tend to rise quicklynbut also fall quickly in most jobs.,And they fall at the hands of matchers.,If you're a matcher, you believenin "An eye for an eye" -- a just world.,And so when you meet a taker,,you feel like it's your mission in life,to just punish the hellnout of that person. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that way justice gets served. 
 Well, most people are matchers.,And that means if you're a taker,,it tends to catch up with you eventually;,what goes around will come around.,And so the logical conclusion is:,it must be the matchersnwho are the best performers.,But they're not.,In every job, in every organizationnI've ever studied,,the best results belongnto the givers again. 
 Take a look at some data I gatherednfrom hundreds of salespeople,,tracking their revenue.,What you can see is that the giversngo to both extremes.,They make up the majority of peoplenwho bring in the lowest revenue,,but also the highest revenue.,The same patterns were truenfor engineers' productivity,and medical students' grades.,Givers are overrepresentednat the bottom and at the top,of every success metric that I can track.,Which raises the question:,How do we create a worldnwhere more of these givers get to excel?,I want to talk about how to do that,nnot just in businesses,,but also in nonprofits, schools --,even governments.,Are you ready? 
 (Cheers) 
 I was going to do it anyway,nbut I appreciate the enthusiasm. 
 (Laughter) 
 The first thing that's really critical,is to recognize that giversnare your most valuable people,,but if they're not careful, they burn out.,So you have to protectnthe givers in your midst.,And I learned a great lesson about thisnfrom Fortune's best networker.,It's the guy, not the cat. 
 (Laughter) 
 His name is Adam Rifkin.,He's a very successful serial entrepreneur,who spends a huge amountnof his time helping other people.,And his secret weaponnis the five-minute favor.,Adam said, "You don't have to benMother Teresa or Gandhi,to be a giver.,You just have to find small waysnto add large value,to other people's lives.",That could be as simplenas making an introduction,between two people who couldnbenefit from knowing each other.,It could be sharing your knowledgenor giving a little bit of feedback.,Or It might be even somethingnas basic as saying,,"You know,,I'm going to try and figure out,if I can recognize somebodynwhose work has gone unnoticed.",And those five-minute favorsnare really critical,to helping givers set boundariesnand protect themselves. 
 The second thing that matters,if you want to build a culturenwhere givers succeed,,is you actually need a culturenwhere help-seeking is the norm;,where people ask a lot.,This may hit a little too closento home for some of you. 
 [So in all your relationships,nyou always have to be the giver?] 
 (Laughter) 
 What you see with successful givers,is they recognize that it's OKnto be a receiver, too.,If you run an organization,nwe can actually make this easier.,We can make it easiernfor people to ask for help.,A couple colleagues and Instudied hospitals.,We found that on certain floors,nnurses did a lot of help-seeking,,and on other floors,nthey did very little of it.,The factor that stood out on the floorsnwhere help-seeking was common,,where it was the norm,,was there was just one nursenwhose sole job it was,to help other nurses on the unit.,When that role was available,,nurses said, "It's not embarrassing,nit's not vulnerable to ask for help --,it's actually encouraged." 
 Help-seeking isn't importantnjust for protecting the success,and the well-being of givers.,It's also critical to gettingnmore people to act like givers,,because the data say,that somewhere between 75 and 90 percentnof all giving in organizations,starts with a request.,But a lot of people don't ask.,They don't want to look incompetent,,they don't know where to turn,nthey don't want to burden others.,Yet if nobody ever asks for help,,you have a lot of frustrated giversnin your organization,who would love to step up and contribute,,if they only knewnwho could benefit and how. 
 But I think the most important thing,,if you want to build a culturenof successful givers,,is to be thoughtful about whonyou let onto your team.,I figured, you want a culturenof productive generosity,,you should hire a bunch of givers.,But I was surprised to discover, actually,nthat that was not right --,that the negative impactnof a taker on a culture,is usually double to triplenthe positive impact of a giver.,Think about it this way:,one bad apple can spoil a barrel,,but one good eggnjust does not make a dozen.,I don't know what that means -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But I hope you do. 
 No -- let even one taker into a team,,and you will see that the giversnwill stop helping.,They'll say, "I'm surroundednby a bunch of snakes and sharks.,Why should I contribute?",Whereas if you let one giver into a team,,you don't get an explosion of generosity.,More often, people are like,,"Great! That person can do all our work.",So, effective hiring and screeningnand team building,is not about bringing in the givers;,it's about weeding out the takers.,If you can do that well,,you'll be left with givers and matchers.,The givers will be generous,because they don't have to worrynabout the consequences.,And the beauty of the matchersnis that they follow the norm. 
 So how do you catch a takernbefore it's too late?,We're actually pretty badnat figuring out who's a taker,,especially on first impressions.,There's a personality traitnthat throws us off.,It's called agreeableness,,one the major dimensionsnof personality across cultures.,Agreeable people are warm and friendly,nthey're nice, they're polite.,You find a lot of them in Canada -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Where there was actuallyna national contest,to come up with a new Canadian slogannand fill in the blank,,"As Canadian as ...",I thought the winning entrynwas going to be,,"As Canadian as maple syrup,"nor, "... ice hockey.",But no, Canadians votednfor their new national slogan to be --,I kid you not --,"As Canadian as possiblenunder the circumstances." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now for those of younwho are highly agreeable,,or maybe slightly Canadian,,you get this right away.,How could I ever say I'm any one thing,when I'm constantly adaptingnto try to please other people?,Disagreeable people do less of it.,They're more critical,nskeptical, challenging,,and far more likely than their peersnto go to law school. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's not a joke,nthat's actually an empirical fact. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I always assumednthat agreeable people were givers,and disagreeable people were takers.,But then I gathered the data,,and I was stunned to findnno correlation between those traits,,because it turns outnthat agreeableness-disagreeableness,is your outer veneer:,How pleasant is it to interact with you?,Whereas giving and takingnare more of your inner motives:,What are your values?nWhat are your intentions toward others? 
 If you really want to judgenpeople accurately,,you have to get to the moment everynconsultant in the room is waiting for,,and draw a two-by-two. 
 (Laughter) 
 The agreeable givers are easy to spot:,they say yes to everything.,The disagreeable takersnare also recognized quickly,,although you might call themnby a slightly different name. 
 (Laughter) 
 We forget about the otherntwo combinations.,There are disagreeable giversnin our organizations.,There are people who are gruffnand tough on the surface,but underneath havenothers' best interests at heart.,Or as an engineer put it,,"Oh, disagreeable givers --,like somebody with a bad user interfacenbut a great operating system." 
 (Laughter) 
 If that helps you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Disagreeable givers are the mostnundervalued people in our organizations,,because they're the onesnwho give the critical feedback,that no one wants to hearnbut everyone needs to hear.,We need to do a much better jobnvaluing these people,as opposed to writing them off early,,and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly,,must be a selfish taker." 
 The other combination we forget aboutnis the deadly one --,the agreeable taker,nalso known as the faker.,This is the personnwho's nice to your face,,and then will stab you right in the back. 
 (Laughter) 
 And my favorite way to catchnthese people in the interview process,is to ask the question,,"Can you give me the names of four people,whose careers you havenfundamentally improved?",The takers will give you four names,,and they will all be moreninfluential than them,,because takers are great at kissing upnand then kicking down.,Givers are more likely to name peoplenwho are below them in a hierarchy,,who don't have as much power,,who can do them no good.,And let's face it, you all knownyou can learn a lot about character,by watching how someonentreats their restaurant server,or their Uber driver. 
 So if we do all this well,,if we can weed takersnout of organizations,,if we can make it safe to ask for help,,if we can protect givers from burnout,and make it OK for them to be ambitiousnin pursuing their own goals,as well as trying to help other people,,we can actually change the waynthat people define success.,Instead of saying it's all aboutnwinning a competition,,people will realize successnis really more about contribution. 
 I believe that the mostnmeaningful way to succeed,is to help other people succeed.,And if we can spread that belief,,we can actually turn paranoia upside down.,There's a name for that.,It's called "pronoia.",Pronoia is the delusional belief,that other peoplenare plotting your well-being. 
 (Laughter) 
 That they're going around behind your back,and saying exceptionallynglowing things about you.,The great thing about a culture of giversnis that's not a delusion --,it's reality.,I want to live in a worldnwhere givers succeed,,and I hope you will help mencreate that world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Cybercrime is out of control.,It's everywhere.,We hear about it every single day.,This year,,over two billion records lost or stolen.,And last year, 100 million of us,nmostly Americans,,lost our health insurance datanto thieves -- myself included.,What's particularly concerning about thisnis that in most cases,,it was months before anyone evennreported that these records were stolen. 
 So if you watch the evening news,,you would think that most of thisnis espionage or nation-state activity.,And, well, some of it is.,Espionage, you see, is an acceptedninternational practice.,But in this case,,it is only a small portionnof the problem that we're dealing with.,How often do we hear about a breach,followed by, "... it was the resultnof a sophisticated nation-state attack?",Well, often that is companiesnnot being willing to own up,to their own lacklusternsecurity practices.,There is also a widely held belief,that by blaming an attacknon a nation-state,,you are putting regulators at bay --,at least for a period of time. 
 So where is all of this coming from?,The United Nations estimatesnthat 80 percent of it,is from highly organizednand ultrasophisticated criminal gangs.,To date,,this represents one of the largestnillegal economies in the world,,topping out at, now get this,,445 billion dollars.,Let me put that in perspectivenfor all of you:,445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP,of 160 nations,,including Ireland, Finland,nDenmark and Portugal,,to name a few. 
 So how does this work?,How do these criminals operate?,Well, let me tell you a little story.,About a year ago,,our security researchers were tracking,a somewhat ordinary but sophisticatednbanking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.,The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer,via you clicking on a linknin a phishing email,that you probably shouldn't have.,It would then sit and wait.,It would wait until you loggedninto your bank account.,And when you did,nthe bad guys would reach in,,steal your credentials,,and then use that to steal your money.,This sounds terrible,,but the reality is,nin the security industry,,this form of attacknis somewhat commonplace.,However, the Dyre Wolf hadntwo distinctly different personalities --,one for these small transactions,,but it took on an entirelyndifferent persona,if you were in the business of movingnlarge-scale wire transfers. 
 Here's what would happen.,You start the processnof issuing a wire transfer,,and up in your browser would popna screen from your bank,,indicating that there's a problemnwith your account,,and that you need to callnthe bank immediately,,along with the numbernto the bank's fraud department.,So you pick up the phone and you call.,And after going throughnthe normal voice prompts,,you're met withnan English-speaking operator.,"Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank.nHow can I help you?",And you go through the processnlike you do every time you call your bank,,of giving them your namenand your account number,,going through the security checksnto verify you are who you said you are.,Most of us may not know this,,but in many large-scale wire transfers,,it requires two people to sign offnon the wire transfer,,so the operator then asks younto get the second person on the line,,and goes through the same setnof verifications and checks. 
 Sounds normal, right?,Only one problem:,you're not talking to the bank.,You're talking to the criminals.,They had builtnan English-speaking help desk,,fake overlays to the banking website.,And this was so flawlessly executed,that they were movingnbetween a half a million,and a million and a halfndollars per attempt,into their criminal coffers. 
 These criminal organizations operate,like highly regimented,nlegitimate businesses.,Their employees worknMonday through Friday.,They take the weekends off.,How do we know this?,We know this becausenour security researchers see,repeated spikes of malwarenon a Friday afternoon.,The bad guys, after a long weekendnwith the wife and kids,,come back in to see how well things went. 
 The Dark Web is wherenthey spend their time.,That is a term used to describenthe anonymous underbelly of the internet,,where thieves can operate with anonymity,and without detection.,Here they peddle their attack software,and share informationnon new attack techniques.,You can buy everything there,,from a base-level attacknto a much more advanced version.,In fact, in many cases, you even see,gold, silver and bronze levels of service.,You can check references.,You can even buy attacks,that come with a money-back guarantee -- 
 (Laughter) 
 if you're not successful.,Now, these environments,nthese marketplaces --,they look like an Amazon or an eBay.,You see products, prices,nratings and reviews.,Of course, if you're goingnto buy an attack,,you're going to buy from a reputablencriminal with good ratings, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 This isn't any different,than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisornbefore going to a new restaurant.,So, here is an example.,This is an actual screenshotnof a vendor selling malware.,Notice they're a vendor level four,,they have a trust level of six.,They've had 400 positive reviewsnin the last year,,and only two negative reviewsnin the last month.,We even see things like licensing terms.,Here's an example of a site you can go to,if you want to change your identity.,They will sell you a fake ID,,fake passports.,But note the legally binding termsnfor purchasing your fake ID.,Give me a break.,What are they going to do --nsue you if you violate them? 
 (Laughter) 
 This occurred a couple of months ago.,One of our securitynresearchers was looking,at a new Android malware applicationnthat we had discovered.,It was called Bilal Bot.,In a blog post,,she positioned Bilal Botnas a new, inexpensive and beta alternative,to the much more advanced GM Bot,that was commonplacenin the criminal underground. 
 This review did not sit wellnwith the authors of Bilal Bot.,So they wrote her this very email,,pleading their casenand making the argument,that they felt she had evaluatednan older version.,They asked her to please updatenher blog with more accurate information,and even offered to do an interview,to describe to her in detail,how their attack software was nownfar better than the competition. 
 So look,,you don't have to like what they do,,but you do have to respectnthe entrepreneurial nature,of their endeavors. 
 (Laughter) 
 So how are we going to stop this?,It's not like we're going to be ablento identify who's responsible --,remember, they operate with anonymity,and outside the reach of the law.,We're certainly not going to be ablento prosecute the offenders.,I would propose that we needna completely new approach.,And that approach needsnto be centered on the idea,that we need to changenthe economics for the bad guys. 
 And to give you a perspectivenon how this can work,,let's think of the response we seento a healthcare pandemic:,SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.,What is the top priority?,It's knowing who is infectednand how the disease is spreading.,Now, governments, private institutions,nhospitals, physicians --,everyone responds openly and quickly.,This is a collective and altruistic effort,to stop the spread in its tracks,and to inform anyone not infected,how to protect or inoculate themselves. 
 Unfortunately, this is not at allnwhat we see in response to a cyber attack.,Organizations are far more likelynto keep information on that attack,to themselves.,Why?,Because they're worriednabout competitive advantage,,litigation,or regulation.,We need to effectively democratizenthreat intelligence data.,We need to get all of these organizationsnto open up and share,what is in their private arsenalnof information.,The bad guys are moving fast;,we've got to move faster.,And the best way to do that is to open up,and share data on what's happening. 
 Let's think about this in the constructnof security professionals.,Remember, they're programmed rightninto their DNA to keep secrets.,We've got to turnnthat thinking on its head.,We've got to get governments,nprivate institutions,and security companies,willing to share information at speed.,And here's why:,because if you share the information,,it's equivalent to inoculation.,And if you're not sharing,,you're actually part of the problem,,because you're increasing the oddsnthat other people could be impacted,by the same attack techniques. 
 But there's an even bigger benefit.,By destroying criminals' devicesncloser to real time,,we break their plans.,We inform the people they aim to hurt,far sooner than they had ever anticipated.,We ruin their reputations,,we crush their ratings and reviews.,We make cybercrime not pay.,We change the economics for the bad guys.,But to do this,na first mover was required --,someone to change the thinkingnin the security industry overall. 
 About a year ago,,my colleagues and I had a radical idea.,What if IBM were to take our data --,we had one of the largest threatnintelligence databases in the world --,and open it up?,It had information not justnon what had happened in the past,,but what was happening in near-real time.,What if we were to publish it allnopenly on the internet?,As you can imagine,nthis got quite a reaction.,First came the lawyers:,What are the legalnimplications of doing that?,Then came the business:,What are the businessnimplications of doing that?,And this was also met with a good dose,of a lot of people just askingnif we were completely crazy. 
 But there was one conversationnthat kept floating to the surface,in every dialogue that we would have:,the realization that if we didn't do this,,then we were part of the problem.,So we did something unheard ofnin the security industry.,We started publishing.,Over 700 terabytes of actionablenthreat intelligence data,,including information on real-time attacks,that can be used to stopncybercrime in its tracks.,And to date,,over 4,000 organizationsnare leveraging this data,,including half of the Fortune 100.,And our hope as a next stepnis to get all of those organizations,to join us in the fight,,and do the same thing,and share their information,on when and hownthey're being attacked as well. 
 We all have the opportunity to stop it,,and we already all know how.,All we have to do is looknto the response that we see,in the world of health care,,and how they respond to a pandemic.,Simply put,,we need to be open and collaborative. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Growing up in Kenya,,I knew I always wantednto study biochemistry.,See, I had seen the impact of the highnprevalence of diseases like malaria,,and I wanted to make medicinesnthat would cure the sick.,So I worked really hard,,got a scholarship to the United States,nwhere I became a cancer researcher,,and I loved it.,For someone who wants to cure diseases,,there is no higher calling. 
 Ten years later, I returnednto Kenya to do just that.,A freshly minted PhD,,ready to take on this horrific illness,,which in Kenya was almostncertainly a death sentence.,But instead of landing a jobnin a pharmaceutical company,or a hospital,,I found myself drawnnto a different kind of lab,,working with a differentnkind of patient --,a patient whose illness was so serious,it impacted every singlenperson in my country;,a patient who needed to get healthy fast.,That patient was my government. 
 (Laughter) 
 See, many of us will agree that lotsnof governments are unhealthy today. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And Kenya was no exception.,When I returned to Kenya in 2014,,there was 17 percent youth unemployment.,And Nairobi, the major business hub,,was rated 177th on the qualitynof living index.,It was bad. 
 Now, an economy is only as healthynas the entities that make it up.,So when government --,one of its most vital entities --,is weak or unhealthy,,everyone and everything suffers.,Sometimes you mightnput a Band-Aid in place,to try and temporarily stop the pain.,Maybe some of you here have participated,in a Band-Aid operationnto an African country --,setting up alternative schools,nbuilding hospitals, digging wells --,because governments thereneither weren't or couldn't provide,the services to their citizens. 
 We all know this is a temporary solution.,There are just some thingsnBand-Aids can't fix,,like providing an environmentnwhere businesses feel secure,that they'll have an equal opportunity,to be able to run and startntheir businesses successfully.,Or there are systems in place,that would protect the privatenproperty that they create.,I would argue,,only government is capable of creatingnthese necessary conditions,for economies to thrive. 
 Economies thrive when business are ablento quickly and easily set up shop.,Business owners create new sourcesnof income for themselves,,new jobs get added into the economy,and then more taxes are paidnto fund public projects.,New business is good for everyone.,And it's such an important measurenof economic growth,,the World Bank has a ranking callednthe "Ease of Doing Business Ranking,",which measures how easynor difficult it is to start a business,in any given country.,And as you can imagine,,starting or running a businessnin a country with an ailing government --,almost impossible. 
 The President of Kenya knew this,nwhich is why in 2014,,he came to our lab and askednus to partner with him,to be able to help Kenyanto jump-start business growth.,He set an ambitious goal:,he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50nin this World Bank ranking.,In 2014 when he came,,Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.,We had our work cut out for us. 
 Fortunately, he came to the right place.,We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.,We're a group of computer scientists,nmathematicians, engineers,and a cancer researcher,,who understood that in ordernto cure the sickness,of a system as big as government,,we needed to examine the whole body,,and then we needed to drill downnall the way from the organs,,into the tissues,,all the way to single cells,,so that we could properlynmake a diagnosis. 
 So with our marching ordersnfrom the President himself,,we embarked on the purestnof the scientific method:,collecting data --,all the data we could get our hands on --,making hypotheses,,creating solutions,,one after the other. 
 So we met with hundreds of individualsnwho worked at government agencies,,from the tax agency, the landsnoffice, utilities company,,the agency that's responsiblenfor registering companies,,and with each of them, we observednthem as they served customers,,we documented their processes --nmost of them were manual.,We also just went back and looked atna lot of their previous paperwork,to try and really understand;,to try and diagnose what bodilynmalfunctions had occurred,that lead to that 136th spotnon the World Bank list. 
 What did we find?,Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days,for a business ownernto register their property,,compared to just one day in New Zealand,,which was ranked secondnon the World Bank list.,It took 158 days to getna new electric connection.,In Korea it took 18 days.,If you wanted to get a construction permit,so you could put up a building,,in Kenya, it was goingnto take you 125 days.,In Singapore, which is ranked first,nthat would only take you 26 days.,God forbid you had to go to court,to get help in being able to settlena dispute to enforce a contract,,because that process alonenwould take you 465 days.,And if that wasn't bad enough,,you would lose 40 percentnof your claim in just fees --,legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees. 
 Now, I know what you're thinking:,for there to exist such inefficienciesnin an African country,,there must be corruption.,The very cells that run the shownmust be corrupt to the bone.,I thought so, too, actually.,When we started out,,I thought I was going to findnso much corruption,,I was literally going to either dienor get killed in the process. 
 (Laughter) 
 But when we dug deeper,,we didn't find corruptionnin the classic sense:,slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,,waiting to grease the palmsnof their friends.,What we found was an overwhelmingnsense of helplessness.,Our government was sick,,because governmentnemployees felt helpless.,They felt that they were notnempowered to drive change.,And when people feel stuck and helpless,,they stop seeing their rolenin a bigger system.,They start to think the work they dondoesn't matter in driving change.,And when that happens,,things slow down,,fall through the cracks,and inefficiencies flourish. 
 Now imagine with me,,if you had a processnyou had to go through --,had no other alternative --,and this process was inefficient, complex,and very, very slow.,What would you do?,I think you might start by tryingnto find somebody to outsource it to,,so that they can justntake care of that for you.,If that doesn't work,,maybe you'd consider paying somebody,to just "unofficially" take carenof it on your behalf --,especially if you thoughtnnobody was going to catch you.,Not out of malice or greed,,just trying to make sure that you getnsomething to work for you,so you can move on.,Unfortunately, thatnis the beginning of corruption.,And if left to thrive and grow,,it seeps into the whole system,,and before you know it,,the whole body is sick. 
 Knowing this,,we had to start by making sure,that every single stakeholdernwe worked with had a shared vision,for what we wanted to do.,So we met with everyone,,from the clerk whose sole jobnis to remove staples,from application packets,,to the legal draftersnat the attorney general's office,,to the clerks who are responsiblenfor serving business owners,when they came to accessngovernment services.,And with them,,we made sure that they understood,how their day-to-day actionsnwere impacting our ability as a country,to create new jobsnand to attract investments.,No one's role was too small;neveryone's role was vital. 
 Now, guess what we started to see?,A coalition of government employees,who are excited and ready to drive change,,began to grow and form.,And together we startednto implement changes,that impacted the servicendelivery of our country. 
 The result?,In just two years,,Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92. 
 (Applause) 
 And in recognition of the significantnreforms we've been able to implement,in such a short time,,Kenya was recognized,to be among the top threenglobal reformers in the world,two years in a row. 
 (Applause) 
 Are we fully healthy?,No.,We have some serious work still to do.,I like to think about these two yearsnlike a weight-loss program. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's that time after monthsnof hard, grueling work at the gym,,and then you get your firstntime to weigh yourself,,and you've lost 20 pounds.,You're feeling unstoppable. 
 Now, some of you may thinknthis doesn't apply to you.,You're not from Kenya.,You don't intend to be an entrepreneur.,But think with me for just a moment.,When is the last timenyou accessed a government service?,Maybe applied for your driver's license,,tried to do your taxes on your own.,It's easy in this politicalnand global economy,to want to give up when we thinknabout transforming government.,We can easily resign to the factnor to the thinking,that government is too inefficient,,too corrupt,,unfixable.,We might even rarely getnsome key government responsibilities,to other sectors,,to Band-Aid solutions,,or to just give up and feel helpless.,But just because a system is sickndoesn't mean it's dying.,We cannot afford to give up,when it comes to the challengesnof fixing our governments. 
 In the end,,what really makes a government healthynis when healthy cells --,that's you and I --,get to the ground,,roll up our sleeves,,refuse to be helpless,and believe that sometimes,,all it takes is for usnto create some space,for healthy cells to grow and thrive. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Let's imagine a sculptornbuilding a statue,,just chipping away with his chisel.,Michelangelo had this elegant waynof describing it when he said,,"Every block of stonenhas a statue inside of it,,and it's the tasknof the sculptor to discover it.",But what if he workednin the opposite direction?,Not from a solid block of stone,,but from a pile of dust,,somehow gluing millions of these particlesntogether to form a statue. 
 I know that's an absurd notion.,It's probably impossible.,The only way you getna statue from a pile of dust,is if the statue built itself --,if somehow we could compel millionsnof these particles to come together,to form the statue. 
 Now, as odd as that sounds,,that is almost exactly the problemnI work on in my lab.,I don't build with stone,,I build with nanomaterials.,They're these just impossibly small,nfascinating little objects.,They're so small that if this controllernwas a nanoparticle,,a human hair would be the sizenof this entire room.,And they're at the heart of a fieldnwe call nanotechnology,,which I'm sure we've all heard about,,and we've all heardnhow it is going to change everything. 
 When I was a graduate student,,it was one of the most exciting timesnto be working in nanotechnology.,There were scientific breakthroughsnhappening all the time.,The conferences were buzzing,,there was tons of moneynpouring in from funding agencies.,And the reason is,when objects get really small,,they're governed by a different setnof physics that govern ordinary objects,,like the ones we interact with.,We call this physics quantum mechanics.,And what it tells you isnthat you can precisely tune their behavior,just by making seeminglynsmall changes to them,,like adding or removingna handful of atoms,,or twisting the material.,It's like this ultimate toolkit.,You really felt empowered;nyou felt like you could make anything. 
 And we were doing it --,and by we I mean my wholengeneration of graduate students.,We were trying to make blazing fastncomputers using nanomaterials.,We were constructing quantum dots,that could one day go in your bodynand find and fight disease.,There were even groupsntrying to make an elevator to space,using carbon nanotubes.,You can look that up, that's true.,Anyways, we thought it was going to affect,all parts of science and technology,nfrom computing to medicine.,And I have to admit,,I drank all of the Kool-Aid.,I mean, every last drop. 
 But that was 15 years ago,,and --,fantastic science was done,nreally important work.,We've learned a lot.,We were never able to translatenthat science into new technologies --,into technologiesnthat could actually impact people.,And the reason is, these nanomaterials --,they're like a double-edged sword.,The same thing that makesnthem so interesting --,their small size --,also makes them impossible to work with.,It's literally like trying to buildna statue out of a pile of dust.,And we just don't have the toolsnthat are small enough to work with them.,But even if we did,nit wouldn't really matter,,because we couldn't one by onenplace millions of particles together,to build a technology.,So because of that,,all of the promisenand all of the excitement,has remained just that:npromise and excitement.,We don't have anyndisease-fighting nanobots,,there's no elevators to space,,and the thing that I'm most interested in,nno new types of computing. 
 Now that last one,nthat's a really important one.,We just have come to expect,the pace of computing advancementsnto go on indefinitely.,We've built entire economies on this idea.,And this pace exists,because of our abilitynto pack more and more devices,onto a computer chip.,And as those devices get smaller,,they get faster, they consume less power,and they get cheaper.,And it's this convergencenthat gives us this incredible pace. 
 As an example:,if I took the room-sized computernthat sent three men to the moon and back,and somehow compressed it --,compressed the world'sngreatest computer of its day,,so it was the same sizenas your smartphone --,your actual smartphone,,that thing you spent 300 bucks onnand just toss out every two years,,would blow this thing away.,You would not be impressed.,It couldn't do anythingnthat your smartphone does.,It would be slow,,you couldn't put any of your stuff on it,,you could possiblynget through the first two minutes,of a "Walking Dead" episodenif you're lucky -- 
 (Laughter) 
 The point is the progress --nit's not gradual.,The progress is relentless.,It's exponential.,It compounds on itself year after year,,to the point wherenif you compare a technology,from one generation to the next,,they're almost unrecognizable.,And we owe it to ourselvesnto keep this progress going.,We want to say the same thingn10, 20, 30 years from now:,look what we've donenover the last 30 years.,Yet we know this progressnmay not last forever.,In fact, the party's kind of winding down.,It's like "last call for alcohol," right?,If you look under the covers,,by many metricsnlike speed and performance,,the progress has already slowed to a halt.,So if we want to keep this party going,,we have to do what we'venalways been able to do,,and that is to innovate. 
 So our group's rolenand our group's mission,is to innovatenby employing carbon nanotubes,,because we think that they cannprovide a path to continue this pace.,They are just like they sound.,They're tiny, hollow tubesnof carbon atoms,,and their nanoscale size,nthat small size,,gives rise to thesenjust outstanding electronic properties.,And the science tells usnif we could employ them in computing,,we could see up to a ten timesnimprovement in performance.,It's like skipping through severalntechnology generations in just one step. 
 So there we have it.,We have this really important problem,and we have what is basicallynthe ideal solution.,The science is screaming at us,,"This is what you should be doingnto solve your problem.",So, all right, let's get started,,let's do this.,But you just run right backninto that double-edged sword.,This "ideal solution" contains a materialnthat's impossible to work with.,I'd have to arrange billions of themnjust to make one single computer chip.,It's that same conundrum,nit's like this undying problem. 
 At this point, we said, "Let's just stop.,Let's not go down that same road.,Let's just figure out what's missing.,What are we not dealing with?,What are we not doingnthat needs to be done?",It's like in "The Godfather," right?,When Fredo betrays his brother Michael,,we all know what needs to be done.,Fredo's got to go. 
 (Laughter) 
 But Michael -- he puts it off.,Fine, I get it.,Their mother's still alive,nit would make her upset.,We just said,,"What's the Fredo in our problem?",What are we not dealing with?,What are we not doing,,but needs to be donento make this a success?",And the answer isnthat the statue has to build itself.,We have to find a way, somehow,,to compel, to convincenbillions of these particles,to assemble themselvesninto the technology.,We can't do it for them.nThey have to do it for themselves.,And it's the hard way,nand this is not trivial,,but in this case, it's the only way. 
 Now, as it turns out,nthis is not that alien of a problem.,We just don't build anything this way.,People don't build anything this way.,But if you look around --nand there's examples everywhere --,Mother Nature builds everything this way.,Everything is built from the bottom up.,You can go to the beach,,you'll find these simple organismsnthat use proteins --,basically molecules --,to template what is essentially sand,,just plucking it from the sea,and building these extraordinarynarchitectures with extreme diversity.,And nature's not crude like us,njust hacking away.,She's elegant and smart,,building with what's available,nmolecule by molecule,,making structures with a complexity,and a diversitynthat we can't even approach.,And she's already at the nano.,She's been therenfor hundreds of millions of years.,We're the ones that are late to the party. 
 So we decided that we're goingnto use the same tool that nature uses,,and that's chemistry.,Chemistry is the missing tool.,And chemistry works in this case,because these nanoscale objectsnare about the same size as molecules,,so we can use themnto steer these objects around,,much like a tool.,That's exactly what we've done in our lab.,We've developed chemistrynthat goes into the pile of dust,,into the pile of nanoparticles,,and pulls out exactly the ones we need.,Then we can use chemistry to arrangenliterally billions of these particles,into the patternnwe need to build circuits.,And because we can do that,,we can build circuitsnthat are many times faster,than what anyone's been ablento make using nanomaterials before.,Chemistry's the missing tool,,and every day our tool gets sharpernand gets more precise.,And eventually --,and we hope this isnwithin a handful of years --,we can deliver on onenof those original promises. 
 Now, computing is just one example.,It's the one that I'm interested in,nthat my group is really invested in,,but there are othersnin renewable energy, in medicine,,in structural materials,,where the science is going to tell younto move towards the nano.,That's where the biggest benefit is.,But if we're going to do that,,the scientists of today and tomorrownare going to need new tools --,tools just like the ones I described.,And they will need chemistry.nThat's the point.,The beauty of science is thatnonce you develop these new tools,,they're out there.,They're out there forever,,and anyone anywherencan pick them up and use them,,and help to delivernon the promise of nanotechnology. 
 Thank you so much for your time.nI appreciate it. 
 (Applause)When I was a kid,nI was the quintessential nerd.,I think some of you were, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you, sir, who laughed the loudest,nyou probably still are. 
 (Laughter) 
 I grew up in a small townnin the dusty plains of north Texas,,the son of a sheriffnwho was the son of a pastor.,Getting into trouble was not an option.,And so I started readingncalculus books for fun. 
 (Laughter) 
 You did, too.,That led me to building a lasernand a computer and model rockets,,and that led me to makingnrocket fuel in my bedroom.,Now, in scientific terms,,we call this a very bad idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 Around that same time,,Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey"ncame to the theaters,,and my life was forever changed.,I loved everything about that movie,,especially the HAL 9000.,Now, HAL was a sentient computer,designed to guide the Discovery spacecraft,from the Earth to Jupiter.,HAL was also a flawed character,,for in the end he chosento value the mission over human life.,Now, HAL was a fictional character,,but nonetheless he speaks to our fears,,our fears of being subjugated,by some unfeeling, artificial intelligence,who is indifferent to our humanity. 
 I believe that such fears are unfounded.,Indeed, we stand at a remarkable time,in human history,,where, driven by refusal to acceptnthe limits of our bodies and our minds,,we are building machines,of exquisite, beautifulncomplexity and grace,that will extend the human experience,in ways beyond our imagining. 
 After a career that led menfrom the Air Force Academy,to Space Command to now,,I became a systems engineer,,and recently I was drawnninto an engineering problem,associated with NASA's mission to Mars.,Now, in space flights to the Moon,,we can rely uponnmission control in Houston,to watch over all aspects of a flight.,However, Mars is 200 times further away,,and as a result it takesnon average 13 minutes,for a signal to travelnfrom the Earth to Mars.,If there's trouble,nthere's not enough time.,And so a reasonable engineering solution,calls for us to put mission control,inside the walls of the Orion spacecraft.,Another fascinating ideanin the mission profile,places humanoid robotsnon the surface of Mars,before the humans themselves arrive,,first to build facilities,and later to serve as collaborativenmembers of the science team. 
 Now, as I looked at thisnfrom an engineering perspective,,it became very clear to menthat what I needed to architect,was a smart, collaborative,,socially intelligentnartificial intelligence.,In other words, I needed to buildnsomething very much like a HAL,but without the homicidal tendencies. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's pause for a moment.,Is it really possible to buildnan artificial intelligence like that?,Actually, it is.,In many ways,,this is a hard engineering problem,with elements of AI,,not some wet hair ball of an AI problemnthat needs to be engineered.,To paraphrase Alan Turing,,I'm not interestednin building a sentient machine.,I'm not building a HAL.,All I'm after is a simple brain,,something that offersnthe illusion of intelligence. 
 The art and the science of computingnhave come a long way,since HAL was onscreen,,and I'd imagine if his inventornDr. Chandra were here today,,he'd have a whole lot of questions for us.,Is it really possible for us,to take a system of millionsnupon millions of devices,,to read in their data streams,,to predict their failuresnand act in advance?,Yes.,Can we build systems that conversenwith humans in natural language?,Yes.,Can we build systemsnthat recognize objects, identify emotions,,emote themselves,nplay games and even read lips?,Yes.,Can we build a system that sets goals,,that carries out plans against those goalsnand learns along the way?,Yes.,Can we build systemsnthat have a theory of mind?,This we are learning to do.,Can we build systems that havenan ethical and moral foundation?,This we must learn how to do.,So let's accept for a moment,that it's possible to buildnsuch an artificial intelligence,for this kind of mission and others. 
 The next questionnyou must ask yourself is,,should we fear it?,Now, every new technology,brings with itnsome measure of trepidation.,When we first saw cars,,people lamented that we would seenthe destruction of the family.,When we first saw telephones come in,,people were worried it would destroynall civil conversation.,At a point in time we sawnthe written word become pervasive,,people thought we would losenour ability to memorize.,These things are all true to a degree,,but it's also the casenthat these technologies,brought to us thingsnthat extended the human experience,in some profound ways. 
 So let's take this a little further.,I do not fear the creationnof an AI like this,,because it will eventuallynembody some of our values.,Consider this: building a cognitive systemnis fundamentally different,than building a traditionalnsoftware-intensive system of the past.,We don't program them. We teach them.,In order to teach a systemnhow to recognize flowers,,I show it thousands of flowersnof the kinds I like.,In order to teach a systemnhow to play a game --,Well, I would. You would, too.,I like flowers. Come on.,To teach a systemnhow to play a game like Go,,I'd have it play thousands of games of Go,,but in the process I also teach it,how to discernna good game from a bad game.,If I want to create an artificiallynintelligent legal assistant,,I will teach it some corpus of law,but at the same time I am fusing with it,the sense of mercy and justicenthat is part of that law.,In scientific terms,nthis is what we call ground truth,,and here's the important point:,in producing these machines,,we are therefore teaching themna sense of our values.,To that end, I trustnan artificial intelligence,the same, if not more,nas a human who is well-trained. 
 But, you may ask,,what about rogue agents,,some well-fundednnongovernment organization?,I do not fear an artificial intelligencenin the hand of a lone wolf.,Clearly, we cannot protect ourselvesnagainst all random acts of violence,,but the reality is such a system,requires substantial trainingnand subtle training,far beyond the resources of an individual.,And furthermore,,it's far more than just injectingnan internet virus to the world,,where you push a button,nall of a sudden it's in a million places,and laptops start blowing upnall over the place.,Now, these kinds of substancesnare much larger,,and we'll certainly see them coming. 
 Do I fear that suchnan artificial intelligence,might threaten all of humanity?,If you look at moviesnsuch as "The Matrix," "Metropolis,","The Terminator,"nshows such as "Westworld,",they all speak of this kind of fear.,Indeed, in the book "Superintelligence"nby the philosopher Nick Bostrom,,he picks up on this theme,and observes that a superintelligencenmight not only be dangerous,,it could represent an existential threatnto all of humanity.,Dr. Bostrom's basic argument,is that such systems will eventually,have such an insatiablenthirst for information,that they will perhaps learn how to learn,and eventually discovernthat they may have goals,that are contrary to human needs.,Dr. Bostrom has a number of followers.,He is supported by peoplensuch as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking.,With all due respect,to these brilliant minds,,I believe that theynare fundamentally wrong.,Now, there are a lot of piecesnof Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack,,and I don't have time to unpack them all,,but very briefly, consider this:,super knowing is very differentnthan super doing.,HAL was a threat to the Discovery crew,only insofar as HAL commandednall aspects of the Discovery.,So it would have to benwith a superintelligence.,It would have to have dominionnover all of our world.,This is the stuff of Skynetnfrom the movie "The Terminator",in which we had a superintelligence,that commanded human will,,that directed every devicenthat was in every corner of the world.,Practically speaking,,it ain't gonna happen.,We are not building AIsnthat control the weather,,that direct the tides,,that command usncapricious, chaotic humans.,And furthermore, if suchnan artificial intelligence existed,,it would have to competenwith human economies,,and thereby compete for resources with us.,And in the end --,don't tell Siri this --,we can always unplug them. 
 (Laughter) 
 We are on an incredible journey,of coevolution with our machines.,The humans we are today,are not the humans we will be then.,To worry now about the risenof a superintelligence,is in many ways a dangerous distraction,because the rise of computing itself,brings to us a numbernof human and societal issues,to which we must now attend.,How shall I best organize society,when the need for human labor diminishes?,How can I bring understandingnand education throughout the globe,and still respect our differences?,How might I extend and enhance human lifenthrough cognitive healthcare?,How might I use computing,to help take us to the stars? 
 And that's the exciting thing.,The opportunities to use computing,to advance the human experience,are within our reach,,here and now,,and we are just beginning. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)"You have cancer.",Sadly, about 40 percent of us will hearnthose three words within our lifetime,,and half will not survive.,This means that two out of fivenof your closest friends and relatives,will be diagnosednwith some form of cancer,,and one will die.,Beyond the physical hardships,,roughly one-thirdnof cancer survivors here in the US,will go into debt from treatment.,And they're at least two and a half timesnmore likely to declare bankruptcy,than those without cancer.,This disease is pervasive.,It's emotionally draining,and, for many,,financially destructive. 
 But a cancer diagnosisndoesn't have to be a death sentence.,Finding cancer early,,closer its genesis,,is one of the critical factorsnto improving treatment options,,reducing its emotional impact,and minimizing financial burdens.,Most importantly,,finding cancer early --,which is one of the primarynaims of my research --,greatly enhances your odds of survival.,If we just look at the casenof breast cancer for example,,we find that those who are diagnosednand treated at stage one,have a five-year survival ratenof nearly 100 percent --,odds that decrease to just 22 percentnif treated at stage four.,And similar trends are foundnfor colorectal and ovarian cancer. 
 Now, we're all awarenthat an early diagnosis that is accurate,is critical for survival.,The problem is that manyncancer diagnostic tools are invasive,,costly,,often inaccurate,and they can take an agonizingnamount of time to get the results back.,Still worse, when it comesnto some forms of cancer,,such as ovarian,nliver or pancreatic cancer,,good screening methods simply don't exist,,meaning that often people waitnuntil physical symptoms surface,,which are themselves alreadynindicators of late-stage progression.,Like a tornado strike in an areanwithout an early warning system,,there is no alarm to warn,,for the danger is already at your doorstep,when your odds of survivalnare greatly reduced.,Having the convenience and accessibilitynof regular screening options,that are affordable, noninvasivenand could provide results much sooner,,would provide us with a formidablenweapon in the fight against cancer. 
 An early warning would allow usnto get out ahead of the disease,instead of merelynfollowing in its relentless wake.,And this is exactly what I've been doing.,For the past three years,nI've been developing technologies,that could ultimately aid clinicians,with rapid, early-stagencancer diagnostics.,And I've been fuelednby a deep scientific curiosity,,and a passion to change these statistics. 
 Last year however,,this fight became much more personal,when my wife was diagnosednwith breast cancer.,It was an experience that added a strongnand unexpected emotional dimension,to these efforts.,I know firsthand how life-alteringntreatment can be,,and I'm keenly awarenof the emotional havoc,that cancer can wreak on a family,,which in our casenincluded our two young daughters.,Because we found it earlynduring a routine mammogram,,we were able to focusnprimarily on treatment options,for the localized tumor,,reaffirming to menhow important an early diagnosis is.,Unlike other forms of cancer,,mammograms do offer an early-stagenscreening option for breast cancer.,Still, not everyone has this done,,or they may develop breast cancer,before the middle age recommendationnfor having a mammogram.,So, there's stillna lot of room for improvement,,even for cancersnthat do have screening options,,and, of course, considerable benefitsnfor those that don't. 
 A key challenge thennfor cancer researchers,is to develop methods,that make regular screeningnfor many types of cancers,much more accessible.,Imagine a scenarionwhere during your regular checkup,,your doctor can takena simple, noninvasive urine sample,,or other liquid biopsy,,and present you with the resultsnbefore you even leave the doctor's office.,Such a technology couldndramatically reduce the number of people,who slip through the netnof an early-stage cancer diagnosis. 
 My research teamnof engineers and biochemists,is working on exactly this challenge.,We're working on ways to frequentlynactivate an early-stage cancer alarm,by enabling regular screeningsnthat would start when a person is healthy,so that action could be takennto stop cancer the moment it emerges,,and before it can progressnbeyond its infancy.,The silver bullet in this casenare tiny vesicles,,little escape pods regularly shednby cells called exosomes.,Exosomes are important biomarkers,that provide an early-warning systemnfor the development of cancer.,And because they're abundantly presentnin just about every bodily fluid,,including blood, urine and saliva,,they're extremely attractivenfor noninvasive liquid biopsies. 
 There's just one problem.,An automated system for rapidly sortingnthese important biomarkers,is not currently available.,We've created a technologynthat we call nano-DLD,that is capable of precisely this:,automated exosome isolation,to aid rapid cancer diagnostics.,Exosomes are the newestnearly-warning weapon, if you will,,to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.,And they're really, really small.,They measure just 30 to 150nnanometers in diameter.,This is so tiny,that you could fit about a millionnof them into a single red blood cell.,That's roughly the differencenbetween a golf ball,and a fine grain piece of sand. 
 Once thought to be little binsnfor unwanted cellular waste,,it has been foundnthat cells actually communicate,by producing and absorbing these exosomes,which contain surface receptors,,proteins and other genetic materialncollected from their cell of origin.,When absorbed by a neighboring cell,,exosomes release their contentsninto the receiving cell,,and can set in motionnfundamental changes in gene expression --,some good,,and this is where cancer comes in,,some bad.,Because they are clothednin the material of the mother cell,,and contain a sample of its environment,,they provide a genetic snapshotnof that cell's health and its origin.,All of these qualitiesnmake exosomes invaluable messengers,that potentially allow physicians,to eavesdrop on your healthnat the cellular level. 
 To catch cancer early, however,,you have to frequentlynintercept these messages,to determine when cancer-causingntroublemakers within your body,decide to start staging a coup,,which is why regularnscreening is so critical,and why we're developingntechnologies to make this possible.,While the first exosome-based diagnosticsnemerged on the market just this year,,they are not yet partnof mainstream healthcare options.,In addition to their recent emergence,,another factor that's limitingntheir widespread adoption,is that currently, no automatednexosome isolation system exists,to make regular screeningneconomically accessible.,The current gold standardnfor exosome isolation,includes ultracentrifugation,,a process requiringnexpensive laboratory equipment,,a trained lab tech,and about 30 hours of timento process a sample.,We've come up with a different approachnfor achieving automated exosome isolation,from a sample such as urine.,We use a chip-based, continuous flownseparation technique,called deterministic lateral displacement.,And we have done with it,what the semiconductor industry has donenso successfully for the past 50 years.,We shrunk the dimensionsnof this technology,from the micron scalento the true nanoscale. 
 So how does it work?,In a nutshell,,a set of tiny pillarsnseparated by nanoscopic gaps,are arranged in such a way,that the system dividesnthe fluid into streamlines,,with the larger cancer-relatednnanoparticles being separated,through a process of redirectionnfrom the smaller, healthier ones,,which can in contrast,move around the pillarsnin a zigzag-type motion,in the direction of fluid flow.,The net result is a complete separationnof these two particle populations.,You can visualize this separation process,similar to traffic on a highwaynthat separates into two roads,,with one road going intona low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,,and the other road going around it.,Here, smaller carsncan go through the tunnel,while larger trucks,ncarrying potentially hazardous material,,are forced to take the detour route.,Traffic is effectively separatednby size and contents,without impeding its flow.,And this is exactly how our system worksnon a much, much smaller scale. 
 The idea here is thatnthe separation process for screening,could be as simple as processingna sample of urine, blood or saliva,,which is a near-term possibilitynwithin the next few years.,Ultimately, it could be usednto isolate and detect target exosomes,associated withna particular type of cancer,,sensing and reportingntheir presence within minutes.,This would make rapid diagnosticsnvirtually painless.,Broadly speaking,,the ability to separatenand enrich biomarkers,with nanoscale precisionnin an automated way,,opens the door to better understandingndiseases such as cancer,,with applications rangingnfrom sample preparation to diagnostics,,and from drug resistancenmonitoring to therapeutics. 
 Even before my wife's bout with cancer,,it was a dream of mine to facilitatenthe automation of this process --,to make regular screening more accessible,,similar to the way Henry Fordnmade the automobile accessible,to the general population,through development of the assembly line.,Automation is the key to accessibility.,And in the spirit of the Hoover dream,,"a chicken in every potnand a car in every garage,",we're developing a technology,that could ultimately placenan early-warning cancer detection system,in every home.,This would allownevery man, woman and child,the opportunity to be regularly testednwhile they're still healthy,,catching cancer when it first emerges. 
 It is my hope and dream,to help people around the worldnavoid the high costs --,physical, financial and emotional --,faced by today's cancer patients,,hardships that I'm well acquainted with.,I'm also happy to report that becausenwe caught my wife's cancer early,,her treatment was successful,,and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free. 
 (Applause) 
 It is an outcome that I would like to seenfor everyone with a cancer diagnosis.,With the work that my teamnhas already done,on separation of nanoscale biomarkers,for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics,,I am optimisticnthat within the next decade,,this type of technology will be available,,helping protect our friends,nour family and future generations.,Even if we are so unluckynas to be diagnosed with cancer,,that early-stage alarmnwill provide a strong beacon of hope. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What if our plants,could sense the toxicitynlevels in the soil,and express that toxicitynthrough the color of its leaves?,What if those plants could alsonremove those toxins from the soil?,Instead, what if those plants,grew their own packaging,,or were designed to only be harvested,by their owners' own patented machines?,What happens when biological design,is driven by the motivationsnof mass-produced commodities?,What kind of world would that be? 
 My name is Ani, and I'm a designernand researcher at MIT Media Lab,,where I'm part of a relatively newnand unique group called Design Fiction,,where we're wedged somewherenbetween science fiction and science fact.,And at MIT, I am lucky enoughnto rub shoulders with scientists,studying all kinds of cutting edge fields,like synthetic neurobiology,,artificial intelligence, artificial life,and everything in between.,And across campus,nthere's truly brilliant scientists,asking questions like,n"How can I make the world a better place?",And part of what my groupnlikes to ask is, "What is better?",What is better for you, for me,,for a white woman, a gay man,,a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?,Technology is never neutral.,It frames a reality,and reflects a context.,Can you imagine what it would saynabout the work-life balance at your office,if these were standard issuenon the first day? 
 (Laughter) 
 I believe it's the rolenof artists and designers,to raise critical questions.,Art is how you can seenand feel the future,,and today is an excitingntime to be a designer,,for all the new tools becoming accessible.,For instance, synthetic biology,seeks to write biologynas a design problem.,And through these developments,,my lab asks, what are the rolesnand responsibilities,of an artist, designer,nscientist or businessman?,What are the implications,of synthetic biology, genetic engineering,,and how are they shaping our notionsnof what it means to be a human?,What are the implications of thisnon society, on evolution,and what are the stakes in this game? 
 My own speculative design researchnat the current moment,plays with synthetic biology,,but for more emotionally driven output.,I'm obsessed with olfactionnas a design space,,and this project started with this idea,of what if you could takena smell selfie, a smelfie? 
 (Laughter) 
 What if you could takenyour own natural body odor,and send it to a lover?,Funny enough, I found that thisnwas a 19th century Austrian tradition,,where couples in courtshipnwould keep a slice of apple,crammed under their armpit during dances,,and at the end of the evening,,the girl would give the guynshe most fancied her used fruit,,and if the feeling was mutual,,he would wolf down that stinky apple. 
 (Laughter) 
 Famously, Napoleon wrotenmany love letters to Josephine,,but perhaps amongst the most memorablenis this brief and urgent note:,"Home in three days. Don't bathe." 
 (Laughter) 
 Both Napoleon and Josephinenadored violets.,Josephine wore violet-scented perfume,,carried violets on their wedding day,,and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets,every year on their anniversary.,When Josephine passed away,,he planted violets at her grave,,and just before his exile,,he went back to that tomb site,,picked some of those flowers,nentombed them in a locket,and wore them until the day he died. 
 And I found this so moving,,I thought, could I engineer that violetnto smell just like Josephine?,What if, for the rest of eternity,,when you went to visit her site,,you could smell Josephinenjust as Napoleon loved her?,Could we engineer new ways of mourning,,new rituals for remembering?,After all, we've engineeredntransgenic crops,to be maximized for profit,,crops that stand up to transport,,crops that have a long shelf life,,crops that taste sugary sweetnbut resist pests,,sometimes at the expensenof nutritional value.,Can we harness these same technologiesnfor an emotionally sensitive output? 
 So currently in my lab,,I'm researching questions like,nwhat makes a human smell like a human?,And it turns out it's fairly complicated.,Factors such as your diet,nyour medications, your lifestyle,all factor into the way you smell.,And I found that our sweatnis mostly odorless,,but it's our bacteria and microbiome,that's responsible for your smells,nyour mood, your identity,and so much beyond.,And there's all kindsnof molecules that you emit,but which we only perceive subconsciously. 
 So I've been cataloging and collecting,bacteria from different sites of my body.,After talking to a scientist, we thought,,maybe the perfect concoction of Ani,is like 10 percent collarbone,n30 percent underarm,,40 percent bikini line and so forth,,and occasionallynI let researchers from other labs,take a sniff of my samples.,And it's been interesting to hearnhow smell of the body,is perceived outsidenof the context of the body.,I've gotten feedback such as,,smells like flowers, like chicken,,like cornflakes,,like beef carnitas. 
 (Laughter) 
 At the same time, I cultivatena set of carnivorous plants,for their ability to emitnfleshlike odors to attract prey,,in an attempt to kind of createnthis symbiotic relationship,between my bacteria and this organism.,And as it so happens,nI'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,,and I was talking to a scientist,who happens to be a chemistnand a plant scientist,,and I was telling him about my project,,and he was like, "Well, this soundsnlike botany for lonely women." 
 (Laughter) 
 Unperturbed, I said, "OK.",I challenged him.,"Can we engineer a plantnthat can love me back?",And for some reason,nhe was like, "Sure, why not?" 
 So we started with,ncan we get a plant to grow towards me,like I was the sun?,And so we're looking at mechanismsnin plants such as phototropism,,which causes the plantnto grow towards the sun,by producing hormones like auxin,,which causes cell elongationnon the shady side.,And right now I'm creatingna set of lipsticks,that are infused with these chemicals,that allow me to interact with a plantnon its own chemical signatures --,lipsticks that cause plantsnto grow where I kiss it,,plants that blossomnwhere I kiss the bloom. 
 And through these projects,,I'm asking questions like,,how do we define nature?,How do we define naturenwhen we can reengineer its properties,,and when should we do it?,Should we do it for profit, for utility?,Can we do it for emotional ends?,Can biotechnology be usednto create work as moving as music?,What are the thresholds between science,and its ability to shapenour emotional landscape? 
 It's a famous design mantranthat form follows function.,Well, now, wedged somewherenbetween science, design and art,I get to ask,,what if fiction informs fact?,What kind of R&amp;D lab would that look like,and what kind of questionsnwould we ask together? 
 We often look to technology as the answer,,but as an artist and designer,,I like to ask, but what is the question? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am from the South Side of Chicago,,and in seventh grade,nI had a best friend named Jenny,who lived on the SouthwestnSide of Chicago.,Jenny was white,,and if you know anything aboutnthe segregated demographics of Chicago,,you know that there arennot too many black people,who live on the Southwest Side of Chicago.,But Jenny was my girl,and so we would hang out every so oftennafter school and on the weekends.,And so one day we werenhanging out in her living room,,talking about 13-year-old things,,and Jenny's little sister Rosienwas in the room with us,,and she was sitting behind menjust kind of playing in my hair,,and I wasn't thinking too muchnabout what she was doing.,But at a pause in the conversation,,Rosie tapped me on the shoulder.,She said, "Can I ask you a question?" 
 I said, "Yeah, Rosie. Sure." 
 "Are you black?" 
 (Laughter) 
 The room froze.,Silence.,Jenny and Rosie's momnwas not too far away.,She was in the kitchennand she overheard the conversation,,and she was mortified.,She said, "Rosie! You can'tnask people questions like that.",And Jenny was my friend,nand I know she was really embarrassed.,I felt kind of bad for her,nbut actually I was not offended.,I figured it wasn't Rosie's faultnthat in her 10 short years on this earth,,living on the Southwest Side of Chicago,,she wasn't 100 percent surenwhat a black person looked like.,That's fair.,But what was more surprising to me was,,in all of this time I had spentnwith Jenny and Rosie's family --,hanging out with them,,playing with them,,even physically interacting with them --,it was not until Rosienput her hands in my hair,that she thought to ask me if I was black.,That was the first time I would realize,how big of a role the texture of my hairnplayed in confirming my ethnicity,,but also that it would play a key rolenin how I'm viewed by others in society. 
 Garrett A. Morgannand Madame CJ Walker were pioneers,of the black hair-care and beautynindustry in the early 1900s.,They're best known as the inventorsnof chemically-based hair creams,and heat straightening tools,designed to permanently,nor semipermanently,,alter the texture of black hair.,Oftentimes when we thinknabout the history of blacks in America,,we think about the heinous acts,and numerous injusticesnthat we experienced as people of color,because of the color of our skin,,when in fact, in post-Civil War America,,it was the hair of annAfrican-American male or female,that was known as the mostn"telling feature" of Negro status,,more so than the color of the skin.,And so before they were staples,of the multibillion-dollarnhair-care industry,,our dependency on tools and products,,like the hair relaxernand the pressing comb,,were more about our survivalnand advancement as a race,in postslavery America. 
 Over the years,nwe grew accustomed to this idea,that straighter and longernhair meant better and more beautiful.,We became culturally obsessed,with this idea of havingnwhat we like to call ...,"good hair.",This essentially means:,the looser the curl pattern,nthe better the hair.,And we let these institutionalized ideasnform a false sense of hierarchy,that would determinenwhat was considered a good grade of hair,and what was not.,What's worse is thatnwe let these false ideologies,invade our perception of ourselves,,and they still continuento infect our cultural identity,as African-American women today. 
 So what did we do?,We went to the hair salonnevery six to eight weeks,,without fail,,to subject our scalpsnto harsh straightening chemicals,beginning at a very young age --,sometimes eight, 10 --,that would result in hair loss,,bald spots,,sometimes even burns on the scalp.,We fry our hair at temperaturesnof 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher,almost daily,,to maintain the straight look.,Or we simply cover our hair upnwith wigs and weaves,,only to let our roots breathe in private,where no one knowsnwhat's really going on under there. 
 We adopted these practicesnin our own communities,,and so it's no wondernwhy today the typical ideal vision,of a professional black woman,,especially in corporate America,,tends to look like this,,rather than like this.,And she certainly doesn't look like this. 
 In September of this year,,a federal court ruled it lawful,for a company to discriminatenagainst hiring an employee,based on if she or he wears dreadlocks.,In the case,,the hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama,is on record as saying,,"I'm not saying yours are messy,,but ...,you know what I'm talking about.",Well, what was she talking about?,Did she think that they were ugly?,Or maybe they werenjust a little too Afrocentric,and pro-black-looking for her taste.,Or maybe it's not about Afrocentricity,,and it's more just aboutnit being a little too "urban",for the professional setting.,Perhaps she had a genuine concernnin that they looked "scary",and that they would intimidatenthe clients and their customer base.,All of these words are onesnthat are too often associated,with the stigmanattached to natural hairstyles.,And this ...,this has got to change. 
 In 2013,,a white paper published by the DeloittenLeadership Center for Inclusion,,studied 3,000 individualsnin executive leadership roles,on the conceptnof covering in the workplace,based on appearance,nadvocacy, affiliation and association.,When thinking aboutnappearance-based covering,,the study showed,that 67 percent of womennof color cover in the workplace,based on their appearance.,Of the total respondents whonadmitted to appearance-based covering,,82 percent said that it wasnsomewhat to extremely important,for them to do sonfor their professional advancement. 
 Now, this is Ursula Burns.,She is the first African-Americannfemale CEO of a Fortune 500 company --,of Xerox.,She's known by her signature look,,the one that you see here.,A short, nicely trimmed,nwell-manicured Afro.,Ms. Burns is whatnwe like to call a "natural girl.",And she is paving the waynand showing what's possible,for African-American womennseeking to climb the corporate ladder,,but still wishingnto wear natural hairstyles. 
 But today the majoritynof African-American women,who we still look to as leaders,nicons and role models,,still opt for a straight-hair look.,Now,,maybe it's because they want to --,this is authenticallynhow they feel best --,but maybe --,and I bet --,a part of them felt like they had to,in order to reach the level of successnthat they have attained today. 
 There is a natural hair movementnthat is sweeping the country,and also in some places in Europe.,Millions of women are exploring whatnit means to transition to natural hair,,and they're cutting offnyears and years of dry, damaged ends,in order to restorentheir natural curl pattern.,I know because I have been an advocatenand an ambassador for this movement,for roughly the last three years.,After 27 years of excessive heatnand harsh chemicals,,my hair was beginning to shownextreme signs of wear and tear.,It was breaking off,,it was thinning,,looking just extremely dry and brittle.,All those years of chasingnthat conventional image of beauty,that we saw earlier,was finally beginning to take its toll.,I wanted to do something about it,,and so I started what I callednthe "No Heat Challenge,",where I would refrainnfrom using heat styling tools on my hair,for six months.,And like a good millennial,,I documented it on social media. 
 (Laughter) 
 I documented as I reluctantly cut off,three to four inches of my beloved hair.,I documented as I strugglednto master these natural hairstyles,,and also as I struggled to embrace them,and think that they actually looked good.,And I documented as my hair texturenslowly began to change. 
 By sharing this journey openly,,I learned that I was notnthe only woman going through this,and that in fact there were thousandsnand thousands of other women,who were longing to do the same.,So they would reach out to menand they would say,,"Cheyenne, how did you donthat natural hairstyle,that I saw you with the other day?,What new products have you started using,that might be a little betternfor my hair texture,as it begins to change?",Or, "What are somenof the natural hair routines,that I should begin to adoptnto slowly restore the health of my hair?",But I also found that there werena large number of women,who were extremely hesitantnto take that first step,because they were paralyzed by fear.,Fear of the unknown --,what would they now look like?,How would they feel about themselvesnwith these natural hairstyles?,And most importantly to them,,how would others view them? 
 Over the last three years,of having numerous conversationsnwith friends of mine,and also complete strangersnfrom around the world,,I learned some really important things,about how African-American womennidentify with their hair.,And so when I think back,to that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama,,I'd say, "Actually, no.,We don't know what you're talking about.",But here are some things that we do know.,We know that when black womennembrace their love for their natural hair,,it helps to undo generations of teaching,that black in its natural statenis not beautiful,,or something to be hidden or covered up.,We know that black womennexpress their individuality,and experience feelings of empowerment,by experimenting with differentnhairstyles regularly.,And we also know,that when we're invitednto wear our natural hair in the workplace,,it reinforces that we are uniquely valued,and thus helps us to flourishnand advance professionally. 
 I leave you with this.,In a time of racial and social tension,,embracing this movement,and others like this,help us to rise aboventhe confines of the status quo.,So when you see a woman with braidsnor locks draping down her back,,or you notice your colleague,who has stoppednstraightening her hair to work,,do not simply approach her and admire,and ask her if you can touch it -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Really appreciate her.,Applaud her.,Heck, even high-five hernif that's what you feel so inclined to do.,Because this --,this is more than about a hairstyle.,It's about self-love and self-worth.,It's about being brave enough,not to fold under the pressurenof others' expectations.,And about knowing that makingnthe decision to stray from the norm,does not define who we are,,but it simply reveals who we are. 
 And finally,,being brave is easier,when we can countnon the compassion of others.,So after today,,I certainly hope that we can count on you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How many of you have usednan electronic spreadsheet,,like Microsoft Excel?,Very good.,Now, how many of you have run a businessnwith a spreadsheet by hand,,like my dad did for his smallnprinting business in Philadelphia?,A lot less. 
 Well, that's the way it was donenfor hundreds of years.,In early 1978,nI started working on an idea,that eventually became VisiCalc.,And the next year it shipped,running on something newncalled an Apple II personal computer.,You could tell that thingsnhad really changed when, six years later,,the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial,that assumed you knew what VisiCalc wasnand maybe even were using it. 
 Steve Jobs back in 1990,said that "spreadsheetsnpropelled the industry forward.","VisiCalc propelled the success of Applenmore than any other single event.",On a more personal note,,Steve said, "If VisiCalc had been writtennfor some other computer,,you'd be interviewingnsomebody else right now." 
 So, VisiCalc was instrumental in gettingnpersonal computers on business desks.,How did it come about?,What was it? What did I go throughnto make it be what it was?,Well, I first learned to programnback in 1966, when I was 15 --,just a couple monthsnafter this photo was taken.,Few high schoolers had accessnto computers in those days.,But through lucknand an awful lot of perseverance,,I was able to getncomputer time around the city. 
 After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock,nI went off to MIT to go to college,,where to make money,nI worked on the Multics Project.,Multics was a trailblazingninteractive time-sharing system.,Have you heard of the Linuxnand Unix operating systems?,They came from Multics.,I worked on the Multics versions,of what are knownnas interpreted computer languages,,that are used by peoplenin noncomputer fields,to do their calculationsnwhile seated at a computer terminal. 
 After I graduated from MIT,,I went to work fornDigital Equipment Corporation.,At DEC, I worked on software,for the new areanof computerized typesetting.,I helped newspapersnreplace their reporters' typewriters,with computer terminals.,I'd write software,and then I'd go out in the fieldnto places like the Kansas City Star,,where I would train usersnand get feedback.,This was real-world experience,that is quite differentnthan what I saw in the lab at MIT. 
 After that, I was project leader,of the software for DEC's firstnword processor, again a new field.,Like with typesetting, the important thingnwas crafting a user interface,that was both natural and efficientnfor noncomputer people to use.,After I was at DEC, I wentnto work for a small company,that made microprocessor-based electronicncash registers for the fast-food industry.,But I had always wanted to startna company with my friend Bob Frankston,that I met on the Multics project at MIT. 
 So I decided to go back to school to learnnas much as I could about business.,And in the fall of 1977,,I entered the MBA programnat Harvard Business School.,I was one of the fewnpercentage of students,who had a backgroundnin computer programming.,There's a picture of me from the yearbooknsitting in the front row. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, at Harvard,nwe learned by the case method.,We'd do about three cases a day.,Cases consist of up to a few dozen pagesndescribing particular business situations.,They often have exhibits,nand exhibits often have words and numbers,laid out in ways that make sensenfor the particular situation.,They're usually all somewhat different.,Here's my homework.,Again, numbers, words,nlaid out in ways that made sense.,Lots of calculations --nwe got really close to our calculators.,In fact, here's my calculator.,For Halloween, I wentndressed up as a calculator. 
 (Laughter) 
 At the beginning of each class,nthe professor would call on somebody,to present the case.,What they would do isnthey would explain what was going on,and then dictate informationnthat the professor would transcribe,onto the many motorized blackboardsnin the front of the class,,and then we'd have a discussion.,One of the really frustrating thingsnis when you've done all your homework,,you come in the next daynonly to find out that you made an error,and all of the other numbersnyou did were wrong.,And you couldn't participate as well.,And we were marked by class participation. 
 So, sitting there with 87 other peoplenin the class, I got to daydream a lot.,Most programmers in those daysnworked on mainframes,,building things like inventory systems,npayroll systems and bill-paying systems.,But I had workednon interactive word processing,and on-demand personal computation.,Instead of thinkingnabout paper printouts and punch cards,,I imagined a magic blackboard,that if you erased one numbernand wrote a new thing in,,all of the other numbersnwould automatically change,,like word processing with numbers.,I imagined that my calculatornhad mouse hardware on the bottom of it,and a head-up display,nlike in a fighter plane.,And I could type some numbers in,nand circle it, and press the sum button.,And right in the middle of a negotiationnI'd be able to get the answer.,Now I just had to take my fantasynand turn it into reality. 
 My father taught me about prototyping.,He showed me mock-ups,that he'd make to figure outnthe placement on the page,for the things for brochuresnthat he was printing.,And he'd use itnto get feedback from customers,and OKs before he sent the jobnoff to the presses.,The act of making a simple, workingnversion of what you're trying to build,forces you to uncover key problems.,And it lets you find solutionsnto those problems much less expensively. 
 So I decided to build a prototype.,I went to a video terminal connected tonHarvard's time-sharing system,and got to work.,One of the first problemsnthat I ran into was:,How do you represent values in formulas?,Let me show you what I mean.,I thought that you would point somewhere,,type in some words,nthen type in some somewhere else,,put in some numbers and some more numbers,npoint where you want the answer.,And then point to the first, press minus,npoint to the second,,and get the result.,The problem was:nWhat should I put in the formula?,It had to be somethingnthe computer knew what to put in.,And if you looked at the formula,,you needed to knownwhere on the screen it referred to.,The first thing I thought wasnthe programmer way of doing it.,The first time you pointed to somewhere,,the computer would ask younto type in a unique name.,It became pretty clear pretty fast thatnthat was going to be too tedious.,The computer had to automaticallynmake up the name and put it inside.,So I thought, why not make it benthe order in which you create them?,I tried that. Value 1, value 2.,Pretty quickly I sawnthat if you had more than a few values,you'd never remembernon the screen where things were. 
 Then I said, why not instead ofnallowing you to put values anywhere,,I'll restrict you to a grid?,Then when you pointed to a cell,,the computer could putnthe row and column in as a name.,And, if I did it like a map and put ABCnacross the top and numbers along the side,,if you saw B7 in a formula,,you'd know exactlynwhere it was on the screen.,And if you had to type the formulanin yourself, you'd know what to do.,Restricting you to a gridnhelped solve my problem.,It also opened up new capabilities,nlike the ability to have ranges of cells.,But it wasn't too restrictive --,you could still put any value,nany formula, in any cell.,And that's the way we do it to this day,nalmost 40 years later. 
 My friend Bob and I decided that we werengoing to build this product together.,I did more work figuring out exactlynhow the program was supposed to behave.,I wrote a reference cardnto act as documentation.,It also helped me ensurenthat the user interface I was defining,could be explained conciselynand clearly to regular people.,Bob worked in the attic of the apartmentnhe rented in Arlington, Massachusetts.,This is the inside of the attic.,Bob bought time on the MIT Multics System,to write computer codenon a terminal like this.,And then he would download test versionsnto a borrowed Apple II,over a phone linenusing an acoustic coupler,,and then we would test. 
 For one of these tests I preparednfor this case about the Pepsi Challenge.,Print wasn't working yet,nso I had to copy everything down.,Save wasn't working,nso every time it crashed,,I had to type in all of the formulasnagain, over and over again.,The next day in class, I raised my hand;nI got called on, and I presented the case.,I did five-year projections.nI did all sorts of different scenarios.,I aced the case.nVisiCalc was already useful. 
 The professor said, "How did you do it?",Well, I didn't want to tell himnabout our secret program. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I said, "I took this and added this,and multiplied by thisnand subtracted that." 
 He said, "Well,nwhy didn't you use a ratio?" 
 I said, "Hah! A ratio --nthat wouldn't have been as exact!",What I didn't say was,n"Divide isn't working yet." 
 (Laughter) 
 Eventually, though,nwe did finish enough of VisiCalc,to be able to show it to the public.,My dad printed up a sample reference card,that we could use as marketing material. 
 In June of 1979, our publishernannounced VisiCalc to the world,,in a small booth at the giant NationalnComputer Conference in New York City.,The New York Times hadna humorous article about the conference.,"The machines performnwhat seem religious rites ...,Even as the believers gather,,the painters in the Coliseum sign roomnare adding to the pantheon,,carefully lettering 'VISICALC'nin giant black on yellow.,All hail VISICALC!",(Gasp) New York Times:n"All hail VISICALC." 
 (Laughter) 
 That was the last mentionnof the electronic spreadsheet,in the popular business pressnfor about two years.,Most people didn't get it yet.,But some did. 
 In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.,It came in packagingnthat looked like this.,And it looked like thisnrunning on the Apple II.,And the rest, as they say, is history. 
 Now, there's an awful lotnmore to this story,,but that'll have to wait for another day.,One thing, though, Harvard remembers.,Here's that classroom.,They put up a plaquento commemorate what happened there. 
 (Applause) 
 But it also serves as a reminder,that you, too, should takenyour unique backgrounds, skills and needs,and build prototypes to discovernand work out the key problems,,and through that, change the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hello, I'm Joy, a poet of code,,on a mission to stopnan unseen force that's rising,,a force that I called "the coded gaze,",my term for algorithmic bias. 
 Algorithmic bias, like human bias,nresults in unfairness.,However, algorithms, like viruses,ncan spread bias on a massive scale,at a rapid pace.,Algorithmic bias can also leadnto exclusionary experiences,and discriminatory practices.,Let me show you what I mean. 
 (Video) Joy Buolamwini: Hi, camera.nI've got a face.,Can you see my face?,No-glasses face?,You can see her face.,What about my face?,I've got a mask. Can you see my mask? 
 Joy Buolamwini: So how did this happen?,Why am I sitting in front of a computer,in a white mask,,trying to be detected by a cheap webcam?,Well, when I'm not fighting the coded gaze,as a poet of code,,I'm a graduate studentnat the MIT Media Lab,,and there I have the opportunity to worknon all sorts of whimsical projects,,including the Aspire Mirror,,a project I did so I could projectndigital masks onto my reflection.,So in the morning, if I wantednto feel powerful,,I could put on a lion.,If I wanted to be uplifted,nI might have a quote.,So I used genericnfacial recognition software,to build the system,,but found it was really hard to test itnunless I wore a white mask. 
 Unfortunately, I've runninto this issue before.,When I was an undergraduatenat Georgia Tech studying computer science,,I used to work on social robots,,and one of my tasks was to get a robotnto play peek-a-boo,,a simple turn-taking game,where partners cover their facenand then uncover it saying, "Peek-a-boo!",The problem is, peek-a-boondoesn't really work if I can't see you,,and my robot couldn't see me.,But I borrowed my roommate's facento get the project done,,submitted the assignment,,and figured, you know what,nsomebody else will solve this problem. 
 Not too long after,,I was in Hong Kongnfor an entrepreneurship competition.,The organizers decidednto take participants,on a tour of local start-ups.,One of the start-ups had a social robot,,and they decided to do a demo.,The demo worked on everybodynuntil it got to me,,and you can probably guess it.,It couldn't detect my face.,I asked the developers what was going on,,and it turned out we had used the samengeneric facial recognition software.,Halfway around the world,,I learned that algorithmic biasncan travel as quickly,as it takes to downloadnsome files off of the internet. 
 So what's going on?nWhy isn't my face being detected?,Well, we have to looknat how we give machines sight.,Computer vision usesnmachine learning techniques,to do facial recognition.,So how this works is, you createna training set with examples of faces.,This is a face. This is a face.nThis is not a face.,And over time, you can teach a computernhow to recognize other faces.,However, if the training setsnaren't really that diverse,,any face that deviates too muchnfrom the established norm,will be harder to detect,,which is what was happening to me. 
 But don't worry -- there's some good news.,Training sets don't justnmaterialize out of nowhere.,We actually can create them.,So there's an opportunity to createnfull-spectrum training sets,that reflect a richernportrait of humanity. 
 Now you've seen in my examples,how social robots,was how I found out about exclusionnwith algorithmic bias.,But algorithmic bias can also leadnto discriminatory practices.,Across the US,,police departments are starting to usenfacial recognition software,in their crime-fighting arsenal.,Georgetown Law published a report,showing that one in two adultsnin the US -- that's 117 million people --,have their facesnin facial recognition networks.,Police departments can currently looknat these networks unregulated,,using algorithms that have notnbeen audited for accuracy.,Yet we know facial recognitionnis not fail proof,,and labeling faces consistentlynremains a challenge.,You might have seen this on Facebook.,My friends and I laugh all the timenwhen we see other people,mislabeled in our photos.,But misidentifying a suspected criminalnis no laughing matter,,nor is breaching civil liberties. 
 Machine learning is being usednfor facial recognition,,but it's also extending beyond the realmnof computer vision.,In her book, "Weaponsnof Math Destruction,",data scientist Cathy O'Neilntalks about the rising new WMDs --,widespread, mysteriousnand destructive algorithms,that are increasingly being usednto make decisions,that impact more aspects of our lives.,So who gets hired or fired?,Do you get that loan?nDo you get insurance?,Are you admitted into the collegenyou wanted to get into?,Do you and I pay the same pricenfor the same product,purchased on the same platform? 
 Law enforcement is also startingnto use machine learning,for predictive policing.,Some judges use machine-generatednrisk scores to determine,how long an individualnis going to spend in prison.,So we really have to thinknabout these decisions.,Are they fair?,And we've seen that algorithmic bias,doesn't necessarily alwaysnlead to fair outcomes. 
 So what can we do about it?,Well, we can start thinking aboutnhow we create more inclusive code,and employ inclusive coding practices.,It really starts with people.,So who codes matters.,Are we creating full-spectrum teamsnwith diverse individuals,who can check each other's blind spots?,On the technical side,nhow we code matters.,Are we factoring in fairnessnas we're developing systems?,And finally, why we code matters.,We've used tools of computational creationnto unlock immense wealth.,We now have the opportunitynto unlock even greater equality,if we make social change a priority,and not an afterthought.,And so these are the three tenetsnthat will make up the "incoding" movement.,Who codes matters,,how we code matters,and why we code matters. 
 So to go towards incoding,nwe can start thinking about,building platforms that can identify bias,by collecting people's experiencesnlike the ones I shared,,but also auditing existing software.,We can also start to createnmore inclusive training sets.,Imagine a "Selfies for Inclusion" campaign,where you and I can helpndevelopers test and create,more inclusive training sets.,And we can also start thinkingnmore conscientiously,about the social impactnof the technology that we're developing. 
 To get the incoding movement started,,I've launched the AlgorithmicnJustice League,,where anyone who cares about fairnessncan help fight the coded gaze.,On codedgaze.com, you can report bias,,request audits, become a tester,and join the ongoing conversation,,#codedgaze. 
 So I invite you to join me,in creating a world where technologynworks for all of us,,not just some of us,,a world where we value inclusionnand center social change. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 But I have one question:,Will you join me in the fight? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)In the movie "Interstellar,",we get an up-close looknat a supermassive black hole.,Set against a backdrop of bright gas,,the black hole's massivengravitational pull,bends light into a ring.,However, this isn't a real photograph,,but a computer graphic rendering --,an artistic interpretationnof what a black hole might look like. 
 A hundred years ago,,Albert Einstein first publishednhis theory of general relativity.,In the years since then,,scientists have providedna lot of evidence in support of it.,But one thing predictednfrom this theory, black holes,,still have not been directly observed.,Although we have some ideanas to what a black hole might look like,,we've never actually takenna picture of one before.,However, you might be surprised to knownthat that may soon change.,We may be seeing our first picturenof a black hole in the next couple years.,Getting this first picture will come downnto an international team of scientists,,an Earth-sized telescope,and an algorithm that puts togethernthe final picture.,Although I won't be able to show youna real picture of a black hole today,,I'd like to give you a brief glimpseninto the effort involved,in getting that first picture. 
 My name is Katie Bouman,,and I'm a PhD student at MIT.,I do research in a computer science lab,that works on making computersnsee through images and video.,But although I'm not an astronomer,,today I'd like to show you,how I've been able to contributento this exciting project. 
 If you go out pastnthe bright city lights tonight,,you may just be lucky enoughnto see a stunning view,of the Milky Way Galaxy.,And if you could zoom pastnmillions of stars,,26,000 light-years toward the heartnof the spiraling Milky Way,,we'd eventually reachna cluster of stars right at the center.,Peering past all the galactic dustnwith infrared telescopes,,astronomers have watched these starsnfor over 16 years.,But it's what they don't seenthat is the most spectacular.,These stars seem to orbitnan invisible object.,By tracking the paths of these stars,,astronomers have concluded,that the only thing small and heavynenough to cause this motion,is a supermassive black hole --,an object so dense that it sucks upnanything that ventures too close --,even light. 
 But what happens if we werento zoom in even further?,Is it possible to see somethingnthat, by definition, is impossible to see?,Well, it turns out that if we werento zoom in at radio wavelengths,,we'd expect to see a ring of light,caused by the gravitationalnlensing of hot plasma,zipping around the black hole.,In other words,,the black hole casts a shadownon this backdrop of bright material,,carving out a sphere of darkness.,This bright ring revealsnthe black hole's event horizon,,where the gravitational pullnbecomes so great,that not even light can escape.,Einstein's equations predictnthe size and shape of this ring,,so taking a picture of itnwouldn't only be really cool,,it would also help to verifynthat these equations hold,in the extreme conditionsnaround the black hole. 
 However, this black holenis so far away from us,,that from Earth, this ring appearsnincredibly small --,the same size to us as an orangenon the surface of the moon.,That makes taking a picture of itnextremely difficult.,Why is that?,Well, it all comes downnto a simple equation.,Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,,there are fundamental limits,to the smallest objectsnthat we can possibly see.,This governing equation saysnthat in order to see smaller and smaller,,we need to make our telescopenbigger and bigger.,But even with the most powerfulnoptical telescopes here on Earth,,we can't even get closento the resolution necessary,to image on the surface of the moon.,In fact, here I show one of the highestnresolution images ever taken,of the moon from Earth.,It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,,and yet each pixel would containnover 1.5 million oranges. 
 So how big of a telescope do we need,in order to see an orangenon the surface of the moon,and, by extension, our black hole?,Well, it turns outnthat by crunching the numbers,,you can easily calculatenthat we would need a telescope,the size of the entire Earth. 
 (Laughter) 
 If we could buildnthis Earth-sized telescope,,we could just start to make outnthat distinctive ring of light,indicative of the blacknhole's event horizon.,Although this picture wouldn't containnall the detail we see,in computer graphic renderings,,it would allow us to safely getnour first glimpse,of the immediate environmentnaround a black hole. 
 However, as you can imagine,,building a single-dish telescopenthe size of the Earth is impossible.,But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,,"You can't always get what you want,,but if you try sometimes,nyou just might find,you get what you need.",And by connecting telescopesnfrom around the world,,an international collaborationncalled the Event Horizon Telescope,is creating a computational telescopenthe size of the Earth,,capable of resolving structure,on the scale of a blacknhole's event horizon.,This network of telescopes is schedulednto take its very first picture,of a black hole next year.,Each telescope in the worldwidennetwork works together.,Linked through the precise timingnof atomic clocks,,teams of researchers at eachnof the sights freeze light,by collecting thousandsnof terabytes of data.,This data is then processed in a labnright here in Massachusetts. 
 So how does this even work?,Remember if we want to see the black holenin the center of our galaxy,,we need to build this impossibly largenEarth-sized telescope?,For just a second,nlet's pretend we could build,a telescope the size of the Earth.,This would be a little bitnlike turning the Earth,into a giant spinning disco ball.,Each individual mirror would collect light,that we could then combinentogether to make a picture.,However, now let's saynwe remove most of those mirrors,so only a few remained.,We could still try to combinenthis information together,,but now there are a lot of holes.,These remaining mirrors representnthe locations where we have telescopes.,This is an incredibly small numbernof measurements to make a picture from.,But although we only collect lightnat a few telescope locations,,as the Earth rotates, we get to seenother new measurements.,In other words, as the disco ball spins,nthose mirrors change locations,and we get to observendifferent parts of the image.,The imaging algorithms we developnfill in the missing gaps of the disco ball,in order to reconstructnthe underlying black hole image.,If we had telescopes locatedneverywhere on the globe --,in other words, the entire disco ball --,this would be trivial.,However, we only see a few samples,nand for that reason,,there are an infinite numbernof possible images,that are perfectly consistentnwith our telescope measurements.,However, not all images are created equal.,Some of those images look more likenwhat we think of as images than others.,And so, my role in helping to takenthe first image of a black hole,is to design algorithms that findnthe most reasonable image,that also fits the telescope measurements. 
 Just as a forensic sketch artistnuses limited descriptions,to piece together a picture usingntheir knowledge of face structure,,the imaging algorithms I developnuse our limited telescope data,to guide us to a picture that alsonlooks like stuff in our universe.,Using these algorithms,nwe're able to piece together pictures,from this sparse, noisy data.,So here I show a sample reconstructionndone using simulated data,,when we pretend to point our telescopes,to the black holenin the center of our galaxy.,Although this is just a simulation,nreconstruction such as this give us hope,that we'll soon be able to reliably takenthe first image of a black hole,and from it, determinenthe size of its ring.,Although I'd love to go onnabout all the details of this algorithm,,luckily for you, I don't have the time. 
 But I'd still likento give you a brief idea,of how we definenwhat our universe looks like,,and how we use this to reconstructnand verify our results.,Since there are an infinite numbernof possible images,that perfectly explainnour telescope measurements,,we have to choosenbetween them in some way.,We do this by ranking the images,based upon how likely they arento be the black hole image,,and then choosing the onenthat's most likely. 
 So what do I mean by this exactly?,Let's say we were trying to make a model,that told us how likely an imagenwere to appear on Facebook.,We'd probably want the model to say,it's pretty unlikely that someonenwould post this noise image on the left,,and pretty likely that someonenwould post a selfie,like this one on the right.,The image in the middle is blurry,,so even though it's more likelynwe'd see it on Facebook,compared to the noise image,,it's probably less likely we'd see itncompared to the selfie. 
 But when it comes to imagesnfrom the black hole,,we're posed with a real conundrum:nwe've never seen a black hole before.,In that case, what is a likelynblack hole image,,and what should we assumenabout the structure of black holes?,We could try to use imagesnfrom simulations we've done,,like the image of the black holenfrom "Interstellar,",but if we did this,nit could cause some serious problems.,What would happennif Einstein's theories didn't hold?,We'd still want to reconstructnan accurate picture of what was going on.,If we bake Einstein's equationsntoo much into our algorithms,,we'll just end up seeingnwhat we expect to see.,In other words,nwe want to leave the option open,for there being a giant elephantnat the center of our galaxy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Different types of images havenvery distinct features.,We can easily tell the differencenbetween black hole simulation images,and images we takenevery day here on Earth.,We need a way to tell our algorithmsnwhat images look like,without imposing one typenof image's features too much.,One way we can try to get around this,is by imposing the featuresnof different kinds of images,and seeing how the type of image we assumenaffects our reconstructions.,If all images' types producena very similar-looking image,,then we can start to become more confident,that the image assumptions we're makingnare not biasing this picture that much. 
 This is a little bit likengiving the same description,to three different sketch artistsnfrom all around the world.,If they all producena very similar-looking face,,then we can start to become confident,that they're not imposing their ownncultural biases on the drawings.,One way we can try to imposendifferent image features,is by using pieces of existing images.,So we take a large collection of images,,and we break them downninto their little image patches.,We then can treat each image patchna little bit like pieces of a puzzle.,And we use commonly seen puzzle piecesnto piece together an image,that also fits our telescope measurements. 
 Different types of images havenvery distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.,So what happens when we take the same data,but we use different sets of puzzle piecesnto reconstruct the image?,Let's first start with black holenimage simulation puzzle pieces.,OK, this looks reasonable.,This looks like what we expectna black hole to look like.,But did we just get it,because we just fed it little piecesnof black hole simulation images?,Let's try another set of puzzle pieces,from astronomical, non-black hole objects.,OK, we get a similar-looking image.,And then how about piecesnfrom everyday images,,like the images you takenwith your own personal camera?,Great, we see the same image.,When we get the same imagenfrom all different sets of puzzle pieces,,then we can start to become more confident,that the image assumptions we're making,aren't biasing the finalnimage we get too much. 
 Another thing we can do is takenthe same set of puzzle pieces,,such as the ones derivednfrom everyday images,,and use them to reconstructnmany different kinds of source images.,So in our simulations,,we pretend a black hole looks likenastronomical non-black hole objects,,as well as everyday images likenthe elephant in the center of our galaxy.,When the results of our algorithmsnon the bottom look very similar,to the simulation's truth image on top,,then we can start to becomenmore confident in our algorithms.,And I really want to emphasize here,that all of these pictures were created,by piecing together little piecesnof everyday photographs,,like you'd take with your ownnpersonal camera.,So an image of a black holenwe've never seen before,may eventually be created by piecingntogether pictures we see all the time,of people, buildings,ntrees, cats and dogs.,Imaging ideas like thisnwill make it possible for us,to take our very first picturesnof a black hole,,and hopefully, verifynthose famous theories,on which scientists rely on a daily basis. 
 But of course, gettingnimaging ideas like this working,would never have been possiblenwithout the amazing team of researchers,that I have the privilege to work with.,It still amazes me,that although I began this projectnwith no background in astrophysics,,what we have achievednthrough this unique collaboration,could result in the very firstnimages of a black hole.,But big projects likenthe Event Horizon Telescope,are successful due to allnthe interdisciplinary expertise,different people bring to the table.,We're a melting pot of astronomers,,physicists, mathematicians and engineers.,This is what will make it soon possible,to achieve somethingnonce thought impossible. 
 I'd like to encourage all of you to go out,and help push the boundaries of science,,even if it may at first seemnas mysterious to you as a black hole. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So many of you have probably seennthe movie "The Martian.",But for those of you who did not,nit's a movie about an astronaut,who is stranded on Mars,nand his efforts to stay alive,until the Earth can send a rescue missionnto bring him back to Earth.,Gladly, they do re-establish communication,with the character,nastronaut Watney, at some point,so that he's not as alonenon Mars until he can be rescued.,So while you're watching the movie,nor even if you haven't,,when you think about Mars,,you're probably thinking aboutnhow far away it is and how distant. 
 And, what might notnhave occurred to you is,,what are the logistics really likenof working on another planet --,of living on two planets,when there are people on the Earthnand there are rovers or people on Mars?,So think about when you have friends,nfamilies and co-workers,in California, on the West Coastnor in other parts of the world.,When you're tryingnto communicate with them,,one of the thingsnyou probably first think about is:,wait, what time is it in California?,Will I wake them up? Is it OK to call?,So even if you're interactingnwith colleagues who are in Europe,,you're immediately thinking about:,What does it take to coordinatencommunication when people are far away?,So we don't have people on Marsnright now, but we do have rovers.,And actually right now, on Curiosity,nit is 6:10 in the morning.,So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.,We have four rovers on Mars.,The United States has put four roversnon Mars since the mid-1990s,,and I have been privileged enoughnto work on three of them.,So, I am a spacecraft engineer,na spacecraft operations engineer,,at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratorynin Los Angeles, California.,And these roversnare our robotic emissaries.,So, they are our eyes and our ears,nand they see the planet for us,until we can send people.,So we learn how to operatenon other planets through these rovers.,So before we send people, we send robots.,So the reason there's a time differencenon Mars right now,,from the time that we're at,is because the Martian daynis longer than the Earth day.,Our Earth day is 24 hours,,because that's how long it takesnthe Earth to rotate,,how long it takes to go around once.,So our day is 24 hours.,It takes Mars 24 hours and approximatelyn40 minutes to rotate once.,So that means that the Martian daynis 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.,So teams of people who are operatingnthe rovers on Mars, like this one,,what we are doing is we are livingnon Earth, but working on Mars.,So we have to think as if we are actuallynon Mars with the rover.,Our job, the job of this team,nof which I'm a part of,,is to send commands to the rovernto tell it what to do the next day.,To tell it to drive or drillnor tell her whatever she's supposed to do.,So while she's sleeping --nand the rover does sleep at night,because she needsnto recharge her batteries,and she needs to weathernthe cold Martian night.,And so she sleeps.,So while she sleeps, we worknon her program for the next day.,So I work the Martian night shift.,(Laughter),So in order to come to work on the Earthnat the same time every day on Mars --,like, let's say I need to benat work at 5:00 p.m.,,this team needs to be at worknat 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,,then we have to come to worknon the Earth 40 minutes later every day,,in order to stay in sync with Mars.,That's like moving a time zone every day.,So one day you come in at 8:00,nthe next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,,the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,,the next day at 10:00.,So you keep moving 40 minutes every day,,until soon you're coming to worknin the middle of the night --,the middle of the Earth night.,Right? So you can imaginenhow confusing that is.,Hence, the Mars watch.,(Laughter),This weights in this watchnhave been mechanically adjusted,so that it runs more slowly.,Right? And we didn't start out --,I got this watch in 2004,when Spirit and Opportunity,nthe rovers back then.,We didn't start out thinking,that we were going to need Mars watches.,Right? We thought, OK,nwe'll just have the time on our computers,and on the mission control screens,nand that would be enough.,Yeah, not so much.,Because we weren't justnworking on Mars time,,we were actually living on Mars time.,And we got just instantaneously confusednabout what time it was.,So you really needed somethingnon your wrist to tell you:,What time is it on the Earth?nWhat time is it on Mars?,And it wasn't just the time on Marsnthat was confusing;,we also needed to be ablento talk to each other about it.,So a "sol" is a Martian day --nagain, 24 hours and 40 minutes.,So when we're talking about somethingnthat's happening on the Earth,,we will say, today.,So, for Mars, we say, "tosol.",(Laughter),Yesterday became "yestersol" for Mars.,Again, we didn't start out thinking,n"Oh, let's invent a language.",It was just very confusing.,I remember somebodynwalked up to me and said,,"I would like to do this activitynon the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover.",And I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow,nor Mars, tomorrow?",We started this terminology becausenwe needed a way to talk to each other.,(Laughter),Tomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow.",Because people have different preferencesnfor the words they use.,Some of you might say "soda"nand some of you might say "pop.",So we have people who sayn"nextersol" or "solorrow.",And then something that I noticed afterna few years of working on these missions,,was that the people who worknon the rovers, we say "tosol.",The people who work on thenlanded missions that don't rove around,,they say "tosoul.",So I could actually tell what missionnyou worked on from your Martian accent.,(Laughter),So we have the watches and the language,nand you're detecting a theme here, right?,So that we don't get confused.,But even the Earth daylightncould confuse us.,If you think that right now,nyou've come to work,and it's the middle of the Martian night,and there's light streaming innfrom the windows,that's going to be confusing as well.,So you can see fromnthis image of the control room,that all of the blinds are down.,So that there's no light to distract us.,The blinds went down all over the buildingnabout a week before landing,,and they didn't go upnuntil we went off Mars time.,So this also worksnfor the house, for at home.,I've been on Mars time three times,nand my husband is like,,OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.,And so he'll put foil all over the windowsnand dark curtains and shades,because it also affects your families.,And so here I was living in kind ofnthis darkened environment, but so was he.,And he'd gotten used to it.,But then I would get these plaintivenemails from him when he was at work.,Should I come home? Are you awake?,What time is it on Mars?,And I decided, OK,nso he needs a Mars watch.,(Laughter),But of course, it's 2016,nso there's an app for that.,(Laughter),So now instead of the watches,nwe can also use our phones.,But the impact on familiesnwas just across the board;,it wasn't just those of usnwho were working on the rovers,but our families as well.,This is David Oh,none of our flight directors,,and he's at the beach in Los Angelesnwith his family at 1:00 in the morning.,(Laughter),So because we landed in August,and his kids didn't have to go backnto school until September,,they actually went on to Mars timenwith him for one month.,They got up 40 minutes later every day.,And they were on dad's work schedule.,So they lived on Mars time for a monthnand had these great adventures,,like going bowlingnin the middle of the night,or going to the beach.,And one of the thingsnthat we all discovered,is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles,at 3:00 in the morningnwhen there's no traffic. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we would get off work,,and we didn't want to go homenand bother our families,,and we were hungry, so instead ofngoing locally to eat something,,we'd go, "Wait, there's this greatnall-night deli in Long Beach,,and we can get there in 10 minutes!",So we would drive down --nit was like the 60s, no traffic.,We would drive down there,nand the restaurant owners would go,,"Who are you people?,And why are you at my restaurantnat 3:00 in the morning?",So they came to realizenthat there were these packs of Martians,,roaming the LA freeways,nin the middle of the night --,in the middle of the Earth night.,And we did actuallynstart calling ourselves Martians.,So those of us who were on Mars timenwould refer to ourselves as Martians,,and everyone else as Earthlings. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's because when you're movingna time-zone every day,,you start to really feel separatednfrom everyone else.,You're literally in your own world.,So I have this button on that says,n"I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90.",And there's a picture of itnup on the screen.,So the reason we got these buttonsnis because we work on Mars time,in order to be as efficient as possiblenwith the rover on Mars,,to make the best use of our time.,But we don't stay on Mars timenfor more than three to four months.,Eventually, we'll move to a modified Marsntime, which is what we're working now.,And that's because it's hard onnyour bodies, it's hard on your families.,In fact, there were sleep researchersnwho actually were studying us,because it was so unusual for humansnto try to extend their day.,And they had about 30 of us,that they would donsleep deprivation experiments on.,So I would come in and take the testnand I fell asleep in each one.,And that was because, again,nthis eventually becomes hard on your body.,Even though it was a blast.,It was a huge bonding experiencenwith the other members on the team,,but it is difficult to sustain.,So these rover missions are our firstnsteps out into the solar system.,We are learning how to livenon more than one planet.,We are changing our perspectivento become multi-planetary.,So the next time you seena Star Wars movie,,and there are people goingnfrom the Dagobah system to Tatooine,,think about what it really means to havenpeople spread out so far.,What it means in termsnof the distances between them,,how they will start to feelnseparate from each other,and just the logistics of the time.,We have not sent peoplento Mars yet, but we hope to.,And between companies like SpaceX and NASA,and all of the internationalnspace agencies of the world,,we hope to do thatnin the next few decades.,So soon we will have people on Mars,nand we truly will be multi-planetary.,And the young boy or the young girl,who will be going to Mars could benin this audience or listening today.,I have wanted to work at JPLnon these missions since I was 14 years old,and I am privileged to be a part of it.,And this is a remarkable timenin the space program,,and we are all in this journey together.,So the next time you thinknyou don't have enough time in your day,,just remember, it's all a matternof your Earthly perspective.,Thank you.,(Applause)Well, as many of you know,,the results of the recentnelection were as follows:,Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate,won a landslide victory,with 52 percent of the overall vote.,Jill Stein, the Green candidate,,came a distant second, with 19 percent.,Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate,,was hot on her heels with 14 percent,,and the remainder of the votenwere shared between abstainers,and Gary Johnson,nthe Libertarian candidate. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, what parallel universendo you suppose I live in?,Well, I don't live in a parallel universe.,I live in the world,nand that is how the world voted.,So let me take you backnand explain what I mean by that. 
 In June this year,,I launched somethingncalled the Global Vote.,And the Global Votendoes exactly what it says on the tin.,For the first time in history,,it lets anybody, anywhere in the world,,vote in the electionsnof other people's countries.,Now, why would you do that?,What's the point?,Well, let me show you what it looks like.,You go to a website,,rather a beautiful website,,and then you select an election.,Here's a bunch that we've already covered.,We do about one a month, or thereabouts.,So you can see Bulgaria,nthe United States of America,,Secretary-General of the United Nations,,the Brexit referendum at the end there.,You select the electionnthat you're interested in,,and you pick the candidates.,These are the candidatesnfrom the recent presidential election,in the tiny island nationnof São Tomé and Príncipe,,199,000 inhabitants,,off the coast of West Africa.,And then you can look at the brief summarynof each of those candidates,which I dearly hope is very neutral,,very informative and very succinct.,And when you've foundnthe one you like, you vote.,These were the candidates,in the recent Icelandicnpresidential election,,and that's the way it goes. 
 So why on earth would you want to votenin another country's election?,Well, the reasonnthat you wouldn't want to do it,,let me reassure you,,is in order to interfere in the democraticnprocesses of another country.,That's not the purpose at all.,In fact, you can't,,because usually what I donis I release the results,after the electorate in eachnindividual country has already voted,,so there's no way that we couldninterfere in that process.,But more importantly,,I'm not particularly interested,in the domestic issuesnof individual countries.,That's not what we're voting on.,So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clintonnproposed to do for the Americans,is frankly none of our business.,That's something that onlynthe Americans can vote on. 
 No, in the global vote,nyou're only considering one aspect of it,,which is what are those leadersngoing to do for the rest of us?,And that's so very importantnbecause we live,,as no doubt you're sicknof hearing people tell you,,in a globalized, hyperconnected,nmassively interdependent world,where the political decisionsnof people in other countries,can and will have an impact on our lives,no matter who we are,nno matter where we live.,Like the wings of the butterfly,beating on one side of the Pacific,that can apparently createna hurricane on the other side,,so it is with the worldnthat we live in today,and the world of politics.,There is no longer a dividing line betweenndomestic and international affairs.,Any country, no matter how small,,even if it's São Tomé and Príncipe,,could produce the next Nelson Mandela,or the next Stalin.,They could pollute the atmospherenand the oceans, which belong to all of us,,or they could be responsiblenand they could help all of us. 
 And yet, the system is so strange,because the system hasn't caught upnwith this globalized reality.,Only a small number of peoplenare allowed to vote for those leaders,,even though their impact is gigantic,and almost universal.,What number was it?,140 million Americans voted,for the next presidentnof the United States,,and yet, as all of us knows,nin a few weeks time,,somebody is going to hand overnthe nuclear launch codes,to Donald J. Trump.,Now, if that isn't havingna potential impact on all of us,,I don't know what is.,Similarly, the electionnfor the referendum on the Brexit vote,,a small number of millionsnof British people voted on that,,but the outcome of the vote,nwhichever way it went,,would have had a significant impact,on the lives of tens, hundreds of millionsnof people around the world.,And yet, only a tiny number could vote. 
 What kind of democracy is that?,Huge decisions that affect all of us,being decided by relativelynvery small numbers of people.,And I don't know about you,,but I don't thinknthat sounds very democratic. 
 So I'm trying to clear it up.,But as I say,,we don't ask about domestic questions.,In fact, I only ever ask two questionsnof all of the candidates.,I send them the samentwo questions every single time.,I say, one,,if you get elected, what are youngoing to do for the rest of us,,for the remainder of the seven billionnwho live on this planet?,Second question:,What is your visionnfor your country's future in the world?,What role do you see it playing?,Every candidate,nI send them those questions.,They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.,I reckon if you're standing,to become the next presidentnof the United States,,you're probably pretty tied upnmost of the time,,so I'm not altogether surprisednthat they don't all answer, but many do.,More every time.,And some of them do much more than answer.,Some of them answer in the mostnenthusiastic and most exciting way,you could imagine. 
 I just want to say a word herenfor Saviour Chishimba,,who was one of the candidates,in the recent Zambiannpresidential election.,His answers to those two questionsnwere basically an 18-page dissertation,on his view of Zambia'snpotential role in the world,and in the international community.,I posted it on the websitenso anybody could read it.,Now, Saviour won the global vote,,but he didn't win the Zambian election. 
 So I found myself wondering,,what am I going to donwith this extraordinary group of people?,I've got some wonderful people herenwho won the global vote.,We always get it wrong, by the way.,The one that we elect,is never the person who's electednby the domestic electorate.,That may be partly becausenwe always seem to go for the woman.,But I think it may also be a sign,that the domestic electoratenis still thinking very nationally.,They're still thinking very inwardly.,They're still asking themselves:nWhat's in it for me? ...,instead of whatnthey should be asking today,,which is, what's in it for we? 
 But there you go.,So suggestions, please, not right now,,but send me an email if you've got an idea,about what we can donwith this amazing team of glorious losers.,(Laughter),We've got Saviour Chishimba,nwho I mentioned before.,We've got Halla Tómasdóttir,,who was the runner upnin the Icelandic presidential election.,Many of you may have seennher amazing talk at TEDWomen,just a few weeks ago,where she spoke about the neednfor more women to get into politics.,We've got Maria das Nevesnfrom São Tomé and Príncipe.,We've got Hillary Clinton.,I don't know if she's available.,We've got Jill Stein.,And we covered also the election,for the next Secretary-Generalnof the United Nations.,We've got the ex-prime ministernof New Zealand,,who would be a wonderfulnmember of the team.,So I think maybe those people,,the glorious loser's club,ncould travel around the world,wherever there's an election,and remind peoplenof the necessity in our modern age,of thinking a little bit outwards,and thinking ofnthe international consequences. 
 So what comes next for the global vote?,Well, obviously,,the Donald and Hillary shownis a bit of a difficult one to follow,,but there are some othernreally important elections coming up.,In fact, they seem to be multiplying.,There's something going on,nI'm sure you've noticed, in the world.,And the next row of electionsnare all critically important.,In just a few day's time,we've got the rerunnof the Austrian presidential election,,with the prospect of Norbert Hofer,becoming what is commonly described,as the first far-right head of statenin Europe since the Second World War.,Next year we've got Germany,,we've got France,,we've got presidential elections in Iran,and a dozen others.,It doesn't get less important.,It gets more and more important. 
 Clearly, the global votenis not a stand-alone project.,It's not just there on its own.,It has some background.,It's part of a projectnwhich I launched back in 2014,,which I call the Good Country.,The idea of the Good Countrynis basically very simple.,It's my simple diagnosisnof what's wrong with the world,and how we can fix it.,What's wrong with the worldnI've already hinted at.,Basically, we facenan enormous and growing number,of gigantic, existentialnglobal challenges:,climate change, human rights abuses,,mass migration, terrorism,neconomic chaos, weapons proliferation.,All of these problemsnwhich threaten to wipe us out,are by their very naturenglobalized problems.,No individual country has the capabilitynof tackling them on its own. 
 And so very obviously,we have to cooperatenand we have to collaborate as nations,if we're going to solve these problems.,It's so obvious, and yet we don't.,We don't do it nearly often enough.,Most of the time,ncountries still persist in behaving,as if they were warring, selfish tribesnbattling against each other,,much as they have donensince the nation-state was invented,hundreds of years ago.,And this has got to change.,This is not a change in political systemsnor a change in ideology.,This is a change in culture. 
 We, all of us, have to understand,that thinking inwards is not the solutionnto the world's problems.,We have to learn how to cooperatenand collaborate a great deal more,and compete just a tiny bit less.,Otherwise thingsnare going to carry on getting bad,and they're going to get much worse,nmuch sooner than we anticipate.,This change will only happen,if we ordinary people,tell our politiciansnthat things have changed.,We have to tell themnthat the culture has changed.,We have to tell themnthat they've got a new mandate.,The old mandatenwas very simple and very single:,if you're in a positionnof power or authority,,you're responsible for your own peoplenand your own tiny slice of territory,,and that's it.,And if in order to donthe best thing for your own people,,you screw over everybody elsenon the planet, that's even better.,That's considered to be a bit macho.,Today, I think everybodynin a position of power and responsibility,has got a dual mandate,,which says if you're in a positionnof power and responsibility,,you're responsible for your own people,and for every single man, woman,nchild and animal on the planet.,You're responsiblenfor your own slice of territory,and for every single square milenof the earth's surface,and the atmosphere above it.,And if you don't like that responsibility,nyou should not be in power.,That for me is the rule of the modern age,,and that's the message that we've gotnto get across to our politicians,,and show them that that's the waynthings are done these days.,Otherwise, we're all screwed. 
 I don't have a problem, actually,,with Donald Trump's credonof "America first.",It seems to me that that'sna pretty banal statement,of what politicians have always donenand probably should always do.,Of course they're elected to representnthe interests of their own people.,But what I find so boringnand so old-fashioned,and so unimaginativenabout his take on that,is that America firstnmeans everyone else last,,that making America great againnmeans making everybody else small again,,and it's just not true.,In my job as a policy advisornover the last 20 years or so,,I've seen so many hundredsnof examples of policies,that harmonize the internationalnand the domestic needs,,and they make better policy.,I'm not asking nationsnto be altruistic or self-sacrificing.,That would be ridiculous.,No nation would ever do that.,I'm asking them to wake up and understandnthat we need a new form of governance,,which is possible,and which harmonizes those two needs,,those good for our own peoplenand those good for everybody else.,Since the US election and since Brexit,it's become more and more obvious to me,that those old distinctionsnof left wing and right wing,no longer make sense.,They really don't fit the pattern.,What does seem to matter today,is very simple,,whether your view of the world is,that you take comfortnfrom looking inwards and backwards,,or whether, like me, you find hopenin looking forwards and outwards.,That's the new politics.,That's the new division that isnsplitting the world right down the middle.,Now, that may sound judgmental,nbut it's not meant to be.,I don't at all misunderstand,why so many people find their comfortnin looking inwards and backwards.,When times are difficult,nwhen you're short of money,,when you're feelingninsecure and vulnerable,,it's almost a naturalnhuman tendency to turn inwards,,to think of your own needs,and to discard everybody else's,,and perhaps to start to imaginenthat the past was somehow better,than the present or the futurencould ever be.,But I happen to believenthat that's a dead end.,History shows us that it's a dead end.,When people turn inwardsnand turn backwards,,human progress becomes reversed,and things get worse for everybodynvery quickly indeed.,If you're like me,and you believe in forwards and outwards,,and you believe that the best thingnabout humanity is its diversity,,and the best thing about globalization,is the way that it stirs upnthat diversity, that cultural mixture,to make something more creative,nmore exciting, more productive,than there's ever been beforenin human history,,then, my friends,nwe've got a job on our hands,,because the inwards and backwards brigade,are uniting as never before,,and that creed of inwards and backwards,,that fear, that anxiety,,playing on the simplest instincts,,is sweeping across the world.,Those of us who believe,,as I believe, in forwards and outwards,,we have to get ourselves organized,,because time is running outnvery, very quickly. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It's 1878.,Sir Francis Galtonngives a remarkable talk.,He's speaking to the anthropologicninstitute of Great Britain and Ireland.,Known for his pioneering worknin human intelligence,,Galton is a brilliant polymath.,He's an explorer,,an anthropologist,,a sociologist,,a psychologist,and a statistician.,He's also a eugenist.,In this talk,,he presents a new techniquenby which he can combine photographs,and produce composite portraits.,This technique could be usednto characterize different types of people.,Galton thinks that if he combinesnphotographs of violent criminals,,he will discover the face of criminality.,But to his surprise,,the composite portrait that he produces,is beautiful. 
 Galton's surprising findingnraises deep questions:,What is beauty?,Why do certain configurations of linenand color and form excite us so?,For most of human history,,these questions have been approachednusing logic and speculation.,But in the last few decades,,scientists have addressednthe question of beauty,using ideas from evolutionary psychologynand tools of neuroscience.,We're beginning to glimpsenthe why and the how of beauty,,at least in terms of what it meansnfor the human face and form.,And in the process,,we're stumbling upon some surprises. 
 When it comes to seeingnbeauty in each other,,while this decision is certainlynsubjective for the individual,,it's sculpted by factors that contributento the survival of the group.,Many experiments have shown,that a few basic parameters contributento what makes a face attractive.,These include averaging, symmetrynand the effects of hormones.,Let's take each one of these in turn. 
 Galton's finding,that composite or average facesnare typically more attractive,than each individual facenthat contributes to the average,has been replicated many times.,This laboratory finding fitsnwith many people's intuitions.,Average faces representnthe central tendencies of a group.,People with mixed featuresnrepresent different populations,,and presumably harborngreater genetic diversity,and adaptability to the environment.,Many people find mixed-racenindividuals attractive,and inbred families less so. 
 The second factor that contributesnto beauty is symmetry.,People generally find symmetric facesnmore attractive than asymmetric ones.,Developmental abnormalitiesnare often associated with asymmetries.,And in plants, animals and humans,,asymmetries often arisenfrom parasitic infections.,Symmetry, it turns out,,is also an indicator of health.,In the 1930s,,a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz,recognized the importancenof symmetry for beauty,when he designed the beauty micrometer.,With this device,,he could measure minor asymmetric flaws,which he could then make up fornwith products he sold from his company,,named brilliantlynafter himself, Max Factor,,which, as you know,nis one of the world's most famous brands,for "make up." 
 The third factor that contributesnto facial attractiveness,is the effect of hormones.,And here, I need to apologizenfor confining my comments,to heterosexual norms.,But estrogen and testosteronenplay important roles,in shaping featuresnthat we find attractive.,Estrogen produces featuresnthat signal fertility.,Men typically find women attractive,who have elementsnof both youth and maturity.,A face that's too baby-like mightnmean that the girl is not yet fertile,,so men find women attractive,who have large eyes,nfull lips and narrow chins,as indicators of youth,,and high cheekbonesnas an indicator of maturity. 
 Testosterone produces featuresnthat we regard as typically masculine.,These include heavier brows,,thinner cheeks,and bigger, squared-off jaws.,But here's a fascinating irony.,In many species,,if anything,,testosterone suppresses the immune system.,So the idea that testosterone-infusednfeatures are a fitness indicator,doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.,Here, the logic is turned on its head.,Instead of a fitness indicator,,scientists invoke a handicap principle. 
 The most commonly citednexample of a handicap,is the peacock's tail.,This beautiful but cumbersome tailndoesn't exactly help the peacock,avoid predators,and approach peahens.,Why should such an extravagantnappendage evolve?,Even Charles Darwin,,in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote,that the sight of the peacock's tailnmade him physically ill.,He couldn't explain itnwith his theory of natural selection,,and out of this frustration,,he developed the theorynof sexual selection. 
 On this account,,the display of the peacock's tailnis about sexual enticement,,and this enticement meansnit's more likely the peacock will mate,and have offspring.,Now, the modern twistnon this display argument,is that the peacock is alsonadvertising its health to the peahen.,Only especially fit organismsncan afford to divert resources,to maintaining suchnan extravagant appendage.,Only especially fit men can affordnthe price that testosterone levies,on their immune system.,And by analogy, think of the fact,that only very rich men can affordnto pay more than $10,000 for a watch,as a display of their financial fitness. 
 Now, many people hear these kindsnof evolutionary claims,and think they mean that we somehownare unconsciously seeking mates,who are healthy.,And I think this ideanis probably not right.,Teenagers and young adults are not exactlynknown for making decisions,that are predicated on health concerns.,But they don't have to be,,and let me explain why. 
 Imagine a population,in which people have three differentnkinds of preferences:,for green, for orange and for red.,From their point of view,,these preferences havennothing to do with health;,they just like what they like.,But if it were also the casenthat these preferences are associated,with the different likelihoodnof producing offspring --,let's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 --,then in the first generation,,there would be 3 greensnto 2 oranges to 1 red,,and in each subsequent generation,,the proportion of greens increase,,so that in 10 generations,,98 percent of this populationnhas a green preference.,Now, a scientist coming innand sampling this population,discovers that greennpreferences are universal.,So the point about this littlenabstract example,is that while preferencesnfor specific physical features,can be arbitrary for the individual,,if those features are heritable,and they are associatednwith a reproductive advantage,,over time,,they become universal for the group. 
 So what happens in the brainnwhen we see beautiful people?,Attractive faces activatenparts of our visual cortex,in the back of the brain,,an area called the fusiform gyrus,,that is especially tunednto processing faces,,and an adjacent area callednthe lateral occipital complex,,that is especially attunednto processing objects.,In addition,,attractive faces activate partsnof our reward and pleasure centers,in the front and deep in the brain,,and these include areasnthat have complicated names,,like the ventral striatum,,the orbitofrontal cortex,and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.,Our visual brain that is tunednto processing faces,interacts with our pleasure centers,to underpin the experience of beauty. 
 Amazingly, while we allnengage with beauty,,without our knowledge,,beauty also engages us.,Our brains respond to attractive faces,even when we're not thinking about beauty.,We conducted an experimentnin which people saw a series of faces,,and in one condition,,they had to decide if a pair of facesnwere the same or a different person.,Even in this condition,,attractive faces drove neural activitynrobustly in their visual cortex,,despite the fact that they were thinkingnabout a person's identity,and not their beauty.,Another group similarly foundnautomatic responses to beauty,within our pleasure centers.,Taken together, these studies suggest,that our brain automaticallynresponds to beauty,by linking vision and pleasure.,These beauty detectors, it seems,,ping every time we see beauty,,regardless of whatever elsenwe might be thinking. 
 We also have a "beauty is good"nstereotype embedded in the brain.,Within the orbitofrontal cortex,,there's overlapping neural activity,in response to beauty and to goodness,,and this happens even when peoplenaren't explicitly thinking,about beauty or goodness.,Our brains seem to reflexivelynassociate beauty and good.,And this reflexive associationnmay be the biologic trigger,for the many social effects of beauty.,Attractive people receivenall kinds of advantages in life.,They're regarded as more intelligent,,more trustworthy,,they're given higher paynand lesser punishments,,even when such judgmentsnare not warranted. 
 These kinds of observationsnreveal beauty's ugly side.,In my lab, we recently found,that people with minor facialnanomalies and disfigurements,are regarded as less good, less kind,,less intelligent, less competentnand less hardworking.,Unfortunately, we also havena "disfigured is bad" stereotype.,This stereotype is probablynexploited and magnified,by images in popular media,,in which facial disfigurementnis often used as a shorthand,to depict someone of villainous character.,We need to understandnthese kinds of implicit biases,if we are to overcome them,and aim for a societynin which we treat people fairly,,based on their behavior and notnon the happenstance of their looks. 
 Let me leave you with one final thought.,Beauty is a work in progress.,The so-called universalnattributes of beauty,were selected for during the almostntwo million years of the Pleistocene.,Life was nasty, brutishnand a very long time ago.,The selection criterianfor reproductive success from that time,doesn't really apply today. 
 For example,,death by parasite is not onenof the top ways that people die,,at least not in the technologicallyndeveloped world.,From antibiotics to surgery,,birth control to in vitro fertilization,,the filters for reproductive successnare being relaxed.,And under these relaxed conditions,,preference and trait combinationsnare free to drift,and become more variable.,Even as we are profoundlynaffecting our environment,,modern medicinenand technological innovation,is profoundly affecting,the very essence of what it meansnto look beautiful.,The universal nature of beauty is changing,even as we're changing the universe. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I die,,I would like for my bodynto be laid out to be eaten by animals.,Having your body laid out to be eatennby animals is not for everyone. 
 (Laughter) 
 Maybe you have already hadnthe end-of-life talk with your family,and decided on,nI don't know, cremation.,And in the interest of full disclosure,,what I am proposing for my dead bodynis not strictly legal at the moment,,but it's not without precedent. 
 We've been laying out our deadnfor all of human history;,it's call exposure burial.,In fact, it's likely happeningnright now as we speak.,In the mountainous regions of Tibet,,they practice "sky burial,",a ritual where the body is leftnto be consumed by vultures.,In Mumbai, in India,nthose who follow the Parsi religion,put their dead in structuresncalled "Towers of Silence.",These are interesting cultural tidbits,,but they just haven't really beennthat popular in the Western world --,they're not what you'd expect. 
 In America, our death traditionsnhave come to be chemical embalming,,followed by burial at your local cemetery,,or, more recently, cremation.,I myself, am a recent vegetarian,,which means I spent the firstn30 years or so of my life,frantically inhaling animals --,as many as I could get my hands on.,Why, when I die, should they notnhave their turn with me? 
 (Laughter) 
 Am I not an animal?,Biologically speaking,nare we not all, in this room, animals?,Accepting the fact that we are animals,has some potentiallynterrifying consequences.,It means acceptingnthat we are doomed to decay and die,,just like any other creature on earth. 
 For the last nine years,nI've worked in the funeral industry,,first as a crematory operator,,then as a mortician,and most recently, as the ownernof my own funeral home.,And I have some good news:,if you're looking to avoid the wholen"doomed to decay and die" thing:,you will have all the helpnin the world in that avoidance,from the funeral industry. 
 It's a multi-billion-dollar industry,,and its economic modelnis based on the principle,of protection, sanitationnand beautification of the corpse.,Whether they mean to or not,,the funeral industry promotesnthis idea of human exceptionalism.,It doesn't matter what it takes,,how much it costs,,how bad it is for the environment,,we're going to do itnbecause humans are worth it!,It ignores the fact,that death can be an emotionally messynand complex affair,,and that there is beauty in decay --,beauty in the natural returnnto the earth from whence we came.,Now, I don't want you to get me wrong --,I absolutely understandnthe importance of ritual,,especially when it comesnto the people that we love.,But we have to be ablento create and practice this ritual,without harming the environment,,which is why we need new options. 
 So let's return to the idea of protection,nsanitation and beautification.,We'll start with a dead body.,The funeral industrynwill protect your dead body,by offering to sell your family a casketnmade of hardwood or metal,with a rubber sealant.,At the cemetery, on the day of burial,nthat casket will be lowered,into a large concrete or metal vault.,We're wasting all of these resources --nconcretes, metal, hardwoods --,hiding them in vastnunderground fortresses.,When you choose burial at the cemetery,,your dead body is not coming anywherennear the dirt that surrounds it.,Food for worms,you are not. 
 Next, the industry will sanitizenyour body through embalming:,the chemical preservation of the dead.,This procedure drains your blood,and replaces it with a toxic,ncancer-causing formaldehyde.,They say they do thisnfor the public health,because the dead body can be dangerous,,but the doctors in this room will tell you,that that claim would only apply,if the person had died of some wildlyninfectious disease, like Ebola.,Even human decomposition,nwhich, let's be honest,,is a little stinky and unpleasant,,is perfectly safe.,The bacteria that causes diseasenis not the same bacteria,that causes decomposition. 
 Finally, the industrynwill beautify the corpse.,They'll tell you that the naturalndead body of your mother or father,is not good enough as it is.,They'll put it in makeup.,They'll put it in a suit.,They'll inject dyes so the personnlooks a little more alive --,just resting.,Embalming is a cheat code,,providing the illusion that deathnand then decay are not the natural end,for all organic life on this planet. 
 Now, if this system of beautification,nsanitation, protection,doesn't appeal to you,,you are not alone.,There is a whole wave of people --,funeral directors, designers,nenvironmentalists --,trying to come up with a moreneco-friendly way of death.,For these people, death is not necessarily,a pristine, makeup,npowder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.,There's no question,that our current methods of deathnare not particularly sustainable,,what with the waste of resourcesnand our reliance on chemicals.,Even cremation,,which is usually considerednthe environmentally friendly option,,uses, per cremation,,the natural gas equivalentnof a 500-mile car trip. 
 So where do we go from here?,Last summer, I was in the mountainsnof North Carolina,,hauling buckets of wood chipsnin the summer sun.,I was at Western Carolina Universitynat their "Body Farm,",more accurately calledna "human decomposition facility.",Bodies donated to sciencenare brought here,,and their decay is studiednto benefit the future of forensics.,On this particular day,,there were 12 bodies laid outnin various stages of decomposition.,Some were skeletonized,,one was wearing purple pajamas,,one still had blonde facial hair visible.,The forensic aspect is really fascinating,,but not actually why I was there.,I was there because a colleague of minennamed Katrina Spade,is attempting to create a system,nnot of cremating the dead,,but composting the dead. 
 She calls the system "Recomposition,",and we've been doing it with cattlenand other livestock for years.,She imagines a facility,where the family could comenand lay their dead loved one,in a nutrient-rich mixture that would,nin four-to-six weeks,,reduce the body -- bonesnand all -- to soil.,In those four-to-six weeks,,your molecules become other molecules;,you literally transform. 
 How would this fit innwith the very recent desire,a lot of people seem to have,to be buried under a tree,,or to become a tree when they die?,In a traditional cremation,nthe ashes that are left over --,inorganic bone fragments --,form a thick, chalky layer,that, unless distributednin the soil just right,,can actually hurt or kill the tree.,But if you're recomposed,nif you actually become the soil,,you can nourish the tree,,and become the post-mortem contributornyou've always wanted to be --,that you deserve to be. 
 So that's one optionnfor the future of cremation.,But what about the future of cemeteries?,There are a lot of people who thinknwe shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore,because we're running out of land.,But what if we reframed it,,and the corpse wasn't the land's enemy,,but its potential savior?,I'm talking about conservation burial,,where large swaths of landnare purchased by a land trust.,The beauty of this is that once you plantna few dead bodies in that land,,it can't be touched,nit can't be developed on --,hence the term, "conservation burial.",It's the equivalent of chaining yourselfnto a tree post-mortem --,"Hell no, I won't go!,No, really -- I can't.nI'm decomposing under here." 
 (Laughter) 
 Any money that the familyngives to the cemetery,would go back into protectingnand managing the land.,There are no headstonesnand no graves in the typical sense.,The graves are scatterednabout the property,under elegant mounds,,marked only by a rocknor a small metal disk,,or sometimes only locatable by GPS.,There's no embalming,,no heavy, metal caskets.,My funeral home sells a few caskets,made out of things likenwoven willow and bamboo,,but honestly, most of our familiesnjust choose a simple shroud.,There are none of the big vaultsnthat most cemeteries require,just because it makes it easiernfor them to landscape.,Families can come here;nthey can luxuriate in nature;,they can even plant a tree or a shrub,,though only native plantsnto the area are allowed.,The dead then blend seamlesslynin with the landscape. 
 There's hope in conservation cemeteries.,They offer dedicated green spacenin both urban and rural areas.,They offer a chance to reintroducennative plants and animals to a region.,They offer public trails,,places for spiritual practice,,places for classes and events --,places where nature and mourning meet.,Most importantly,nthey offer us, once again,,a chance to just decomposenin a hole in the ground.,The soil,,let me tell you,,has missed us. 
 I think for a lot of people,,they're starting to get the sense,that our current funeral industrynisn't really working for them.,For many of us,,being sanitized and beautifiednjust doesn't reflect us.,It doesn't reflectnwhat we stood for during our lives.,Will changing the way we bury our deadnsolve climate change?,No.,But it will make bold moves,in how we see ourselvesnas citizens of this planet.,If we can die in a waynthat is more humble and self-aware,,I believe that we stand a chance. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As patients,,we usually remembernthe names of our doctors,,but often we forgetnthe names of our nurses.,I remember one.,I had breast cancer a few years ago,,and somehow I managednto get through the surgeries,and the beginningnof the treatment just fine.,I could hide what was going on.,Everybody didn't really have to know.,I could walk my daughter to school,,I could go out to dinner with my husband;,I could fool people.,But then my chemo was scheduled to begin,and that terrified me,because I knew that I was going to losenevery single hair on my body,because of the kind of chemonthat I was going to have.,I wasn't going to be ablento pretend anymore,as though everything was normal. 
 I was scared.,I knew what it felt like to haveneverybody treating me with kid gloves,,and I just wanted to feel normal.,I had a port installed in my chest.,I went to my first day of chemotherapy,,and I was an emotional wreck.,My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,,and every bone in my body was tellingnme to get up out of that chair,and take for the hills.,But Joanne looked at me and talkednto me like we were old friends.,And then she asked me,,"Where'd you get your highlights done?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was like, are you kidding me?,You're going to talk to me about my hairnwhen I'm on the verge of losing it?,I was kind of angry,,and I said, "Really? Hair?",And with a shrugnof her shoulders she said,,"It's gonna grow back.",And in that moment she saidnthe one thing I had overlooked,,and that was that at some point,nmy life would get back to normal.,She really believed that.,And so I believed it, too. 
 Now, worrying about losing your hairnwhen you're fighting cancer,may seem silly at first,,but it's not just that you're worriednabout how you're going to look.,It's that you're worried that everybody'sngoing to treat you so carefully.,Joanne made me feel normalnfor the first time in six months.,We talked about her boyfriends,,we talked about lookingnfor apartments in New York City,,and we talked about my reactionnto the chemotherapy --,all kind of mixed in together.,And I always wondered,,how did she so instinctivelynknow just how to talk to me? 
 Joanne Staha and my admiration for her,marked the beginning of my journeyninto the world of nurses.,A few years later,nI was asked to do a project,that would celebratenthe work that nurses do.,I started with Joanne,,and I met over 100 nursesnacross the country.,I spent five years interviewing,nphotographing and filming nurses,for a book and a documentary film.,With my team,,we mapped a trip across Americanthat would take us to places,dealing with some of the biggestnpublic health issues facing our nation --,aging, war, poverty, prisons.,And then we went places,where we would findnthe largest concentration of patients,dealing with those issues.,Then we asked hospitals and facilitiesnto nominate nurses,who would best represent them. 
 One of the first nurses I metnwas Bridget Kumbella.,Bridget was born in Cameroon,,the oldest of four children.,Her father was at worknwhen he had fallen from the fourth floor,and really hurt his back.,And he talked a lot about what it was likento be flat on your back,and not get the kindnof care that you need.,And that propelled Bridgetnto go into the profession of nursing.,Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,,she has a really diverse groupnof patients that she cares for,,from all walks of life,,and from all different religions.,And she's devoted her careernto understanding the impact,of our cultural differencesnwhen it comes to our health.,She spoke of a patient --,a Native American patient that she had --,that wanted to bringna bunch of feathers into the ICU.,That's how he found spiritual comfort.,And she spoke of advocating for him,and said that patients comenfrom all different religions,and use all different kindsnof objects for comfort;,whether it's a holy rosarynor a symbolic feather,,it all needs to be supported. 
 This is Jason Short.,Jason is a home health nursenin the Appalachian mountains,,and his dad had a gas stationnand a repair shop when he was growing up.,So he worked on cars in the communitynthat he now serves as a nurse.,When he was in college,,it was just not macho at allnto become a nurse,,so he avoided it for years.,He drove trucks for a little while,,but his life path was alwaysnpulling him back to nursing.,As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,,Jason goes placesnthat an ambulance can't even get to.,In this photograph,nhe's standing in what used to be a road.,Top of the mountain miningnflooded that road,,and now the only waynfor Jason to get to the patient,living in that housenwith black lung disease,is to drive his SUVnagainst the current up that creek.,The day I was with him,nwe ripped the front fender off the car.,The next morning he got up,nput the car on the lift,,fixed the fender,,and then headed outnto meet his next patient.,I witnessed Jasonncaring for this gentleman,with such enormous compassion,,and I was struck again by how intimatenthe work of nursing really is. 
 When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.,He had just come back from a deployment,and he hadn't really settled back innto life in San Diego yet.,He talked about his experiencenof being a nurse in Germany,and taking care of the soldiersncoming right off the battlefield.,Very often, he would benthe first person they would see,when they openedntheir eyes in the hospital.,And they would look at himnas they were lying there,,missing limbs,,and the first thing they would say is,,"When can I go back?nI left my brothers out there.",And Brian would have to say,,"You're not going anywhere.,You've already given enough, brother.",Brian is both a nurse and a soldiernwho's seen combat.,So that puts him in a unique position,to be able to relate to and help healnthe veterans in his care. 
 This is Sister Stephen,,and she runs a nursing homenin Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.,And the entire circle of lifencan be found under her roof.,She grew up wishing they lived on a farm,,so given the opportunitynto adopt local farm animals,,she enthusiastically brings them in.,And in the springtime,nthose animals have babies.,And Sister Stephen usesnthose baby ducks, goats and lambs,as animal therapynfor the residents at Villa Loretto,who sometimes can'tnremember their own name,,but they do rejoicenin the holding of a baby lamb.,The day I was with Sister Stephen,,I needed to take her awaynfrom Villa Loretto,to film part of her story.,And before we left,,she went into the room of a dying patient.,And she leaned over and she said,,"I have to go away for the day,,but if Jesus calls you,,you go.,You go straight home to Jesus.",I was standing there and thinking,it was the first time in my life,I witnessed that you could shownsomeone you love them completely,by letting go.,We don't have to hold on so tightly.,I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto,than I have ever seen at any other timenat any other place in my life. 
 We live in a complicated timenwhen it comes to our health care.,It's easy to lose sightnof the need for quality of life,,not just quantity of life.,As new life-savingntechnologies are created,,we're going to have reallyncomplicated decisions to make.,These technologies often save lives,,but they can also prolong painnand the dying process.,How in the world are we supposednto navigate these waters?,We're going to neednall the help we can get.,Nurses have a really uniquenrelationship with us,because of the time spent at bedside.,During that time,,a kind of emotional intimacy develops. 
 This past summer, on August 9,,my father died of a heart attack.,My mother was devastated,,and she couldn't imaginenher world without him in it.,Four days later she fell,,she broke her hip,,she needed surgery,and she found herselfnfighting for her own life.,Once again I found myself,on the receiving endnof the care of nurses --,this time for my mom.,My brother and my sister and Instayed by her side,for the next three days in the ICU.,And as we triednto make the right decisions,and follow my mother's wishes,,we found that we were dependingnupon the guidance of nurses.,And once again,,they didn't let us down.,They had an amazing insightnin terms of how to care for my mom,in the last four days of her life.,They brought her comfortnand relief from pain.,They knew to encourage my sister and Into put a pretty nightgown on my mom,,long after it mattered to her,,but it sure meant a lot to us.,And they knew to come and wake me upnjust in time for my mom's last breath.,And then they knewnhow long to leave me in the room,with my mother after she died. 
 I have no idea how they know these things,,but I do know that I am eternally grateful,that they've guided me once again. 
 Thank you so very much. 
 (Applause)I would like to tell younabout the most embarrassing thing,that has ever happened to me in my yearsnof working as a palliative care physician.,This happened a couple of years ago.,I was asked as a consultantnto see a woman in her 70s --,retired English professornwho had pancreatic cancer.,I was asked to see her becausenshe had pain, nausea, vomiting ...,When I went to see her,nwe talked about those symptoms,and in the course of that consultation,,she asked me whether I thoughtnthat medical marijuana might help her.,I thought back to everything,that I had learned in medical schoolnabout medical marijuana,,which didn't take very longnbecause I had learned absolutely nothing.,And so I told her that as far as I knew,,medical marijuananhad no benefits whatsoever.,And she smiled and nodded and reachedninto the handbag next to the bed,,and pulled out a stack of about a dozennrandomized controlled trials,showing that medicalnmarijuana has benefits,for symptoms like nauseanand pain and anxiety.,She handed me those articles and said,,"Maybe you should read thesenbefore offering an opinion ...,doctor." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I did.,That night I read all of those articlesnand found a bunch more.,When I came to see her the next morning,,I had to admit that it looks likenthere is some evidence,that marijuana can offer medical benefits,and I suggested that if shenreally was interested,,she should try it.,You know what she said?,This 73-year-old,nretired English professor?,She said, "I did try itnabout six months ago.,It was amazing.,I've been using it every day since.,It's the best drug I've discovered.,I don't know why it took me 73 yearsnto discover this stuff. It's amazing." 
 (Laughter) 
 That was the moment at which I realized,I needed to learn somethingnabout medical marijuana,because what I was prepared fornin medical school,bore no relationship to reality. 
 So I started reading more articles,nI started talking to researchers,,I started talking to doctors,,and most importantly,nI started listening to patients.,I ended up writing a booknbased on those conversations,,and that book really revolvednaround three surprises --,surprises to me, anyway.,One I already alluded to --,that there really are some benefitsnto medical marijuana.,Those benefits may not benas huge or as stunning,as some of the most avid proponentsnof medical marijuana,would have us believe,,but they are real.,Surprise number two:,medical marijuana does have some risks.,Those risks may not benas huge and as scary,as some of the opponents of medicalnmarijuana would have us believe,,but they are real risks, nonetheless.,But it was the third surprisenthat was most ...,surprising.,And that is that a lotnof the patients I talked with,who've turned to medicalnmarijuana for help,,weren't turning to medical marijuananbecause of its benefits,or the balance of risks and benefits,,or because they thoughtnit was a wonder drug,,but because it gave themncontrol over their illness.,It let them manage their health,in a way that was productive and efficient,and effective and comfortable for them. 
 To show you what I mean,nlet me tell you about another patient.,Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.,She looked thoughnlike she was in her late 60s.,She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritisnfor the last 20 years,,her hands were gnarled by arthritis,,her spine was crooked,,she had to relynon a wheelchair to get around.,She looked weak and frail,,and I guess physically she probably was,,but emotionally,ncognitively, psychologically,,she was among the toughestnpeople I've ever met.,And when I sat down next to her,in a medical marijuana dispensarynin Northern California,to ask her about why she turnednto medical marijuana,,what it did for her and how it helped her,,she started out by telling me things,that I had heardnfrom many patients before.,It helped with her anxiety;,it helped with her pain;,when her pain was better,nshe slept better.,And I'd heard all that before.,But then she said somethingnthat I'd never heard before,,and that is that it gave herncontrol over her life,and over her health.,She could use it when she wanted,,in the way that she wanted,,at the dose and frequencynthat worked for her.,And if it didn't work for her,nthen she could make changes.,Everything was up to her.,The most important thing she said,was she didn't neednanybody else's permission --,not a clinic appointment,nnot a doctor's prescription,,not a pharmacist's order.,It was all up to her.,She was in control. 
 And if that seems like a little thingnfor somebody with chronic illness,,it's not -- not at all.,When we face a chronic serious illness,,whether it's rheumatoid arthritisnor lupus or cancer or diabetes,,or cirrhosis,,we lose control.,And note what I said: "when," not "if.",All of us at some point in our livesnwill face a chronic serious illness,that causes us to lose control.,We'll see our function decline,nsome of us will see our cognition decline,,we'll be no longer ablento care for ourselves,,to do the things that we want to do.,Our bodies will betray us,,and in that process, we'll lose control.,And that's scary.,Not just scary -- that's frightening,,it's terrifying.,When I talk to my patients,nmy palliative care patients,,many of whom are facing illnessesnthat will end their lives,,they have a lot of be frightened of --,pain, nausea, vomiting,nconstipation, fatigue,,their impending mortality.,But what scares themnmore than anything else,is this possibility that at some point,,tomorrow or a month from now,,they're going to losencontrol of their health,,of their lives,,of their healthcare,,and they're going to becomendependent on others,,and that's terrifying. 
 So it's no wonder reallynthat patients like Robin,,who I just told you about,,who I met in that clinic,,turn to medical marijuana,to try to claw backnsome semblance of control.,How do they do it though?,How do these medicalnmarijuana dispensaries --,like the one where I met Robin --,how do they give patients like Robinnback the sort of control that they need?,And how do they do it,in a way that mainstreamnmedical hospitals and clinics,,at least for Robin, weren't able to?,What's their secret?,So I decided to find out. 
 I went to a seedy clinicnin Venice Beach in California,and got a recommendation,that would allow mento be a medical marijuana patient.,I got a letter of recommendationnthat would let me buy medical marijuana.,I got that recommendation illegally,,because I'm notna resident of California --,I should note that.,I should also note, for the record,,that I never used that letternof recommendation to make a purchase,,and to all of you DEA agents out there -- 
 (Laughter) 
 love the work that you're doing,,keep it up. 
 (Laughter) 
 Even though it didn't let menmake a purchase though,,that letter was pricelessnbecause it let me be a patient.,It let me experiencenwhat patients like Robin experience,when they go to a medicalnmarijuana dispensary.,And what I experienced --,what they experience every day,,hundreds of thousandsnof people like Robin --,was really amazing.,I walked into the clinic,,and from the moment that I enterednmany of these clinics and dispensaries,,I felt like that dispensary, that clinic,,was there for me.,There were questionsnat the outset about who I am,,what kind of work I do,,what my goals are in lookingnfor a medical marijuana prescription,,or product,,what my goals are,nwhat my preferences are,,what my hopes are,,how do I think, how do I hopenthis might help me,,what am I afraid of.,These are the sorts of questions,that patients like Robinnget asked all the time.,These are the sorts of questionsnthat make me confident,that the person I'm talking withnreally has my best interests at heart,and wants to get to know me. 
 The second thing I learnednin those clinics,is the availability of education.,Education from the folksnbehind the counter,,but also educationnfrom folks in the waiting room.,People I met were more than happy,nas I was sitting next to them --,people like Robin --,to tell me about who they are,nwhy they use medical marijuana,,what helps them, how it helps them,,and to give me advice and suggestions.,Those waiting rooms really arena hive of interaction, advice and support. 
 And third, the folks behind the counter.,I was amazed at how willingnthose people were,to spend sometimes an hour or morentalking me through the nuances,of this strain versus that strain,,smoking versus vaporizing,,edibles versus tinctures --,all, remember, without menmaking any purchase whatsoever.,Think about the last timenyou went to any hospital or clinic,and the last time anybody spent an hournexplaining those sorts of things to you.,The fact that patients like Robinnare going to these clinics,,are going to these dispensaries,and getting that sortnof personalized attention,and education and service,,really should be a wake-up callnto the healthcare system.,People like Robin are turning awaynfrom mainstream medicine,,turning to medical marijuana dispensaries,because those dispensariesnare giving them what they need. 
 If that's a wake-up callnto the medical establishment,,it's a wake-up call that manynof my colleagues are either not hearing,or not wanting to hear.,When I talk to my colleagues,nphysicians in particular,,about medical marijuana,,they say, "Oh, we need more evidence.,We need more research into benefits,nwe need more evidence about risks.",And you know what? They're right.,They're absolutely right.,We do need much more evidencenabout the benefits of medical marijuana.,We also need to ask the federal governmentnto reschedule marijuana to Schedule II,,or to deschedule it entirelynto make that research possible.,We also need more researchninto medical marijuana's risks.,Medical marijuana's risks --,we know a lot aboutnthe risks of recreational use,,we know next to nothingnabout the risks of medical marijuana.,So we absolutely do need research,,but to say that we need research,and not that we neednto make any changes now,is to miss the point entirely.,People like Robinnaren't seeking out medical marijuana,because they think it's a wonder drug,,or because they thinknit's entirely risk-free.,They seek it out because the contextnin which it's delivered and administered,and used,,gives them the sort of controlnthey need over their lives.,And that's a wake-up callnwe really need to pay attention to. 
 The good news though is thatnthere are lessons we can learn today,from those medical marijuana dispensaries.,And those are lessonsnwe really should learn.,These are often small,nmom-and-pop operations,run by people with no medical training.,And while it's embarrassing to think,that many of these clinicsnand dispensaries are providing services,and support and meeting patients' needs,in ways that billion-dollarnhealthcare systems aren't --,we should be embarrassed by that --,but we can also learn from that.,And there are probablynthree lessons at least,that we can learnnfrom those small dispensaries. 
 One: we need to find waysnto give patients more control,in small but important ways.,How to interact with healthcare providers,,when to interactnwith healthcare providers,,how to use medicationsnin ways that work for them.,In my own practice,,I've gotten much morencreative and flexible,in supporting my patientsnin using drugs safely,to manage their symptoms --,with the emphasis on safely.,Many of the drugs I prescribenare drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines,which can be dangerous if overused.,But here's the point.,They can be dangerous if they're overused,,but they can also be ineffectivenif they're not used in a way,that's consistent withnwhat patients want and need.,So that flexibility,nif it's delivered safely,,can be extraordinarily valuablenfor patients and their families.,That's number one. 
 Number two: education.,Huge opportunities,to learn from some of the tricksnof those medical marijuana dispensaries,to provide more education,that doesn't requirena lot of physician time necessarily,,or any physician time,,but opportunities to learnnabout what medications we're using,and why,,prognoses, trajectories of illness,,and most importantly,,opportunities for patientsnto learn from each other.,How can we replicate what goes on,in those clinic and medicalndispensary waiting rooms?,How patients learn from each other,nhow people share with each other. 
 And last but not least,,putting patients first the waynthose medical marijuana dispensaries do,,making patients feelnlegitimately like what they want,,what they need,,is why, as healthcare providers,,we're here.,Asking patients about their hopes,ntheir fears, their goals and preferences.,As a palliative care provider,,I ask all my patients what they'renhoping for and what they're afraid of.,But here's the thing.,Patients shouldn't have to waitnuntil they're chronically seriously ill,,often near the end of life,,they shouldn't have to waitnuntil they're seeing a physician like me,before somebody asks them,,"What are you hoping for?","What are you afraid of?",That should be baked into the waynthat healthcare is delivered. 
 We can do this --,we really can.,Medical marijuana dispensariesnand clinics all across the country,are figuring this out.,They're figuring this out,in ways that larger, more mainstreamnhealth systems are years behind.,But we can learn from them,,and we have to learn from them.,All we have to do is swallow our pride --,put aside the thought for a minute,that because we havenlots of letters after our name,,because we're experts,,because we're chief medical officersnof a large healthcare system,,we know all there is to knownabout how to meet patients' needs. 
 We need to swallow our pride.,We need to go visitna few medical marijuana dispensaries.,We need to figure out what they're doing.,We need to figure outnwhy so many patients like Robin,are leaving our mainstream medical clinics,and going to these medicalnmarijuana dispensaries instead.,We need to figure outnwhat their tricks are,,what their tools are,,and we need to learn from them.,If we do,,and I think we can,nand I absolutely think we have to,,we can guarantee all of our patientsnwill have a much better experience. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine,told the story of Clyde Murphy,,a black man who was a membernof the Class of 1970.,Clyde was a success story.,After Yale and a law degree from Columbia,,Clyde spent the next 30 years,as one of America'sntop civil rights lawyers.,He was also a great husband and father.,But despite his success,,personally and professionally,,Clyde's story had a sad ending. 
 In 2010,,at the age of 62,,Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.,Clyde's experience was not unique.,Many of his black classmates from Yale,also died young.,In fact, the magazine article indicated,that 41 years after graduation from Yale,,the black members of the Class of 1970,had a death ratenthat was three times higher,than that of the average class member.,It's stunning. 
 America has recently awakened,to a steady drumbeat,of unarmed black mennbeing shot by the police.,What is even a bigger story,is that every seven minutes,,a black person dies prematurelynin the United States.,That is over 200 black people,die every single day,who would not die if the healthnof blacks and whites were equal. 
 For the last 25 years,,I have been on a mission,to understand why does race,matter so profoundly for health.,When I started my career,,many believed that it was simplynabout racial differences,in income and education.,I discovered that whileneconomic status matters for health,,there is more to the story.,So for example, if we looknat life expectancy at age 25,,at age 25 there's a five-year gapnbetween blacks and whites.,And the gap by educationnfor both whites and blacks,is even larger than the racial gap.,At the same time,nat every level of education,,whites live longer than blacks.,So whites who are high school dropouts,live 3.4 years longernthan their black counterparts,,and the gap is even larger,among college graduates.,Most surprising of all,,whites who have graduated from high school,live longer than blacksnwith a college degree,or more education. 
 So why does race matternso profoundly for health?,What else is itnbeyond education and income,that might matter? 
 In the early 1990s,,I was asked to review a new book,on the health of black America.,I was struck that almost every single one,of its 25 chapters,said that racism,was a factor that was hurtingnthe health of blacks.,All of these researchers,were stating that racism was a factornadversely impacting blacks,,but they provided no evidence.,For me, that was not good enough. 
 A few months later,,I was speaking at a conferencenin Washington, DC,,and I said that onenof the priorities for research,was to document the waysnin which racism affected health.,A white gentleman stood in the audience,and said that while he agreednwith me that racism was important,,we could never measure racism.,"We measure self-esteem," I said.,"There's no reason,why we can't measure racismnif we put our minds to it." 
 And so I put my mind to it,and developed three scales.,The first one capturednmajor experiences of discrimination,,like being unfairly firednor being unfairly stopped by the police.,But discrimination also occursnin more minor and subtle experiences,,and so my second scale,ncalled the Everyday Discrimination Scale,,captures nine items,that captures experiences,like you're treatednwith less courtesy than others,,you receive poorer servicenthan others in restaurants or stores,,or people act as if they're afraid of you.,This scale captures,ways in which the dignity and the respect,of people who society does not value,is chipped away on a daily basis. 
 Research has found,that higher levels of discrimination,are associated with an elevated risknof a broad range of diseases,from blood pressure to abdominal obesity,to breast cancer to heart disease,and even premature mortality.,Strikingly, some of the effectsnare observed at a very young age.,For example, a study of black teens,found that those who reported highernlevels of discrimination as teenagers,had higher levels of stress hormones,,of blood pressure,and of weight at age 20.,However,,the stress of discrimination,is only one aspect. 
 Discrimination and racism,also matters in othernprofound ways for health.,For example, there'sndiscrimination in medical care.,In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine,asked me to serve on a committee,that found, concludednbased on the scientific evidence,,that blacks and other minorities,receive poorer quality care than whites.,This was true for all kindsnof medical treatment,,from the most simple,to the most technologically sophisticated.,One explanation for this pattern,was a phenomenonnthat's called "implicit bias",or "unconscious discrimination.",Research for decadesnby social psychologists,indicates that if you holdna negative stereotype,about a group in your subconscious mind,and you meet someone from that group,,you will discriminate against that person.,You will treat them differently.,It's an unconscious process.nIt's an automatic process.,It is a subtle process, but it's normal,and it occurs even amongnthe most well-intentioned individuals. 
 But the deeper that I delved,into the health impact of racism,,the more insidious the effects became.,There is institutional discrimination,,which refers to discrimination,that exists in the processesnof social institutions.,Residential segregation by race,,which has led to blacks and whites livingnin very different neighborhood contexts,,is a classic examplenof institutional racism.,One of America's best-kept secrets,is how residential segregation,is the secret source,that creates racial inequalitynin the United States.,In America, where you live,determines your access to opportunities,in education, in employment,,in housing and evennin access to medical care.,One study of the 171 largestncities in the United States,concluded that there is not even one city,where whites livenunder equal conditions to blacks,,and that the worst urban contextsnin which whites reside,is considerably better than the averagencontext of black communities.,Another study found,that if you could eliminate statistically,residential segregation,,you would completely erasenblack-white differences in income,,education and unemployment,,and reduce black-white differencesnin single motherhood,by two thirds,,all of that driven by segregation.,I have also learned,how the negative stereotypes,and images of blacks in our culture,literally create and sustain,both institutionalnand individual discrimination. 
 A group of researchersnhave put together a database,that contains the books,,magazines and articles,that an average college-educatednAmerican would read over their lifetime.,It allows us to look within this database,and see how Americansnhave seen words paired together,as they grow up in their society.,So when the word "black"nappears in American culture,,what co-occurs with it?,"Poor,","violent,","religious,","lazy,","cheerful,","dangerous.",When "white" occurs,,the frequently co-occurring words,are "wealthy,","progressive,","conventional,","stubborn,","successful,","educated.",So when a police officer,overreacts when he seesnan unarmed black male,and perceives himnto be violent and dangerous,,we are not necessarily dealingnwith an inherently bad cop.,We may be simply viewing,a normal American,who is reflectingnwhat he has been exposed to,as a result of being raised,in this society. 
 From my own experience,,I believe that your race,does not have to bena determinant of your destiny.,I migrated to the United States,from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia,in the late 1970s,in pursuit of higher education,,and in the last 40 years,,I have done well.,I have had a supportive family,,I have worked hard,,I have done well.,But it took more for me to be successful.,I received a minority fellowshipnfrom the University of Michigan.,Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.,Without affirmative action,,I would not be here. 
 But in the last 40 years,,black America has beennless successful than I have.,In 1978, black householdsnin the United States,earned 59 cents for every dollarnof income whites earned.,In 2015,,black families still earn 59 cents,for every dollar of incomenthat white families receive,,and the racial gaps in wealthnare even more stunning.,For every dollar of wealthnthat whites have,,black families have six penniesnand Latinos have seven pennies. 
 The fact is,,racism,is producing a truly rigged system,that is systematically disadvantagingnsome racial groups in the United States.,To paraphrase Plato,,there is nothing so unfair,as the equal treatment of unequal people.,And that's why I am committed,to working to dismantle racism. 
 I deeply appreciate the fact,that I am standing on the shoulders,of those who have sacrificedneven their lives to open the doors,that I have walked through.,I want to ensurenthat those doors remain open,and that everyonencan walk through those doors.,Robert Kennedy said,,"Each time a man" --nor woman, I would add --,"stands up for an ideal,or acts to improve the lot of others,or strikes out against injustice,,he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope,,and those ripples can build a current,that can sweep down the mightiest wallsnof oppression and resistance." 
 I am optimistic today,because all across America,,I have seen ripples of hope.,The Boston Medical Center,has added lawyers to the medical team,so that physicians can improventhe health of their patients,because the lawyers are addressingnthe nonmedical needs their patients have.,Loma Linda Universitynhas built a gateway college,in nearby San Bernardino,so that in additionnto delivering medical care,,they can provide job skills,and job training,to a predominantly minority,nlow-income community members,so that they will have the skillsnthey need to get a decent job.,In Chapel Hill, North Carolina,,the Abecedarian Project has figured out,how to ensure that they have lowerednthe risks for heart disease,for blacks in their mid-30s,by providing high-quality day care,from birth to age five.,In after-school centersnacross the United States,,Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy,is breaking the cycle of incarceration,by providing high-qualitynacademic enrichment and mentoring,to the children of prisoners,and children who havenfallen behind in school.,In Huntsville, Alabama,,Oakwood University,,a historically black institution,,is showing how we can improventhe health of black adults,by including a health evaluation,as a part of freshman orientation,and giving those studentsnthe tools they need,to make healthy choices,and providing them annuallyna health transcript,so they can monitor their progress.,And in Atlanta, Georgia,,Purpose Built Communities has dismantlednthe negative effects of segregation,by transforming a crime-ridden,,drug-infested public housing project,into an oasis of mixed-income housing,,of academic performance,,of great community wellness,and of full employment.,And finally,,there is the Devine solution.,Professor Patricia Devine,of the University of Wisconsin,has shown us how we can attack,our hidden biases head on,and effectively reduce them.,Each one of us,can be a ripple of hope. 
 This work will not always be easy,,but former Supreme Court JusticenThurgood Marshall,has told us, "We must dissent.,We must dissent from the indifference.,We must dissent from the apathy.,We must dissent from the hatrednand from the mistrust.,We must dissent,because America can do better,,because America has no choicenbut to do better." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was 10 years old when I learnednwhat the word "genocide" meant.,It was 2003,,and my people were being brutallynattacked because of their race --,hundreds of thousands murdered,,millions displaced,,a nation torn apart at the handsnof its own government. 
 My mother and father immediately begannspeaking out against the crisis.,I didn't really understand it,,except for the factnthat it was destroying my parents.,One day, I walked in on my mother crying,,and I asked her whynwe are burying so many people.,I don't remember the words that she chose,to describe genocide to hern10-year-old daughter,,but I remember the feeling.,We felt completely alone,,as if no one could hear us,,as if we were essentially invisible. 
 This is when I wrotenmy first poem about Darfur.,I wrote poetry to convince peoplento hear and see us,,and that's how I learnednthe thing that changed me.,It's easy to be seen.,I mean, look at me -- I'm a youngnAfrican woman with a scarf around my head,,an American accent on my tongue,and a story that makes even the mostnbrutal of Monday mornings seem inviting.,But it's hard to convince peoplenthat they deserve to be seen.,I learned this in my high schoolnclassroom one day,,when my teacher asked mento give a presentation about Darfur.,I was setting up the projectornwhen a classmate of mine said,,"Why do you have to talk about this?,Can't you think about usnand how it will make us feel?" 
 (Laughter) 
 My 14-year-old self didn't knownwhat to say to her,,or how to explain the painnthat I felt in that moment,,and in every moment that we were forcednnot to talk about "this.",Her words took me back to the daysnand nights on the ground in Darfur,,where we were forced to remain silent;,where we didn't speak over morning tea,because the warplanes overheadnwould swallow any and all noise;,back to the days when we were told,not only that we don'tndeserve to be heard,but that we do not have a right to exist.,And this is where the magic happened,,in that classroom when all the studentsnstarted taking their seats,and I began to speak,,despite this renewed feelingnthat I didn't deserve to be there,,that I didn't belong there,or have a right to break the silence. 
 As I talked,,and my classmates listened,,the fear ebbed away.,My mind became calm,,and I felt safe.,It was the sound of our grieving,,the feel of their arms around me,,the steady walls that held us together.,It felt nothing like a vacuum. 
 I choose poetry because it's so visceral.,When someone is standing in front of you,nmind, body and soul,,saying "Witness me,",it's impossible not to becomenkeenly aware of your own humanity.,This changed everything for me.,It gave me courage.,Every day I experiencenthe power of witness,,and because of that, I am whole.,And so now I ask:,Will you witness me? 
 They hand me the microphone,as my shoulders sinknunder the weight of this stress. 
 The woman says,,"The one millionth refugeenjust left South Sudan.,Can you comment?" 
 I feel my feet rock back and forthnon the heels my mother bought, 
 begging the question: 
 Do we stay, or is it safernto choose flight? 
 My mind echoes the numbers: 
 one million gone, 
 two million displaced, 
 400,000 dead in Darfur. 
 And this lump takes over my throat, 
 as if each of those bodiesnjust found a grave 
 right here in my esophagus. 
 Our once country, 
 all north and south and east and west, 
 so restless the Nile couldn'tnhold us together, 
 and you ask me to summarize. 
 They talk about the numbersnas if this isn't still happening, 
 as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria, 
 as if 3,000 aren't still makingntheir final stand 
 at the bottom of the Mediterranean, 
 as if there aren't entire volumesnfull of fact sheets about our genocides, 
 and now they want me to write one. 
 Fact: 
 we never talked over breakfast, 
 because the warplanesnwould swallow our voices. 
 Fact: 
 my grandfather didn't want to leave home, 
 so he died in a war zone. 
 Fact: 
 a burning bush without God is just a fire. 
 I measure the distance between what I know 
 and what is safe to say on a microphone. 
 Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement? 
 Do I mention the violence, 
 how it's never as simplenas what you see on TV, 
 how there are weeks' worth of fearnbefore the camera is on? 
 Do I tell her about our bodies, 
 how they are 60 percent water, 
 but we still burn like driftwood, 
 making fuel of our sacrifice? 
 Do I tell her the men died first,nmothers forced to watch the slaughter? 
 That they came for our children, 
 scattering them across the continentnuntil our homes sank? 
 That even castles sinknat the bite of the bomb? 
 Do I talk about the elderly,,our heroes, 
 too weak to run, too expensive to shoot, 
 how they would march them, 
 hands raised, rifles at their backs,,into the fire? 
 How their walking sticksnkept the flames alive? 
 It feels too harsh for a bundle of wiresnand an audience to swallow. 
 Too relentless, 
 like the valley that fillednwith the putrid smoke of our deaths. 
 Is it better in verse? 
 Can a stanza become a burial shroud? 
 Will it sting less if I say it softly? 
 If you don't see me cry,nwill you listen better? 
 Will the pain leavenwhen the microphone does? 
 Why does every word feelnas if I'm saying my last? 
 Thirty seconds for the sound bite, 
 and now three minutes for the poem. 
 My tongue goes dry the same way we died, 
 becoming ash, having never been coal. 
 I feel my left leg go numb, 
 and I realize that I locked my knees,,bracing for impact. 
 I never wear shoes I can't run in. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So, I wanted to leave on a positive note,,because that's the paradoxnthat this life has been:,in the places where I learnednto cry the most,,I also learned how to smile after.,So, here goes. 
 "You Have a Big Imagination,or,400,000 Ways to Cry." 
 For Zeinab. 
 I am a sad girl, 
 but my face makes other plans, 
 focusing energy on this smile,nso as not to waste it on pain. 
 The first thing they took was my sleep, 
 eyes heavy but wide open, 
 thinking maybe I missed something, 
 maybe the cavalry is still coming. 
 They didn't come, 
 so I bought bigger pillows. 
 (Laughter) 
 My grandmother could cure anything 
 by talking the life out of it. 
 And she said that I could makena thief in a silo laugh,in the middle of our raging war. 
 War makes a broken marriage bednout of sorrow. 
 You want nothing more than to disappear, 
 but your heart can't salvagenenough remnants to leave. 
 But joy -- 
 joy is the armor we carried acrossnthe borders of our broken homeland. 
 A hasty mix of stories and faces,that lasts long after the flavor is gone. 
 A muscle memory that overcomesneven the most bitter of times, 
 my memory is spotted withndays of laughing until I cried, 
 or crying until I laughed. 
 Laughter and tears are bothninvoluntary human reactions, 
 testaments to our capacity for expression. 
 So allow me to express 
 that if I make you laugh,,it's usually on purpose. 
 And if I make you cry,,I'll still think you are beautiful. 
 This is for my cousin Zeinab, 
 bedridden on a random afternoon. 
 I hadn't seen her since the last timenwe were in Sudan together, 
 and there I was at her hospital bedside 
 in a 400-year-old building in France. 
 Zeinab wanted to hear poems. 
 Suddenly, English, Arabicnand French were not enough. 
 Every word I knew became empty noise, 
 and Zeinab said, "Well, get on with it." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I read her everything that I could,,and we laughed,,and we loved it, 
 and it was the most important stagenthat I've ever stood on, 
 surrounded by family, 
 by remnants of a people who were givennas a dowry to a relentless war 
 but still managednto make pearls of this life; 
 by the ones who taught mento not only laugh, 
 but to live in the face of death; 
 who placed their hands across the sky, 
 measuring the distance to the sunnand saying, "Smile;,I'm gonna meet you there." 
 And for Zeinab -- 
 Zeinab, who taught me lovenin a place like France, 
 Zeinab, who wanted to he.arnpoems on her deathbed -- 
 Dilated fibromyalgia. 
 Her heart muscles expanded,until they couldn't function. 
 And she held me,nand she made me feel like gold. 
 And I said, "Zeinab, 
 isn't it strange that your only problem 
 is that your heart was too big?" 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Here's a question for you:,how many different scentsndo you think you can smell,,and maybe even identify with accuracy?,100?,300?,1,000?,One study estimates that humans canndetect up to one trillion different odors.,A trillion.,It's hard to imagine,,but your nose has the molecularnmachinery to make it happen. 
 Olfactory receptors --,tiny scent detectors --,are packed into your nose,,each one patiently waitingnto be activated by the odor,,or ligand,,that it's been assigned to detect.,It turns out we humans,nlike all vertebrates,,have lots of olfactory receptors.,In fact, more of our DNA is devotednto genes for different olfactory receptors,than for any other type of protein. 
 Why is that?,Could olfactory receptorsnbe doing something else,in addition to allowing us to smell? 
 In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axelnuncovered the molecular identity,of olfactory receptors --,work which ultimatelynled to a Nobel Prize.,At the time,,we all assumed that these receptorsnwere only found in the nose.,However, about a year or so later,,a report emerged of an olfactorynreceptor expressed in a tissue,other than the nose.,And then another such report emerged,,and another.,We now know that these receptorsnare found all over the body,,including in some prettynunexpected places --,in muscle,,in kidneys,,lungs,and blood vessels. 
 But what are they doing there?,Well, we know that olfactory receptorsnact as sensitive chemical sensors,in the nose --,that's how they mediatenour sense of smell.,It turns out they also actnas sensitive chemical sensors,in many other parts of the body.,Now, I'm not saying that your liver canndetect the aroma of your morning coffee,as you walk into the kitchen.,Rather, after you drinknyour morning coffee,,your liver might use an olfactory receptor,to chemically detectnthe change in concentration,of a chemical floatingnthrough your bloodstream. 
 Many cell types and tissues in the bodynuse chemical sensors,,or chemosensors,,to keep track of the concentrationnof hormones, metabolites,and other molecules,,and some of these chemosensorsnare olfactory receptors.,If you are a pancreas or a kidney,and you need a specialized chemical sensor,that will allow you to keep tracknof a specific molecule,,why reinvent the wheel? 
 One of the first examples,of an olfactory receptornfound outside the nose,showed that human spermnexpress an olfactory receptor,,and that sperm with this receptornwill seek out the chemical,that the receptor responds to --,the receptor's ligand.,That is, the spermnwill swim toward the ligand.,This has intriguing implications.,Are sperm aided in finding the egg,by sniffing out the areanwith the highest ligand concentration? 
 I like this examplenbecause it clearly demonstrates,that an olfactory receptor's primary jobnis to be a chemical sensor,,but depending on the context,,it can influence how you perceive a smell,,or in which direction sperm will swim,,and as it turns out,,a huge variety of other processes.,Olfactory receptors have beennimplicated in muscle cell migration,,in helping the lung to sensenand respond to inhaled chemicals,,and in wound healing. 
 Similarly, taste receptors once thoughtnto be found only in the tongue,,are now known to be expressednin cells and tissues throughout the body.,Even more surprisingly,,a recent study found,that the light receptors in our eyesnalso play a role in our blood vessels. 
 In my lab,,we work on trying to understand the rolesnof olfactory receptors and taste receptors,in the context of the kidney.,The kidney is a centralncontrol center for homeostasis.,And to us,,it makes sense that a homeostaticncontrol center would be a logical place,to employ chemical sensors.,We've identified a numbernof different olfactory and taste receptors,in the kidney,,one of which, olfactory receptor 78,,is known to be expressednin cells and tissues,that are importantnin the regulation of blood pressure.,When this receptor is deleted in mice,,their blood pressure is low.,Surprisingly, this receptornwas found to respond,to chemicals callednshort-chain fatty acids,that are produced by the bacterianthat reside in your gut --,your gut microbiota.,After being producednby your gut microbiota,,these chemicals are absorbedninto your bloodstream,where they can thenninteract with receptors,like olfactory receptor 78,,meaning that the changesnin metabolism of your gut microbiota,may influence your blood pressure. 
 Although we've identified a numbernof different olfactory and taste receptors,in the kidney,,we've only just begunnto tease out their different functions,and to figure out which chemicalsneach of them responds to.,Similar investigations lie aheadnfor many other organs and tissues --,only a small minority of receptorsnhas been studied to date.,This is exciting stuff.,It's revolutionizing our understandingnof the scope of influence,for one of the five senses.,And it has the potentialnto change our understanding,of some aspects of human physiology.,It's still early,,but I think we've picked up on the scentnof something we're following. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A few days after my husband Paulnwas diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,,we were lying in our bed at home,,and Paul said,,"It's going to be OK.",And I remember answering back,,"Yes.,We just don't know what OK means yet." 
 Paul and I had met as first-yearnmedical students at Yale.,He was smart and kind and super funny.,He used to keep a gorilla suitnin the trunk of his car,,and he'd say, "It's for emergencies only." 
 (Laughter) 
 I fell in love with Paul as I watchednthe care he took with his patients.,He stayed late talking with them,,seeking to understandnthe experience of illness,and not just its technicalities.,He later told me he fell in love with me,when he saw me cry over an EKGnof a heart that had ceased beating.,We didn't know it yet,,but even in the heady days of young love,,we were learning hownto approach suffering together. 
 We got married and became doctors.,I was working as an internist,and Paul was finishing his trainingnas a neurosurgeon,when he started to lose weight.,He developed excruciating back painnand a cough that wouldn't go away.,And when he was admitted to the hospital,,a CT scan revealed tumorsnin Paul's lungs and in his bones.,We had both cared for patientsnwith devastating diagnoses;,now it was our turn. 
 We lived with Paul's illnessnfor 22 months.,He wrote a memoir about facing mortality.,I gave birth to our daughter Cady,,and we loved her and each other.,We learned directly how to strugglenthrough really tough medical decisions.,The day we took Paulninto the hospital for the last time,was the most difficult day of my life.,When he turned to me at the end,and said, "I'm ready,",I knew that wasn't just a brave decision.,It was the right one.,Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.,In that moment,,the most important thing to Paul,was to hold our baby daughter.,Nine hours later,,Paul died. 
 I've always thought of myselfnas a caregiver --,most physicians do --,and taking care of Paulndeepened what that meant.,Watching him reshapenhis identity during his illness,,learning to witness and accept his pain,,talking together through his choices --,those experiences taught me,that resilience does not meannbouncing back to where you were before,,or pretending thatnthe hard stuff isn't hard.,It is so hard.,It's painful, messy stuff.,But it's the stuff.,And I learned that when wenapproach it together,,we get to decide what success looks like. 
 One of the first thingsnPaul said to me after his diagnosis was,,"I want you to get remarried.",And I was like, whoa, I guessnwe get to say anything out loud. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was so shocking,and heartbreaking ...,and generous,,and really comforting,because it was so starkly honest,,and that honesty turned outnto be exactly what we needed.,Early in Paul's illness,,we agreed we wouldnjust keep saying things out loud.,Tasks like making a will,,or completing our advance directives --,tasks that I had always avoided --,were not as daunting as they once seemed.,I realized that completingnan advance directive is an act of love --,like a wedding vow.,A pact to take care of someone,,codifying the promise,that til death do us part,,I will be there.,If needed, I will speak for you.,I will honor your wishes.,That paperwork becamena tangible part of our love story. 
 As physicians,,Paul and I were in a good position,to understand and evennaccept his diagnosis.,We weren't angry about it,,luckily,,because we'd seen so many patientsnin devastating situations,,and we knew that death is a part of life.,But it's one thing to know that;,it was a very different experience,to actually live with the sadnessnand uncertainty of a serious illness.,Huge strides are being madenagainst lung cancer,,but we knew that Paul likely hadnmonths to a few years left to live. 
 During that time,,Paul wrote about his transitionnfrom doctor to patient.,He talked about feelingnlike he was suddenly at a crossroads,,and how he would have thoughtnhe'd be able to see the path,,that because he treated so many patients,,maybe he could follow in their footsteps.,But he was totally disoriented.,Rather than a path,,Paul wrote,,"I saw instead,only a harsh, vacant,ngleaming white desert.,As if a sandstormnhad erased all familiarity.,I had to face my mortality,and try to understandnwhat made my life worth living,,and I needed my oncologist'snhelp to do so." 
 The clinicians taking care of Paul,gave me an even deeper appreciationnfor my colleagues in health care.,We have a tough job.,We're responsible for helping patientsnhave clarity around their prognoses,and their treatment options,,and that's never easy,nbut it's especially tough,when you're dealing with potentiallynterminal illnesses like cancer.,Some people don't want to knownhow long they have left,,others do.,Either way, we never have those answers.,Sometimes we substitute hope,by emphasizing the best-case scenario.,In a survey of physicians,,55 percent saidnthey painted a rosier picture,than their honest opinion,when describing a patient's prognosis.,It's an instinct born out of kindness.,But researchers have found,that when people better understandnthe possible outcomes of an illness,,they have less anxiety,,greater ability to plan,and less trauma for their families. 
 Families can strugglenwith those conversations,,but for us, we also found that informationnimmensely helpful with big decisions.,Most notably,,whether to have a baby.,Months to a few years meantnPaul was not likely to see her grow up.,But he had a good chancenof being there for her birth,and for the beginning of her life.,I remember asking Paul,if he thought havingnto say goodbye to a child,would make dying even more painful.,And his answer astounded me.,He said,,"Wouldn't it be great if it did?",And we did it.,Not in order to spite cancer,,but because we were learning,that living fullynmeans accepting suffering. 
 Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo,so he could continuenworking as a neurosurgeon,,which initially we thoughtnwas totally impossible.,When the cancer advanced,and Paul shifted from surgery to writing,,his palliative care doctornprescribed a stimulant medication,so he could be more focused.,They asked Paul aboutnhis priorities and his worries.,They asked him what trade-offsnhe was willing to make.,Those conversationsnare the best way to ensure,that your health care matches your values.,Paul joked that it's notnlike that "birds and bees" talk,you have with your parents,,where you all get it over withnas quickly as possible,,and then pretend it never happened.,You revisit the conversationnas things change.,You keep saying things out loud.,I'm forever grateful,because Paul's clinicians felt,that their job wasn't to trynto give us answers they didn't have,,or only to try to fix things for us,,but to counsel Paulnthrough painful choices ...,when his body was failingnbut his will to live wasn't. 
 Later, after Paul died,,I received a dozen bouquets of flowers,,but I sent just one ...,to Paul's oncologist,,because she supported his goals,and she helped him weigh his choices.,She knew that livingnmeans more than just staying alive. 
 A few weeks ago,na patient came into my clinic.,A woman dealingnwith a serious chronic disease.,And while we were talkingnabout her life and her health care,,she said, "I love my palliative care team.,They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'.",Yeah, I thought, of course it is.,But many patients don't feel that.,Compassion and Choices did a study,where they asked peoplenabout their health care preferences.,And a lot of peoplenstarted their answers with the words,"Well, if I had a choice ...",If I had a choice.,And when I read that "if,",I understood better,why one in four people,receives excessive or unwantednmedical treatment,,or watches a family member receivenexcessive or unwanted medical treatment.,It's not because doctors don't get it.,We do.,We understand the realnpsychological consequences,on patients and their families.,The things is, we deal with them, too.,Half of critical care nursesnand a quarter of ICU doctors,have considered quitting their jobs,because of distress over feelingnthat for some of their patients,,they've provided carenthat didn't fit with the person's values.,But doctors can't make surenyour wishes are respected,until they know what they are. 
 Would you want to be on life supportnif it offered any chance of longer life?,Are you most worriednabout the quality of that time,,rather than quantity?,Both of those choicesnare thoughtful and brave,,but for all of us, it's our choice.,That's true at the end of life,and for medical care throughout our lives.,If you're pregnant,ndo you want genetic screening?,Is a knee replacement right or not?,Do you want to do dialysisnin a clinic or at home?,The answer is:,it depends.,What medical care will help younlive the way you want to?,I hope you remember that question,the next time you facena decision in your health care.,Remember that you always have a choice,,and it is OK to say no to a treatmentnthat's not right for you. 
 There's a poem by W.S. Merwin --,it's just two sentences long --,that captures how I feel now.,"Your absence has gone through me,like thread through a needle.,Everything I donis stitched with its color.",For me that poem evokes my love for Paul,,and a new fortitude,that came from loving and losing him. 
 When Paul said, "It's going to be OK,",that didn't meannthat we could cure his illness.,Instead, we learned to acceptnboth joy and sadness at the same time;,to uncover beauty and purpose,both despite and because we are all born,and we all die.,And for all the sadnessnand sleepless nights,,it turns out there is joy.,I leave flowers on Paul's grave,and watch our two-year-oldnrun around on the grass.,I build bonfires on the beachnand watch the sunset with our friends.,Exercise and mindfulnessnmeditation have helped a lot.,And someday,,I hope I do get remarried. 
 Most importantly,nI get to watch our daughter grow.,I've thought a lotnabout what I'm going to say to her,when she's older.,"Cady,,engaging in the fullnrange of experience --,living and dying,,love and loss --,is what we get to do.,Being human doesn't happenndespite suffering.,It happens within it.,When we approach suffering together,,when we choose not to hide from it,,our lives don't diminish,,they expand." 
 I've learned that cancernisn't always a battle.,Or if it is,,maybe it's a fight for somethingndifferent than we thought.,Our job isn't to fight fate,,but to help each other through.,Not as soldiers,but as shepherds.,That's how we make it OK,,even when it's not.,By saying it out loud,,by helping each other through ...,and a gorilla suit never hurts, either. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The best Christmas my children ever had,was also the worst Christmasnmy husband and I ever had.,Elizabeth, age seven,,and her brother, Ian, age five,,couldn't imagine why they were gettingneverything they wanted for Christmas.,The reason Santa was so generous,was because of somethingnmy husband Pat and I knew,and the kids couldn't comprehend.,Something that we had just learned,nand it terrified us. 
 This was 1994,and the story actually startsna few years earlier.,For a couple of years I had noticedna rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck,that looked like prickly heat.,For those same years,nmy father and brother both died of cancer,,and I was probablynoveranxious about illness.,The doctors assured usnthere was nothing wrong,and I shouldn't worry,,but I wasn't so sure.,And so without a referral,nand paying out-of-pocket,,I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.,She was probablynjust allergic to something,,but why did it appearnjust on the sides of her neck, this rash? 
 So it's two days before Christmas,,1994,,and the dermatologistntakes a quick look at her neck and says,,"She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum.",And then he shuts off the lightsnand looks in her eyes.,It turns out, by chance,,this dermatologistnalso trained in ophthalmology.,Our lucky day.,I am sick to my stomach.,"Oma?",Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma --,cancer.,"Why are you lookingnin her eyes for a skin rash?",I scream and make no sound. 
 So there it is.,Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum,,PXE for short.,Questions mix with fear,and erupt like bile in my throat.,Why are you looking in her eyes?,What do you know about this?nHow do you know for sure?,What is the prognosis?,My training in pastoral counselingndid not prepare me for this. 
 Dr. Bercovitch tells usneverything he knows about PXE.,It's a rare genetic disorder,,it's systemic,,it's a slowly progressing,npremature aging disease.,It causes loose wrinkly skinnin the flexor areas.,It causes legal blindness,,like macular degeneration,,and a host of cardiovascular problems.,Little is known about this disease,,and some people die in their 30s,,say some of the reports at the time.,He then just glances at our son and says,,"He has it, too.",We want to fleenback to the land of normal. 
 Two days after Christmas,,researchers comenfrom a university in Boston,,and they take bloodnfrom us and our children,for a research projectnfocused on finding the gene.,A few days later,,researchers comenfrom a medical center in New York,and say they want blood, too.,"These are children.,They're five and seven years old.,Don't make them face the needle twice.,Go and get your sharenfrom the other researchers.",They laugh, incredulous.,"Share?",It is then that we learn that therenis little sharing in biomedical research. 
 This moment, more than any other,,lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.,Pat and I went to a medical school library,and we copied every articlenwe could find on PXE.,We didn't understand a thing.,We bought medical dictionariesnand scientific textbooks,and read everythingnwe could get our hands on.,And though we still didn't understand,,we could see patterns,,and it became quicklynapparent within a month,that there was no systematic effortnto understand PXE. 
 In addition,,the lack of sharingnthat we experienced was pervasive.,Researchers competed with each other,because the ecosystemnwas designed to reward competition,rather than to alleviate suffering.,We realized that we would have to donwork on this condition ourselves,to find solutionsnfor ourselves and others like us.,But we faced two major barriers.,The first one:,Pat and I have no science background.,At the time, he's the managernof a construction company,,and I'm a former college chaplainnstay-at-home mom --,hardly the backgroundsnto take the research world by storm.,The second barrier:,researchers don't share.,People told us you can't herd cats.,Well, yes you can if you move their food. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 DNA and clinical data is the food.,So we would collect bloodnand medical histories,,and require that all scientistsnusing these resources,would share results with each othernand with the people who donated. 
 Well before the internetnwas in common use,,Pat and I established PXE International,,a nonprofit dedicated to initiatingnresearch and conducting it on PXE,and also supportingnindividuals with the disease.,Using traditional media,,we garnered aroundn100-150 people around the world,who we asked,,would you give us your blood,nyour tissue, your medical histories,,your medical records?,And we brought all of that together. 
 We quickly learned that this sharednresource was not going to be enough.,And so we decided we hadnto do hardcore bench science --,hardcore research.,So we borrowed bench spacenat a lab at Harvard.,A wonderful neighborncame a couple times a week,and sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am,while Pat and I extracted DNA,,ran and scored gels,and searched for the gene.,Generous postdocsntutored us as we went along.,Within a few years, we found the gene.,We patented it so thatnit would be freely available.,We created a diagnostic test.,We put together a research consortium.,We held research meetingsnand opened a center of excellence.,We found more than 4,000 peoplenaround the world who had PXE,,and held patient meetings,and did clinical trials and studies. 
 Through all this,,we lived with fear.,Fear of the diseasenbreathing down our neck,while the clock ticked.,Fear of researchers,,so well credentialed and positionednin a world made for them.,Fear that we were makingnthe wrong choices.,Fear that the naysayers were right,and the cats would simply find a new food.,But greater than all these fearsnwas our drive to make a difference,for our kids and for all thosenwe had met along the way.,And very quickly,,we also realized what wenwere doing for one disease,,we should do for all diseases. 
 We joined with, and I eventually led,,Genetic Alliance --,a network of health advocacy,,patient advocacy,,research and health organizations.,We built scalablenand extensible resources,,like biobanks and registriesnand directories of support,for all diseases.,And as I learned about all those diseasesnand all those disease communities,,I realized that there werentwo secrets in health care,that were impacting me greatly.,The first:,there are no ready answersnfor people like my kids,or all the people I was working with,,whether common or rare conditions.,And the second secret:,the answers lie in all of us together,,donating our data,,our biological samples,and ultimately ourselves. 
 There is a smallngroundswell of individuals,who are working to change this.,Citizen scientists, activists, hacks,who are using crowdsourcing,ndo-it-yourself science,are changing the game.,Even President Obamanand Vice President Biden,are evangelists for the idea,that people should benpartners in research.,This is a founding principlenof our organization.,Sure, it's really hard,to discover and developninterventions and therapies.,The science is hard,,the regulatory regime is difficult.,There are a lot of stakeholdersnwith lots of interests,and misaligned incentivesnlike publishing, promotion and tenure.,I don't fault scientistsnfor following this path,,but I challenge them and usnto do this differently.,To recognize that peoplenare at the center. 
 Genetic Alliance has experimented,in what it will takento transform these crusty systems.,Our goal is to work without boundaries.,That sounds abstract,nbut for us it's quite practical.,When we're frustratednthat entities won't share data --,data that comes from people who gaventheir energy, their time, their blood,and even their tears --,we need to stop and ask,,"How is it true that wencould share, but we aren't?",We're part of this system, too.,How do we make itnso that people can share ideas freely?,So that people can take risksnand move closer to one another? 
 This leads to a dissolvingnof us versus them,,not only for organizationsnbut also for individuals.,If I'm going to asknorganizations or individuals,to strive for these standards,,then I too need to explorenmy own being and my practices.,If I'm going to ask cliniciansnand researchers and administrators,to take risks,,then I, Sharon,nneed to take risks as well.,I need to face my personal fears.,My fear of not having enough impact.,My fear of not leading well.,My fear of not being enough. 
 Just before they entered their teens,nour kids stopped us in our tracks,and said, "You have to stop worryingnabout making a difference,,making an impact,,and instead, like us,nlearn to live with disease,rather than fight it.",I have to ask,,where does all my fear come from?,The kids' declarationnshines a spotlight on that fear.,It arises from a bedrock of love.,I love Elizabeth and Ian.,I love people with PXE.,I love people with any disease.,I love people.,Some of my colleagues have discoverednthat it is not death we fear,,it is the enormity of our loving.,This expansive love opens me to great pain,as I face loss. 
 As I discover my fear,,I discover that I,and all those around me,have boundless capacity for love.,And I also discover,as I move into this fear,,that I can learn many new things,and find paths,to things like practical solutions,as well as the core of healing and health. 
 I don't fear fear the way I used to.,In fact lately, with enormous supportnfrom all my fellow journeyers,,I notice that it's not a warningnthe way it used to be.,I notice that instead,,it's an invitation to go forward,because in it lies lovenand the path to greater love.,If I turn with gentle curiosityntoward that fear,,I find enormous wealthnwithin myself and others,and the ability to step into challengesnthat I never thought I could. 
 My kids are ahead of menon that path still.,At ages 29 and 27,,they declare they are happy and healthy,despite having manifestations of PXEnin their skin and eyes and arteries.,And so I invite you, us, we,,to turn toward our fear;,to embrace the things that scare us,and find the love at the center.,We'll not only find ourselves there,but we'll also be ablento step into the shoes of those we fear,and those who fear us.,If we breathe into that fear,and are vulnerable with the systemsnand people who challenge us,,our power as changemakersngrows exponentially.,And when we realize,that working on our inner lifenis working on our outer life,and outer work is inner work,,we get down to what is real,and shit gets done. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is no limitnto what we can accomplish together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The last time I heard my son's voice,was when he walked out the front door,on his way to school.,He called out one word in the darkness:,"Bye." 
 It was April 20, 1999.,Later that morning,nat Columbine High School,,my son Dylan and his friend Eric,killed 12 students and a teacher,and wounded more than 20 othersnbefore taking their own lives.,Thirteen innocent people were killed,,leaving their loved onesnin a state of grief and trauma.,Others sustained injuries,,some resulting in disfigurementnand permanent disability.,But the enormity of the tragedy,can't be measured only by the numbernof deaths and injuries that took place.,There's no way to quantifynthe psychological damage,of those who were in the school,,or who took partnin rescue or cleanup efforts.,There's no way to assessnthe magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine,,especially when it can be a blueprint,for other shooters who go onnto commit atrocities of their own.,Columbine was a tidal wave,,and when the crash ended,,it would take yearsnfor the community and for society,to comprehend its impact. 
 It has taken me yearsnto try to accept my son's legacy.,The cruel behaviornthat defined the end of his life,showed me that he was a completelyndifferent person from the one I knew.,Afterwards people asked,,"How could you not know?,What kind of a mother were you?",I still ask myself those same questions. 
 Before the shootings,nI thought of myself as a good mom.,Helping my children become caring,,healthy, responsible adults,was the most important role of my life.,But the tragedy convinced menthat I failed as a parent,,and it's partially this sense of failurenthat brings me here today.,Aside from his father,,I was the one personnwho knew and loved Dylan the most.,If anyone could have knownnwhat was happening,,it should have been me, right?,But I didn't know. 
 Today, I'm here to share the experience,of what it's like to be the mothernof someone who kills and hurts.,For years after the tragedy,nI combed through memories,,trying to figure outnexactly where I failed as a parent.,But there are no simple answers.,I can't give you any solutions.,All I can do,is share what I have learned. 
 When I talk to peoplenwho didn't know me before the shootings,,I have three challenges to meet.,First, when I walk into a room like this,,I never know if someone therenhas experienced loss,because of what my son did.,I feel a need to acknowledge the sufferingncaused by a member of my family,who isn't here to do it for himself.,So first, with all of my heart,,I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain. 
 The second challenge I have,is that I must ask for understandingnand even compassion,when I talk aboutnmy son's death as a suicide.,Two years before he died,,he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook,that he was cutting himself.,He said that he was in agony,and wanted to get a gunnso he could end his life.,I didn't know about any of thisnuntil months after his death.,When I talk about his death as a suicide,,I'm not trying to downplay the viciousnessnhe showed at the end of his life.,I'm trying to understand,how his suicidal thinking,led to murder.,After a lot of readingnand talking with experts,,I have come to believe,that his involvement in the shootingsnwas rooted not in his desire to kill,but in his desire to die. 
 The third challenge I havenwhen I talk about my son's murder-suicide,is that I'm talking about mental health --,excuse me --,is that I'm talking about mental health,,or brain health, as I prefer to call it,nbecause it's more concrete.,And in the same breath,nI'm talking about violence.,The last thing I want to donis to contribute to the misunderstanding,that already exists around mental illness.,Only a very small percent of thosenwho have a mental illness,are violent toward other people,,but of those who die by suicide,,it's estimated that about 75nto maybe more than 90 percent,have a diagnosablenmental health condition of some kind.,As you all know very well,,our mental health care systemnis not equipped to help everyone,,and not everyone with destructive thoughts,fits the criteria,for a specific diagnosis.,Many who have ongoing feelings,of fear or anger or hopelessness,are never assessed or treated.,Too often, they get our attentionnonly if they reach a behavioral crisis.,If estimates are correct,that about onento two percent of all suicides,involves the murder of another person,,when suicide rates rise,nas they are rising for some populations,,the murder-suicide ratesnwill rise as well. 
 I wanted to understand what was going onnin Dylan's mind prior to his death,,so I looked for answersnfrom other survivors of suicide loss.,I did research and volunteerednto help with fund-raising events,,and whenever I could,,I talked with those who hadnsurvived their own suicidal crisis,or attempt. 
 One of the most helpfulnconversations I had,was with a coworker,who overheard me talking to someone else,in my office cubicle.,She heard me saynthat Dylan could not have loved me,if he could do somethingnas horrible as he did.,Later, when she found me alone,,she apologized for overhearingnthat conversation,,but told me that I was wrong.,She said that when she wasna young, single mother,with three small children,,she became severely depressednand was hospitalized to keep her safe.,At the time, she was certain,that her childrennwould be better off if she died,,so she had made a plan to end her life.,She assured me that a mother's lovenwas the strongest bond on Earth,,and that she loved her childrennmore than anything in the world,,but because of her illness,,she was sure that theynwould be better off without her. 
 What she said and whatnI've learned from others,is that we do not makenthe so-called decision or choice,to die by suicide,in the same waynthat we choose what car to drive,or where to go on a Saturday night.,When someone isnin an extremely suicidal state,,they are in a stage fournmedical health emergency.,Their thinking is impaired and they'venlost access to tools of self-governance.,Even though they cannmake a plan and act with logic,,their sense of truthnis distorted by a filter of pain,through which theyninterpret their reality.,Some people can be very goodnat hiding this state,,and they often havengood reasons for doing that.,Many of us havensuicidal thoughts at some point,,but persistent,nongoing thoughts of suicide,and devising a means to die,are symptoms of pathology,,and like many illnesses,,the condition has to benrecognized and treated,before a life is lost. 
 But my son's deathnwas not purely a suicide.,It involved mass murder.,I wanted to know how hisnsuicidal thinking became homicidal.,But research is sparsenand there are no simple answers.,Yes, he probably had ongoing depression.,He had a personalitynthat was perfectionistic and self-reliant,,and that made him less likelynto seek help from others.,He had experiencedntriggering events at the school,that left him feelingndebased and humiliated and mad.,And he had a complicated friendship,with a boy who shared his feelingsnof rage and alienation,,and who was seriously disturbed,,controlling and homicidal.,And on top of this period in his life,of extreme vulnerability and fragility,,Dylan found access to guns,even though we'd nevernowned any in our home.,It was appallingly easynfor a 17-year-old boy to buy guns,,both legally and illegally,nwithout my permission or knowledge.,And somehow, 17 yearsnand many school shootings later,,it's still appallingly easy. 
 What Dylan did that day broke my heart,,and as trauma so often does,,it took a toll on my body and on my mind.,Two years after the shootings,nI got breast cancer,,and two years after that,nI began to have mental health problems.,On top of the constant, perpetual grief,I was terrified that I would runninto a family member,of someone Dylan had killed,,or be accosted by the press,or by an angry citizen.,I was afraid to turn on the news,,afraid to hear myself being calledna terrible parent or a disgusting person. 
 I started having panic attacks.,The first bout startednfour years after the shootings,,when I was getting readynfor the depositions,and would have to meetnthe victims' families face to face.,The second round startednsix years after the shootings,,when I was preparingnto speak publicly about murder-suicide,for the first time at a conference.,Both episodes lasted several weeks.,The attacks happened everywhere:,in the hardware store, in my office,,or even while reading a book in bed.,My mind would suddenly lockninto this spinning cycle of terror,and no matter how I hard I tried,to calm myself downnor reason my way out of it,,I couldn't do it.,It felt as if my brainnwas trying to kill me,,and then, being afraid of being afraid,consumed all of my thoughts.,That's when I learned firsthand,what it feels likento have a malfunctioning mind,,and that's when I trulynbecame a brain health advocate.,With therapy and medication and self-care,,life eventually returned,to whatever could be thought ofnas normal under the circumstances. 
 When I looked backnon all that had happened,,I could see that my son'snspiral into dysfunction,probably occurrednover a period of about two years,,plenty of time to get him help,,if only someone had knownnthat he needed help,and known what to do. 
 Every time someone asks me,,"How could you not have known?",,it feels like a punch in the gut.,It carries accusationnand taps into my feelings of guilt,that no matter how much therapy I've had,I will never fully eradicate.,But here's something I've learned:,if love were enough,to stop someone who is suicidal,from hurting themselves,,suicides would hardly ever happen.,But love is not enough,,and suicide is prevalent.,It's the second leading cause of death,for people age 10 to 34,,and 15 percent of American youth,report having made a suicide plan,in the last year.,I've learned that no matternhow much we want to believe we can,,we cannot know or control,everything our loved ones think and feel,,and the stubborn beliefnthat we are somehow different,,that someone we lovenwould never think of hurting themselves,or someone else,,can cause us to miss,what's hidden in plain sight.,And if worst case scenariosndo come to pass,,we'll have to learnnto forgive ourselves for not knowing,or for not asking the right questions,or not finding the right treatment.,We should always assume,that someone we love may be suffering,,regardless of what they say,or how they act.,We should listen with our whole being,,without judgments,,and without offering solutions. 
 I know that I will live with this tragedy,,with these multiple tragedies,,for the rest of my life.,I know that in the minds of many,,what I lost can't comparento what the other families lost.,I know my strugglendoesn't make theirs any easier.,I know there are even some who thinknI don't have the right to any pain,,but only to a life of permanent penance. 
 In the end what I know comes down to this:,the tragic fact is that evennthe most vigilant and responsible of us,may not be able to help,,but for love's sake,,we must never stop trying,to know the unknowable. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It was just an ordinary Saturday.,My dad was outside mowing the lawn,,my mom was upstairs folding laundry,,my sister was in her room doing homework,and I was in the basementnplaying video games.,And as I came upstairsnto get something to drink,,I looked out the window,and realized that there was somethingnthat I was supposed to be doing,,and this is what I saw. 
 No, this wasn'tnmy family's dinner on fire.,This was my science project.,Flames were pouring out,,smoke was in the air,and it looked like our wooden decknwas about to catch fire.,I immediately started yelling.,My mom was freaking out,,my dad ran around to put out the fire,and of course my sisternstarted recording a Snapchat video. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was just the beginningnof my team's science project.,My team is composed of menand three other students,who are here in the audience today.,We competed in FIRST LEGO League,which is an internationalnLEGO robotics competition for kids,,and in addition to a robotics game,,we also workednon a separate science project,,and this was the projectnthat we were working on. 
 So the idea for this project all started,when a few months earlier,,a couple of my teammatesntook a trip to Central America,and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,,or expanded polystyrene foam.,And when they came backnand told us about it,,we really started thinking about the waysnin which we see Styrofoam every day.,Get a new flat-screen TV?,You end up with a block of Styrofoamnbigger than the TV itself.,Drink a cup of coffee?,Well, those Styrofoam coffee cupsnare sure going to add up.,And where do all these items gonafter their one-time use?,Since there aren't any goodnexisting solutions for used Styrofoam,,almost all of themnend up right in the landfill,,or the oceans and beaches,,taking over 500 years to degrade.,And in fact, every year, the US alone,produces over two billionnpounds of Styrofoam,,filling up a staggeringn25 percent of landfills. 
 So why do we have these ghostnaccumulations of Styrofoam waste?,Why can't we just recycle themnlike many plastics?,Well, simply put, recyclednpolystyrene is too expensive,and potentially contaminated,,so there is very little market demandnfor Styrofoam that has to be recycled.,And as a result, Styrofoamnis considered a nonrenewable material,,because it is neither feasiblennor viable to recycle polystyrene.,And in fact, many cities across the US,have even passed ordinances,that simply ban the productionnof many products containing polystyrene,,which includes disposable utensils,,packing peanuts, takeout containers,and even plastic beach toys,,all products that are very usefulnin today's society.,And now Francenhas become the first country,to completely ban all plastic utensils,,cups and plates. 
 But what if we could keep using Styrofoam,and keep benefitingnfrom its cheap, lightweight, insulating,and excellent packing ability,,while not having to suffernfrom the repercussions,of having to dispose of it?,What if we could turn it intonsomething else that's actually useful?,What if we could makenthe impossible possible? 
 My team hypothesized that we could usenthe carbon that's already in Styrofoam,to create activated carbon,,which is used in almostnevery water filter today.,And activated carbon worksnby using very small micropores,to filter out contaminantsnfrom water or even air. 
 So we started outnby doing a variety of heating tests,,and unfortunately, we had many failures.,Literally, nothing worked.,Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,,most of our samplesnvaporized into nothing,,or exploded inside expensive furnaces,,leaving a horribly sticky mess.,In fact, we were so saddenednby our failures that we almost gave up. 
 So why did we keep trying,when all the adultsnsaid it was impossible?,Well, maybe it's because we're kids.nWe don't know any better.,But the truth is, we kept tryingnbecause we thought it was still possible.,We knew that if we were successful,,we would be helping the environmentnand making the world a better place.,So we kept trying,and failing,and trying,and failing.,We were so ready to give up. 
 But then it happened.,With the right temperatures,ntimes and chemicals,,we finally got that successful test result,showing us that we had creatednactivated carbon from Styrofoam waste.,And at that moment,nthe thing that had been impossible,all of a sudden wasn't.,It showed us that although we hadnmany failures at the beginning,,we were able to persevere through themnto get the test results that we wanted.,And moreover, not only were we ablento create activated carbon,for purifying water,,but we were also ablento reduce Styrofoam waste,,solving two global problemsnwith just one solution. 
 So from then on, we were inspirednto take our project further,,performing more testsnto make it more effective,and testing it in real world situations.,We then proceeded to receive funding,from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSIONnSTEM-in-Action program,sponsored by the US Army,,as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards,sponsored by XPRIZE.,And we were also honored,with the Scientific AmericannInnovator Award,from Google Science Fair.,And using these funds, we plannto file a full patent on our process,and to continue to work on our project. 
 So yes, although we startednwith catching my dad's grill on fire,and failing so many timesnthat we almost quit,,it was well worth itnwhen we look back at it now.,We took a problemnthat many people said was impossible,and we made it possible,,and we persevered when it lookednlike nothing that we did would work.,We learned that you can't have success,without a little,,or a lot, of failure. 
 So in the future, don't be afraidnif your grill goes up in flames,,because you never knownwhen your idea might just catch fire. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This story starts with these two --,my kids.,We were hiking in the Oakland woods,when my daughter noticedna plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.,She looked at me and said,,"Daddy?,That doesn't go there." 
 When she said that,nit reminded me of summer camp.,On the morning of visiting day,,right before they'd let our anxiousnparents come barreling through the gates,,our camp director would say,,"Quick! Everyone pick upnfive pieces of litter.",You get a couple hundred kidsneach picking up five pieces,,and pretty soon, you've gotna much cleaner camp.,So I thought,,why not apply that crowdsourcedncleanup model to the entire planet?,And that was the inspirationnfor Litterati. 
 The vision is to createna litter-free world.,Let me show you how it started.,I took a picture of a cigarettenusing Instagram.,Then I took another photo ...,and another photo ...,and another photo.,And I noticed two things:,one, litter became artisticnand approachable;,and two,,at the end of a few days,nI had 50 photos on my phone,and I had picked up each piece,,and I realized that I was keeping a record,of the positive impactnI was having on the planet.,That's 50 less things that you might see,,or you might step on,,or some bird might eat. 
 So I started telling peoplenwhat I was doing,,and they started participating.,One day,,this photo showed up from China.,And that's when I realized,that Litterati was morenthan just pretty pictures;,we were becoming a communitynthat was collecting data.,Each photo tells a story.,It tells us who picked up what,,a geotag tells us where,and a time stamp tells us when.,So I built a Google map,,and started plotting the pointsnwhere pieces were being picked up.,And through that process,nthe community grew,and the data grew.,My two kids go to schoolnright in that bullseye. 
 Litter:,it's blending intonthe background of our lives.,But what if we brought itnto the forefront?,What if we understood exactlynwhat was on our streets,,our sidewalks,and our school yards?,How might we use that datanto make a difference? 
 Well, let me show you.,The first is with cities.,San Francisco wanted to understandnwhat percentage of litter was cigarettes.,Why?,To create a tax.,So they put a couple of peoplenin the streets,with pencils and clipboards,,who walked around collecting information,which led to a 20-cent taxnon all cigarette sales.,And then they got sued,by big tobacco,,who claimed that collecting informationnwith pencils and clipboards,is neither precise nor provable.,The city called me and askednif our technology could help.,I'm not sure they realized,that our technologynwas my Instagram account -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But I said, "Yes, we can." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And we can tell younif that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.,Plus, every photographnis geotagged and time-stamped,,providing you with proof.",Four days and 5,000 pieces later,,our data was used in courtnto not only defend but double the tax,,generating an annual recurring revenuenof four million dollars,for San Francisco to clean itself up. 
 Now, during that processnI learned two things:,one, Instagram is not the right tool -- 
 (Laughter) 
 so we built an app. 
 And two, if you think about it,,every city in the worldnhas a unique litter fingerprint,,and that fingerprint providesnboth the source of the problem,and the path to the solution.,If you could generate a revenue stream,just by understandingnthe percentage of cigarettes,,well, what about coffee cups,or soda cans,or plastic bottles?,If you could fingerprint San Francisco,nwell, how about Oakland,or Amsterdam,or somewhere much closer to home?,And what about brands?,How might they use this data,to align their environmentalnand economic interests? 
 There's a block in downtown Oaklandnthat's covered in blight.,The Litterati community got togethernand picked up 1,500 pieces.,And here's what we learned:,most of that litter camenfrom a very well-known taco brand.,Most of that brand's litternwere their own hot sauce packets,,and most of those hot sauce packetsnhadn't even been opened.,The problem and the pathnto the solution --,well, maybe that brand onlyngives out hot sauce upon request,or installs bulk dispensers,or comes up with morensustainable packaging.,How does a brand takenan environmental hazard,,turn it into an economic engine,and become an industry hero? 
 If you really want to create change,,there's no better place to startnthan with our kids.,A group of fifth graders picked upn1,247 pieces of litter,just on their school yard.,And they learned that the mostncommon type of litter,were the plastic straw wrappersnfrom their own cafeteria.,So these kids wentnto their principal and asked,,"Why are we still buying straws?",And they stopped.,And they learned that individuallynthey could each make a difference,,but together they created an impact. 
 It doesn't matternif you're a student or a scientist,,whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,,this is a community for everyone.,It started because of two little kidsnin the Northern California woods,,and today it's spread across the world.,And you know how we're getting there?,One piece at a time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)She wrote:,"When I become famous,nI will tell everyone,that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson." 
 Heroes rarely look like me.,In fact,,I'm what garbage looks like.,No, not the most appealingnway to open a talk,or start a conversation,,and perhaps you have some questionsngoing through your head about that.,Why would this man saynsuch a thing about himself?,What does he mean?,How can someone view him as a heronwhen he sees himself as garbage? 
 I believe we learn more from questionsnthan we do from answers.,Because when we're questioning something,,we're invested in taking innsome sort of new information,,or grappling with some sort of ignorancenthat makes us feel uncomfortable.,And that's why I'm here:,to push us to question,,even when it makes us uncomfortable. 
 My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago,,the southernmost island in the Caribbean.,Trinidad is also homento the only acoustic instrument,invented in the 20th century:,the steel pan.,Deriving from the African drums,and evolving from the geniusnof one of the ghettos in Trinidad,,a city called Laventille,,and the disregardnof the American military ...,Well, I should tell you,,America, during WWII, hadnmilitary bases set up in Trinidad,,and when the war ended,,they left the island litterednwith empty oil drums --,their trash.,So people from Laventillenrepurposed the old drums left behind,into the full chromatic scale:,the steel pan.,Playing music now from Beethovennto Bob Marley to 50 Cent,,those people literally madenmusic out of garbage. 
 Twelve days before my 20th birthday,,I was arrested for my rolenin a violent robbery attempt,in lower Manhattan.,While people were sittingnin a coffee shop,,four people were shot.,Two were killed.,Five of us were arrested.,We were all the productsnof Trinidad and Tobago.,We were the "bad immigrants,",or the "anchor babies" that Trumpnand millions of Americans easily malign.,I was discarded, like waste material --,and justifiably so to many.,I eventually served 10 years, two monthsnand seven days of a prison sentence.,I was sentenced to a decade of punishmentnin a correctional institution.,I was sentenced to irrelevance --,the opposite of humanity. 
 Interestingly,,it was during those years in prisonnthat a series of letters redeemed me,,helped me move beyondnthe darkness and the guilt,associated with the worstnmoment of my young life.,It gave me a sense that I was useful.,She was 13 years old.,She had wrote that she saw me as a hero.,I remember reading that,,and I remember cryingnwhen I read those words. 
 She was one of over 50 students,and 150 letters that I wrote duringna mentoring correspondence program,that I co-designed with a friend,who was a teachernat a middle school in Brooklyn,,my hometown.,We called it the Young Scholars Program.,Every time those young peoplenshared their stories with me,,their struggles,,every time they drew a picturenof their favorite cartoon character,and sent it to me,,every time they said they dependednon my letters or my words of advice,,it boosted my sense of worthiness.,It gave me a sense of whatnI could contribute to this planet.,It transformed my life. 
 Because of those lettersnand what they shared with me,,their stories of teen life,,they gave me the permission,,they gave me the couragento admit to myself,that there were reasons -- not excuses --,but that there were reasonsnfor that fateful day in October of 1999;,that the trauma associatednwith living in a community,where guns are easiernto get than sneakers;,that the trauma associated with beingnraped at gunpoint at the age of 14;,that those are reasons for me,why making that decision,,that fatal decision,,was not an unlikely proposition. 
 Because those lettersnmattered so much to me,,because writing and receiving,and having that communicationnwith those folks,so hugely impacted my life,,I decided to share the opportunitynwith some friends of mine,who were also inside with me.,My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,,all in prison for violent crimes also,,shared their words of wisdomnwith the young people as well,,and received the sensenof relevancy in return.,We are now published writersnand youth program innovators,and trauma experts,and gun violence prevention advocates,,and TED talkers and -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and good daddies.,That's what I call a positivenreturn of investment. 
 Above all else,,what building that programntaught me was that when we sow,,when we invest in the humanitynof people no matter where they're at,,we can reap amazing rewards. 
 In this latest eranof criminal justice reform,,I often question and wonder why --,why is it that so many believe,that only those who have been convictednof nonviolent drug offenses,merit empathy and recognized humanity?,Criminal justice reform is human justice.,Am I not human?,When we invest in resourcesnthat amplify the relevancy of people,in communities like Laventille,or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,,we can literally createnthe communities that we want. 
 We can do better.,We can do better than investing solelynin law enforcement as a resource,,because they don't give usna sense of relevancy,that is at the core of why so many of usndo so many harmful things,in the pursuit of mattering.,See, gun violence is just a visiblendisplay of a lot of underlying traumas.,When we invest in the redemptivenvalue of relevancy,,we can render a return of bothnpersonal responsibility and healing.,That's the people work I care about,,because people work. 
 Family, I'm asking younto do the hard work,,the difficult work,,the churning work of bestowingnundeserved kindness,upon those who we can relegate as garbage,,who we can disregard and discard easily.,I'm asking myself. 
 Over the past two months,,I've lost two friends to gun violence,,both innocent bystanders.,One was caught in a drive-bynwhile walking home.,The other was sitting in a cafénwhile eating breakfast,,while on vacation in Miami.,I'm asking myself to seenthe redemptive value of relevancy,in the people that murdered them,,because of the hard worknof seeing the value in me.,I'm pushing us to challengenour own capacity,to fully experience our humanity,,by understanding the full biography,of people who we canneasily choose not to see,,because heroes are waitingnto be recognized,,and music is waiting to be made. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to introduce you to my mom. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm guessing that's not what you expected,,and it's not what I expected either,,and thank goodness I realizednthat an Asian man was not my mom,before I hugged him,,because that would have been so awkward. 
 Recognizing peoplenisn't one of my strengths,due to a genetic visual impairmentnthat has no correction or cure.,As a result, I am legally blind,,though I prefer "partially sighted"nbecause it's more optimistic. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm entitled to the label "disabled." 
 I hate the word disablednwhen it's used to describe people.,It detonates a mindset of less than,that utterly disregards capacity,,ability, potential,,instead prioritizing brokenness,and lack. 
 The perspective can be overt.,What can't he do for himselfnthat I'm going to have to do for him?,She'll probably need some accommodation,that no other employeenat this business needs.,Sometimes, the hidden bias,is so sweetly conveyed.,"Wow, Susan,,look at everything you've donenin your career and your life.,How did you do all of thatnand be visually impaired?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I fail at being disabled. 
 (Laughter) 
 So in the spirit of incentivizingnthe rampant failure,of people all over the world,and enticing the so-called normalnto just give it a rest already,,here are five tips,to fail at being disabled. 
 Tip one:,know your superpowers.,The best team I ever led in my career,was based on superpowers,,and we even gave ourselvesnfancy-pantsy titles,like "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen.","The Biscuit Butterer." 
 (Laughter) 
 "The Voice of Reason." 
 Because we relied on our strengths,,our best strengths,,we achieved tremendous outcomes.,The trait that prevents menfrom recognizing my mom,allows me to smoothly adapt,,to quickly absorb and accurately processnan exhausting volume of cues,,tease out what's important,,determine multiple processes or potentialsnfor any situation that I'm in,,and then select the onenthat makes the most sense,,all in a matter of seconds.,I see what other people do not.,Some people think that's a superpower,,but my real superpowers,are ricocheting off of glass walls -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and letting my friendsnwalk around with kale in their teeth. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's true. Don't have lunch with me,,or dinner. 
 Tip two: be supremely skilled,,supremely skilled at getting it wrong.,It is important to benas equally confident in your superpowers,as you are in you FUBARs.,That's "effed up beyond all recognition",for you millennials. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's a good example.,It is not a great idea to say,,"Don't worry, everything in herenis too small for me to see",when you accidentallynwalk into the men's room -- 
 (Laughter) 
 at one of the world'snlargest sporting arenas -- 
 (Laughter) 
 or anywhere.,I really wish that one wasn't true.,I'm serious. It is better to just walk outnand let them think you're drunk. 
 (Laughter) 
 Tip three: know that everyonenis disabled in some way,,like when you have a coldnand you can't smell,and you realize that the milknthat you splashed in your coffee was sour,only after you've tasted it.,Very recently, a womannwalked up to me frantic.,She could not findnthe bakery she was looking for.,As I motioned in the directionnI thought she should go,,saying, "There are no storesnon this side of the street,so your best bet is to cross --" 
 "Oh my goodness," she interrupted.,"There it is.,All I needed was another set of eyes." 
 (Laughter) 
 I just let her have it.,I would have said that, you know,,being logical and paying attention,and staying calmnwould have done the trick,,but who am I? 
 Tip four: point outnthe disability in others.,This one is best reserved --nvery important note --,this one is best reservednfor people you know well,,because random strangersntypically don't appreciate,teachable moments.,A few years ago, my parents and Inwent to see the Rockettes,,Radio City's high-kicking dancers.,I leaned over to my dad. 
 "The two Rockettes on the leftnaren't kicking in a straight line." 
 "Yes, they are." 
 "No, they're not." 
 "Yes, they are, and how do you know?,You can't see." 
 But I know whatna straight line looks like.,I had snapped a picturenduring our back and forth,and presented him the evidencenthat proved I was right.,He looked at the picture.,I leaned in further. 
 "Who's disabled now?" 
 Tip five: pursue audacious goals.,Flip expectation upside down,and shove limitation off a cliffnto meet its demise.,There is a college football linebacker,who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles,while having one hand.,There is a teachernwho successfully transfers knowledge,and inspires countless students,while living with Down syndrome.,And for me,,on my long list,,to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal,nto Darjeeling, India,on the backseatnof a bicycle built for two.,It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure,,and I'm sure I will haventhe blurry photos to show for it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, before we go on,nI forgot to introduce you to my mom.,I need to do that.,And here she is,,as she would appear to me,if I were looking through a crowdnof people looking for her.,Or is that an Asian man? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the next six minutesnthat you will listen to me,,the world will have lost three mothers,while delivering their babies:,one, because of a severe complication;,second, because she will be a teenager,and her body will notnbe prepared for birth;,but the third, only because of lacknof access to basic clean tools,at the time of childbirth.,She will not be alone.,Over one million mothers and babiesndie every single year,in the developing world,,only because of lack of accessnto basic cleanliness,while giving birth to their babies. 
 My journey began on a hot summer afternoon,in India in 2008,,when after a day of meeting womennand listening to their needs,,I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.,As a mother, I was very curiousnon how she delivered babies in her house.,After a deep and engagingnconversation with her,on how she considered it a profoundncalling to do what she was doing,,I asked her a parting question:,Do you have the tools that you neednto deliver the babies?,I got to see her tool.,"This is what I use to separatenthe mother and the baby," she said.,Unsure of how to react, I held thisnagricultural tool in my hand in shock.,I took a picture of this,nhugged her and walked away.,My mind was flooded with reflectionsnof my own infection,that I had to struggle withnfor a year past childbirth,despite having accessnto the best medical care,,and memories of my conversationnwith my father,,who had lost his mom to childbirth,,on how he thought his lifenwould be so different,if she would have beennjust next to him growing up. 
 As a product developer,nI started my process of research.,I was very excited to findnthat there was a product out there,called the Clean Birth Kit.,But I just couldn't buy one for months.,They were only assemblednbased on availability of funding.,Finally, when I got my hands on one,nI was in shock again.,I would never use these toolsnto deliver my baby, I thought.,But to confirm my instincts,nI went back to the women,,some of whom had the experiencenof using this product. 
 Lo and behold, they hadnthe same reaction and more.,The women said they would ratherndeliver on a floor,than on a plastic sheetnthat smeared blood all over.,They were absolutely right --nit would cause more infection.,The thread provided was a highwaynto bacterial infection,through the baby's umbilical cord,,and the blade used was the kindnthat men used for shaving,,and they did not want itnanywhere close to them.,There was no incentive for anybodynto redesign this product,,because it was based on charity.,The women were nevernconsulted in this process.,And to my surprise, the neednwas not only in homes,but also in institutional settingsnwith high-volume births.,Situations in remote areasnwere even more daunting. 
 This had to change.,I made this my area of focus.,I started the design processnby collecting feedback,,developing prototypes,and engaging with various stakeholdersnresearching global protocols.,With every single prototype,nwe went back to the women,to ensure that we had a product for them.,What I learned through this processnwas that these women,,despite their extreme poverty,,placed great valuenon their health and well-being.,They were absolutely not poor in mind.,As with all of us, they would appreciatena well-designed product,developed for their needs. 
 After many iterationsnworking with experts,,medical health professionals,and the women themselves,,I should say it was notnan easy process at all,,but we had a simple and beautiful design.,For a dollar more than whatnthe existing product was offered for,,at three dollars, we were ablento deliver "janma,",a clean birth kit in a purse.,Janma, meaning "birth," containedna blood-absorbing sheet,for the woman to give birth on,,a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp,na bar of soap, a pair of gloves,and the first clothnto wipe the baby clean.,All this came packagednin a beautiful purse,that was given to the mothernas a gift after all her hard work,,that she carried home with pridenas a symbol of prosperity. 
 One woman reacted to this gift.,She said, "Is this really mine?nCan I keep it?",The other one said,n"Will you give me a different color,when I have my next baby?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Better yet, a woman expressednthat this was the first purse,that she had ever owned in her life.,The kit, aside from its symbolismnand its simplicity,,is designed to follownglobally recommended medical protocol,and serves as a behavior-change toolnto follow steps one after the other.,It can not only be used in homes,nbut also in institutional settings. 
 To date, our kit has impactednover 600,000 mothers and babies,around the world.,It's a humbling experiencento watch these numbers grow,,and I cannot wait untilnwe reach a hundred million. 
 But women's health issues do not end here.,There are thousands of simple issuesnthat require low-cost interventions.,We have facts to proventhat if we invest in women and girls,and provide them with betternhealth and well-being,,they will deliver healthier and wealthiernand prosperous communities.,We have to start by bringing simplicitynand dignity to women's health issues:,from reducing maternal mortality,nto breaking taboos,,to empowering womennto take control of their own lives.,This is my dream.,But it is not possible to achieve itnwithout engaging men and women alike,from around the world --,yes, all of you. 
 I recently heard this lyricnby Leonard Cohen:,"Ring the bells that still can ring.,Forget your perfect offering.,There is a crack in everything.,That's how the light gets in." 
 This is my bit of light.,But we need more light.,In fact, we need huge spotlightsnplaced in the world of women's health,if we need a better tomorrow.,We should never forget that womennare at the center of a sustainable world,,and we do not exist without them. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)
